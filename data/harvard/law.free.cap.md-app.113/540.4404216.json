We also must determine if the insurer is obligated to indemnify its insured, and whether a subcontractor of the insured breached its contract to provide insurance for the. insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">In February 1991, Michael and Kathleen Corradetti filed suit against Jones Intercable, Inc. (\u201cJones\u201d) for personal injuries suffered after the couple\u2019s car fell into a utility pit (\u201cthe <em>Corradetti </em>suit\u201d). They later amended their suit to include claims for negligence against Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (\u201cBGE\u201d), appellant, Ferguson Trenching Company (\u201cFerguson\u201d), appellee, and others. Pursuant to a contract with BGE, Ferguson dug the pit into which Mr. Corradetti later drove his car. Ferguson was contractually obligated to obtain a general commercial liability insurance policy to protect both Ferguson and BGE, in connection with Ferguson\u2019s work for BGE. That policy, which is central to this dispute, was obtained from Commercial Union Insurance Company (\u201cCommercial\u201d), appellee, through Commercial\u2019s issuing company, American Employers Insurance Company (\u201cAmerican\u201d), appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Relying on the terms of the policy, Commercial declined to defend or indemnify BGE in the <em>Corradetti </em>suit. Thereafter, BGE instituted a declaratory action in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, seeking a determination of its rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>under the policy. After judgment was entered against BGE in the <em>Corradetti </em>suit, the circuit court granted appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment in the declaratory action. It determined that Commercial did not have a duty to defend or indemnify BGE and that Ferguson did not breach its contractual obligation to provide BGE with insurance coverage. This appeal followed, in which BGE presents the following questions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">I. Did the circuit court err in granting Appellees\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment on all issues relating to the indemnification and defense of BGE in the underlying <em>Corradetti </em>case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">II. Did the circuit court err in failing to grant Appellant\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on all issues related to the indemnification and defense of BGE in the underlying <em>Corradetti </em>case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">In connection with BGE\u2019s installation of underground utilities in Anne Arundel County, BGE and Ferguson entered into a \u201cblanket contract,\u201d which extended from June 1, 1989 to May 31, 1991. The agreement specifically required the insurance to cover \u201cexcavation\u201d and \u201csubsurface work,\u201d and provided that Ferguson assumed all risks of liability for injuries \u201carising out of or incident to the performance of the work.\u201d Further, the contract obligated Ferguson to maintain commercial general liability insurance for the benefit of BGE, listing BGE as an additional insured. Pursuant to the contract, in May 1990 Ferguson excavated the site in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">In accordance with the contract, Ferguson obtained insurance coverage from Commercial, through its issuing agent, American.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ferguson was the named insured on the policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>and an endorsement to the policy named BGE as an additional insured. Under the policy, however, BGE\u2019s coverage was limited by several exclusions, which restricted coverage to claims based on negligence by Ferguson and claims that BGE negligently failed to supervise Ferguson.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Between May 21 and May 23, 1990, Ferguson dug a \u201csplicing pit\u201d adjacent to Seamore Street, in Anne Arundel County, based on a request from BGE under the parties\u2019 blanket contract. The pit was designed to give BGE access to a power line buried in the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Some months later, in October 1990, the Corradettis visited the home of a friend residing on Seamore Street. As they were leaving, Mr. Corradetti backed his car down the driveway of the home and onto Seamore Street. Unfortunately, he stopped his car partially in the splicing pit. As he got out of his car, he fell into the pit, sustaining serious personal injuries. Although the Corradettis brought suit initially against Jones only, they amended their suit to add claims against BGE, Ferguson, C &amp; P Telephone Company, and Spector Communications, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">BGE advised Commercial of the suit and requested a defense. In September 1992, Commercial refused to defend BGE, asserting that the Corradettis\u2019 claim was not covered by Commercial\u2019s policy, as it fell within one of the exclusions to BGE\u2019s coverage. Consequently, BGE instituted a declaratory action against Commercial, alleging that the insurer was obligated to defend and indemnify BGE in the <em>Corradetti </em>case, and that Ferguson breached its contractual obligation to acquire certain insurance for BGE. On March 22,1993, the court denied BGE\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding: \u201cI don\u2019t think I can resolve this issue without [the <em>Corradetti </em>case] being resolved first.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">In the meantime, the parties in the <em>Corradetti </em>case proceeded with discovery and, on April 12, 1993, the trial court held a hearing on the Corradettis\u2019 Motion For Dismissal By Order of Court, which all defendants, except BGE, joined. The motion sought dismissal of 1) all claims by the plaintiffs against all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>defendants, except BGE; 2) all cross-claims by Jones against the other defendants; and 3) BGE\u2019s cross-claim against Ferguson.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The Corradettis advised the court that they had concluded, based on discovery, that BGE alone was negligent, as it was responsible for the failure to backfill the pit. The plaintiffs further argued that the continued presence of the other defendants would confuse the jury, since \u201cthe only person we\u2019re going after is BG &amp; E.\u201d Although BGE objected, the court granted the motion and dismissed all claims, with prejudice, except the Corradettis\u2019 claim against BGE. Thereafter, the Corradettis proceeded to trial and the jury returned a verdict finding BGE liable for negligence. It awarded the Corradettis $500,800.00 in damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The jury in the <em>Corradetti </em>case found BGE liable for the Corradettis\u2019 injuries, based on BGE\u2019s own negligence, apparently because of BGE\u2019s failure to backfill the splicing pit. The <em>Corradetti </em>jury returned the following answer to the single question presented to it on the issue of BGE\u2019s conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsS\">1. Was the Defendant, the Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Company, negligent, and did that negligence proximately cause injuries to the Plaintiff, Michael W. Corradetti and his wife, Kathleen Corradetti?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Check: Yes (X) No ()</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">On September 15, 1993, the court held a hearing in the declaratory action with regard to Ferguson\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Ferguson argued that the court\u2019s dismissal of BGE\u2019s cross-claim against it acted as res judicata or collateral estoppel of the entire declaratory action. The court concurred and dismissed the declaratory action.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">BGE appealed both cases. In the <em>Corradetti </em>case, BGE asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was not solely responsible for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>condition of the trench, and argued that it should have had an opportunity to establish that others were hable for the accident. We upheld the jury verdict in an unreported opinion, but reversed the dismissal, <em>with prejudice, </em>of BGE\u2019s cross-claim against Ferguson; we directed the trial court to enter an order of dismissal <em>without </em>prejudice. <em>Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. v. Corradetti, </em>No. 1493, September Term 1993, 100 Md.App. 788 (filed May 2, 1994). While we determined that BGE was entitled to an opportunity to present evidence on its cross-claim, we rejected BGE\u2019s claim that it was entitled to a reversal because it had been prevented from presenting evidence that Ferguson and others were responsible for the Corradettis\u2019 injuries. We noted that \u201cthe questions of liability and damages as between BG &amp; E and the Coradettis were unaffected by the presence or absence of Ferguson in the suit....\u201d Slip. op. at 9. We reasoned that BGE never proffered any evidence to support its proposed defense, and that BGE\u2019s claim as to Ferguson and others was not relevant to the issues in the <em>Corradetti </em>suit, because BGE was not attempting to <em>shift </em>liability onto Ferguson. Rather, BGE was attempting to <em>share </em>liability with Ferguson, and thus BGE was not shielded from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">In an unreported opinion in the declaratory action, we concluded that our reversal of the dismissal of BGE\u2019s claim against Ferguson \u201ceviscerated\u201d the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the declaratory action based on res judicata or collateral estoppel principles. <em>Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>No. 23, September Term, 1994, 101 Md.App. 714 (filed Sept. 19, 1994). Therefore, we- remanded the declaratory action for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">On remand in the declaratory action, BGE filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether Commercial had a duty to defend BGE in the <em>Corradetti </em>suit. The court denied this motion, and issued a written opinion and order dated September 19, 1995, concluding that Commercial \u201chad no duty to defend BG &amp; E in the <em>Corradetti </em>litigation.\u201d The court stated that it had previously found that Ferguson had completed the excavation work on May 25,1990, and \u201cwas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>off the job from that point forward.\u201d The court thus concluded: \u201cThe Plaintiff in <em>Corradetti </em>was not injured as a result of Ferguson\u2019s omission to fill in the ditch excavated, but rather BG <em>&amp; </em>E\u2019s omission.\u201d Therefore, the court determined that the Corradettis\u2019 claims were not covered by BGE\u2019s policy with Commercial.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Thereafter, Ferguson and Commercial moved for summary judgment as to BGE\u2019s claims in the declaratory action. They argued that, because the jury had found BGE liable for the Corradettis\u2019 injuries, the Corradettis\u2019 claim was excluded from coverage under BGE\u2019s policy. Ferguson also contended that it had not breached its contract to provide insurance for BGE, because the Corradettis\u2019 claim arose from BGE\u2019s own negligence in not backfilling the pit, and Ferguson\u2019s contract did not require it to obtain insurance to cover BGE\u2019s own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">BGE filed another motion for partial summary judgment. It asserted: 1) Commercial had a duty to defend BGE in the <em>Corradetti </em>case; 2) Commercial breached its contract by refusing to indemnify BGE for the <em>Corradetti </em>judgment; and 3) Ferguson breached its contractual obligation to provide BGE with the requisite insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">After the court entertained oral argument on the motions on February 20, 1996, it entered judgment in favor of all defendants. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">[Ejvery time I look at this case I come up with the same picture and it \u2014 and I have given it an independent look because I think it\u2019s clear BG <em>&amp; </em>E is \u2014 is in search of some theory by which it can extricate itself from this hole they\u2019ve got themselves into, financially. But I think that really it\u2019s quite clear that this contract was complete except for the work that had to be done by BG &amp; E filling it in. And I think that was clear from the testimony earlier that preceded the trial with the Corradetti matter and which ended up by [the Corradettis] letting all those other people out of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>I don\u2019t think with that in mind and regardless of whether BGE was found negligent at trial, which of course would exclude it from coverage under the Commercial Union policy, but even excluding that theory, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any duty to defend where you \u2014 your only claim of having the contract continuing is your own negligence in not terminating it by filling- in the hole. They had signed off on Ferguson\u2019s work order, they were no longer required to do anything under the contract and the mere fact that BGE didn\u2019t do anything to complete the filling of the hole doesn\u2019t mean the contract stays open forever so that there would be duty to defend under the policy and I think clearly there\u2019s not only a no [sic] duty to indemnify, but there\u2019s no duty to defend and I think summary judgment should be granted in favor of Ferguson and Commercial Union and American Employers on all counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Md. Rule 2-501 establishes a two part test for summary judgment. \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment ... the trial court must decide whether there is any genuine dispute as to material facts and, if not, whether either party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Bagwell v. Peninsula Regional Med. Ctr., </em>106 Md.App. 470, 488, 665 A.2d 297 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>341 Md. 172, 669 A.2d 1360 (1996). <em>See also Beatty v. Trailmaster Products, Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 737-38, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993); <em>Bits \u201cN\u201d Bytes Computer Supplies, Inc. v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co., </em>97 Md.App. 557, 576-77, 631 A.2d 485 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>333 Md. 385, 635 A.2d 425 (1994); <em>Seaboard Surety Co. v. Richard F. Kline, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 236, 242-45, 603 A.2d 1357 (1992). In deciding the motion, however, the court does not resolve disputes of fact. Rather, the court must determine if the parties genuinely dispute any material fact. <em>Honaker v. W.C. &amp; A.N. Miller Dev. Co., </em>285 Md. 216, 401 A.2d 1013 (1979); <em>Impala Plati</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>num, Ltd. v. Impala Sales (U.S.A), Inc., </em>283 Md. 296, 326, 389 A.2d 887 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">To defeat the motion for summary judgment, the party opposing the motion must produce evidence demonstrating that the parties genuinely dispute a material fact. <em>Scroggins v. Dahne, </em>335 Md. 688, 645 A2d 1160 (1994). Even if the non-moving party demonstrates the existence of a disputed fact, it will not defeat the motion for summary judgment unless the dispute concerns a <em>material </em>fact, <em>i.e., </em>a fact that will alter the outcome of the case depending upon how the factfinder resolves the dispute over it. <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985); <em>Keesling v. State, </em>288 Md. 579, 583, 420 A.2d 261 (1980); <em>Miller v. Fairchild Indus., </em>97 Md.App. 324, 340, 629 A.2d 1293 (1993). The non-moving party must present more than \u201cmere general allegations which do not show facts in detail and with precision\u201d to demonstrate the factual dispute and defeat the motion. <em>Beatty, </em>330 Md. at 738, 625 A.2d 1005. Moreover, the court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Berkey v. Delia, </em>287 Md. 302, 413 A.2d 170 (1980); <em>Maloney v. Carling Nat\u2019l Breweries, Inc., </em>52 Md.App. 556, 451 A.2d 343 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s decision to determine whether the court reached the correct legal result. <em>Beatty, </em>330 Md. at 737, 625 A.2d 1005. Appellate courts generally review a grant of summary judgment based only on the grounds relied upon by the trial court. <em>Blades v. Woods, </em>338 Md. 475, 659 A.2d 872 (1995); <em>Gross v. Sussex, Inc., </em>332 Md. 247, 254 n. 3, 630 A.2d 1156 (1993); <em>Hoffman v. United Iron and Metal Co., </em>108 Md.App. 117, 671 A.2d 55 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">As this case requires us to interpret both the insurance contract issued to Ferguson and the contract between BGE and Ferguson, we pause to review the principles that guide us in the interpretation of contracts. In Maryland, the law is well settled that an insurance policy is interpreted like any other contract. <em>Collier v. MD-Individual Practice Ass\u2019n, </em>327 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Md. 1, 607 A.2d 537 (1992); <em>National Grange Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pinkney, </em>284 Md. 694, 399 A.2d 877 (1979); <em>Aetna Insurance Company v. Aaron, </em>112 Md.App. 472, 481-83, 685 A.2d 858 (1996); <em>Bentz v. Mutual Fire, Marine &amp; Inland Ins. Co., </em>83 Md.App. 524, 575 A.2d 795 (1990). Therefore, Maryland courts do not follow the rule that an insurance policy must be strictly construed against the insurer. <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>330 Md. 758, 779, 625 A.2d 1021 (1993); <em>Cheney v. Bell Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>315 Md. 761, 766, 556 A.2d 1135 (1989). <em>See also Hartford Acc. and Indem. Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Assoc. Ltd. Partnership, </em>109 Md.App. 217, 290, 674 A.2d 106, <em>cert. granted, </em>343 Md. 334, 681 A.2d 70 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">\u201cConstruction of a contract is, in the first instance, a question of law for the court to resolve.\u201d <em>Shapiro v. Massengill, </em>105 Md.App. 743, 754, 661 A.2d 202, <em>cert. denied, </em>341 Md. 28, 668 A.2d 36 (1995). The principal rule in the interpretation of all contracts is to effect the intentions of the parties. <em>Kasten Constr. Co., Inc. v. Rod Enterprises, Inc., </em>268 Md. 318, 301 A.2d 12 (1973); <em>McIntyre v. Guild Inc., </em>105 Md.App. 332, 355, 659 A.2d 398 (1995); <em>Taylor v. Feissner, </em>103 Md.App. 356, 653 A.2d 947, <em>cert. denied, </em>339 Md. 355, 663 A.2d 73 (1995). When the language of the contract is clear, the court will presume that the parties intended what they expressed, even if the expression differs from the parties\u2019 intentions at the time they created the contract. <em>Roged, Inc. v. Paglee, </em>280 Md. 248, 372 A.2d 1059 (1977); <em>McIntyre, </em>105 Md.App. at 355, 659 A.2d 398; <em>Shapiro, </em>105 Md.App. at 754, 661 A.2d 202; <em>Bernstein v. Kapneck, </em>46 Md.App. 231, 417 A.2d 456 (1980), <em>aff'd, </em>290 Md. 452, 430 A.2d 602 (1981). A contract must be construed as a whole, and effect given to every clause arid phrase, so as not to omit an important part of the agreement. <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb, </em>330 Md. at 758, 625 A.2d 1021; <em>Sagner v. Glenangus Farms, Inc., </em>234 Md. 156, 198 A.2d 277 (1964); <em>see also Marsh v. Loffler Housing Corp., </em>102 Md.App. 116, 648 A.2d 1081 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>With these principles in mind, we turn to an examination of appellant\u2019s contentions. Appellant argues that Ferguson breached its contract with BGE by failing to provide the required insurance coverage. It also claims that Commercial was contractually bound to defend BGE in the <em>Corradetti </em>case, and that Commercial was obligated to indemnify BGE for the judgment in the <em>Corradetti </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">I. Ferguson\u2019s Contractual Duty to Procure Insurance for BGE</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Appellant argues that the blanket contract between the parties required Ferguson to \u201cprocure insurance that would have provided coverage for any relevant claim (bodily injury or property damage) that arose out of work done by Ferguson.\u201d It maintains that the Corradettis\u2019 claims arose out of the work performed by Ferguson, because Ferguson excavated the trench into which Mr. Corradetti fell. Therefore, it asserts that if Commercial\u2019s policy does not cover the claims in the <em>Corradetti </em>suit, then Ferguson failed to meet its obligation under the contract to provide BGE with the appropriate insurance coverage. Without comment on this issue, the circuit court entered judgment in favor of Ferguson.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The contract between BGE and Ferguson required Ferguson to provide BGE with coverage only for certain potential claims that might be brought against BGE. Whether Ferguson properly performed under the contract depends upon a comparison of the coverage that the contract bound Ferguson to obtain, and the coverage Ferguson provided through the Commercial policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">According to its contract with BGE, Ferguson was to obtain commercial general liability insurance, and the insurance was to be endorsed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">Such insurance as afforded by this policy for the benefit of BGE shall be primary as respects any claims, losses, damages, expenses, or liabilities <em>arising out of work or services for BGE, </em>and insured hereunder, and any insurance carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>by BGE shall be excess of and noncontributing with insurance afforded by this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Thus, Ferguson was to provide BGE with coverage for potential claims by third parties that were <em>based on work by Ferguson for BGE. </em>It is plain that, through the contract, BGE sought to insulate itself from claims grounded on the actions of its subcontractor, over which it would have only supervisory control, but for which BGE could potentially be found derivatively liable. BGE apparently recognized that by contracting with Ferguson to perform work on BGE\u2019s behalf, it was assuming the risk of liability if Ferguson\u2019s work should result in legal action against it. Thus, BGE sought to shift that risk back to Ferguson, by requiring Ferguson to provide appropriate insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The contract, however, does not require Ferguson to provide BGE with insurance coverage for claims brought against BGE based on BGE\u2019s <em>own </em>negligence. The contract expressly required Ferguson to carry the coverage for itself, with an endorsement to also cover BGE. While it provides that the coverage is to protect BGE for \u201cclaims, losses, damages, expenses, or liabilities arising out of work or services <em>for BGE,\u201d </em>it does not apply to liabilities arising from work performed <em>by BGE.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Under its insurance policy, Commercial agreed to insure Ferguson as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance applies. No other obligation or liability to pay sums or perform acts or services is covered unless explicitly provided for under SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENTS-COVERAGES A AND B.<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> This insurance applies only to \u201cbodily injury\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\u201cproperty damage\u201d which occurs during the policy period. The \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d must be caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d. The \u201coccurrence\u201d must take place in the \u201ccoverage territory\u201d. We will have the right and duty to defend any \u201csuit\u201d seeking those damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The insurance policy specified that, as an additional insured, BGE was protected only with respect to liability arising out of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">A. \u201cYour work\u201d [Ferguson\u2019s] for the additional insured(s) at the location designated above, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">B. Acts or omissions of the additional insured(s) in connection with their general supervision of \u201cyour work\u201d at the location shown in the Schedule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The policy defined \u201cYour work\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">a. Work or operations performed by you or on your behalf; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">b. Materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work or operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">\u201cYour work\u201d includes warranties or representations made at any time with respect to the fitness, quality, durability or performance of any of the items included in a. or b. above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">As Ferguson was the named insured on the policy, \u201cyour work\u201d referred to work performed by Ferguson. Thus, as required by the contract, the policy provided BGE with coverage for claims brought against BGE based on Ferguson\u2019s work for BGE. The policy also provided BGE with coverage for claims based on BGE\u2019s acts or omissions in supervising Ferguson.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">The endorsement also contained the following exclusions hmiting coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-14\">B. Additional Exclusions. This insurance does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>(2) \u201cBodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d occurring after:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">(a) All work on the project (other than service, maintenance, or repairs) to be performed by or on behalf of the additional insured(s) at the site of the covered operations has been completed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">(b) That portion of \u201cyour work\u201d out of which the injury or damage arises has been put to its intended use by any person or organization other than another contractor or subcontractor engaged in performing operations for a principal as a part of the same project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">(3) \u201cBodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d arising out of any act or omission of the additional insured(s) or any of their employees, other than the general supervision of work performed for the additional insured(s) by you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">These exclusions essentially correspond to the section providing coverage; the policy does not cover claims based on actions by BGE, except for its supervision of Ferguson\u2019s work. The exclusions also bar coverage for claims occurring after Ferguson completed its work at a site and after Ferguson\u2019s work was \u201cput to its intended use____\u201d Arguably, Exclusion (B)(2)(a) breached Ferguson\u2019s obligation to provide BGE with adequate insurance, because it may limit BGE\u2019s coverage for work done by Ferguson to the period of time that Ferguson actually worked on the site. Yet a claim for negligence could have been brought against BGE for an accident occurring after Ferguson completed its work, but which nonetheless \u201carose\u201d out of Ferguson\u2019s work. If that had been the allegation in the <em>Corradetti </em>suit, then BGE might have had a viable claim that Ferguson had breached its contract, and was responsible for BGE\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">In this case, however, as we discuss, <em>infra, </em>after the Corradettis dismissed their claims against all parties except BGE, their only remaining claim was based on BGE\u2019s own negligence, for which Ferguson was not required to insure BGE. Thus, BGE\u2019s claim that Ferguson failed to meet its contractual obligation is not material. Ferguson never had the obligation to protect BGE in an action grounded on BGE\u2019s own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>negligence. Therefore, Ferguson could not have violated that obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">As the circuit court did not specify the grounds upon which it granted summary judgment in favor of Ferguson, we must assume that it \u201ccarefully considered all of the asserted grounds and determined that all or at least enough of them ... were meritorious.\u201d <em>Bond v. NIBCO, Inc., </em>96 Md.App. 127, 133, 623 A.2d 731 (1993). Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment in favor of Ferguson.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">II. Commercial\u2019s Duty to Defend BGE</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We must decide whether Commercial had a duty to defend appellant in the <em>Corradetti </em>litigation. This decision requires us to resolve two questions: 1) whether Commercial, at the outset of the suit, had a duty to defend BGE in the <em>Corradetti </em>suit; 2) even if Commercial originally had a duty to defend, did the actions of the Corradettis in dismissing their claims as to all parties except BGE then relieve Commercial of its obligation to defend BGE?</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The law in Maryland is well settled that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend its insured under a liability insurance policy arises when the insured is sued on a claim that is covered, or is potentially covered, by the insurance policy; the duty is ordinarily determined based on the allegations in the suit and the language of the policy. <em>See Brohawn v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>276 Md. 396, 347 A.2d 842 (1975). <em>See also Chantel Assoc. v. Mt. Vernon Fire Ins. Co., </em>338 Md. 131, 656 A.2d 779 (1995); <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Cochran, </em>337 Md. 98, 651 A.2d 859 (1995); <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. v. Pryseski, </em>292 Md. 187, 438 A.2d 282 (1981); <em>Aetna Ins. Co. v. Aaron, </em>112 Md.App. 472, 481-83, 685 A.2d 858 (1996); <em>Reames v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins., </em>111 Md.App. 546, 558, 683 A.2d 179 (1996) ; <em>Oweiss v. Erie Ins. Exchange, </em>67 Md.App. 712, 717, 509 A.2d 711 (1986). Indeed, the Court of Appeals recently held that the duty to defend arises as long as the plaintiff in a tort case alleges an \u201caction that is <em>potentially covered </em>by the policy, no matter how attenuated, frivolous, or illogical that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>allegation may be.\u201d <em>Sheets v. Brethren Mut. Ins. Co., </em>342 Md. 634, 643, 679 A.2d 540 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">In <em>Brohawn, </em>276 Md. 396, 347 A.2d 842, the insurer filed a declaratory judgment seeking a determination that it did not have to defend or indemnify its insured. The insured was sued by employees of a nursing home for alleged assault after she tried to take her grandmother out of the nursing home. The initial complaint by the employees alleged only an intentional assault by the insured, but it was later amended to include a negligence claim. The insurer claimed it had no duty to defend, because intentional torts were expressly excluded from coverage under its policy. The insurer reasoned that because its insured had pled guilty to criminal assault charges based on the incident, she would be found hable for an intentional act, and thus the claim would not be covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The Court disagreed. In explaining the insurer\u2019s duty to defend, it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">The obligation of an insurer to defend its insured under a contract provision such as here involved is determined by the ahegations in the tort actions. If the plaintiffs in the tort suits allege a claim covered by the policy, the insurer has a duty to defend. Even if a tort plaintiff does not allege facts which clearly bring the claim within or without the policy coverage, the insurer still must defend if there is a potentiality that the claim could be covered by the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-7\"><em>Brohawn, </em>276 Md. at 407, 347 A.2d 842 (citations omitted). Thus, the Court held that the insurer had a duty to defend because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">[t]he amended declarations in the personal injury cases here involved, alleging negligence, clearly state claims within the coverage of the policy. While Transamerica may believe that the evidence of the guilty plea would establish that any injuries sustained by [the employees] were the result of intentional acts by Mrs. Brohawn, this belief will not relieve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Transamerica of its duty to defend its insured in suits which allege an unintentional tort covered by the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 408, 347 A.2d 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Later, in <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. v. Pryseski, </em>292 Md. 187, 438 A.2d 282 (1981), the Court articulated a two part test for determining the insurer\u2019s duty to defend. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">In determining whether a liability insurer has a duty to provide its insured with a defense in a tort suit, two types of questions ordinarily must be answered: (1) what is the coverage and what are the defenses under the terms and requirements of the insurance policy? (2) do the allegations in the tort action potentially bring the tort claim within the policy\u2019s coverage? The first question focuses upon the language and requirements of the policy, and the second question focuses upon the allegations of the tort suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxY\"><em>Pryseski, </em>292 Md. at 193, 438 A.2d 282. Subsequent decisions have consistently reaffirmed the <em>Pryseski </em>test. <em>Sheets, </em>342 Md. at 643, 679 A.2d 540; <em>Cochran, </em>337 Md. at 103-04, 651 A.2d 859; <em>Aaron, </em>slip op. at 8-9; <em>Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. v. Knopf, </em>109 Md.App. 134, 674 A.2d 65, <em>cert. denied, </em>343 Md. 333, 681 A.2d 69 (1996); <em>Chesapeake Physicians Professional Ass\u2019n v. Home Ins. Co., </em>92 Md.App. 385, 608 A.2d 822 (1992). In addition to examining the insurance policy and the allegations raised by the tort plaintiff, the court may also consider \u201cextrinsic evidence\u201d adduced by the insured to determine if the tort plaintiffs suit is covered by the policy. <em>Cochran, </em>337 Md. at 111, 651 A.2d 859; see also <em>Sheets, </em>342 Md. at 640 n. 2, 679 A.2d 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The Corradettis\u2019 amended complaint against Jones, C &amp; P, Spector, BGE, and Ferguson alleged, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">4. That on October 10, 1990, while the Plaintiff was backing his vehicle from a private driveway onto Seamore Street, and while exercising all due care and prudent caution for his own safety, his vehicle fell into an excavation made by the Defendant corporations, by their agents, servants or employees which excavation was created by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>negligent, careless and reckless construction activities of the Defendants, their agents, servants and employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">5. That said fall and injuries to the Plaintiff occurred by reason of the negligence, carelessness and lack of due care on the part of the Defendants, by their agents, servants or employees in that they: did fail to fully fill-in, grade and level the area of excavation created by construction activities; they did fail to post adequate signs, warnings, barriers, or protection for vehicles and pedestrians traversing the area when they knew, or with the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that the failure to so act would cause a condition hazardous to the public; they did fail to grade the area to level with the existing topography in relationship to road and sidewalk areas; they did create a hazard to motor traffic by causing an excavation adjacent to the road which was at least partially obscured by the improper grading and adjacent vegetation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">These assertions do not specify the particulars of the negligence claim against BGE. Rather, the general allegations include a claim against BGE grounded on derivative liability, based on BGE\u2019s failure to supervise its agents, and a claim of liability based on its own conduct. In our view, it is not dispositive that the Corradettis failed to \u201callege facts which clearly bring the claim within or without the policy coverage,\u201d <em>Brohawn, </em>276 Md. at 408, 347 A.2d 842, as \u201c \u2018any doubt as to whether there is a potentiality of coverage under an insurance policy is to be resolved in favor of the insured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chantel, </em>338 Md. at 145, 656 A.2d 779 (citation omitted). Indeed, in <em>Sheets, </em>the Court recognized that \u201c[tjhere is an important difference between the duty to defend a lawsuit that affirmatively makes a claim that falls outside of the coverage of the policy, and the duty to defend a lawsuit that fails to allege the elements of a cause of action that if properly alleged and proven would be within the coverage of the policy.\u201d <em>Sheets, </em>342 Md. at 644, 679 A.2d 540. Moreover, the \u201cduty to defend is broader than and different from the duty to pay.\u201d <em>Luppino v. Vigilant Ins. Co., </em>110 Md.App. 372, 381, 677 A.2d 617 (1996). Based on the complaint, we are amply satisfied that there was the potential<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ity for coverage under the Commercial policy. Therefore, at least initially, Commercial had a duty to defend BGE in the <em>Corradetti </em>suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Ultimately, the Corradettis chose to pursue their claim only against BGE, on the theory that BGE was solely responsible for the occurrence because of its own negligence. At the hearing on the motion to dismiss in the <em>Corradetti </em>case, the Corradettis expressly redefined their theory of BGE\u2019s liability. The following colloquy between court and counsel illustrates the Corradettis\u2019 change in position.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">Counsel for C &amp; P: Your Honor, as you\u2019re already familiar with this case, it involves an accident where the Plaintiff backed into a pit, and the Plaintiff, through various complaints, ended up with an amended complaint against five defendants, all of whom are represented here today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">* * # * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">Discovery as to liability, in my mind, has led to a point where C &amp; P and the other Defendants, with the exception of BG &amp; E, should be dismissed from the case. I submitted on Friday, a motion for dismissal pursuant to 2 \u2014 506(b), because under 2-506(a), all defendants \u2014 all parties to the case must agree to the dismissal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">sic sjs s\u00a1\u00ab # jk</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">Plaintiff, obviously, has reached a point where he is willing to dismiss all Defendants except BG &amp; E, because the facts are clear that the splicing pit into which the Plaintiff fell was, although dug by a subcontractor of BG &amp; E, there was no connection at all between the splicing pit and C &amp; P Telephone Company or the other two TV cable companies, Jones and Spector____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">So, I\u2019m speaking, obviously, on behalf of C &amp; P, but I know that the Plaintiffs counsel believes it\u2019s clear that the TV communications people are also without liability; and although Ferguson Trenching dug the pit, I believe [Fergu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>son\u2019s counsel] will argue that there\u2019s no liability with regard to that Defendant, as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\">Counsel for Ferguson: [T]he part of this case that\u2019s at issue is who had the responsibility to fill [the pit] in, and I urge counsel to tell me where there\u2019s a witness that can connect either C &amp; P, any of the cable companies, or Ferguson Trenching with the responsibility, the duty to fill in that pit, sir. I think \u2014 and I think [the Corradettis counsel], who is a very able Plaintiff\u2019s counsel, as Your Honor well knows, has done this. He has looked at it, he\u2019s taken the depositions, and he is perfectly willing to let all these Defendants go except BG &amp; E.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">* sf: * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">Counsel for Spector: Well, very briefly, I would have to take all the arguments by [C &amp; P] and [Ferguson]. The uncontradicted evidence is, and they produced that BG &amp; E man. Ferguson said, \u201cI dug it for BGE at their request,\u201d the splicing pit. That\u2019s the only things that \u2014 is at issue. He said he put the rebars around it and the tape, thereafter he was through and so notified BG <em>&amp; </em>E. The BG &amp; E witness clearly says, \u201cIt\u2019s our, BG &amp; E\u2019s, responsibility to ' take care of that pit, fill it in,\u201d and they said the cable companies and the C <em>&amp; </em>P, they\u2019re through.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">\u00ed}\u00ed \u00edf\u00ed \u00edfi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">Counsel for Jones: I can only add to what [counsel for Spector] has already said.... And if there were any other evidence that could be produced, it would have been certainly produced by now. So here we are on the eve of trial, they\u2019re protesting we shouldn\u2019t be let out, but there has \u2014 I don\u2019t understand what the inference is or the \u2014 evidence that \u2014 that can be obtained against at least the cable companies could amount to, because it has not been produced, it can\u2019t be produced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">Counsel for the Corradettis: Your Honor, I\u2019m always willing to sue as many rich Defendants as I can find, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>this instance, I must agree with all counsel with the exception of course, of [BGE].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">More importantly, the reason why [BGE] should fail on this \u2014 these representations to the Court.... I think they really should read their answers to interrogatories filed in this case, in which they say that a hole was dug by Ferguson who was responsible for it, and negligently failed to fill it in. And that\u2019s all they\u2019ve ever said as to what the cause of this accident is and who\u2019s responsible for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">They have yet to identify the first additional party that had any responsibilities for filling in that hole except their allegation that it was Ferguson; but, lo and behold, their own records show that they had a contract with Ferguson to dig the hole, and they paid Ferguson at that point, and never commissioned him to close the hole, at all. And, in fact, when it was closed some seven, eight months later, it was filled in by another subcontractor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">And there\u2019s absolutely no indication anywhere in the meantime that anybody is in this hole for any reason except BG <em>&amp; </em>E, and their own worker or administrative person suggests that the hole was dug and they simply forgot about it, and that\u2019s the problem here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">And there\u2019s no other evidence that they bring forward to show that anyone else is responsible for the hole, or that anyone else was in it. And if that exists by way of proof, they haven\u2019t provided it to me, or I wouldn\u2019t be agreeing to this dismissal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">So the only evidence I have is to the effect that the hole was created by them for their purposes and \u2014 and that\u2019s the end of the ballgame, as far as I\u2019m concerned. And I can\u2019t show another person responsible at all. So I think it just clouds the issue, creates a lot of traffic in the courtroom when the case is tried, and the only person we\u2019re going after is BG &amp; E.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">As we noted, the policy does not cover a claim based on BGE\u2019s own negligence. The question, then, is whether the insurer\u2019s duty to defend continued even after the Corradettis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>dismissed their claims against all parties except BGE. Appellant steadfastly maintains that Commercial had a continuing duty to defend BGE, regardless of the Corradettis\u2019 subsequent dismissal of their case against Ferguson and the other parties. BGE argues that 1) the Corradettis\u2019 amended complaint alleges negligence against BGE, and 2) Commercial\u2019s policy covers BGE for bodily injury or property damage that BGE becomes legally obligated to pay, based on an incident occurring within the coverage period of the policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant also cites the <em>Pryseski </em>test, and argues that to determine whether a suit against the insured is potentially covered by the policy, the court must look exclusively at the insurance policy, the complaint of the tort plaintiff, and any extrinsic evidence adduced by the <em>insured </em>that may bring the claim within the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Appellees argue, however, that the Corradettis\u2019 dismissal of their claims against the other defendants is evidence that the remaining claim against BGE is not covered by the policy, thereby vitiating the duty to defend. They reason that because the plaintiff elected to pursue BGE based on its own negligence, there is no potentiality of coverage, since the policy does not cover BGE for its own negligence. Appellees asserted, at oral argument, that, in certain circumstances, the insurer is permitted to use \u201cextrinsic evidence\u201d which does not go to the merits of the plaintiffs claim, in order to establish that the claim is not covered under the policy. For example, they contend that if the insured has not paid the premiums for the insurance, the insurer could establish that fact through extrinsic evidence, and thus would not have a duty to defend, even if the claim against the insured otherwise falls within the scope of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Appellees rely on our opinion in <em>Mt. Vernon Fire Ins. Co. v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., </em>99 Md.App. 545, 638 A.2d 1196 (1994), <em>ajfd in part, rev\u2019d in part, sub nom. Chantel Assoc. v. Mt. Vernon Fire Ins. Co., </em>338 Md. 131, 656 A.2d 779 (1995), to support their claim that they are entitled to present extrinsic evidence on the duty to defend issue, even if it touches on the merits of the Corradettis\u2019 suit. There, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\">We conclude that these [selected] cases do not abolish the exclusive pleading rule. They merely recognize that the court is not required to play the ostrich when uncontroverted evidence makes it clear that the exclusive pleading rule should not be applied. If there is no dispute about the truth of facts asserted in the \u201cother sources,\u201d the court may rely on those undisputed assertions to determine whether there is a duty to defend. If there is a reasonable dispute about the truth of facts asserted in the \u201cother sources,\u201d the court must resolve the duty to defend issue by examining the four corners of the complaint and the four corners of the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 563, 638 A.2d 1196 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals has repeatedly made clear that an insurer may not introduce extrinsic evidence that would take the claim outside the policy\u2019s coverage, so long as the <em>allegations </em>in the tort suit raise the potentiality of coverage under the policy. <em>See, e.g., Sheets, </em>342 Md. at 640 n. 2, 679 A.2d 540. (\u201cThe <em>insurer </em>... may not use [extrinsic] evidence to contest coverage if the allegations in the underlying tort suit sufficiently establish a potentiality of coverage.\u201d); <em>Cochran, </em>337 Md. at 107, 651 A.2d 859 (\u201c[W]e have held that an <em>insurer </em>may not use extrinsic evidence to contest coverage under an insurance policy if the tort suit complaint establishes a potentiality of coverage ....\u201d) (citing <em>Brohawn v.

The rule protects the insured from the requirement of proving to its insurer that the insured is, in fact, hable to the tort plaintiff under a theory covered by the policy, in order to obtain the insurer\u2019s assistance in defending the insured against the same allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">As we see it, however, appellees have not attempted to introduce extrinsic evidence in order to attack the merits of the Corradettis\u2019 claim against BGE, or to establish that the Corradettis would not prevail at trial; that is the type of \u201cextrinsic evidence\u201d that the insurer may not use. <em>See Brohawn, </em>276 Md. at 408, 347 A.2d 842 (stating that the insurer\u2019s belief that the guilty plea entered by its insured would result in a finding of intentional assault not covered by the policy did not reheve the insurer of the obhgation to defend). <em>See also Sheets, </em>342 Md. at 640 n. 2, 679 A.2d 540; <em>Cochran, </em>337 Md. at 107, 651 A.2d 859. Rather, appellees attempted to rely upon a change in the Corradettis\u2019 <em>allegations, </em>which they assert removes the entire suit from the ambit of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">In our view, the plaintiffs\u2019 eleventh hour dismissal of claims against all parties except BGE was tantamount to an amendment to the allegations. We conclude that when the plaintiff amends the allegations, the changes in the allegations may be proffered by the insured and considered by the court to determine whether the insurer has a continuing duty to defend. This is because the tort plaintiffs <em>allegations </em>are central to the determination of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Appellant suggests that, in resolving whether there is a duty to defend, the court is to examine only the <em>complaint, </em>the policy, and extrinsic evidence adduced by the insured. Therefore, any subsequent change in the allegations would not be probative with respect to the duty to defend. <em>See, e.g., Sheets, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>342 Md. at 641, 679 A.2d 540 (\u201cPursuant to the second part of the <em>Pryseski </em>inquiry, this Court must look to the Christen-sens\u2019 <em>complaint </em>and any extrinsic evidence adduced .... \u201d)(emphasis added); <em>Chantel, </em>338 Md. at 142, 656 A.2d 779 (\u201c[A]n insurer\u2019s duty to defend is triggered when an examination of the policy, <em>the complaint </em>and appropriate extrinsic evidence discloses a potentiality of coverage under the insurance policy.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Western World Ins. Co. v. Harford Mut. Ins. Co., </em>784 F.2d 558, 562 (4th Cir.1986) (\u201cThe sole controlling factor relating to Harford\u2019s duty to defend is whether the allegations contained in [the tort plaintiffs] <em>complaint </em>are such that a \u2018potentiality\u2019 of coverage exists.\u201d) (applying Maryland law) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">In our view, those opinions that have referred to an examination of <em>the complaint </em>have merely utilized a shorthand description for the court\u2019s obligation to examine <em>the allegations </em>raised in the tort suit. We find support for this view in numerous case, including <em>Brohavm </em>and <em>Pryseski, </em>in which the Court recognized that the potentiality of coverage under the policy depended upon an examination of <em>the allegations </em>raised in the tort suit. <em>Pryseski, </em>292 Md. at 193, 438 A.2d 282 (concluding that the court must determine if <em>\u201cthe allegations </em>in the tort action potentially bring the tort claim within the policy\u2019s coverage[.]\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Brohawn, </em>276 Md. at 407, 347 A.2d 842 (\u201cThe obligation of an insurer to defend its insured under a contract provision such as here involved is determined by <em>the allegations </em>in the tort actions.\u201d) (emphasis added). Recent opinions have made clear that the analysis centers on the actual <em>allegations </em>raised by the tort plaintiff, the terms of the policy, and extrinsic evidence, if any. <em>Sullins v.

Brohawn, </em>276 Md. at 408, 347 A.2d 842. Because the plaintiffs had added a claim, based on negligence, to their original intentional tort claim, the suit was brought within the coverage of the policy. <em>Id. </em>We are persuaded that the converse should also apply; as a result of the changes in the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, the Corradettis\u2019 claims against BGE were no longer within the ambit of the policy. <em>See Oweiss, </em>67 Md.App. at 718, 509 A.2d 711 (holding that, as a result of amendments to suit, insurer had a duty to defend, although it did not initially have such a duty based on original allegations); <em>Steyer v.

Cf<em>. Eastern Shore Financial Resources, Ltd. v. Donegal Mut. Ins.

State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins., </em>111 Md.App. 546, 683 A.2d 179 (1996), which makes clear that an insurer\u2019s obligation to defend its insured depends upon the allegations that are actually asserted, and not the allegations that <em>could </em>be raised based on the facts of the case. In <em>Reames, </em>the insureds were sued by their teenaged daughter\u2019s former boyfriend. The suit arose out of a physical altercation between the daughter and the boyfriend, after the boyfriend found the daughter in her bedroom with another male. Although the boyfriend had permission to enter the home at will, the daughter filed charges against him for breaking and entering, and assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>After the boyfriend was found not guilty, he sued the Reameses for malicious prosecution and abuse of process. When their insurer, State Farm, refused to defend the suit, the Reameses sued State Farm in a declaratory judgment action. State Farm claimed that the boyfriend\u2019s allegations were not covered by the policy, which provided insurance for an \u201coccurrence\u201d resulting in \u201cbodily injury,\u201d defined as physical injury, sickness, or disease, but not including emotional distress, mental anguish, humiliation, mental distress, mental injury, unless arising out of physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Judge Harrell, writing for the Court, said that State Farm had no duty to defend, because the allegations were not covered by the policy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">Unasserted causes of action that could potentially have been supported by the factual allegations or the extrinsic evidence cannot form the basis of a duty to defend because they do not demonstrate \u201ca reasonable potential that the issue triggering coverage will be generated at trial.\u201d <em>Cochran, </em>337 Md. at 112, 651 A.2d 859. In the instant case, because the complaint, alleging causes of action for malicious prosecution and abuse of process ... failed to demonstrate a reasonable potential that Ms. Reames would face a \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201csuit\u201d for damages resulting from an assault and battery, we conclude that the circuit court correctly concluded that appellants could not use this, or any other unasserted cause of action, as a basis for compelling State Farm to provide Ms. Reames a defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\"><em>Reames, </em>111 Md.App. at 561, 683 A.2d 179 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Similarly, in this case, BGE cannot compel Commercial to provide it with a defense based on claims which, although at one time asserted by the Corradettis, were no longer asserted, because such claims \u201cwill not be generated at trial.\u201d <em>Cochran, </em>337 Md. at 112, 651 A.2d 859. The fact that the plaintiffs never formally amended their complaint to restate the allegations so as to reflect their revised theory of BGE\u2019s liability is of no moment. Their claims were dismissed against all the parties, except BGE. Under these circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>stances, their actions were the functional equivalent of an amendment of the complaint, and to conclude otherwise would surely exalt form over substance. The plaintiffs\u2019 dismissal of all claims against Ferguson, and their argument to the court, made it clear that their remaining claim against BGE was grounded on the premise that BGE was liable only because of its own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Our view that, in regard to the duty to defend, an insurer may rely on a change in the underlying allegations is in accord with longstanding principles of insurance law. As early as <em>Lee v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>178 F.2d 750, 753 (2nd Cir.1949), Judge Learned Hand articulated that \u201cif the plaintiffs complaint against the insured alleged facts which would have supported a recovery covered by the policy, it was the duty of the defendant to undertake the defense, <em>until it could confine the claim to a recovery that the policy did not cover.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>See also Maryland Cas. Co. v. Pearson, </em>194 F.2d 284 (2nd Cir.1952); 17 George J. Couch, Insurance Law 2d \u00a7 51:48, at 487 (Rev. ed. 1983) (\u201cIt has also been stated that if the complaint in the suit brought against the insured does not exclude a basis for recovery for which the insurer is liable, the insurer is obliged to defend his suit <em>until it can confine the claim to a recovery that the policy does not cover.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); Appleman, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4684.01, at 100 (the insurer\u2019s duty to defend \u201clasts until a stage of the proceedings is reached at which it is clear that no element of the subject matter of the suit is within the scope of the policy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">In <em>Consolidated Underwriters v. Loyd W. Richardson Construction Corp., </em>444 S.W.2d 781 (Tex.Civ.App.1969), an insured sued to recover attorney\u2019s fees and expenses incurred in connection with the defense of a lawsuit by the insured\u2019s own attorney, after the insurer\u2019s attorney obtained permission to withdraw as counsel. In the underlying action, the tort plaintiff had sued the insured for negligently repairing a damaged road. Later, the tort plaintiff amended the complaint, alleging that the repairs in issue had been completed by a certain date. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Since the insurance policy excluded coverage for \u201cwork completed,\u201d the insurer notified its insured that it was withdrawing from the defense. What the court stated is pertinent here: \u201c \u2018[I]n testing the liability of the insurer to defend, the proof is not material. Liability depends upon the allegations of the plaintiffs petition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 784 (quoting <em>Maryland Cas. Co. v. Moritz, </em>138 S.W.2d 1095, 1097 (Tex.Civ.App.1940)). The court noted the \u201c \u2018distinction between cases in which the merit of the claim is the issue and those where the coverage of the insurance policy is in question.\u2019\u201d <em>Consolidated Underwriters, </em>444 S.W.2d at 784 (quoting <em>Cook v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>418 S.W.2d 712, 715-16 (Tex.Civ.App.1967)). The court determined that, once the suit was amended, the insurer was justified in concluding that the claim was not within the policy and in withdrawing its defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">This principle has also been restated as settled law in more recent decisions in several jurisdictions. In <em>Sears, Roebuck and Co. v. Reliance Ins. Co., </em>654 F.2d 494, 496 (7th Cir.1981), the court, although finding that the insurer had a duty to defend its insured, quoted the \u201cwell settled rule\u201d in <em>Lee </em>and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">The law is clear that an insurance carrier\u2019s duty to defend is determined by reference to the allegations of the underlying complaint. Where, as here, the complaint contains allegations which may be covered by the policy, the carriers\u2019 duty continues until such time, if ever, as the claim might be confined to non-covered allegations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-7\"><em>See also Forum Ins. Co. v. Allied Sec., Inc., </em>866 F.2d 80 (3rd Cir.1989); <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Cos. v. Ex-Cell-O Corp., </em>752 F.Supp. 812 (E.D.Mich.1990); <em>Sachs v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>303 F.Supp. 1339 (D.D.C.1969) (finding that the insurer\u2019s duty to defend \u201clasts until a stage of the proceedings is reached at which it is clear that no element of the subject matter of the suit is within the scope of the policy.\u201d); <em>City of Myrtle Point v. Pacific Indemnity Co., </em>233 F.Supp. 193 (D.Or.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Our analysis is further supported by a consideration of the contractual nature of the relationship between the insured and the insurer. The insurer\u2019s duty to defend and indemnify is its consideration to the insured in exchange for the insured\u2019s payment of premiums. <em>See Brohawn, </em>276 Md. at 408, 347 A.2d 842 (\u201cThe [insurer\u2019s] obligation is contractual and exists because of the agreement made by Transamerica with Mrs. Brohawn.\u201d). Thus, by its contract, the insurer is obligated to provide a defense to a covered claim, even if the claim will ultimately fail. The converse is also true, however. The insurer is not obligated to provide a defense to a suit that does not assert a covered claim. Therefore, as a matter of contract interpretation, the insurer is entitled to refuse to defend a suit for which it has no obligation under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">In an attempt to bring the <em>Corradetti </em>suit within the policy, appellant argues that its liability arose out of Ferguson\u2019s work, because Ferguson was responsible for filling in the splicing pit, and since the policy covers BGE for claims based on that theory of negligence, Commercial should have a duty to defend. This argument misses the point, however. Commercial\u2019s duty depends upon whether the <em>allegations </em>raised by the Corradettis are within the scope of the policy. In this case, the Corradettis chose to revise their allegations to sue BGE on a theory that BGE was responsible for the Corradettis\u2019 injuries directly, entirely because of its own negligence. This claim is simply not covered under Commercial\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Moreover, in order to bring the claim within the policy, BGE was not entitled to show that Ferguson <em>shared </em>liability for the Corradettis\u2019 injuries. Although the insured may, under certain circumstances, proffer extrinsic evidence, the proposed extrinsic evidence must pertain to an issue that will be generated at trial, or a cause of action asserted in the suit. <em>See Cochran, </em>337 Md. at 112, 651 A.2d 859 (holding that the insurer had a duty to defend when the facts \u201csufficiently establish a reasonable potential that a self defense issue will be generated at trial.\u201d); <em>Reames, </em>111 Md.App. at 561, 683 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>A.2d 179 (\u201c[The] extrinsic evidence must, however, relate in some manner to a cause of action actually alleged in the complaint and cannot be used by the insured to create a new, unasserted claim that would create a duty to defend.\u201d). As we noted in our earlier unpublished opinion affirming the underlying <em>Corradetti </em>verdict, BGE\u2019s contention that Ferguson was also liable was not relevant in the <em>Corradetti </em>suit. <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em>No. 1493, slip op. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Nevertheless, as a result of our decision affirming the <em>Corradetti </em>verdict, we said that BGE is entitled to pursue its cross-claim against Ferguson.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> BGE could have elected in that cross-claim to pursue a claim that BGE\u2019s liability for the Corradettis\u2019 injuries was premised on BGE\u2019s failure to supervise Ferguson properly or on a derivative liability theory based on Ferguson\u2019s own negligence. Even if BGE could successfully prove these allegations, however, they would still not bring the Corradettis\u2019 claim against BGE within the ambit of Commercial\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Commercial\u2019s policy covered damages that BGE becomes legally obligated to pay \u201cbecause of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this coverage applies.\u201d Thus, if BGE must pay damages to an injured party because of bodily injury <em>based on claims for which BGE is covered </em>by the policy, then Commercial must indemnify BGE. BGE became legally obligated to pay money to the Corradettis, however, because of bodily injury caused by its own negligence, to which Commercial\u2019s policy does <em>not apply. </em>Even if BGE later proves that Ferguson was acting as BGE\u2019s agent and Ferguson was also negligent, the claim against BGE was not based on that theory of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Further, according to the policy\u2019s plain language, Commercial had a right and a duty \u201cto defend\u201d BGE. The policy does not provide coverage for suits <em>by BGE against others, wholly </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>independent of BGE\u2019s </em>defense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An attempt to show that BGE and Ferguson were joint tortfeasors who <em>shared </em>liability would not be a complete defense in the <em>Corradetti </em>suit. Thus, it would not create a duty \u201cto defend\u201d BGE. Nor would such a cross-claim by BGE against Ferguson come within the confines of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that Commercial had a duty to defend BGE, but only until the court granted the Corradettis\u2019 motion to dismiss. At that point, there was no longer a potentiality of coverage under the policy. Once .the suit was \u201cconfined to noncovered allegations\u201d, Commercial no longer had a duty to defend BGE. We emphasize that, based on the blanket contract, the same result would not have attended if the Corradettis had sued BGE on a theory of derivative liability, including a failure to supervise Ferguson properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">We are constrained to note that if, at the outset of the litigation, Commercial had provided BGE with counsel, as it had a duty to do, the attorney may have been obligated to continue representing BGE for the remainder of the trial, notwithstanding Commercial\u2019s lack of any contractual duty to defend and indemnify. Under Rule 1.16(b) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, absent good cause, a lawyer may only withdraw from representing a client if the \u201cwithdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of the client.\u201d Moreover, under Rule 1.16(c), \u201c[w]hen ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation.\u201d The concern for the interests of the client would have been especially salient in this case, because the change affecting the insurer\u2019s duty to defend occurred on the eve of trial. Thus, had the insurer timely provided an attorney, consistent with its obligation, it would not, in all probabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>ty, have been permitted to withdraw at the eleventh hour, regardless of the change in allegations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Nevertheless, the obligation of the attorney to continue its representation under such circumstances rests upon the ethical canons governing attorney conduct, not upon a contractual obligation. As the Court noted in <em>Brohawn, </em>the insurer\u2019s duty to defend is based on a contractual promise. <em>See Brohawn, </em>276 Md. at 409, 347 A.2d 842 (\u201cThe promise to defend the insured, as well as the promise to indemnify, is the consideration received by the insured for payment of the policy premiums.\u201d). Thus, once the allegations against BGE were no longer potentially covered by the policy, BGE was no longer entitled to representation as part of its contract under the policy. Consequently, BGE may have been responsible for compensating the insurer for the continuing representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The rule in Maryland is clear, however, that if an insured must resort to litigation to force its insurer to fulfill its duty to defend, then the insured may recover the fees, costs and expenses of the litigation. <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Board of Educ., </em>302 Md. 516, 489 A.2d 536 (1985); <em>Bankers &amp; Shippers Ins. Co. v. Electro Enter., Inc., </em>287 Md. 641, 415 A.2d 278 (1980); <em>Cohen v. American Home Assur. Co., </em>255 Md. 334, 258 A.2d 225 (1969); <em>Nolt v. USF &amp; G, </em>329 Md. 52, 617 A.2d 578 (1993). \u201cIf an insurer wrongfully refused to defend an insured, it should be liable for the damages that the insured thereby incurs----\u201d <em>Oweiss, </em>67 Md.App. at 720, 509 A.2d 711 <em>(quoting </em>A.D. Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes \u00a7 4.35 (1982)). When all damages are ascertained, the insured may recover for breach of contract. <em>Luppino, </em>110 Md.App. at 382, 677 A.2d 617. As we have determined that Commercial had a duty to defend BGE until the Coradettis dismissed their claims against the other parties, the trial court, on remand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>should determine the reasonable fees, costs, and expenses that BGE incurred during the period when BGE was entitled to representation, for which Commercial may be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">III. Commercial\u2019s Duty to Indemnify BGE</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\u201c[A]n insurer\u2019s unjustified refusal to defend does not estop it from later denying coverage under its duty to indemnify---- The insurer\u2019s breach of contract should not ... be used as a method of obtaining coverage for the insured that the insured did not purchase.\u201d <em>Oweiss, </em>67 Md.App. at 720, 509 A.2d 711 <em>(quoting </em>A.D. Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes \u00a7 4.35 (1982)). As the judgment against BGE in the <em>Corradetti </em>suit was not based on Ferguson\u2019s negligence, it was not covered by the policy. Therefore, Commercial had no duty to indemnify BGE for the judgment in the <em>Corradetti </em>suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Nevertheless, BGE, in its cross-claim, could seek contribution from Ferguson on the theory that Ferguson is a joint tortfeasor with BGE. As we said in <em>Hartford v. Scarlett Harbor, </em>109 Md.App. 217, 280-81, 674 A.2d 106, <em>cert. granted, </em>343 Md. 334, 681 A.2d 70 (1996),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">[i]n order for a party to have a right of contribution, two prerequisites must be satisfied. First, the parties must share a \u201ccommon liability\u201d or burden. Second, the party seeking contribution must have paid, under legal compulsion, more than his fair share of the common obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">Parties share a common liability if they are either coobligors or joint tortfeasors. Parties are co-obligors if they are jointly liable or jointly and severally liable on an obligation. They are not co-obligors, however, if they are only severally liable on the obligation. The Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, Md. Ann.Code, art 50, \u00a7 16(a) (1994), provides: \u201c \u2018Joint tort-feasors\u2019 means two <em>or </em>more persons jointly <em>or </em>severally liable <em>in tort </em>for the same injury to person or property, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or some of them.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). In sum, parties share a common liability if they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>either (1) jointly hable on the same non-tort obligation (such as a contract, promissory note, or tax), or (2) jointly or severally liable, or both, in tort, for the same harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">(Citations omitted.) Further, as our recent opinion in <em>Lerman v. Heemann, </em>112 Md.App. 320, 326-28, 685 A.2d 782 (1996) makes clear, the tortfeasor seeking contribution need not even have lodged a cross-claim in the tort plaintiffs suit in order to seek contribution from its joint tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">In this case, BGE filed a cross-claim against Ferguson. If BGE can prove that Ferguson is a joint tortfeasor in regard, to the Corradettis\u2019 injuries, it may be entitled to contribution. BGE\u2019s claim, however, would arise from traditional tort principles, not from its insurance policy with Commercial. Although, in the end, Commercial may be required to pay monies to BGE, on behalf of Ferguson, if Ferguson is found liable, Commercial\u2019s obligation to pay would arise from its contractual obligation as <em>Ferguson\u2019s insurer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">JUDGMENT REVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART AS TO COMMERCIAL\u2019S AND AMERICAN\u2019S DUTY TO DEFEND BGE.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF COMMERCIAL AND AMERICAN AFFIRMED AS TO INDEMNIFICATION.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">JUDGMENT ON BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM, IN FAVOR OF FERGUSON, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">COSTS TO BE PAID ONE HALF BY BGE, ONE QUARTER BY COMMERCIAL, AND ONE QUARTER BY AMERICAN.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-11\">.

After its cross-claim was dismissed, appellant filed third-party complaints against Ferguson and others, seeking joint tortfeasor contribution as well as tort and contractual indemnity. The trial court dismissed these complaints after the <em>Corradetti </em>trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[3]\">\n<p id=\"b582-9\">3. Coverages A and B specified that, in connection with a suit against Ferguson, Commercial would pay its own expenses, up to $250 in bail bonds, the costs of bonds to release attachments, reasonable expenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>incurred by the insured to assist in the suit, all costs \"taxed against the insured,\u201d and certain interest payments based on the part of a judgment paid by Commercial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b592-5\">. BGE's argument essentially mirrors what is known as the Exclusive Pleading Rule. For a thorough discussion of that rule, <em>see Eastern Shore Financial Resources, Ltd. v. Donegal Mut. Ins. Co., </em>84 Md.App. 609, 620-27, 581 A.2d 452 (1990), <em>criticized </em>by <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v.

The parties have not advised us whether BGE pursued this claim, or of the outcome of the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b602-6\">. We do not suggest that an insurer actively defending its insured could not undertake counter or cross claims on behalf of its insured. Such claims may fall within the duty to defend, and it would be incumbent upon the insurer to pursue them. Also, as part of a defense strategy, the insurer may wish to pursue such claims, even if not required to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b603-9\">. Of course, if BGE would have preferred another lawyer at that point, BGE could have requested a continuance from the trial court to procure other counsel. The request need not have been granted, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
