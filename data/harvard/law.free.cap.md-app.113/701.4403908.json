She asserts that the order was improper because of the privileged nature of those records.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">In relevant part, Md.Code (1974, 1995 RepLVol.) \u00a7 9-109 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">In <em>all </em>judicial ... proceedings, a patient ... has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent a witness from disclosing, communications relating to diagnosis or treatment of the patient\u2019s mental or emotional disorder.... There is no privilege if ... [i]n a civil or criminal proceeding ... [t]he patient introduces his mental condition as an element of his ... defense---- [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">In the. case at bar, the trial court\u2019s sua sponte order, in relevant part, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-11\">But I will order both Mr. and Mrs. R. to authorize the Department in writing to get all medical records and medical opinions from the Springfield Hospital and from all persons treating or who treated [them] in the past____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">Appellant\u2019s counsel, at the first opportunity, requested that the court reconsider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>MS. LONG: ... I would just ask ... as a legal matter that you reconsider____ I don\u2019t believe, Your Honor ... has authority to order her to do that....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">COURT: Well, the point is if she [does not] want to do it she\u2019s in California and I\u2019m over here. What am I going to do? Send somebody for her? <em>What I\u2019m really trying to say by ordering it is that I consider it very important. </em>I\u2019m going to let the order stand <em>but it\u2019s up to her if she wants to do it or not. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The trial judge was then interrupted by appellant and the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">MRS. R: I have a lengthy psychiatric history related to many different issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">... I\u2019d be more than willing to do an independent evaluation but I\u2019m not going to have an evaluation tainted by old documents in my past which is changed....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-10\">COURT: Well,' the point is that you can show that it\u2019s changed....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-11\">... I think the Court\u2019s entitled to know the background of ... your background. We just can\u2019t cut your background off from you. But you\u2019re certainly entitled to show that you\u2019ve gotten help, that you\u2019re a different person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">While it is not altogether clear that the trial court intended its order to be mandatory, it is clear that appellant\u2019s trial counsel and appellant vigorously asserted the statutory privilege. It is absolutely clear that the waiver that the Montgomery County Department of Social Services now asserts to us on appeal was never raised by it, asserted by it, proffered by it, or, in any way brought to the trial court\u2019s attention, and it is equally manifest that the trial court never found a waiver of the privilege, either expressly or by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">Appellant presents this question on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Does the psychotherapist-patient privilege bar discovery of a parent\u2019s prior psychiatric records in a CINA proceeding, even though the parent\u2019s psychological fitness to care for her child is at issue?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">While we shall ultimately answer that question, we stress now our emphasis on the statute\u2019s use of the words <em>\u201call </em>judicial ... proceedings\u201d \u2014 \u201call\u201d includes CINA proceedings. Before finally answering the issue posed, we perceive, however, another preliminary question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">Where the only basis for admissibility of privileged information is either an express waiver of the privilege under C J section 9-109(6) or an implied waiver under [CJ] section 9-109(d)(3)(i), may a trial court order a party to produce privileged information when that information is not directly requested and where the privilege is plainly asserted and there is no proffer made by the other party or any finding made by the trial court that the privilege has been waived?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak2\">We answer our preliminary question in the negative. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">We initially note the provisions of two Maryland Rules. Maryland Rule 5-301, Presumptions in Civil Actions, provides that \u201ca presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of producing evidence to rebut the presumption.\u201d Maryland Rule 5-104, Preliminary Questions, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\">Preliminary questions concerning ... the <em>existence of a privilege </em>... shall be determined by the court.... In making its determination, the court may, in the interest of justice, decline to require strict application of the rules of evidence, <em>except those relating to privilege </em>and competency of witnesses. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Appellee cites <em>In re Vanessa C., </em>104 Md.App. 452, 460, 656 A.2d 795 (1995), for the proposition that the error in admitting the records was harmless. Appellee argues that appellant \u201cdoes not assert that she has complied with the order, nor that she has been threatened with a contempt proceeding for noncompliance.\u201d We disagree. Appellant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>refused to execute a release for the records. If appellee\u2019s harmless error arguments were to be accepted by us, a patient would have absolutely no recourse prior to refusing to obey the court\u2019s order and risking contempt sanctions. The risk in refusing to comply, even if the court acknowledges little actual power to enforce because appellant is not within this jurisdiction, exists and continues to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\"><em>In re Vanessa C. </em>is more relevant for its procedural discussion. We held there that it was error for the trial court to compel the production of a mother\u2019s psychiatric records. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">The initial hearing was conducted before Judge Harrington and was of short duration. One of the few things accomplished at that time was the acceptance into evidence of the discharge summary of appellant\u2019s psychiatric records from Holy Cross Hospital. Initially, the court was reluctant to admit the records. The court was then informed that the records were released to DSS by the Crisis Center and that the Crisis Center had obtained the records from Holy Cross Hospital. It was argued that this amounted to a waiver. <em>Appellant\u2019s counsel objected to admission of the summary and insisted that appellant had the right to an evidentiary hearing with respect to whether the privilege was waived. </em>It appears that, while <em>DSS has the bu,rden to show waiver, </em>the court did not require DSS to meet its burden prior to accepting the discharge summary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 460, 656 A.2d 795 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">In the present case, there was no evidentiary hearing on the waiver issue \u2014 it was not even presented below by appellee. The potential for harm remains. More relevant to our discussion of this issue was our clear holding in <em>In re Vanessa C. </em>that the party relying on a waiver of the privilege has the burden to show waiver. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">Another case involving whether a position taken by a person with a privilege (attorney-client privilege) constituted a waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>was <em>Harrison v. State, </em>276 Md. 122, 345 A.2d 830 (1975).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant, Harrison, while on the witness stand, testified as to the content of a jail house conversation with another prisoner. On cross-examination, the prosecutor was permitted to ask Harrison if he had ever told his former attorney of the conversation. Harrison replied that he had. The trial judge then allowed the State to reopen its case and call Harrison\u2019s former attorney, over Harrison\u2019s privilege-based objection. Harrison\u2019s former attorney denied that Harrison had told him of the matter. Harrison\u2019s conviction was reversed. The Court of Appeals, after giving a concise history of the privilege, acknowledged that the existence of the relationship and whether the communication is privileged \u201cin the first instance for the trial court.\u201d <em>Harrison, </em>276 Md. at 136, 345 A.2d 830. The Court then commented that one of the State\u2019s positions was that the privilege \u201cwas waived by the appellant\u2019s responses to' the prosecutor on cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court, in addressing the issue, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">Although waiver by implication is universally recognized and even though it need not be expressed in writing nor in any particular form, the intent to waive must, however, be expressed either by word or act, or omission to speak out. Once the confidential matter has been disclosed, it is no longer secret and the privilege which might be claimed disappears.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">Since a voluntary disclosure deprives a subsequent claim of privilege based upon confidentiality, and since traditionally waiver is described as the intentional relinquishment of a known right, in determining waiver by implication \u201cregard must be had to the double elements that are predicated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>every waiver, <em>ie., </em>not only the element of implied intention, but also the element of fairness and consistency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 137-38, 345 A.2d 830 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">In <em>Harrison, </em>the Court recognized a procedural problem similar to that in the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">Procedurally, we think [the trial court] erred in not conducting a preliminary inquiry out of the presence of the jury and hearing testimony of all the surrounding facts and circumstances to determine initially whether a confidential relationship existed between Harrison and [Harrison\u2019s former attorney], and if so, whether or not there had been a waiver of the privilege. It appears that the trial court required a disclosure of the communication without first determining the existence of the privilege.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 151, 345 A.2d 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Appellant, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>clearly invoked her privilege. Appellee did not assert below that the privilege had been waived, nor did the trial court make any finding of waiver. Additionally, the Department of Social Services, in one of its reports, noted that appellant declined to waive the privilege as to past records.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\"><em>Goldsmith v. State, </em>337 Md. 112, 651 A.2d 866 (1995), involved attempts by a criminal defendant to obtain privileged information about a victim in pretrial criminal proceedings. The Court of Appeals noted that during a hearing on the motion to compel the production of certain documents, the defendant had made \u201cno proffer of any likelihood that relevant information would be obtained by reviewing the records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, 651 A.2d 866. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellee not only failed to make a proffer of relevance at the hearing, but never moved to force the production of appellant\u2019s psychiatric records. As we have indicated, it was a <em>sua sponte </em>trial court initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">The <em>Goldsmith </em>majority commented on its holding in <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 626 A.2d 946 (1993), in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Court held, in reference to less protected confidential records,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that <em>\u201cbefore disclosure </em>will be ordered, the moving party must show, usually at a hearing, some connection between the records sought, the issue before the court, and the <em>likelihood </em>that information relevant to the trial would be discovered.\u201d <em>Goldsmith, </em>837 Md. at 127-28, 651 A.2d 866 (some emphasis added; citations omitted). The <em>Goldsmith </em>Court concluded that, in order to obtain pretrial discovery of even confidential records, a \u201cdefendant [had] to show a likelihood of obtaining relevant information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128, 651 A.2d 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The <em>Goldsmith </em>Court went on to note that a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional rights may outweigh a victim\u2019s right to assert a privilege and, therefore, privileged information could be obtained by a criminal defendant at trial. The Court, however, cautioned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">[t]he mere assertion that the records in question <em>may </em>contain evidence useful for impeachment is insufficient to override an absolute statutory privilege, even at the trial stage---- We cannot permit a privilege to be abrogated even at the trial stage by the mere assertion that privileged records <em>may </em>contain information relevant to credibility. To do so would virtually destroy the psychotherapist-patient privilege of crime victims. It has long been recognized that privileges, by their very nature, restrict access to information which would otherwise be disclosed. The rationale for this restriction has been our recognition of the social importance of protecting the privacy encompassed by specified relationships. Such privacy interests cannot be negated by the mere assertion of the possibility of impeachment evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 133, 651 A.2d 866 (citatipns omitted). The <em>Goldsmith </em>Court ultimately held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-10\">that in order to abrogate a privilege such as to require disclosure at trial of privileged records, a defendant must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>establish a reasonable likelihood that the privileged records contain exculpatory information necessary for a proper defense. In the present case, the defendant did not establish the likelihood that the records sought would provide exculpatory information. At most, <em>Goldsmith </em>made only a speculative assertion that the records might be relevant for impeachment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 133-35, 651 A.2d 866 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The dissent in <em>Goldsmith, </em>written by Judge (now Chief Judge) Bell and joined by Judge Eldridge, although also basing its discussion on criminal cases, at least inferentially recognized the need for an adequate proffer. Judge Bell commented that in <em>Avery v. State, </em>15 Md.App. 520, 292 A.2d 728, <em>cert. denied, </em>266 Md. 733 (1972), <em>and appeal dismissed, </em>410 U.S. 977, 93 S.Ct. 1499, 36 L.Ed.2d 173 (1973), it was noted that \u201c[i]t is not clear from the court\u2019s opinion whether, other than a proffer that the records existed, the defendant proffered why he believed he was entitled to inspect the records.\u201d <em>Goldsmith, </em>337 Md. at 146, 651 A.2d 866. The dissent then discussed that in <em>Avery </em>we, addressing a criminal defendant\u2019s request for a victim\u2019s psychiatric records, adopted the procedure suggested by the Court of Appeals in <em>Hamilton v. Verdow, </em>287 Md. 544, 414 A.2d 914 (1980), which discussed claims of executive privilege. Judge Bell noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj5A\">[ujnder that procedure, once materials have been determined to be presumptively privileged, the burden shifts to the party seeking them to show either that they are not privileged or that there is some necessity for their production notwithstanding the privilege. Only when the requisite showing has been made to overcome the presumption will the court conduct an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the materials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A35\"><em>Goldsmith, </em>337 Md. at 147, 651 A.2d 866 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The dissenters\u2019 argument in <em>Goldsmith </em>involved, to a large degree, the conflict between the privilege and a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation. Their reasoning and discussion leads us to believe that, in a civil case, they would join with the majority in requiring that, when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>privilege, such as that implicated in the case <em>sub judice, </em>is asserted, the party seeking the privileged information has the burden of establishing that one of the exceptions to the respective statutory privilege exists. In order to rebut the claim of privilege with an argument of waiver, the argument <em>must be made to the tribunal </em>before whom the claim of statutory privilege has been asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">When the privilege clearly applies, as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>our position, that an assertion of privilege creates a presumption, necessitating the introduction or at least the proffer of evidence rebutting it, is buttressed somewhat by the Court of Appeals\u2019s discussion of the privileged confidential relationship between spouses in <em>Coleman v. State, </em>281 Md. 538, 380 A.2d 49 (1977). Therein, former Chief Judge Murphy noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">It is not necessary that the spouse claiming the privilege establish the confidential nature of the communication. Generally, the courts have presumed that communications between husband and wife are confidential and privileged, although the circumstances of a given case can negate this presumption. The presumption is rebutted where it is shown that the communication was not intended to be confidential, or was made to, or in the presence of a third party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 543, 380 A.2d 49 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">In <em>Hamilton v. Verdow, supra, </em>discussed by Judge Bell in <em>Goldsmith, </em>the Court of Appeals established a procedure to be used by a court when addressing an executive privilege claim. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">[W]hen a formal claim of executive privilege is made, with an affidavit stating that the demanded materials are of a type that fall within the scope of the privilege, they are presumptively privileged even from <em>in camera </em>inspection. The burden is on the party seeking production to make a preliminary showing that the communications or documents may not be privileged.... Consequently, absent such a preliminary showing by the party demanding disclosure, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>claim of executive privilege should be honored without requiring an <em>in camera </em>inspection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">287 Md. at 566-67, 414 A.2d 914 (citations omitted). We later held, in <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>98 Md.App. 348, 366, 633 A.2d 455 (1993), that \u201cthe procedure [above] established to resolve claims of executive privilege should also be applied to claims of privilege under C.J. [\u00a7] 9-109.... Records containing information about communications between the patient and the psychiatrist or psychologist are presumptively privileged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In the case at bar, the judge <em>sua sponte </em>ordered disclosure. Appellant claimed the privilege. Appellee never objected below to the claimed privilege, nor proffered to the trial court the claim of waiver now made to this Court. A presumptive privilege cannot be rebutted when no one even claims it has been waived. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court\u2019s action in ordering appellant to disclose her past records was, for that reason, as well as those that follow, in error. We shall, however, because of the importance of the issue and the frequency with which social service agencies, and others, introduce the mental condition of opposing parties in litigation, address another reason for reversal and in doing so respond to the position taken by appellee to that important question actually raised by appellant in this appeal. We repeat appellant\u2019s question:</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Does the psychotherapist-patient privilege bar discovery of a parent\u2019s prior psychiatric records in a CINA proceeding, even though the parent\u2019s psychological fitness to care for her child is at issue?</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">We initially emphasize again that the General Assembly made the statutory privilege applicable in <em>\u201call\u201d </em>judicial proceedings, subject to certain exceptions. We next note that the subject matter of a document introduced in evidence by appellant was offered for the purpose of responding to appellee\u2019s claims as to appellant\u2019s mental fitness. To counter MCDSS\u2019s claim of mental unfitness, appellant\u2019s attorney, Ms. Long, on cross-examination of Mr. Williams, an employee of MCDSS, asked him if he had received a document dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>December of 1995 from a Dr. Powell. Williams responded that he had reviewed the document. Thereafter, appellant\u2019s counsel requested that the court admit \u201cmother\u2019s exhibit number one.\u201d It was then received in evidence. That exhibit included the relatively recent letter from Dr. Powell dated December 5, 1995, less than five months before the hearing. In that letter, the following statements, relative to appellant\u2019s mental and emotional state, were included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">The patient currently suffers from bipolar illness____ She has no paranoia, psychosis, suicidal ideation, or homicidal ideation. Her motivation is good for continued care, medication compliance, and self-improvement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">... She is taking her medications regularly. She is aware of having her bipolar disorder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">... Her memory is normal. Her judgment and insight appear intact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">... [H]er illness appears stable at the moment---- She also is having no aggravation of her symptoms from seasonal changes____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-11\">Thus, for her further mental health stability I would encourage the court to at least consider \u201csponsored\u201d visitation of her children.!<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">Dr. Powell\u2019s letter then recommended to the California court that it consider ordering an evaluation of appellant \u201cwith the children to further clarify the appropriateness of the visitation or eventual custody.\u201d Appellee, relying on section 9-109(d)(3)(i) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, asserts that appellant\u2019s claim to be mentally fit for custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>and this letter constitute the introduction of this mother\u2019s mental condition by her as an element of her claim. We shall address this issue more fully as we conclude our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Most of the cases addressing this privilege, or those closely related to it, are criminal cases. We first note again what Judge Chasanow wrote in <em>Goldsmith, </em>that the rationale for the privilege is the recognition \u201cof the social importance of protecting the privacy encompassed by specified relationships.\u201d 337 Md. at 133, 651 A.2d 866. In addition to <em>Goldsmith, </em>we are guided in our resolution by a case involving the attorney-client privilege, <em>State v. Pratt, </em>284 Md. 516, 398 A.2d 421 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">In <em>Pratt, </em>a defense attorney retained a psychiatrist to examine his client, who had entered an insanity plea to the charges against her. During trial, the State presented the testimony of that psychiatrist to rebut Pratt\u2019s insanity defense. Pratt\u2019s attorney objected to the testimony of that particular psychiatrist on the grounds that it violated the attorney-client privilege. The State asserted that \u201cwhen Mrs. Pratt interposed a defense of insanity, she waived the privilege with respect to all statements she may have made to any medical expert, whether in her employ or in that of the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521, 398 A.2d 421 (footnote omitted). The Court commented in a footnote that the State\u2019s position was the equivalent of asking the Court to create a waiver of the attorney-client privilege, similar to that created by the General Assembly in section 9-109(d)(3)(i) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article and asserted by appellee in the present case, <em>\u201cif the patient introduces his mental condition </em>as an element of his claim or defense.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Although <em>Pratt </em>involved the attorney-client privilege (the psychiatrist had been employed by the attorney), the Court, responding to the State\u2019s assertion that Pratt had waived the privilege by interposing \u201ca defense of insanity,\u201d noted what appears to us to be equally true in respect to the case <em>sub </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number><em>judice. </em>It answered the question by commenting, \u201cAn additional consequence of the State\u2019s suggested waiver rule, if adopted by us, is that the defense, in essence, would be required to assist the prosecution in discharging its burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524, 398 A.2d 421. The Court further opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxU\">If, in its efforts to establish the mental responsibility of the accused following a plea of insanity, the State is permitted to utilize a psychiatrist hired by the defendant, both the defense attorney and his client will be inhibited from \u201cconsulting one or more experts, with possibly conflicting views, by the fear that in doing so [they] may be assisting the government in meeting its burden of proof on the [sanity] issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-5\"><em>Id. </em>(brackets in original). Similarly, in the case at bar, a mother\u2019s desire to seek psychiatric help in order to be a better mother, or remain a good mother, could be seriously inhibited if the records of diagnoses and treatment, which often would include information of the most sensitive nature, could be readily obtained whenever a state agency seeking to modify or terminate that parent\u2019s rights to her children alleges that she is unable to care for them properly due in part to a mental or emotional problem. Moreover, if one parent in a custody dispute could, by challenging the other parent\u2019s mental fitness, get access to the other parent\u2019s records by his or her response to the allegations, the privilege would be meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In <em>Goldsmith, </em>Judge Chasanow, after opining that \u201c[b]e-cause of the privileged nature of the records involved in the present case, the burden of proof required of the [opposing party] defendant to establish a need for disclosure may be higher than that required in <em>Zaal [v. State, </em>326 Md. 54, 602 A.2d 1247 (1992) ],\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">In <em>[Commonwealth v.] Two Juveniles </em>[397 Mass. 261, 491 N.E.2d 234 (Mass.1986) ], the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ... recognized that \u201c[i]n general, an assertion that inspection of information is needed only for a possible attack on credibility has been rejected because, if upheld, such a broad right of discovery would substantially destroy the privilege.\u201d In [Commonwealth] <em>v. Clancy, </em>[402 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Mass. 664] 524 N.E.2d 395 (Mass.1988), the ... Court ... further clarified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\">\u201cthe individual seeking to override the privilege of another bears the burden of establishing a legitimate need for the privileged information sought____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">337 Md. at 132, 651 A.2d 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellee argues on appeal, although it did not do so below, that because appellant claimed to be mentally and emotionally fit to supervise, raise, or visit with her children, it had a right to inspect her privileged past records to help determine the validity of her assertions. It, therefore, at least in part,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> would have been seeking the information (if it had sought the information in the actual court proceeding as opposed to mentioning it in a report) for the potential purpose of impeaching her assertions and countering the more recent report as to appellant\u2019s then present condition, such as Dr. Powell\u2019s report, and any future evaluations appellant agreed to undergo so long as her privilege was not breached. We repeat what Judge Chasanow stated in <em>Goldsmith:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">We cannot permit a privilege to be abrogated even at the trial stage by the mere assertion that privileged records <em>may </em>contain information relevant to credibility. To do so would virtually destroy the psychotherapist-patient privilege of crime victims. It has long been recognized that privileges, by their very nature, restrict access to information which would otherwise be disclosed. The rationale for this restriction has been our recognition of the social importance of protecting the privacy encompassed by specified relationships.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">337 Md. at 133, 651 A.2d 866 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">The appellee relies extensively on our decision in <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>98 Md.App. 348, 633 A.2d 455 (1993). We initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>note that the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Goldsmith, supra, </em>appears to some degree to conflict with some of our determinations in Reynolds. It, like Reynolds, was a criminal case in which the privilege conflicted with a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation. The present case is not a criminal case and a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation is not involved.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, in <em>Reynolds, </em>although we held that the signing of a release to permit the prosecutors to review the records did not constitute a waiver, we held that, when the prosecutor introduced the hospital records, it constituted an \u201cunqualified waiver\u201d in regard to the hospital records, and, therefore, the victim had completely waived the privilege as to those records. 98 Md.App. at 363-64, 633 A.2d 455.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Reynolds, </em>we noted that, in criminal cases, in which a constitutional right to confrontation exists, the correct procedure would be that adopted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Hamilton v. Verdow, supra. </em>While, when we wrote <em>Reynolds, Hamilton </em>appeared to state the correct procedure, that may no longer be so. <em>See Goldsmith, supra. </em>The dissent in <em>Goldsmith </em>relied in part on our reliance on <em>Hamilton </em>in <em>Reynolds </em>and the <em>Goldsmith </em>majority mentioned neither Reynolds nor Hamilton. We need not resolve the conflict between these cases (even if we were capable of it) in light of our ultimate determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">We emphasize again that <em>Reynolds </em>(and <em>Goldsmith </em>for that matter) arise out of the conflict between statutory privileges and a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront witnesses. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we are faced with the statutory privilege alone, unaffected by any exigency to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>solve a conflict of constitutional dimension arising out of the other party\u2019s constitutional rights. Montgomery County Department of Social Services has no constitutional right of confrontation. As we shall indicate, the mother\u2019s, not appellee\u2019s, constitutional rights are at issue. Because the party with the privilege, rather than the party seeking to breach it, has the constitutional right at issue here, we are able to piece together a policy in the more tailored manner of addressing a privilege alone. We mention the constitutional rights of appellant in order to note their importance. But first we need to determine the underlying type of action here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">The immediate issue of privilege arises out of a review hearing in respect to continued commitment of Matthew with, or through, the MCDSS. During this hearing, the order complained of was made. Appellant\u2019s primary focus appears to have been on her right to visit with Matthew. As far as we can discern from both sets of docket entries,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a CINA petition was first filed in December of 1994. It contained certain comments that we shall discuss, <em>infra,. </em>Ultimately, an adjudication hearing was held. It reaffirmed previous orders (orders not contained in the record before us). Subsequently, another adjudication hearing was held on January 18, 1996 [sic] (apparently January 18,1995). In that hearing, the court ordered suspension of appellant\u2019s visitation. Another adjudication hearing was then held in February of 1995. It reaffirmed several prior orders. Then, on July 17, 1996, another adjudication hearing was held before yet another judge. That judge then found Matthew to be a child in need of assistance and committed Matthew \u201cto the Montgomery County Department of Social Services for placement in foster care, visitation with the parents under \u2018the direction and supervision of MCDSS.\u2019 EXHIBITS #1 and #2, STIPULATION OF FACTS RECEIVED BY COURT.\u201d A disposition hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>was subsequently held on August 31, 1995. The commitment to MCDSS was continued. The court directed that the parents could have visitation \u201cat the discretion and under the supervision of MCDSS.\u201d On March 7, and then again on March 15,1996, review hearings were held. The court continued the commitment to MCDSS and then entered the orders that are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">At the March 15, 1996 review hearing, appellant \u201crequest[ed] that the case be transferred.\u201d Appellee objected. Appellant\u2019s counsel argued, \u201cShe would like the child removed to California. That\u2019s where she\u2019s living.\u201d The father of the child agreed to the mother\u2019s position. The child\u2019s attorney, although objecting to the mother\u2019s position, appropriately framed the issue: \u201cThe mother is essentially [requesting] a change in foster care from Maryland to California.\u201d The mother had created a minimal flower-selling business in California and provisions for extremely basic housing in the jurisdiction in which her other three children were already being supervised by the California courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">While there were several other issues asserted at that last review hearing, the primary issue was that the mother desired to have Matthew transferred to California where she lived. We, however, do not need \u2014 and essentially cannot review the appropriateness of the trial court\u2019s order on that issue, as it was not appealed to us. We note, however, that at an appellate glance, it appeared to be appropriate. The only matter appealed to us was the correctness of the trial court\u2019s order directing appellant to release her medical records. The underlying matter, however, involves the \u201ccommitment of Matthew to the MCDSS for foster home placement.\u201d Section 3-801(h) of the Court\u2019s and Judicial Proceedings Article defines \u201ccommit\u201d as \u201cmeans to transfer legal custody.\u201d Accordingly, the review hearing did involve a custody matter, even though that issue was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Appellant\u2019s parental rights are of constitutional dimension. Transfers of legal custody and changes in visitation involve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>parental rights. We noted in <em>Wagner v. Wagner, </em>109 Md.App. 1, 25, 674 A.2d 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>343 Md. 334, 681 A.2d 69 (1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM8\">[T]o be entitled to the protection of procedural due process, an individual must have a property or liberty interest warranting protection by the Fourteenth Amendment. Ms. Wagner, as a parent, has a protectible liberty interest in the care and custody of her children and when a state seeks to affect the relationship of a parent and child, the due process clause is implicated. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">We also noted that \u201c[t]he right to rear one\u2019s child has been deemed to be \u2018essential,\u2019 and encompassed within a parent\u2019s \u2018basic civil rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37, 674 A.2d 1 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">In <em>M.L.B. v. S.L.J., \u2014 </em>U.S.\u2014, \u2014, 117 S.Ct. 555, 564, 136 L.Ed.2d 473 (1996) (citations omitted; footnotes omitted), the Supreme Court recently opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">Choices about marriage, family life, and the upbringing of children are among associational rights this Court has ranked as \u201cof basic importance in our society!.]\u201d M.L.B.\u2019s case, involving the State\u2019s authority to sever permanently a parent-child bond, demands the close consideration the Court has long required when a family association so undeniably important is at stake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">The Supreme Court subsequently noted that although the Court had been divided in some respects in certain prior cases, it had been</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-10\">unanimously of the view that \u201cthe interest of parents in their relationship with their children is sufficiently fundamental to come within the finite class of liberty interests protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.... It was also the Court\u2019s unanimous view that few consequences of judicial action are so grave as the severance of natural family ties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-11\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 117 S.Ct. at 565 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">Thus, the question is: When an assertion of mental or emotional parenting limitations is made by a state agency seeking to maintain custody of a child contrary to that parent\u2019s constitutional rights to raise or visit with her child, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>that mother, by filing a present mental evaluation in order to defend herself against the allegations made by a social services agency, \u201cintroduce[ ][her] mental condition as to an element of [her] claim or defense?\u201d CJ \u00a7 9-109(d)(3)(i). We shall hold that she does not. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Appellee\u2019s Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Appellee, Montgomery County Department of Social Services, in its petition below, alleged, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">Mr. and Mrs. R are not able to provide ordinary and proper care and attention for M at this time____ [B]oth Mr. and Mrs. R have a history of emotional [weakness]; ...

Mrs. R____ Investigation at that time noted that Mrs. R had a history of mental illness; that she had experienced a post-partem psychosis and required inpatient psychiatric care____ [T]he family came to their attention in 1992 when Mrs. R experienced another postpartem psychosis and required hospitalization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-19\">On appeal, appellee asserts that appellant introduced her mental condition as part of her claim or defense. We dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>agree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is overwhelmingly clear that appellee \u201cintroduced\u201d appellant\u2019s mental condition when it initially sought a transfer of custody of Matthew and sought to maintain that transfer of custody. Appellant merely responded to that <em>introduction. </em>The specific issue to be resolved is, therefore, does such a response constitute the introduction of appellant\u2019s mental condition? <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We note again that appellant is protecting or asserting a constitutional right when she defends or participates in an action filed against her interests in respect to transfer of custody or visitation. The position asserted by appellee would, under these circumstances, force a mother to help the Montgomery County Department of Social Services defeat her constitutional right to visit or otherwise assert a mother\u2019s interest in the placement of her own children.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The privilege as to the psychotherapeutic records of a patient was first established by the enactment of Chapter 503 of the laws of 1966.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As enacted, it then included an exception providing that the presiding judge could \u201ccompel such disclosure\u201d in child custody cases, if the trial judge considered disclosure to be \u201cnecessary to a proper determination of the issue of custody.\u201d 1966 Md. Laws, Chap. 503. It also then included the exception at issue in this case. The exception as to \u201ccustody matters\u201d remained in the statute through the 1973 Special Session when Chapter 2 consolidated many statutes into the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Thereafter, the Legislature eliminated the custody exception in 1977. See 1977 Md. Laws, Chap. 684. With the exception of some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>definitional modifications in 1981, the statute has remained unchanged since 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The exception that permitted a trial judge to waive the privilege in custody cases, which, incidentally, is almost the equivalent of what occurred here, was repealed by Chapter 685 of the Laws of 1977. The proceedings in respect to that repeal, while certainly not conclusive as to legislative purpose, indicate that the Legislature did not accidentally remove that judicial power. Senator Curran, now the Attorney General, then the chairman of the Judicial Proceedings Committee, solicited input from several judges. In a letter to those judges, Senator Curran, writing for the Judicial Proceedings Committee, noted that \u201c[w]e understand the need to encourage a full and frank discussion <em>between the patient and the psychiatrist, and want to enact laws to meet this end.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The bill file contains a letter to Senator Curran from a former colleague of ours, the late Honorable Solomon Liss. In that letter, Judge Liss opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">I would be reluctant to urge compelled disclosure except as a last resort. Such an edict is not fair either to the professional person involved nor to his patient, who should be able to speak frankly without fear of disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Senator Curran also received a response from the Medical Service of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore (now the Circuit Court for Baltimore City). In that letter, Dr. Jonas Rappaport stressed the importance of protecting full and frank disclosure between patients and their physicians, noting instances in which doctors had had \u201cextreme difficulty\u201d in working with \u201cparents in psychotherapy\u201d when those parents were informed that what they, the parents, said or did in psychotherapy could be brought out in court in custody cases. He noted that several other doctors had proffered that the exception prevented needy parents from obtaining treatment and that the exclusion \u201cmay eventually place the children at a disadvantage. If their parents cannot be \u2018cured,\u2019 then the child continues to be exposed to an emotionally disturbed parent.\u201d Dr. Rappaport concluded by furnishing his opinion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>the benefits to society of having confidential and privileged treatment available to troubled parents far outweighs the limitations placed upon the court by not having such information revealed against the parents\u2019 wishes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">We realize that an after the fact review of notes in the \u201cbill file\u201d of a statute is somewhat tenuous in respect to establishing legislative purpose. Even with this limitation, however, we at least know that the Committee\u2019s purpose was \u201cto enact laws\u201d promoting \u201ca full and frank discussion between the patient and the psychiatrist.\u201d We also know that the Legislature eliminated the very exception that may, under a broad interpretation, have permitted the trial judge\u2019s actions in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Considering that the Committee\u2019s comments and solicitations, as well as the responses it received in 1977, were in connection with removing an exception that empowered judges to force parents to disclose their mental records when involved in custody disputes, we find it difficult to perceive the existence of any legislative purpose or intent that a judge should have that power when a state agency initiates and maintains an action to commit, <em>ie., </em>change the legal custody of a child, which could result in divesting both parents of certain parental rights. Because we perceive a strong legislative interest in preserving the psychiatrist-patient privilege, we shall construe the exception in section 9 \u2014 109(d)(3)(i) of the Maryland Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, so as to preserve the privilege as opposed to destroying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">We hold that the section 9 \u2014 109(d)(3)(i) exception does <em>not </em>apply when the opposing party, in this case, the Montgomery County Department of Social Services, \u201cintroduces\u201d the patient\u2019s mental condition and the patient is merely responding to the Department\u2019s claim. To hold otherwise could create absurd results in many instances. Were we to hold as appellee suggests, that the opponent of a person who has been a psychiatric patient, who has sued that person in any type of action and alleged a deficient mental condition, could force that patient either to admit the assertion by not denying it or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>waive the statutory privilege by denying the contentions of the other party. This could apply even though the agency bears the ultimate burden of proving a need to change a child\u2019s custody. It would also apply to other custody disputes, tortious actions in which a proponent alleges a mental deficiency on the part of the other party, and perhaps other actions as well. To adopt the interpretation suggested by appellee would virtually empower that agency to ignore the privilege in any case, in which it presents allegations of a mother\u2019s or father\u2019s mental instability.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Our combined judicial experience suggests that this type of allegation by such agencies is not infrequent. Were we to . legitimize appellee\u2019s positions by adopting them, the result would virtually abolish the privilege in CI\u00d1A and other parental right cases involving the various social service agencies in this State. If this privilege is to be abolished, that function should be for the legislative branch, in that this privilege is its creature, not ours. This is especially true where it is shown, \u25a0as here, that the legislative branch has abolished the provision that formerly permitted judges in custody cases to require the production of such records, in order, according to the Committee Chairperson, to \u201cencourage a full and frank discussion\u201d between patient and psychiatrist. We hasten to add, however, that what we have said should not be construed to indicate that we believe, or do not believe, that an exception should be made in these types of cases in which the best interests of the children would be well served by such an exception. What we mean to say is that question is for the Legislature that imposed the privilege in the first instance. The Legislature has available to it a much broader range of resources to draw upon in order to determine what the State\u2019s policy should be in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">We shall now resolve the remaining sub-issue: Does a litigant completely waive the privilege when she, forced to respond to an agency\u2019s assertion of her mental problems or risk losing certain rights to her children, responds by furnishing a relatively current letter as to her present condition? Obviously, those cases we have discussed heretofore do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>answer, or even suggest the answer, in cases containing the circumstances here present. We, therefore, fashion a rule to apply until, and if, the Court of Appeals or, preferably, the legislative branch, clarifies the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">We hold that in cases in which a litigant\u2019s mental condition is <em>introduced </em>by the opposing party and the litigant responds with a denial supported by a limited medical record asserting a present condition and where an attorney enters into a stipulation such as that in the case <em>sub judice </em>for an institutionalized client, the waiver of the privilege is limited to the record offered by the litigant and the testimony of the person producing the record and to any record that is included as a part of the stipulation. Under these circumstances, there is no <em>carte blanche </em>waiver of the privilege as to past records, communications, and treatment predating that evidence proffered to defend against the opposing party\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">We have fashioned a holding to apply in respect to a specific exclusion, section 9-109(d)(3)(i), under somewhat limited circumstances. We respectfully suggest, however, that either the Court of Appeals or the General Assembly should consider this matter anew. In stating this, we recognize the <em>Goldsmith </em>holding \u2014 and the dissent\u2019s position in that case. The resolution of these privilege issues in criminal cases, however, seems invariably to be connected with a defendant\u2019s right to the privileged records of others based on his constitutional rights to confrontation and not as here, a defendant\u2019s (respondent\u2019s) assertion of the privilege in order to help her defend her constitutional right to parent her child. The cases, therefore, are not, with absolute clarity, applicable. We perceive that in civil cases involving important matters relating to the well-being of children, especially those cases involving an agency\u2019s introduction of the mental condition of a parent, at least the Court of Appeals\u2019s imprimatur would be helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\">.
