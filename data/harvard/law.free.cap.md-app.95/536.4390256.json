The State filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty. After a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Howard County, Tirado was convicted of all charges except accessory after the fact. He was sentenced by a jury to life without parole for murder, twenty years for robbery, and two five year terms for the handgun violations; each sentence was consecutive to the others. Because a notice of appeal was not timely filed, our jurisdiction to decide this matter arises pursuant to the court\u2019s granting Tirado post-conviction relief in the form of a belated appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">Tirado presents the following nine issues for our review: whether the court erred when it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-12\">I. failed to grant defense counsel\u2019s requested relief for the State\u2019s discovery violation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-13\">II. limited Tirado\u2019s impeachment of witness Devarie;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-14\">III. admitted evidence of other crimes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-15\">IV. admitted Trooper Coppinger\u2019s opinion testimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>V. admitted identification testimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">VI. admitted the expert opinion of Special Agent Spaulding regarding the sequence of shots;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">VII. instructed the jury on felony murder;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">VIII. instructed the jury on armed robbery; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">IX. whether the court\u2019s cumulative errors require reversal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">The record in this case is extensive. Tirado\u2019s trial commenced on June 17, 1991, and concluded about a month later on July 18, 1991. (Beginning April 17, 1991, and ending on June 12, 1991, a total of seven days of pre-trial motions hearings were held; jury selection began on June 13, 1991.) Numerous witnesses testified at Tirado\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">On March 29, 1990, John Anderson was driving a tractor-trailer northbound on 1-95 at a speed of about seventy-two miles per hour. He and the driver of a car were \u201crunning parallel at approximately the same speed.\u201d Anderson saw a State trooper pull his police vehicle in between the tractor-trailer and the car; he then saw the trooper drop back behind the car and activate his car\u2019s emergency lights. The trooper and the driver of the car continued at the same speed for \u201capproximately five-eights of a mile.\u201d He noticed that there were two occupants in the car. When the trooper turned on his spotlight, the light \u201creflected off the rear view mirror and [lit] the driver\u2019s face up.\u201d Subsequently, in November 1990, while watching television, Anderson saw the driver of the car being escorted in handcuffs by the police. Anderson recognized Tirado as being the driver of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">Also on March 29th, Wilbur Farver was driving his truck northbound on 1-95 sometime between 3:54 and 3:56 a.m. He noticed, alongside the highway, a State trooper\u2019s vehicle with its lights on and a car stopped in front of it. Farver saw \u201ca male get out of the front right side of the trooper\u2019s car.\u201d He noticed that the male \u201cjust slowly walked up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>the car that was apparently stopped in front of the trooper.\u201d The door of the police vehicle was left open. He then saw the man open the passenger door of the car, lean inside, and talk to the person seated inside. The occupant was leaning from the driver\u2019s side to the passenger\u2019s side. He then observed the man slowly walk back to the police vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Later that morning, at around 4:00 or 5:00 a.m., Officer Robert Loproto of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department was travelling northbound on 1-95 when he observed Corporal Wolf seated in a State Police vehicle with his head \u201cslightly down.\u201d The vehicle\u2019s interior lights, emergency lights, and headlights were on. Officer Loproto stopped, walked toward the passenger side of the vehicle, and saw \u201cblood on the front seat and ... blood all over [Trooper Wolf\u2019s] face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">At about 5:15 a.m., Officer Louis Martin of the Baltimore County Police Department responded to a call for a suspected stolen vehicle discovered behind a local restaurant. He saw what he believed to be blood inside the car and on the car\u2019s exterior. He found the \u201ccharred remains of what [he] believed to be a trooper\u2019s warning book, on the ground, approximately ten feet in front of the car toward the back door of [the restaurant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">James Simms, a fingerprint expert with the Maryland State Police Department, testified that Tirado\u2019s fingerprints matched three fingerprints recovered from the driver\u2019s side of the stolen car. According to Simms, Tirado\u2019s right ring fingerprint was \u201cpositively identical in friction ridge characteristics to the blood print taken from the armrest\u201d of the car. Tirado\u2019s fingerprints were also matched to three prints recovered from the clothing store bag found in the car\u2019s back seat. The fingerprints of Tirado\u2019s accomplice, Francisco Rodriguez, were found on papers that belonged to the car\u2019s owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Sharon Dubey, a forensic serologist with the Maryland State Police, testified that, based on tests conducted on the blood stains found in the stolen car and in the police vehicle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Corporal Wolf was the sole source of the blood, and Tirado and Rodriguez were excluded as possible sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">James Kaplan, a former Maryland assistant medical examiner, and an expert in forensic pathology, performed the autopsy of Corporal Wolf. In his opinion, Corporal Wolf sustained gunshot wounds to the lips, right cheek, and back of the head. According to Kaplan, Corporal Wolf was first shot in the lips \u2014 which caused his head to droop \u2014 and was subsequently shot in the cheek.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">F.B.I. Special Agent Robert Spaulding, an expert in blood stain pattern analysis, testified that the blood stain patterns in the police vehicle\u2019s front and back seat areas were \u201cconsistent with the wounds that he suffered,\u201d but he \u201cwould not necessarily feel comfortable associating them with either particular shot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Professor Herbert Leon McDonald, also an expert in blood stain analysis, testified that \u201cboth shots were fired from outside of the door [of the trooper\u2019s car].\u201d He posited that the \u201cback seat is uniformly spattered, and if a person were in the back seat, they would have intercepted the blood.\u201d He opined that no one could have been in the back seat when the shot was fired that caused the blood spatter in the vehicle because there were \u201cno streaks or smears anywhere on the front or the back seat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Edgar Devarie (Devarie), a friend of Tirado\u2019s, testified that, during the first week of April 1990, he went to Tirado\u2019s family\u2019s house in New York City to visit Tirado and Rodriguez. Tirado told Devarie that he shot a police officer. Tirado explained to Devarie that he and Rodriguez were travelling from Virginia through Maryland in a stolen car. Tirado said that he was the driver of the car, and that he was speeding. Tirado told Devarie that he stole the car because he did not have enough money to get back to New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">According to Devarie, Tirado told him that a State trooper pulled over the stolen car, and after talking with Tirado, walked back to his vehicle with Tirado\u2019s license and regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>tration. At that point, Tirado and Rodriguez discussed who would kill the officer. Tirado said, \u2018Til do it.\u201d Rodriguez handed Tirado a .357 magnum and Tirado \u201cput it in his pants.\u201d The trooper then told Tirado and Rodriguez to come to his vehicle, and Tirado got in the front passenger seat of the police vehicle and Rodriguez got in the back. The trooper then told Rodriguez to close the door, and Rodriguez got out of the vehicle to go close the door of the stolen car. The trooper said, \u201cHey what are you doing? Where are you going?\u201d Rodriguez said he was going to close the door of the car, and the trooper said, \u201cNo, not that door, this door.\u201d Then Rodriguez got in the back seat of the car, and the trooper started to write a ticket. Tirado then pulled out the gun and shot Corporal Wolf. Tirado told Devarie that the trooper \u201cstraightened up, opened his eyes.\u201d Because \u201che didn\u2019t know where the first bullet went,\u201d Tirado shot the trooper a second time in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Tirado went on to tell Devarie that, after he shot the trooper, he took the ticket book, his driver\u2019s license, and other papers. He then \u201ccleaned up a bit and he ran.\u201d The two men got back in the stolen car and drove to the next exit and abandoned the vehicle. As they ran away, they burned Corporal Wolf\u2019s ticket book because it had Tirado\u2019s name on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Finally, Rosalinda Santos\u2019s prior recorded statements were admitted into evidence. Before Tirado and Rodriguez left for New York, Santos heard Rodriguez exclaim that \u201c[h]e was so mad that if somebody got in his way or stopped \u2014 or stopped him he would kill the person.\u201d She overheard Rodriguez say, \u201cI have nothing to lose, I\u2019m going to jail.\u201d Santos added that he said he \u201chates police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Additional facts are provided in the discussion, <em>infra, </em>where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Tirado first contends that the trial court erred when it refused to declare a mistrial, or in the alternative, strike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Devarie\u2019s testimony, or grant a continuance. Specifically, he argues that the State violated discovery rules when it failed to disclose: 1) Devarie\u2019s correct address; 2) the fact that he relocated from New York to Maryland; and, 3) promises and inducements made by the State to Devarie to secure his testimony at trial. Tirado maintains that the State was required to disclose Devarie\u2019s most recent address \u2014 1035 Woodycrest Avenue. Even though the State notified defense counsel of Devarie\u2019s 40 Mont Clair Road address, Tirado urges that the State knew Devarie \u201cnever lived at the address provided during the entire investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In his reply brief, Tirado clarifies that, although he does not contest the court\u2019s refusal to disclose Devarie\u2019s Maryland address, the State was nonetheless obligated to notify him that Devarie relocated. He suggests that the State\u2019s non-compliance with respect to its relocating Devarie without informing defense counsel, as well as promises and inducements made by the State to secure Devarie\u2019s testimony, left defense counsel surprised by the significance of Devarie\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Tirado further contends that the State\u2019s alleged discovery violations prejudiced him at trial. He complains that since he did not have the correct address, and consequently, could not locate Devarie before trial, he was unable to interview Devarie or prepare for his cross-examination. He insists that this was prejudicial because Devarie was the only witness to testify that Tirado was the gunman. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">\n<em>Non-Compliance with Discovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJ9D\">Rule 4-263(b) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">Disclosure Upon Request. \u2014 Upon request of the defendant, the State\u2019s Attorney shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">(1) Witnesses. \u2014 Disclose to the defendant the <em>name and address of each person then known whom the State intends to call as a witness </em>at the hearing or trial to prove its case in chief or to rebut alibi testimony____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Generally, \u201c[w]hen requested, the State\u2019s Attorney must give the defendant the names and addresses of each person he intends to call as a witness to prove his case in chief.\u201d <em>Coleman v. State, </em>321 Md. 586, 601, 583 A.2d 1044 (1991). \u201c \u2018The decision to compel disclosure ... is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603, 583 A.2d 1044 <em>(quoting Brooks v. State, </em>320 Md. 516, 525, 578 A.2d 783 (1990)). The Court of Appeals held in <em>Warrick v. State, </em>302 Md. 162, 173, 486 A.2d 189 (1985), \u201cthat the question of whether any sanction is to be imposed for a discovery violation, and if so what sanction, is in the first instance committed to the discretion of the trial judge, and that the exercise of that discretion includes evaluating whether the violation prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>Evans v. State, </em>304 Md. 487, 500, 499 A.2d 1261 (1985), <em>cert, denied, </em>478 U.S. 1010, 106 S.Ct. 3310, 92 L.Ed.2d 722 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>after hearing testimony and arguments regarding defense counsel\u2019s allegation that the State failed to comply with discovery, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1dp\">I don\u2019t find from the evidence that the State intended to conceal the whereabouts of this witness. In fact, the witness\u2019 [sic] own testimony was that he used the address of Montclare [sic] Road, that his dealings with the police were generally by using a phone number when he dealt with the police. I don\u2019t find that the State has intentionally tried to deprive or preclude access with this particular witness. To the extent the request is that ... I strike his testimony and/or grant a mistrial, I\u2019ll deny those requests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">He later denied defense counsel\u2019s request that the court recess at 3:00 p.m. on July 10, 1991, until 9:30 a.m. on July 11, 1991, to allow him time to talk with co-counsel who went to New York the night before to locate witnesses to impeach Devarie\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The question of whether the State violated its discovery obligations in this case is particularly troublesome. Even an unintentional violation of Rule 4-263 may require a mistrial if there is irreparable prejudice to the defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>See Evans, </em>304 Md. at 501, 499 A.2d 1261. We do, however, determine that the court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to grant a mistrial, or in the alternative, strike Devarie\u2019s testimony or grant a continuance. <em>See </em>Rule 4-263; <em>Evans, </em>304 Md. at 501, 499 A.2d 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">On December 21, 1990, defense counsel filed a specific request for the names and addresses of individuals the State intended to call as witnesses. On February 22, 1991, the State informed defense counsel that Devarie would be called as a witness, and provided an address: \u201c40 Mont Clair Road, Yonkers, NY.\u201d Although the State is under a continuing duty to disclose material information to the defendant once it has responded to requests for discovery, at no time did the State supplement that address with any other address or information with respect to Devarie\u2019s whereabouts. <em>See </em>Rule 4-263(h). Devarie\u2019s name was among at least 280 other names of individuals the State intended to call as witnesses against Tirado \u2014 undoubtedly, the defense\u2019s investigative resources were put to the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">At oral argument, defense counsel conceded that, although the address the State disclosed was not \u201cinaccurate,\u201d it was nonetheless \u201cinadequate.\u201d Indeed, there was evidence that Devarie maintained contact with the 40 Mont Clair address. Devarie testified that he lived at \u201c1035 Woodycrest\u201d (in New York City) \u201con and off\u201d for three years, and that he had not lived at 40 Mont Clair for a \u201cyear and a half.\u201d When pressed by defense counsel, he clarified that, before June 1991, he lived at 1035 Woodycrest. Devarie considered 1035 Woodycrest his current residence, but would stay at 40 Mont Clair from \u201ctime to time.\u201d He testified that since \u201cfamily\u201d resided at 40 Mont Clair, he would \u201calways go there,\u201d and that his family would relay messages to him from that address.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Devarie used a post office box as his mailing address. Therefore, even though the State failed to disclose the 1035 Woodycrest address, assuming it had the address, Devarie\u2019s most accurate mailing address was a post office box, not 1035 Woodycrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Regardless, we hold that the address the State gave defense counsel was sufficient. Since Devarie did not sever ties with the 40 Mont Clair residence, he still could have been contacted at that address.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Moreover, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the State actually knew of any address other than 40 Mont Clair. Devarie testified that he did not give the State his 1035 Woodycrest address. We disagree, therefore, with Tirado\u2019s assertion that the State knew during discovery that Devarie \u201cnever lived at the address provided during the entire investigation.\u201d We recognize that, because the State spoke with Devarie by telephone during its investigation, it could have traced the calls to ensure that Devarie gave it his correct address. Devarie also testified that the police did visit him at that address. We conclude, however, that the State\u2019s disclosure was adequate \u2014 it was the only address Devarie gave the State, and he maintained contact with the residents at that location. Further, State troopers moved Devarie from the Woodycrest home in New York to Maryland in June 1991 contemporaneously with the commencement of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Contact with Devarie was generally made at locations other than his current residence. In the beginning of the summer of 1990, a year before Tirado\u2019s trial, Devarie met with Sergeant Coppinger at a cousin\u2019s home. The next meeting between Devarie and Sergeant Coppinger occurred on a street in New York. A couple days later, Devarie spoke with Sergeant Coppinger over the telephone. At the end of the summer, Devarie was transported to Maryland to meet with the police and assistant state\u2019s attorneys. He subsequently met with the assistant state\u2019s attorneys \u201cabout ten times\u201d in Maryland before trial, and again met with them after they relocated him to Maryland. Devarie and Sergeant Coppinger both testified that the State made <em>arrangements </em>for the relocation three months before trial, but his <em>actual relocation </em>did not occur until June 1991 \u2014 at the start of the trial. The summons the State mailed to secure his attendance at trial was mailed to the 40 Mont <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Clair address, and as discussed, <em>supra, </em>the State disclosed that address long before he relocated. To the extent his testimony was the result of an inducement, which the State conceded during oral argument, this does not support Tirado\u2019s contention that Devarie was otherwise unavailable to the defense \u2014 the State did not attempt to hide this witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Our conclusion that the State complied with discovery is further supported by defense counsel\u2019s lack of diligence visa-vis its efforts to locate Devarie. Defense counsel proffered that the last time they attempted to locate Devarie was on June 14 and 21, 1991 \u2014 after the jury was selected and then later when trial commenced. Defense counsel never did disclose, in the record, when they <em>first </em>tried to locate Devarie. The only dates that appear in the record on which the defense attempted to locate Devarie were the 14th and 21st of June 1991. They left messages at his 40 Mont Clair address, but Devarie testified that he never got them. The State should have disclosed Devarie\u2019s new address. Yet, the State proffered that \u201cat least on one occasion [defense counsel] wanted a more current address\u201d of another witness, but that they did not request the same for Devarie. Defense counsel did not issue Devarie a summons, as they did other witnesses, to secure his attendance at trial. Defense counsel may have been surprised by Devarie\u2019s testimony, but we are not persuaded that they made a diligent effort to locate him before the trial. This point is further buttressed by the fact that Tirado and Devarie were friends. To the extent the State could have better assisted the defense in locating Devarie, the defendant was \u201cin as good a position as the State, or for that matter a better one\u201d to reveal the existence of a more recent address. <em>See Middleton v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 286, 290, 431 A.2d 734, <em>cert, denied, </em>291 Md. 779 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Tirado next complains that the court improperly restricted his impeachment of Devarie. He argues that the court erred when it 1) refused the out-of-court statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>a third party (Napoleone) \u2014 offered in the form of a question posed by defense counsel \u2014 that contradicted Devarie\u2019s testimony; and, 2) denied counsel\u2019s request for a one or two week continuance to allow defense counsel time to secure Napoleone\u2019s attendance at trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The relevant portion of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Devarie is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">[Defense counsel]: Did you ever read any newspaper articles about this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">[Devarie]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">[Defense counsel]: Did you ever see any wanted posters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_C\">[Devarie]: I didn\u2019t read it, they just showed me a clipping but I didn\u2019t look at it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">[Defense counsel]: Who showed you a clipping?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZY\">[Devarie]: [Napoleone], from the pharmacy in Hunt\u2019s Point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-10\">[Defense counsel]: Did you read the clipping?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-11\">[Devarie]: No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-12\">[Defense counsel]: You didn\u2019t read any facts about the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-13\">[Devarie]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-14\">* # * * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJx\">[Defense counsel]: Well at that point when you spoke to [Napoleone], you didn\u2019t believe that [Tirado] had done this, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-16\">[Devarie]: Nope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-17\">[Defense counsel]: So wouldn\u2019t you want to kind of read it to verify your thoughts or lack of thoughts or questions in your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-18\">[Devarie]: Nope, because the second he told me about it, I believed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-19\">[Defense counsel]: The second that [Napoleone] told you about what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-20\">[Devarie]: That [Tirado], when I first got to the pharmacy he told me, do you know about [Tirado] and I said yeah he\u2019s in jail and he said no, no, not that, about that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>killed a cop and I said oh and then he went to show me the clipping. I just looked and that was it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Defense counsel proceeded to ask Devarie, \u201cIf I were to tell you that that man\u2019s name as we\u2019ve discussed is [Napoleone] and that he denies that conversation \u2014[?]\u201d After the State objected, defense counsel proffered that his co-counsel spoke with Napoleone and that Napoleone told him that he \u201cnever even heard of the whole incident until this morning.\u201d The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">I\u2019ll sustain the objection. Again ... if the predicate is that ...

The court did not abuse its discretion when it restricted defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination because it required that Devarie assume a fact \u2014 that Napoleone denied the conversation \u2014 not otherwise in evidence. In addition, the question posed by defense counsel was based on hearsay, and thus, irrespective of the reason that it assumed a fact not yet in evidence, was properly excluded. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 802.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Tirado argues that he was entitled to a continuance because the State failed to \u201cprovide an address\u201d for Devarie, he was otherwise unwilling to cooperate with defense counsel, and as a result defense counsel was unaware of the importance of Napoleone\u2019s testimony. As early as February 22, 1991, defense counsel knew that the State intended to call Devarie as a witness, and the State <em>did </em>provide defense counsel Devarie\u2019s address. Devarie\u2019s testimony\u2014 in which he explained that he didn\u2019t believe Tirado actually committed a murder until Napoleone talked to him \u2014 took place on July 9th and 10th, and co-counsel spoke with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Napoleone the morning of July 10th. Defense counsel sought a continuance on July 15th \u2014 five days after initially making contact with Napoleone, and near the close of the trial. Defense counsel conceded that the petition, which is necessary to compel Napoleone\u2019s attendance at trial, had not yet been filed in the New York courts. <em>See </em>Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 9-303 (1989); <em>see also Breeden v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 481, 622 A.2d 160 (1993). Thus, given the additional fact that defense counsel was made aware of the importance of Napoleone\u2019s testimony no later than July 10th, and still on July 15th had not filed the necessary petition to compel Napoleone\u2019s appearance, we conclude that defense counsel did not make a diligent effort to secure Napoleone\u2019s attendance. We hold that the court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Tirado\u2019s request for a continuance. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>237 Md. 283, 288, 206 A.2d 138 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Tirado maintains that the court erred when it admitted evidence of his past criminal conduct during the State\u2019s redirect examination of Devarie. When defense counsel asked what type of work Tirado had done since he left his prior employment (Tirado was a cadet at the police academy for a couple months), Devarie testified that he had done \u201cnothing legal.\u201d Counsel then attempted to impeach Devarie\u2019s credibility by asking if he was involved with Tirado when he committed the illegal activities. On redirect, the State asked Devarie what Tirado did after the police academy, and Devarie replied, \u201cSell drugs and rob spots.\u201d Thus, Tirado suggests that defense counsel could not have \u201copened the door\u201d to the State\u2019s subsequent inquiry since the State was not prejudiced by the testimony. Further, Tirado claims he was unfairly prejudiced by Devarie\u2019s testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\u201cRedirect examination is restricted to the scope of the subjects addressed on cross-examination and rehabilitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>of the witnesses] credibility after impeachment____\u201d <em>See </em>McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 611.1; <em>see Mills v.

We conclude that the court was correct when it allowed the State to question Devarie about Tirado\u2019s prior illegal conduct since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>defense counsel opened the door during cross-examination to such testimony. <em>See </em>McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 611.1. Devarie\u2019s specific testimony was in response to the same question previously asked by defense counsel. <em>See Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 716, 415 A.2d 830 (1980) (party may waive objection to admissibility of evidence by allowing similar evidence to be admitted without objection, or by giving testimony which confirms the evidence objected to). Moreover, we find that the State properly sought during redirect to rehabilitate Devarie from any suggestion during cross-examination that he participated with Tirado in illegal activity. We hold that the evidence was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Even if evidence of other crimes committed by Tirado was improper, we conclude that the error, if any, was not prejudicial. <em>Cf. Ross v. State, </em>276 Md. 664, 674, 350 A.2d 680 (1976); <em>Cook v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 122, 131, 578 A.2d 283 (1990), <em>cert, denied, </em>321 Md. 502, 583 A.2d 276 (1991). The court instructed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">In this case [Devarie] testified and I permitted [him] to testify concerning certain prior conduct of [Tirado], ... which is not the subject of the charges in this case. Such evidence was allowed in this case solely on the issue of establishing [Devarie\u2019s] knowledge or lack of knowledge of [Tirado\u2019s] employment during a certain period of time and you\u2019re permitted to consider such evidence solely for that purpose. You may not consider such prior conduct, that is conduct which [Tirado] is not charged, as tending to show in any other way [his] guilt for the offenses for which he is now on trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The jury was directed to consider the testimony only as to Devarie\u2019s knowledge of Tirado\u2019s employment, or lack thereof, after he left the police academy. Further, the tainted evidence of Tirado\u2019s past illegal acts did not necessarily contribute to Tirado\u2019s conviction since there was evidence that Tirado himself boasted that he killed Corporal Wolf. Thus, we see no harmful effect as a result of the court\u2019s allowing the testimony. <em>But cf. Savoy v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 241, 250-55, 494 A.2d 957 (1985) (error not harmless where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>tainted evidence \u2014 that an officer previously arrested the defendant on drug charges \u2014 portrayed defendant as a \u201cbad man\u201d that may have \u201ctilted balance\u201d against him on a key issue \u2014 whether he fled an arrest or intentionally drove his car into the officer).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Tirado next suggests that the court erred when it admitted, during cross-examination, Sergeant Coppinger\u2019s opinion that Tirado fired the fatal shots and that Devarie\u2019s testimony was consistent with the results of his investigation. Tirado claims the testimony was inadmissible hearsay, and that it improperly bolstered Devarie\u2019s testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">On direct examination, defense counsel questioned Sergeant Coppinger regarding his investigation of Corporal Wolf\u2019s murder, and specifically why he chose not to preserve Devarie\u2019s statements. The following inquiry then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">[Sergeant]: Well, for one, there weren\u2019t too many questions asked. I asked him what happened and he just went in a narrative in such detail and so to the point on what happened that \u2014 that I had no doubt in my mind that what he was telling me was correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">[Defense counsel]: By this time, you had your \u2014 own theory as to what happened, isn\u2019t that correct? [Sergeant]: There were a lot of theories of what happened and there\u2019s probably still a lot of theories as to what happened. I had all kinds of theories, I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">\u2021 # Sfc S]! $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">[Defense counsel]: I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m asking. You had all kinds of theories as to who was the shooter, the person who fired the fatal shots?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-12\">[Sergeant]: No, I \u2014 I\u2014I think I had it pretty well set in my mind since April 11th of 1990 who fired the fatal shot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP6T\">On cross-examination, the following colloquy between the State and Sergeant Coppinger ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>[State]: Sergeant Coppinger, who, in your mind, fired the fatal shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">[Sergeant Coppinger]: Eric Tirado, the Defendant seated at defense table in the black and gray sweater.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">* <em>* </em>* Hi * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">[State]: Sergeant Coppinger, is the reason that there was no doubt in your mind that the information from Edgar Devarie was correct is that that information was consistent with the results of your investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\"><em>Hi </em>SH <em>* </em>Si* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">[Sergeant Coppinger]: It was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">We conclude that the State\u2019s inquiry on cross-examination was well within the scope of defense counsel\u2019s direct examination of the officer. <em>See </em>McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 611.1 (\u201cMaryland follows the prevailing American practice of generally limiting cross-examination to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness. Under this rule, counsel always may cross-examine an opponent\u2019s witness in order to impeach the witness, but is entitled to ask substantive questions on cross only in the course of further inquiry into the points brought up on that witnesses] direct examination.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the officer\u2019s opinion testimony into evidence. <em>See Winkles v. State, </em>40 Md.App. 616, 622-23, 392 A.2d 1173 (1978), <em>cert, denied, </em>284 Md. 751 (1979) (\u201c \u2018[T]he admissibility of expert testimony is a matter largely within the discretion of the trial court and its action will seldom constitute a ground for reversal\u2019, notwithstanding that \u2018the court[ ] ... may be reversed if it is found[ ] ... [that] the trial court clearly abused its discretion.\u2019 \u201d). Furthermore, the court allowed the testimony for the limited purpose of establishing <em>why the officer chose not to preserve Devarie\u2019s statement, </em>and not for its truth. Thus, the statement was not inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Moreover, the jury may draw its own conclusion as to what, if any, weight to give the officer\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>40 Md.App. at 623, 392 A.2d 1173; <em>see also Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 660, 612 A.2d 258 (1992). <em>But see Bohnert v. State, </em>312 Md. 266, 278-79, 539 A.2d 657 (1988) (expert opinion of social worker in child sexual abuse case was erroneously admitted because it was \u201ctantamount to a declaration ... that the child was telling the truth and that [the defendant] was lying.\u201d); <em>Cook, </em>84 Md.App. at 138-44, 578 A.2d 283 (probative value outweighed by prejudice where officer rendered opinion essentially as to defendants\u2019 guilt and factual basis was weak).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Tirado further contends that the court erred when it admitted Special Agent Spauldings\u2019s expert opinion regarding the sequence of shots \u2014 that the shot to Corporal Wolf\u2019s mouth preceded the shot to the cheek. He claims that no adequate basis for his opinion was established because it was based upon the autopsy report of another expert, Dr. Kaplan. He insists that Special Agent Spaulding\u2019s testimony was prejudicial since it bolstered Devarie\u2019s testimony that Tirado told him the sequence of the shots he fired. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">During its case in chief, the State called F.B.I. Special Agent Spaulding, an expert in blood stain pattern analysis, to testify about the sequence of the shots fired. Defense counsel objected and argued that the State did not establish the basis for his opinion. The court allowed the question, but it also ruled that it would grant relief, if appropriate, after the witness responded to the question. The agent stated his opinion, and defense counsel renewed his objection. The court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">Well his basis for relying on that fact, I assume, is information he obtained from someone else. I don\u2019t know that. But he\u2019s also said from his assessment of the blood stains that he found in the area the [sic] he\u2019s concluded that the second shot would have suffered \u2014 would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>caused additional spattering and I\u2019ll overrule the objection, its [sic] in. I think he\u2019s sufficiently qualified to render an opinion. Its [sic] the subject of cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">\u201c[A] trial judge is given broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony. Seldom will the decision in this regard constitute grounds for reversal.\u201d <em>Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 43, 542 A.2d 1258 (1988); <em>see also </em>McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 702.1 (\u201cthe standard for the admissibility of expert evidence is whether the finder of fact can receive appreciable help from an expert on the subject matter\u201d). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the court determined that Special Agent Spaulding relied on his own expertise, and not merely the autopsy report, when he gave his opinion as to the sequence of the shots. Special Agent Spaulding and Dr. Kaplan conferred in reaching their opinions, but the agent\u2019s opinion as to the sequence of the shots fired by Tirado was based on his independent assessment of the evidence, including the blood stains in the police vehicle. Indeed, when the witness was asked to explain the basis for his opinion, he responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">The second shot would have caused a pistoning effect to some extent where blood would have been expelled from the mouth. Blood would have blown back toward the shooter from the second shot on the passenger\u2019s seat. This is also taken into consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Nothing in the record warrants a conclusion that the court abused its discretion when it admitted the testimony into evidence. <em>See Simmons, </em>313 Md. at 43, 542 A.2d 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">Tirado next contends that Anderson\u2019s extrajudicial identification of Tirado was suggestive and unreliable. He asserts that the court erred when it denied counsel\u2019s motion to suppress the television identification and subsequent in-court identification. Tirado failed to show that Anderson\u2019s extrajudicial identification was the result of State action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Anderson\u2019s identification of Tirado as the driver of the car took place gratuitously \u2014 he identified Tirado when he observed him on his television screen in his home. <em>See Brockington v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 165, 178-74, 582 A.2d 568 (1990). Moreover, \u201c[ojnce identification evidence is deemed admissible as a matter of law, its reliability becomes an issue of fact to be resolved by the jury. Any uncertainty expressed by a witness regarding his or her identification affects the weight placed on that evidence and not the issue of admissibility.\u201d <em>Barrow v. State, </em>59 Md.App. 169, 186, 474 A.2d 967 (1984). Thus, the court was correct when it ruled that defense counsel\u2019s claim was without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">VII. &amp; VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">We address Tirado\u2019s next two contentions together; both involve the question of erroneous jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Tirado complains that the court erred when it refused to incorporate his requested instructions on felony murder and robbery. Specifically, he argues that the court erroneously failed to: 1) elaborate on the \u201cnexus\u201d between felony murder and robbery; and, 2) instruct the jury that Tirado must have intended permanently to deprive Corporal Wolf of the ticket book rather than to facilitate an escape. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">\n<em>Felony Murder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A4Y\">Rule 4-325(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">The court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding. The court may give its instructions orally or, with the consent of the parties, in writing instead of orally. <em>The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-11\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the court instructed the jury that: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>In order to convict the defendant of first degree felony murder, the state must prove, one, that the defendant or another individual participating in the crime with the defendant committed a robbery[,] ... secondly that the defendant or another individual participating in the crime killed Corporal Wolf, and third that the act resulting in the death of Corporal Wolf occurred during the commission of the robbery. Felony murder does not require the state to prove that the defendant intended to kill the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Defense counsel requested the court to instruct the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">[i]f you find that Francisco Rodriguez murdered Corporal Wolf prior to and independent of any acts and intentions of Mr. Tirado to aid and abet Mr. Rodriguez in the taking of the ticket book to conceal the murder, you may not convict Mr. Tirado of murder. Then to clarify, in other words, this is an alternative instruction we asked for. In other words if you\u2019re not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Eric Tirado murdered Corporal Wolf, and you believe that Francisco Rodriguez murdered Corporal Wolf and that Eric Tirado did not aid or abet him that the murder did not take place during a planned robbery scheme, then you must find Eric Tirado not guilty of murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The court\u2019s instruction fairly covered Tirado\u2019s requested instruction on the \u201cnexus\u201d requirement. <em>See </em>Rule 4-325(c). The court\u2019s instruction mirrors the pattern jury instruction on felony murder. <em>See Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction </em>4:17.7 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">\n<em>Robbery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">In order to convict the defendant of robbery with a dangerous weapon, the state must prove ... the taking ... and carrying away of property from someone else or from that person\u2019s presence and control and its [sic] a taking by force or threat of force with the intent to steal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>the property____ [T]he state must prove, one, that the defendant took the property from the victim, in this case Trooper Wolf is alleged, two, that the defendant took the property by force or threat of force, three, that the defendant intended to steal the property, that is to <em>deprive the owner or the victim of the property permanently, </em>and, four, that the defendant committed the robbery by using a dangerous weapon. For a robbery to occur there must be a taking and a removal with the <em>intent to permanently deprive the owner </em>of the property....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">Tirado requested the court to instruct the jury that: [I]f the jury finds that when Eric Tirado and/or Francisco Rodriguez removed Corporal Wolfs ticket book from his police vehicle that they merely intended [to remove] evidence of their identity from the scene of a prior crime and the verdict should be not guilty of robbery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The instruction given by the court was identical to the pattern jury instruction on robbery with a dangerous weapon. <em>See id. </em>4:28, 4:28.1. Again, the court\u2019s instruction fairly covered Tirado\u2019s requested instruction with respect to the question of intent. Thus, we perceive no error with either instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Tirado finally argues that the court\u2019s cumulative errors require reversal. Our disposition of each of the alleged cumulative errors makes it unnecessary for us to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
