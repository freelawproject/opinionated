He had been shot once in the head. The body was lying next to his automobile with the door open and the engine running. Found inside the car were $310 in cash, two pagers, several pieces of paper with \u201cinitials or names and phone numbers\u201d on them, and numerous small bags of cocaine. On Johnson\u2019s person was an additional $130 in cash. At trial, Detective Roger Irvin of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department testified that he arrested co-defendant Perry Lee on January 11, 1990 and took the following statement from him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">On January 6th, 1990 me, Anthony, Ryan went out in my father\u2019s gold Honda. Ryan had his father\u2019s D.C. Police gun. We were going to rob a dope dealer. Anthony had the gun. We went around Dodge Park Apartments. There was no one out so we decided to leave. When I saw a car enter the apartment, myself and Ryan were walking on the sidewalk. Anthony was about 15 feet in the street. That\u2019s when the car came back and Anthony said, \u201cAre you looking?\u201d I could not hear what the person said in the car. Then Anthony said \u201cGet on\u2014 get the fuck out or on.\u201d The car stood for 30 seconds, then pulled in and parked. A male got out the car. He then reached back in the car and hit the horn and turned to Anthony and said putting his hands in the air \u201cI\u2019m the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>biggest dealer around here.\u201d Anthony then said, \u201cNo, fuck, you\u2019re not,\u201d and shot him. Anthony then ran. Me and Ryan walked away. I could not believe he had done that. I then got in my car, pick up Anthony, Ryan and talk about it and then dropped Ryan off and dropped Anthony off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">[This is followed by:] Question number one, ... \u201cWhat is Anthony\u2019s name?\u201d His answer, \u201cAnthony Brady Weston.\u201d Question number two, \u201cWhat is Ryan\u2019s name?\u201d Answer, \u201cRyan O\u2019Neil Wilson.\u201d Question number three, \u201cWhere does Anthony live?\u201d Answer, \u201cIt\u2019s on Walkerton in Lanham, Maryland.\u201d Question number four, \u201cWhere does Ryan live?\u201d Answer, \u201cIt\u2019s off of Hill Road somewhere.

There were a couple people out there. They said that they did not have anything. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>were leaving. Me and Ryan were on the sidewalk. Anthony was ten to fifteen feet behind us and he was in the street. That\u2019s when a car came in. The car went down about three buildings and it looked like he was dropping somebody off. Meanwhile, we were calling Anthony and saying, \u2018Come on, Anthony, let\u2019s go.\u2019 The car came back and Anthony said, \u2018Are you looking for something?\u2019 He said that the \u2014 he said that to the guy in the car. I couldn\u2019t hear what the guy said. The car pulled in front of the building where he was shot at. The guy got out of the car. He was rolling down his window. When he was doing this he reached back in the car and blew the horn three times. He was facing the building. Anthony was behind him. The guy turned around and threw his hands in the air and said, \u2018I\u2019m the biggest hustler around here.\u2019 And Anthony said, \u2018No, you\u2019re not. I am.\u2019 The whole time the gun was at his head. At first the guy hit the gun away and then Anthony shot the gun and then Anthony run down the street to the 25 Hour store. I walked to the car. Ryan left. He walked towards the store. I drove and picked up Ryan first and then Anthony. We talked driving home and I asked Anthony why he did that. He didn\u2019t say why he did it. I dropped Ryan off, then Anthony at their homes.\u201d My next question was, \u201cWhat happened to the gun?\u201d His answer was, \u201cAnthony gave it to Ryan. I don\u2019t know what Ryan did with the gun.\u201d The next question was, \u201cHow many times did Anthony shoot the black male on Dodge Park Road?\u201d His answer, \u201cOnce.\u201d Question number sixteen, \u201cDid you tell anybody about this incident?\u201d His answer, \u201cMy girlfriend. I don\u2019t want to tell you her name.\u201d Question number seventeen, \u201cDo you remember what Anthony was wearing that night?\u201d His answer, \u201cHe was wearing a blue Dallas coat and a pair of jeans.\u201d Question number eighteen, \u201cWhat did you have on that night?\u201d His answer, \u201cA gray coat, blue jeans and some boots.\u201d Question- number nineteen, \u201cHow about Ryan?\u201d His answer, \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Question number twenty, \u201cDid the guy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Anthony have any type of weapon?\u201d Answer, \u201cFrom the distance that I was at, no.\u201d Question number twenty-one, \u201cHow far back from Anthony were you when he shot the black male?\u201d His answer, \u201cApproximately ten to fifteen feet.\u201d Question number twenty-two, \u201cDid Anthony take anything from the black male that he shot?\u201d His answer was, \u201cNo.\u201d Question number twenty-three, \u201cDid you waive your rights freely and knowingly?\u201d His answer, \u201cYes. It was something that had to be done.\u201d Question number twenty-four, \u201cIs the statement accurate as to what you told me?\u201d His answer, \u201cIt can\u2019t get no better than it is.\u201d Question number twenty-five, \u201cIs this the truth?\u201d His answer, \u201cTo be honest the honest to God truth.\u201d Question number twenty-six, \u201cAre you under the influence of any drug or narcotic?\u201d His answer, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Special Agent Douglas Reardon of the Virginia State Police testified that he had arrested appellant on January 11, 1990. Appellant was interviewed in the dean\u2019s office of St. Paul\u2019s College in Lawrenceville, Virginia, where he was a student. Appellant made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">On Friday night or Saturday morning this happened 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. Anthony Weston, Perry Lee and me together we went by a friend\u2019s house, but I think he had moved. No one answered the door. His name was David Brewington. Within five seconds Anthony pulled a gun and shot the gun. The man that got shot said, \u201cI\u2019m the baddest guy around,\u201d and Anthony said, \u201cNo, I am.\u201d Anthony pulled the gun and the man smacked the gun away and then Anthony shot him. The car was parked a block away. Anthony gave me the gun when we got into the car. We dropped Anthony off at home. No, they dropped me off first. I took the gun in the house and put it back into my father\u2019s room in the closet in a cardboard box on the shelf. As far as I know the gun is still there. I had nuthin\u2019 [sic] to do with the shooting. It was not planned. I had not even spoke to the man. It was stupid what he did. Anthony said the man hit the gun and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>went off,, but I saw Anthony bring the gun back to the man and shoot him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Appellant gave a second statement at the Sheriffs Department, of which Agent Reardon made written notes, and appellant signed. That statement was almost exactly the same as appellant\u2019s first statement. Agent Reardon added that the appellant later related to him that \u201cthey had been out robbing drug dealers that night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Detective Daniel Smart of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department testified that he also interviewed the appellant on January 11 and took the following statement from him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">\u201cOn January 6th, 1990 around 3:00 to 4:00 a.m. when outside of some apartments in Landover, Maryland Perry Lee and I were walking down the side of the parking lot when two gentlemen began to argue. Anthony Weston pulled out a gun and shot a man. Then Perry and I proceeded to leave as Anthony Weston began running down the street with the gun. Then we got in the car and went home.\u201d The remainder of the statement is question and answer in my handwriting.

Taylor testified that on January 11, 1990, he and other members of the police department entered the residence of appellant\u2019s parents at 508 Millwoof Drive in Capitol Heights and retrieved a gun from a box in a bedroom closet. The weapon was a Smith and Wesson service revolver, blue steel with a brown handle, stamped with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>seal of the Metropolitan Police Department, Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">DISCUSSION OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Appellant asseverates that the trial court erred in allowing into evidence the confession of a non-testifying accomplice in a case in which appellant was implicated in the crimes. Pre-trial, appellant and his co-defendant, Perry Lee, both moved to suppress their respective confessions on the basis that they were coerced. The ruling as to each was that the confessions would be admitted. Subsequently, when the State began to introduce Lee\u2019s confession, both counsel objected. Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that Lee\u2019s statement \u201churts my client also.\u201d The objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The law is well established that ordinarily the confession of an accomplice may not be introduced at his and another\u2019s joint trial when the confession implicates the latter in the crime as well as the former, and the former is not available for cross-examination, despite an instruction to the jury to disregard the implicating confession against the co-defendant. Such hearsay confessions of an accomplice that incriminate defendants are presumptively unreliable. <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). The Supreme Court has held, however, that the confession of a non-testifying co-defendant may be admitted where the circumstances of the confession provide indicia of reliability, and the co-defendants\u2019 confessions are significantly interlocking to rebut the presumption of unreliability. <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 544-546, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 2064-65, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The facts of <em>Bruton v. United States, supra, </em>are relatively straightforward. Bruton and his co-defendant Evans were tried jointly before a jury on the charge of armed postal robbery. At trial, although Evans elected not to take the stand, a postal inspector testified that Evans had confessed orally to the robbery and had implicated Bruton. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>The trial judge instructed the jury that it should consider Evans\u2019 confession solely in determining Evans\u2019 guilt, but that it should be disregarded when considering Bruton\u2019s involvement because it constituted inadmissible hearsay against him. Evans and Bruton both appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. That court set aside Evans\u2019 conviction on the ground that the oral confession should not have been received against him but affirmed Bruton\u2019s conviction in view of the trial judge\u2019s instructions. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the Court held that because of the substantial risk that the jury, despite instructions to the contrary, looked to the incriminating extrajudicial statements in determining Bruton\u2019s guilt, the admission of Evans\u2019 confession in the joint trial violated Bruton\u2019s right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. In doing so, the Court overruled its prior holding in <em>Delli Paoli v. United States, </em>352 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 294, 1 L.Ed.2d 278 (1957). The basic premise of <em>Delli Paoli </em>was that it is \u201creasonably possible for the jury to follow\u201d sufficiently clear instructions to disregard the confessor\u2019s extrajudicial statement that his co-defendant participated with him in committing the crime. 352 U.S. at 239, 77 S.Ct. at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">In <em>Lee v. Illinois, supra, </em>Millie Lee and her boyfriend, Edwin Thomas, charged with committing a double murder, were tried jointly in a bench trial at which neither defendant testified. On the eve of trial, the attorneys for both defendants withdrew their motions for severance and for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In finding Lee guilty of both murders, the trial judge expressly relied on portions of her co-defendant\u2019s confession, particularly with respect to the court\u2019s rejection of Lee\u2019s assertions that she had not participated in the murder of one of the victims (Odessa, a friend of Lee\u2019s aunt) and that she had acted either in self-defense or under intense and sudden passion in killing the other victim, her aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">On appeal, the Supreme Court determined that, although the confessions overlapped to a great extent in their factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>recitations, they clearly diverged with respect to Lee\u2019s participation in the planning of her aunt\u2019s death, her assistance in the murder of the other victim, and factual circumstances relevant to the couple\u2019s premeditation. In remanding the matter to the trial court for its review as to harmlessness, in light of other evidence, the Court rejected the Illinois court\u2019s contention that the circumstances surrounding the confession rebutted the presumption that the co-defendant\u2019s statement could be trusted as regards Lee\u2019s participation in the murders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court also rejected Illinois\u2019 second basis for establishing reliability, namely, that because Lee\u2019s and Thomas\u2019 confessions \u201cinterlocked\u201d on some points, Thomas\u2019 confession should be deemed trustworthy in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Justice Brennan, writing on behalf of the Court, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">Obviously, when co-defendants\u2019 confessions are identical in all material respects, the likelihood that they are accurate is significantly increased. But a confession is not necessarily rendered reliable simply because some of the facts it contains \u201cinterlock\u201d with the facts in the defendant\u2019s statement---- If those portions of the codefendant\u2019s purportedly \u201cinterlocking\u201d statement which bear to any significant degree on the defendant\u2019s participation in the crime are not thoroughly substantiated by the defendant\u2019s own confession, the admission of the statement poses too serious a threat to the accuracy of the verdict to be countenanced by the Sixth Amendment. In other words, when the discrepancies between the statements are not insignificant, the codefendant\u2019s confession may not be admitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">In this case, the confessions overlap in their factual recitations to a great extent. However, they clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>diverge with respect to Lee\u2019s participation in the planning of her aunt\u2019s death, Lee\u2019s facilitation of the murder of Odessa, and certain factual circumstances relevant to the couple\u2019s premeditation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">* * * * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">The subjects upon which these two confessions do not \u201cinterlock\u201d cannot in any way be characterized as irrelevant or trivial. The discrepancies between the two go to the very issues in dispute at trial: the roles played by the two defendants in the killing of Odessa, and the question of premeditation in the killing of Aunt Beedie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">In sum, we are not convinced that there exist sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability,\u201d flowing from either the circumstances surrounding the confession or the \u201cinterlocking\u201d character of the confessions, to overcome the weighty presumption against the admission of such uncross-examined evidence. We therefore hold that on the record before us, there is no occasion to depart from the time-honored teaching that a co-defendant\u2019s confession inculpating the accused is inherently unreliable, and that convictions supported by such evidence violate the constitutional right of confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-9\"><em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. at 545-46, 106 S.Ct. at 2064-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">We next examine the Court\u2019s treatment of the confrontation issue in <em>Cruz v. New York, </em>481 U.S. 186, 107 S.Ct. 1714, 95 L.Ed.2d 162 (1987). The question facing it was whether the holding in <em>Bruton </em>applies where the defendant\u2019s own confession, corroborating that of his co-defendant, is introduced against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">At the joint trial of the appellant Cruz and his brother for the felony murder of a gas station attendant, the trial court allowed the State, over objection, to introduce the brother\u2019s videotaped confession that he had killed the attendant who had just shot the appellant. The brother did not himself testify, and the court warned the jury that the brother\u2019s confession was not to be used against the appellant. The State also called a witness who testified about a conversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>tion with the appellant that recited essentially the same facts as the brother\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"AuN\">The New York Court of Appeals in <em>Cruz </em>affirmed appellant\u2019s conviction, adopting the reasoning of the plurality opinion in <em>Parker v. Randolph, </em>442 U.S. 62, 99 S.Ct. 2132, 60 L.Ed.2d 713 (1979), that <em>Bruton </em>did not require the brother\u2019s confession to be excluded because the appellant had himself confessed and his confession \u201cinterlocked\u201d with that of his brother\u2019s. The four remaining justices participating in <em>Parker, </em>however, disagreed. They subscribed to the view expressed by Justice Blackmun that introduction of Parker\u2019s own interlocking confession might, in some cases, render the violation of the Confrontation Clause harmless but could not cause introduction of the nontestifying co-defendant\u2019s confession not to constitute a violation. The Supreme Court in <em>Cruz </em>adopted the approach by Justice Blackmun and remanded the matter. Writing on behalf of the Court in <em>Cruz, </em>Justice Scalia stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">We hold that, where a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession incriminating the defendant is not directly admissible against the defendant, see <em>Lee v. Illinois, supra, </em>the Confrontation Clause bars its admission at their joint trial, even if the jury is instructed not to consider it against the defendant, and even if the defendant\u2019s own confession is admitted against him. Of course, the defendant\u2019s confession may be considered at trial in assessing whether his codefendant\u2019s statements are supported by sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d to be directly admissible against him (assuming the \u201cunavailability\u201d of the codefendant) despite the lack of opportunity for cross-examination, see <em>Lee, supra </em>[476 U.S.], at 543-544 [106 S.Ct. at 2063-2064]; <em>Bruton, supra </em>[391 U.S.], at 128, n. 3 [88 S.Ct. at 1623, n. 3], and may be considered on appeal in assessing whether any Confrontation Clause violation was harmless, see <em>Harrington v. California, </em>395 U.S. 250 [89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284] (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">We had occasion to visit the issue in <em>In re Montrail M., </em>87 Md.App. 420, 589 A.2d 1318, <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>325 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Md. 527, 601 A.2d 1102 (1992). In <em>Montrail, </em>four juveniles were arrested and charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. The arresting officer testified to the effect that each youngster told him that he and the others had driven to Philadelphia earlier that evening and had purchased drugs. Although we did not expressly relate the circumstances surrounding the confessions as to reliability, we determined that the violation of the <em>Bruton </em>rule was harmless error and remanded the matter on the basis of <em>Cruz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant\u2019s and his co-defendant\u2019s confessions are substantially identical in all significant aspects. Both confessions identify the persons involved as Perry Lee, Anthony Weston, and appellant, Ryan Wilson. Both confessions relate that the car in which they went to the scene was Perry Lee\u2019s father\u2019s Honda. Both confessions state that appellant supplied the gun, which was his father\u2019s .38 police revolver. Both confessions state that Anthony Weston got into an argument at Dodge Park Apartments with a man none of them knew, and that Weston shot him. Both confessions state that Weston then ran, and that the trio later drove home in the Honda.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Appellant concedes that there was significant overlapping between Perry Lee\u2019s statements and those of the appellant\u2019s, but contends that there were also significant divergences, in that, according to appellant, \u201cPerry Lee\u2019s statements established beyond question that the one and only purpose in going to the Dodge Park Apartments was to find a cocaine dealer and rob him.\u201d Appellant\u2019s statements, on the other hand, \u201cwere much more equivocal\u201d regarding the purpose or motivation for going to the Dodge Park Apartments. Therefore, appellant asseverates, Lee\u2019s statements implicated appellant in a conspiracy to rob Lawrence Johnson far more than appellant\u2019s own statements did, and thus, under <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>it cannot be said that the non-interlocking parts of the confessions were \u201cirrelevant or trivial.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>The co-defendant said, \u201cWe were going to rob a dope dealer.\" In response to a question asking why the three went to Dodge Park Road, the co-defendant answered, \u201cTo rob someone with cocaine.\u201d Appellant, in response to the question, \u201cWhat were your intentions on Dodge Park Road?\" answered, \u201cWe went up there to rob dealers.\u201d Because both co-defendants stated that they were going to Dodge Park to rob drug dealers, the fact that appellant may have had additional motivations does not render the confessions significantly different. While the statements may contain somewhat varying degrees of detail, they are materially parallel.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Importantly, the circumstances of the actual taking of the independent confessions further demonstrate their strength and reliability. First, unlike the defendant in <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. at 544, 106 S.Ct. at 2064, appellant\u2019s co-defendant did not initially refuse to talk with police. Rather, he voluntarily confessed immediately after being advised of his rights. Second, unlike the situation in <em>Lee, </em>appellant\u2019s co-defendant was not told that the appellant had already confessed. In fact, appellant\u2019s statement of confession was taken after that of his co-defendant\u2019s. Third, the primary reason for viewing non-testifying co-defendant confessions as unreliable, in many instances, is the apparent motivation of an accomplice to blame his co-defendant and to mitigate the appearance of his own culpability. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>unlike the situation in <em>Lee, </em>the co-defendant\u2019s confession placed primary fault with a third accomplice, the shooter, who was not a party in appellant\u2019s trial. Indeed, much of the co-defendant\u2019s confession exculpates appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">We hold that the <em>Bruton </em>rule does not apply in the context of the matter before us. The independent circumstances surrounding the taking of the confessions, in addition to their significantly interlocking detail of material aspects, clearly evidenced sufficient indicia of reliability to rebut the presumption of unreliability of the co-defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>confession and was properly admitted as direct evidence against the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In any event, even assuming that the non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s confession was not directly admissible against the appellant, we believe that under the facts and circumstances of this case, wherein the appellant\u2019s independent confession supported the co-defendant\u2019s, the Confrontation Clause violation was harmless. <em>See generally Cruz, </em>481 U.S. at 194, 107 S.Ct. at 17, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-9\">. When co-defendant Thomas was taken in for questioning and read his rights, he refused to discuss the matter. The confession was elicited only after Thomas was told that Lee had already implicated him and only after he was implored by Lee to share \u201cthe rap\" with her. <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. at 544, 106 S.Ct. at 2064.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
