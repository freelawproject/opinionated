Levinson, M.D. (\u201cDr. Levinson\u201d). Dr. Levinson filed a notice of appeal with Appellee, the Montgomery County Board of Appeals (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The Board conducted an evidentiary hearing and affirmed the Notice. Dr. Levinson then filed an appeal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Appellee, Montgomery County (the \u201cCounty\u201d), filed a motion to intervene. The circuit court granted the County\u2019s motion, and affirmed the decision of the Board. Dr. Levinson filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Appellant raises the following issues, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">I. Whether a zoning ordinance that prohibits a home health practitioner from selling prescribed remedial devices that are available from a commercial source, without establishing specific criteria and standards for granting special exceptions or allowing sales that are compatible with the general welfare of the community as permitted uses, or both, is illegal, arbitrary, and capricious?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">II. Whether a zoning ordinance that prohibits a home health practitioner from selling prescribed remedial devices that are available from a commercial source, without establishing specific criteria and standards for granting special exceptions or allowing sales that are compatible with the general welfare of the community as permitted uses, or both, deprives physicians of due process of law and equal protection of the laws, as guaranteed by the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">III. Whether Dr. Levinson acquired a vested right to sell commercially available eyeglasses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">IV. Whether the DEP is prevented, under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, from enforcing the Notice?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">The facts of this case are essentially undisputed. Dr. Levinson, an ophthalmologist, has maintained a private practice in Potomac, Maryland since 1975. Around 1981, Dr. Levinson added to his office an optical dispensary from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>which eyeglasses were sold. The office was located in the Sovran Bank Building in Potomac Village. Sometime in 1990, however, Dr. Levinson moved his ophthalmology practice, including the optical dispensary, to the basement of his single-family residence in Potomac. Although the property is zoned \u201cRE-2\u201d (residential, one-family), the Montgomery County Code, \u00a7 59-A-6.1 (1984, as amended), permits a home health practitioner to maintain a professional office within his or her home, subject to certain requirements and restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Before moving his practice, Dr. Levinson submitted two building permit applications to the DEP. In the first application, dated November 22, 1989, he requested a permit to alter the existing structure for use as a basement professional office. In the second application, dated January 19, 1990, he requested a permit to construct a professional office. The applications were accompanied by floor plans, which indicated an area for an \u201cOptical Shop.\u201d The DEP approved the applications on January 25 and 30, 1990, respectively. On January 29, 1990, Dr. Levinson submitted an application for a \u201cUse and Occupancy Certificate,\u201d on which he listed as the proposed use: \u201cPROFESSIONAL OPHTHALMOLOGY OFFICE DISPENSING GLASSES + CONTACT LENSES\u201d (emphasis in original). The DEP approved the application and, on March 13, 1990, issued the certificate. The certificate specified the use as \u201cProfessional Office for resident of dwelling \u2014 Ophthalmology.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In August 1990, the West Montgomery County Citizens Association (the \u201cAssociation\u201d) sent a letter of complaint to the DEP. The Association alleged that Dr. Levinson was selling, in his home, commercially available eyeglasses in violation of a County zoning ordinance. Section 59-A-6.1(c)(6) of the Montgomery County Code provides: \u201cThe sale of goods on the premises is prohibited, except for medication prescribed by the health practitioner or a prescribed remedial device <em>that cannot be obtained from a commercial source </em>\u201d (emphasis added). In response to the complaint, Mark Moran (\u201cMoran\u201d), a County zoning inspector, visited Dr. Levinson\u2019s home, and confirmed the Associa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>tion\u2019s allegation. In a subsequent conversation with Moran, Dr. Levinson admitted that the eyeglasses he sold were available at commercial establishments. At the hearing, Dr. Levinson testified that, to the best of his knowledge, all eyeglasses are commercially available. Dr. Levinson gave his patients the option of purchasing glasses at his shop, or elsewhere. He neither advertised that he sold eyeglasses, nor filled other doctors\u2019 prescriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">The County Council adopted Section 59-A-6.1 on January 16, 1990 as part of a series of text amendments aimed at \u201cminimizing the adverse impacts of non-residential uses in one-family residential zones and removing certain distinctions between types of occupations which no longer appeared to be valid.\u201d On February 5, 1990, the effective date of the text amendments, \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) replaced a similar provision contained in \u00a7 59-A-2.1, which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\"><em>Office, professional, residential: </em>Rooms and/or buildings used for office purposes by not more than one (1) member of any recognized profession ...; provided, that such use shall be incidental to and subordinate to residential use and <em>not one involving a commercial enterprise. </em>Such use shall preclude manufacturing or sale of any hardware product, except those remedial devices which are prescribed as a direct result of the specific service rendered on the premises <em>and which devices cannot be obtained by the client from any commercial establishment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In October 1990, the DEP requested that the County Attorney provide an interpretation of \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6). Moran testified that because the home occupation provisions of the zoning code were changed, the DEP wanted to confirm that, under the new text amendments, the sale of commercially available eyeglasses was prohibited. After receiving a memorandum from the County Attorney\u2019s office, which concluded that the sale of commercially available prescribed remedial devices by home health practitioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>was prohibited by the zoning ordinance, Moran issued the Notice directing Dr. Levinson, <em>inter alia, </em>to \u201c[c]ease sale of prescribed remedial devices on the premises that may be obtained from a commercial source.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Dr. Levinson filed a notice of appeal to the Board. After an evidentiary hearing on August 14 and September 11, 1991, the Board affirmed the Notice and found that there was a \u201cfacial violation of an unambiguous ordinance.\u201d The Board determined that the doctrines of vested rights and equitable estoppel were inapplicable, but declined to pass on the constitutionality of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Dr. Levinson filed an appeal to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. After hearing the arguments of counsel, the court affirmed the decision of the Board.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">The Court feels that although this is perhaps a close case, it is fair for the County to undertake to exclude commercial enterprise from a residential zone in general, and specifically when it does allow home offices, which really are of a commercial nature in a residential area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">It can also restrict the extent of that practice, and whether it is the number of people that can visit, or the number of parking spaces or signs, or the kinds of products that can be sold from the premises. Those are all reasonably related to the health and welfare that the Council is mandated to try and promote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">So, despite the interest, and there are obviously some issues that are going to be debated further on by perhaps other kinds of practitioners about just what the scope of this ordinance is, but for purposes of this specific case, I don\u2019t find that [Dr. Levinson\u2019s] positions are well taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay2\">Also, the court found, at least implicitly, that the doctrines of vested rights and equitable estoppel did not prevent the DEP from enforcing the Notice against Dr. Levinson.</p>\n<p id=\"AoK\">Additional facts will be included, as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Article 25A, \u00a7 5(U) of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1990) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board [of appeals] and a party to the proceeding before it may appeal to the circuit court for the county which shall have power to affirm the decision of the board, or if such decision <em>is not in accordance with law, </em>to modify or reverse such decision, with or without remanding the case for rehearing as justice may require.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">(Emphasis added). Generally, the determination of an administrative agency, such as the Board in the case <em>sub judice, </em>is entitled to great deference. Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he Board\u2019s decision may be set aside as not in accordance with law if it is arbitrary, illegal or capricious.\u201d <em>Art Wood Enters, v. Wiseburg Community Assoc., Inc., </em>88 Md.App. 723, 727, 596 A.2d 712 (1991), <em>cert, denied, </em>325 Md. 397, 601 A.2d 130 (1992). A decision of the Board is arbitrary, illegal, or capricious when it is not \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record taken as a whole.\u201d <em>Mortimer v. Howard Research &amp; Dev. Corp., </em>83 Md.App. 432, 441, 575 A.2d 750, <em>cert, denied, </em>321 Md. 164, 582 A.2d 499 (1990). Furthermore, \u201c[w]here ... the [Board]\u2019s decision is based on an erroneous conclusion of law, ... [t]he reviewing court ... may substitute its judgment for that of the [Board]....\u201d <em>Mayor of Ocean City v. Purnell-Jarvis, Ltd., </em>86 Md.App. 390, 402, 586 A.2d 816 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u201c[T]he role of this court is essentially to repeat the task of the circuit court; that is, to be certain the circuit court did not err in its review.\u201d <em>Mortimer, </em>83 Md.App. at 442, 575 A.2d 750. We shall also consider whether the circuit court\u2019s conclusion of law regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) was correct, because that question was considered there for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AQy\">I <em>&amp; </em>II</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Montgomery County \u201cenjoys no inherent power to zone or rezone, and may exercise zoning power only to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>extent and in the manner directed by the State Legislature.\u201d <em>West Montgomery County Citizens Assoc. v. Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>309 Md. 183, 186, 522 A.2d 1328 (1987). The Regional District Act authorizes the County Council, sitting as district council, to \u201cadopt and amend the text of the zoning ordinance ... [in order] to regulate ... the location and uses of buildings and structures and units therein for trade, industry, residence, recreation, agriculture, public activities, and other purposes ____\u201d Md.Ann.Code art. 28, \u00a7 8-101(b)(l) (1990). Section 8-101(b)(l) requires, at least implicitly, that the County Council carry out its delegated zoning powers for the \u201cprotection and promotion of the health, safety, morals, comfort, and welfare of the inhabitants of the [County].\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 7-110. In deference to this legislative mandate, the County Council declared that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">The zoning regulations set out in this chapter for that portion of the Maryland-Washington Regional District in the county are hereby adopted for the purpose of protecting and promoting the health, safety, morals, comfort and welfare of the present and future inhabitants of the district____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Montgomery County Code, \u00a7 59-A-l.l (1984, as amended).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Dr. Levinson first contends that the prohibition of the sale of commercially available prescribed remedial devices under \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) does not bear a substantial relation to the protection and promotion of the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the County\u2019s inhabitants. He argues that there is no reason for the County to assume that the sale of eyeglasses will have an adverse impact on the community, and therefore, the County\u2019s decision to ban the sale, in advance, was arbitrary, discriminatory, and not rationally related to a lawful objective. Dr. Levinson points to the fact that \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(3) already limits the vehicle traffic to and from his office; thus, selling eyeglasses to existing patients would not increase traffic, parking, or other problems. Dr. Levinson also argues that the County could provide for special exceptions, thereby allowing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Board to decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether such prohibition is necessary. Further, Dr. Levinson compares \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) to \u00a7 59-A-6.1(b)(4), a similar provision that applies to all home occupations other than the home health practitioner. Section 59-A-6.1(b)(4) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">The sale of goods on the premises is prohibited, except for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">(A) The products of dressmaking, hand-weaving, block-printing, the making of jewelry, pottery or musical instruments by hand, or similar arts or handicrafts performed by a resident of the dwelling____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">He argues that there are no facts or valid reasons to justify the distinctions made by the Council between selling jewelry and selling eyeglasses, or between seeing a patient and selling prescribed eyeglasses to that patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Dr. Levinson further contends that \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) denies him due process of law. He suggests that the ordinance creates an \u201cirrebuttable presumption\u201d by unconditionally and permanently banning all sales of remedial devices that are available from a commercial source, without giving him procedural due process, i.e., an opportunity to obtain a special exception, or to present facts to establish that the sale of eyeglasses is consistent with the legislative purpose. He argues that the ordinance has no standards or criteria for granting a special exception or allowing the sale as an incidental or related use. He again points to the fact that \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(3) limits the amount of vehicle traffic to and from his office, yet he is nevertheless prohibited from selling commercially available prescribed remedial devices, and asserts that, without a meaningful opportunity to show that there is no impact, and without standards to guide the DEP in enforcing the regulation, an unconstitutional deprivation of a property right results.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Dr. Levinson also argues that he has been denied equal protection of the laws because he is prohibited from selling eyeglasses while those in other home occupations can sell jewelry and handbags. He contends that the County offers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>no justification for its distinctions, and therefore, the County has failed to provide the rational basis needed to justify unequal treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Although Dr. Levinson attacks both the validity and constitutionality of \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6), the former is essentially a component of the latter. Put another way, the validity of the ordinance as a proper exercise of the County\u2019s delegated police power hinges on whether it violates notions of substantive or procedural due process, or equal protection of the laws, under either Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights or the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Because many of Dr. Levinson\u2019s contentions are interrelated, or based on the same or similar standard of review, or both, we shall address them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">First, we shall consider whether \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) offends notions of substantive due process under either Article 24 or the Fourteenth Amendment. Under the latter, the validity of a zoning ordinance that does not involve a fundamental right or suspect classification</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APf\">generally is said to be determined by the so-called \"minimum rationality\u201d test. Under this test, the objective of a given piece of legislation is usually conceded to be valid, and the focus of inquiry is instead on whether the means adopted are reasonably calculated to achieve that objective \u2014 a criterion which is satisfied by any conceivable, rational basis in fact or logic linking regulation with its intended objective or purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">1 Arden H. and Daren A. Rathkopf, <em>The Law of Zoning and Planning </em>\u00a7 3.04[4] (1992) (footnotes omitted). Many state courts, however, have \u201cindicated a much greater willingness than their federal counterparts to find that as a matter of due process a zoning restriction is arbitrary and unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3.04[5]. Accordingly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">[sjtate courts, either explicitly or implicitly, tend to hold that due process requires some \"real and substantial relationship\u201d to a legitimate public purpose for regulation to be valid. While in theory this due process standard is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>similar to the \u201cminimum rationality\u201d test, in its actual application state courts may give less deference to legislative judgment and hold invalid zoning restrictions only tangentially related to the public welfare or found to be unduly oppressive, fundamentally unfair, or overinclusive or underinclusive in their impact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In <em>Goldman v. Crowther, </em>147 Md. 282, 293, 128 A. 50 (1925), an early case in which the Court of Appeals undertook to review the validity of a Baltimore City zoning ordinance, the Court recognized that Maryland \u201ccourts have uniformly held that the police power is not unlimited, but that wherever it is invoked in aid of any purpose or legislation, such purpose or legislation must bear some <em>definite and tangible relation </em>to the health, comfort, morals, welfare, or safety of the public ...\u201d (emphasis added). The Court also noted that \u201cany exercise of the [police] power which interferes with some right protected by the letter of the Constitution must bear some <em>substantial relation </em>to the public health, morals, safety, comfort or welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295, 128 A. 50 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In <em>Mayor of Pocomoke City v. Standard Oil Co., </em>162 Md. 368, 376-77, 159 A. 902 (1932), the Court of Appeals, in sustaining an ordinance that prohibited any filling station within a specified congested area, said that where a subordinate agency of the state, such as a municipal corporation, acts directly in such exercise of the police power, \u201cthe only limitation upon its right to exercise the power is that it must act <em>impartially, </em>that any interference by it with the unrestricted use of private property must be <em>reasonably necessary </em>to the public welfare, and consistent with the prohibitions of the Constitution\u201d (emphasis added). The Court then recited several \u201csettled\u201d principles applicable to consideration of the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">validity of legislative and governmental acts imposing building and use restrictions upon real property ...: (1) That restrictions imposed by the State or some agency of the State upon the use of private property cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>justified under the police power unless they are <em>reasonably necessary </em>for the adequate protection of the public welfare, safety, health, comfort, or morals; (2) that whether such restrictions are reasonable in fact is a judicial question; (3) that when imposed by competent legislative authority the burden of proof in any such inquiry is upon him who challenges their validity; and (4), when they are <em>reasonably necessary </em>for the adequate protection of the public welfare, safety, health, morals, or comfort, such restrictions will be regarded as a valid exercise of the police power unless they contravene some express constitutional prohibition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 379-80, 159 A. 902 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Furthermore, in <em>City of Baltimore v. Cohn, </em>204 Md. 523, 530, 105 A.2d 482 (1954), the Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIl\">the governmental power to interfere by zoning regulations with the general rights of the landowner by restricting the character of the use of his land is not unlimited, and such restriction cannot be imposed if it does not bear <em>a substantial relation </em>to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Legislative bodies have no authority, under the guise of the police power, to impose <em>unreasonable and unnecessary </em>restrictions on the use of private property in pursuit of useful activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbTU\">(Emphasis added); <em>see also Norbeck Village Joint Venture v. Montgomery County Council, </em>254 Md. 59, 66, 254 A.2d 700 (1969) (\u201cThe broad test of the validity of a comprehensive rezoning is whether it bears a <em>substantial relationship </em>to the public health, comfort, order, safety, convenience, morals and general welfare, and such zoning enjoys a strong presumption of validity and correctness\u201d (emphasis added).).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">[4_6] Viewing the standards espoused in <em>Goldman, Standard Oil Co., </em>and <em>Cohn </em>together, we conclude that Maryland courts employ, like many other states, a heightened level of scrutiny \u2014 something over and above the \u201cminimum rationality\u201d test required under the federal constitution. Although almost any zoning ordinance could be said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>to be rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest, <em>but see City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., </em>473 U.S. 432, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985), the \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d test is not so yielding. Despite the heightened level of review, \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) is presumed to be constitutional. <em>See Lucky Stores, Inc. v. Board of Appeals, </em>270 Md. 513, 526, 312 A.2d 758 (1973). \u201c[T]he burden is upon [Dr. Levinson] to establish clearly that it is unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Id.; see Standard Oil Co., </em>162 Md. at 380, 159 A. 902. We conclude that Dr. Levinson has failed to meet this burden. Section 59-A-6.1(c)(6) is substantially related to the promotion and protection of the community\u2019s health, safety, comfort, morals, and general welfare. It is a reasonable and necessary means to an end \u2014 the preservation of the residential nature of a residentially zoned district, and the provision of adequate fire protection. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u201cThat the right to hold, enjoy and use property is not absolute but subject to the police power of the State is axiomatic____\u201d <em>Goldman, </em>147 Md. at 302, 128 A. 50.

Nevertheless, \u201czoning ordinances today that allow [such] accessory uses often impose specific restrictions....\u201d 2 Rathkopf, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 23.-04[2]. The County\u2019s ordinance is no exception.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">These varied limitations upon home occupations and the conditions under which they may be maintained have a common denominator in their purpose to minimize the impact of home occupations upon their immediate neighbors. They represent a political compromise between the purpose of zoning to remove incompatible commercial use from residential districts, and the social necessity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>permitting some of the traditional home occupations to continue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Anderson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 13.02.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">Zoning ordinances which permit home occupations commonly discourage the operation of a store, or the sale of merchandise. Some prohibit the keeping of a stock in trade. Others outlaw the sale of any commodity. A lesser restriction, which emphasizes the aesthetic aspects of a commercial activity in a residential neighborhood, provides that \u201cno display of products shall be visible from the street and only articles made on the premises may be sold on the premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 13.24 <em>(quoting </em>Charlotte, North Carolina, Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 23-32.1(h) (1973)) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Dr. Levinson argues that he should be permitted to conduct what is essentially a commercial enterprise. Although any home occupation is necessarily commercial in nature, the County Council has presumably engaged in a careful balancing process in order to determine which accessory uses should be permitted and what restrictions need be imposed. <em>See Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 21, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">A fundamental purpose of zoning, justified because of its reasonable relationship to the promotion of the public welfare, health and safety, is the preservation of the character of a neighborhood by excluding new uses and structures prejudicial to the restricted character of the area____ Zoning regulations which preserve neighborhood characteristics stabilize the value of property, promote the permanency of desirable home surroundings and add to the happiness and comfort of citizens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">8 Eugene McQuillin, <em>The Law of Municipal Corporations </em>\u00a7 25.24 (3d ed. rev. vol. 1991) (footnotes omitted).

This goal is a permissible one____ The police power is not confined to elimination of filth, stench, and unhealthy places. It is ample to lay out zones where family values, youth values, and the blessings of quiet seclusion and clear air make the area a sanctuary for people.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Dr. Levinson argues that the restriction contained in \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) is unreasonable and not substantially related to any valid purpose because, in his particular case, the sale of eyeglasses to existing patients would not increase traffic in the area, create parking problems, or bring about other evils that zoning laws are designed to prevent. Dr. Levinson also contends that the restriction in \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(3) is sufficient to prevent the residential quality of the neighborhood from deteriorating. Section 59-A-6.1(c)(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">The home health practitioner(s) may be allowed to treat more than one patient or client at a time, provided that this does not result in more than 5 vehicle trips containing not more than 10 patients arriving or departing at the same appointment time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">\u201cIt is recognized that although a zoning ordinance is not invalid per se, yet when the provisions of such an ordinance come to be applied to particular premises, it may be found to be clearly arbitrary and unreasonable.\u201d <em>Cohn, </em>204 Md. at 530, 105 A.2d 482. Such is not the case here, however. Legislatures are frequently called upon to draw lines when determining which restrictions on accessory uses are necessary to promote the community\u2019s general welfare. <em>See generally McBriety v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>219 Md. 223, 235, 148 A.2d 408 (1959). This Court will only interfere with this purely legislative function when the line is drawn unreasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">By allowing home occupations generally, and the office of a home health practitioner in particular, in single-family residences, the County Council obviously considered: 1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>benefit the accessory use would have to the homeowner, and 2) the benefit the accessory use would have to the community by increasing its residents\u2019 access to health care, for example. At the same time, however, the County Council was apparently concerned that allowing these accessory uses could open Pandora\u2019s Box. Accordingly, the County Council prohibited the sale of all goods, except: medicine and prescribed remedial devices that are not commercially available (by a home health practitioner), and handmade works of art or craft (by all others who engage in a home occupation).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">In <em>Sinoway v. Village of S. </em>Orange, 104 N.J.Super. 477, 250 A.2d 429 (App.Div.1969), the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division held that a zoning ordinance that allowed a home office in the residence of a physician or dentist, but not an optometrist, had a reasonable basis and was, therefore, not repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Although the court reviewed a zoning ordinance unlike the one <em>sub judice, </em>and decided the case on federal constitutional grounds, the court made several noteworthy comments.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">South Orange is generally a high-class residential community, especially in its \u201cResidence A\u201d zone. The village trustees could justifiably limit the invasion of this residential area for office use in one\u2019s actual place of residence to the exceptional cases of doctors of medicine and dentistry. Their need is frequently required in emergency situations on short notice. Their ready availability is important to the health and welfare of the community. They sell no merchandise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">Optometrists, concerned generally with measuring the acuity of the eye, are rarely faced with emergencies. They are more involved in the fitting and sale of spectacles, besides their other functions of measuring the powers of vision to ascertain any departure from the normal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0p\"><em>Id. </em>250 A.2d at 430-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Unlike the South Orange ordinance, the County\u2019s ordinance allows a home office not only for physicians and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>dentists, but also for most other health care practitioners. In addition, another subsection of \u00a7 59-A-6.1 allows homeowners to maintain a home office for other occupations that provide a service or product. It is clear that the County Council did not attempt to restrict the extent to which home occupations are considered accessory uses. The County Council did, however, limit the extent to which goods could be sold, presumably to prevent a home office from being transformed into more of a commercial enterprise than necessary. The County Council could have reasonably concluded that a home occupation is a legitimate accessory use in a residentially zoned district, but the sale of commercially available goods is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Dr. Levinson nevertheless argues that he should not be prevented from selling commercially available eyeglasses where, for example, under \u00a7 59-A-6.1(b)(4)(A), jewelers can sell jewelry. What Dr. Levinson fails to appreciate, however, is that the sale of goods under \u00a7 59-A-6.1(b)(4)(A) is limited to handmade works of art or craft, which are generally one-of-a-kind items not readily available from a commercial source. The County Council limited the sale of goods by all who engage in a home occupation. In other words, the general rule is that <em>no goods </em>may be sold from a home occupation or by a home health practitioner. The County Council carved several narrow exceptions consistent with what it believed to be reasonably necessary for the general welfare of the community. The County Council might have determined that the sale of goods was generally inconsistent with the character of a residential neighborhood, but concluded that medicine, prescribed remedial devices that are not commercially available, and hand-made objects of art or craft should be available for sale despite their commercial nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Dr. Levinson contends that, because the limitation in \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(3) is adequate to restrict traffic flow, and thereby preserve the residential nature of the community, \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) contains an unnecessary and unreasonable limitation, and is unduly restrictive in its application. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>this Court, however, were to declare \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) unconstitutional on that basis, the floodgates would open to receive endless litigation. Jewelers, for example, who can maintain a home office under \u00a7 59-A-6.1(b), would march into court for the purpose of having \u00a7 59-A-6.1(b)(4)(A) declared unconstitutional. They would argue that they should be able to sell commercially available jewelry because \u00a7 59-A-6.1(b)(3) already restricts the number of customer visits to twenty per week (and five per day) and the sale of stock jewelry in addition to hand-made jewelry would not have a negative impact on the residential nature of the community. If this were to happen, an optician would be permitted to operate a home business and to sell eyeglasses and contact lenses prescribed by an optometrist or ophthalmologist, provided no more than twenty customers per week and five customers per day are serviced. Any commercial enterprise could establish an outpost in a residential district under the guise of a home occupation, provided it conforms to the general requirements of \u00a7 59-A-6.1, and does not otherwise run afoul of \u00a7 59-A-6.1\u2019s limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Section 59-A-6.1(c)(6) also bears a substantial relation to the promotion and protection of the safety of the County\u2019s inhabitants. The County Council could have reasonably concluded that \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) was necessary to reduce the risk and severity of fire. Commercial enterprises that sell stock merchandise often keep in storage extra stock. It is likely that the goods are kept in combustible containers, or are combustible themselves. The County Council could have concluded that along with the sale of commercially available goods would be the storage of those goods, and that this would pose a greater fire hazard than should be tolerated in a residential area. This bears a substantial relation to the safety of the home\u2019s occupants and their neighbors. It also adds some sense of predictability and uniformity so that the County can provide suitable fire protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Dr. Levinson cites <em>Aspen Hill Venture v. Montgomery County Council, </em>265 Md. 303, 289 A.2d 303 (1972), for the proposition that zoning officials may not consider \u201cneed\u201d or substitute their economic judgment for property owners\u2019 or the public\u2019s. In that case, the appellant owned residentially zoned land that he wished to use for the expansion of an existing shopping center. The appellant filed a zoning application with the District Council seeking reclassification of the property from residential to commercial. A hearing examiner determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\">(1) there was sufficient change in the character of the neighborhood to justify rezoning, (2) the proposed reclassification was in accordance with \u201cthe recently adopted Aspen Hill and Vicinity Master Plan,\u201d and (3) the proposed reclassification would not have an adverse effect upon the surrounding residential property or create traffic circulation problems or an additional nuisance factor in the area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 306-07, 289 A.2d 303. Despite those findings, the hearing examiner recommended denial of the application because there was a \u201c \u2018demonstrated lack of public need for additional commercial facilities at the subject site to service residents of the area.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307, 289 A.2d 303. The District Council followed the hearing examiner\u2019s recommendation and denied appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The Court of Appeals was asked to decide \u201cwhether, absent a statutory mandate such as is usually required in cases of special exceptions, a \u2018lack of need\u2019 may be the sole basis for the rejection of a zoning reclassification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313, 289 A.2d 303. The Court recognized first that \u201c \u2018the constitutionality and validity of zoning laws depend essentially upon a reasonable balancing of public interest in zoning as against opposing private interests in property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. (quoting </em>McQuillin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 25.40). The Court then held that \u201c[t]he legislative decision to refuse to grant the requested rezoning ... [did] not ... bear a sufficient relation to the public welfare to be supported as a valid enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ment of the police power when balanced against the rights of the property owner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Dr. Levinson is not attempting to have the subject property rezoned as commercial. He is arguing that selling commercially available eyeglasses should be permitted in a <em>residential </em>neighborhood as an accessory use. Unlike the subject property in <em>Aspen Hill Venture, </em>Dr. Levinson\u2019s home is in a residential neighborhood that presumably has <em>not </em>changed in character. If it has, Dr. Levinson should follow the appropriate procedure to have his property rezoned. Furthermore, even if \u201clack of need\u201d played some part in the decision of the County Council to prohibit the sale of commercially available prescribed remedial devices, that was not the sole factor it considered. As discussed <em>supra, </em>preserving the residential nature of the neighborhood and promoting the safety of homeowners and neighbors likely played a substantial part in its decision. <em>Aspen Hill Venture </em>is, therefore, inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The next stage of Dr. Levinson\u2019s attack on the validity of \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) is based on the fact that there is no mechanism by which he can obtain a special exception for the sale of commercially available prescribed remedial devices. He argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">[w]hen the County Council unconditionally banned the sale of commercially available prescribed remedial devices, it usurped the Board\u2019s administrative function to use its expertise and judgment to determine whether a special exception use should have been granted for the sale of such eyeglasses by Dr. Levinson____ The Board, and not the Council, should make the requisite findings that the sale of prescribed remedial devices in a particular case will adversely impact on surrounding neighborhoods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArT\">Dr. Levinson cites <em>Creative Country Day Sch., Inc. v. Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>242 Md. 552, 219 A.2d 789 (1966), and <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981), to support his position. We do not find, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>these cases, any support for the proposition that the County Council <em>must </em>provide for special exceptions. In fact, the statutory authority for granting special exceptions to zoning regulations clearly provides that such mechanism is permissive, not mandatory.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">A district council in either county, in its zoning regulations, <em>may </em>provide that the board of zoning appeals, the district council, or an administrative office or agency designated by the district council, <em>in appropriate cases </em>and subject to appropriate principles, standards, rules, conditions, and safeguards set forth in the regulations, may either grant or deny, upon conditions as may be deemed necessary to carry out the purposes of this article, special exceptions and variances to the provisions of the zoning regulations in harmony with their general purposes and intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Md.Ann.Code art. 28, \u00a7 8-110 (Supp.1992) (emphasis added). Furthermore, in <em>Schultz, </em>the Court stated that \u201c[wjhen the legislative body <em>determines that other uses are compatible with the permitted uses in a use district, </em>but that the beneficial purposes such other uses serve do not outweigh their possible adverse effect, such uses are designated as conditional or special exception uses.\u201d 291 Md. at 21, 432 A.2d 1319. As discussed <em>supra, </em>the County Council presumably determined that the sale of commercially available goods <em>is not compatible </em>with other permitted uses in a residential district. As long as this determination is reasonable and substantially related to the promotion and protection of the general welfare of the community, it will be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Dr. Levinson also argues that the County Council improperly relied on an irrebuttable presumption when it enacted \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) and that this denies him procedural due process of law. Once again, Dr. Levinson complains that he has not been given the opportunity to obtain a special exception, or to present facts, either to the DEP or the Board, to establish that the sale of eyeglasses is consistent with the legislative purpose. Dr. Levinson cites <em>Schad </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>v.

Goldstein, </em>453 F.Supp. 787 (D.Md.1978), aff<em>'d, </em>594 F.2d 859 (4th Cir.1979), the Court discussed the law of irrebuttable presumptions. The Court recognized that \u201ccertain irrebuttable presumptions are invalid where the facts assumed are not universally true, and where no opportunity for a hearing of individual cases is established. \u2018Statutes creating permanent irrebuttable presumptions have long been disfavored under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 795 <em>(quoting Vlandis, </em>412 U.S. at 446, 93 S.Ct. at 2233) (citation omitted). But the Court then identified the crucial point \u2014 that \u201cthe prevailing test is one of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 796. \u201c[D]ue process of law does not require a hearing \u2018in every conceivable case of government impairment of private interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stanley v.

Here, however, the County Council determined that the sale of all commercially available prescribed remedial devices in a residential use district is inconsistent with the general welfare of the community. Furthermore, of the cases Dr. Levinson cites, only <em>Schad </em>addresses a zoning ordinance, and in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>case, the ordinance impaired a fundamental right \u2014 freedom of expression under the First Amendment. <em>See Schad, </em>452 U.S. at 68, 101 S.Ct. at 2182. Here, the ordinance regulates merely an economic interest, and is not entitled to the same level of scrutiny as the ordinance in <em>Schad. </em>Therefore, \u201c[t]he facts here are not compatible with those dictating administrative hearings[,]\u201d 453 F.Supp. at 796, and due process does not require notice and hearing. If this Court were to invalidate \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) on procedural due process grounds, we would usurp the legislative function of the County Council and no doubt open the door to an attack on many other valid zoning provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Dr. Levinson also argues that \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) deprives him of his right to the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag4\">[I]f a person seeks to rely upon the denial of the equal protection of the laws, that person has the burden of showing that his situation is the same as the situation complained of, and that the State, or its instrumentalities has treated the two situations differently in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><em>Creative Country Day Sch., Inc., </em>242 Md. at 572, 219 A.2d 789. Dr. Levinson contends that the County Council does not have a rational basis for permitting the sale of jewelry and other goods under \u00a7 59-A-6.1(b)(4)(A), while at the same time prohibiting the sale of commercially available prescribed remedial devices under \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">We hold that \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the equal protection guarantee embodied in Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Dr. Levinson has failed to prove that he is treated any differently than those with home occupations under \u00a7 59-A-6.1(b). As discussed <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 59-A-6.1(b)(4) prohibits the sale of goods on the premises of a home occupation. Only hand-made works of art or craft, generally \u201cone-of-a-kind\u201d items that are not commercially available, may be sold. This is consistent with the prohibition in \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) of the sale of pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>scribed remedial devices except those that are commercially available. The fact that Dr. Levinson only offers goods that are commercially available is of no consequence. He is not treated any differently than a person with a home occupation. ' If Dr. Levinson were to dispense prescribed remedial devices that were not commercially available, this use would be clearly permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Ill &amp; IV</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Dr. Levinson also contends that the doctrines of vested rights and equitable estoppel bar the County from enforcing' the Notice. We hold that neither doctrine applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Maryland courts have adopted the majority rule that a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">\u201clandowner will be held to have acquired a vested right to continue construction of a building or structure and to initiate and continue a use despite a restriction contained in an ordinance where, <em>prior to the effective date of the ordinance, </em>in reliance upon a permit theretofore validly issued, he has, in good faith, made a substantial change of position in relation to the land, made substantial expenditures, or has incurred substantial obligations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\"><em>Prince George\u2019s County v.

Although this provision was later removed from \u00a7 59-A-2.1, it was transferred to \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6), in a substantively unaltered form. Put another way, the applicable zoning ordinance effective both before and after the DEP granted Dr. Levinson building and use and occupancy permits prohibited him from selling commercially available prescribed remedial devices. The mere recodification and rewording of this provision does not amount to a \u201csubsequent change\u201d in the law.

This rule, when applicable, must be bottomed on the need for the interpretation or clarification of an ambiguous statute or ordinance, which latter element is not here present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">The Court concluded that the definition of a term in the County\u2019s zoning ordinance \u201cwas open to at least two reasonable and debatable interpretations^] ... that the County shared the interpretation given this section by Permanent at the time of the issuance of the building permit, and that the County had consistently applied that interpretation for a significant period of time prior thereto.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>\u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) is not \u201copen to at least two reasonable and debatable interpretations.\u201d It may be that the Board will have to determine exactly what \u201ccommercial source\u201d means in a future \u201cborderline\u201d case, but there is no question that, in the instant case, eyeglasses sold by Dr. Levinson are readily available from a commercial source. The plain language of the ordinance clearly forbids the sale of eyeglasses that may be purchased at a retail establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">Furthermore, Dr. Levinson failed to produce sufficient evidence before the Board to establish that the County had consistently applied a different interpretation to the ordinance. Dr. Levinson makes much of the fact that agents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the DEP led him to believe that he could sell eyeglasses and that the DEP requested the opinion of the County Attorney as to the applicability of the ordinance to Dr. Levinson. At most, Dr. Levinson proved that the County had some question concerning the applicability of \u00a7 59-A-2.1 and was unclear whether \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) changed the law in any relevant respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Dr. Levinson also refers us to language in the County Attorney\u2019s memorandum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">It is my opinion that to the extent that the sale of prescribed medical devices <em>was permitted as a customary and incidental use to a residential medical practice, </em>that the change to the law by the Home Occupation Text Amendment has resulted in a prohibition of the sale of goods on the premises except as permitted by \u00a7 59-A-6.1(c)(6) of the Zoning Ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">(Emphasis added). This language, however, does not indicate that the County had a long standing administrative interpretation contrary to the plain meaning of the ordinance. The County Attorney merely said <em>\u201cto the extent\" </em>the prior use was permitted, it is clear that use is now prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">We hold that this case more closely resembles <em>City of Hagerstown v. Long Meadow, supra. </em>\u201cWe ... recognize the hardship presented by this case, however, we are faced with the realization that to [reverse] the decision of the [Board and circuit court] below would unsettle a principle of law which has become stabilized in this jurisdiction by application in many cases.\u201d <em>City of Hagerstown, </em>264 Md. at 493, 287 A.2d 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
