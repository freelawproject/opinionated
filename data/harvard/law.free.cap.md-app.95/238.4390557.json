The trial court sentenced appellant to ten years on the child abuse conviction and merged the second degree sexual offense conviction into the child abuse conviction. He presents three main issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">I. Did the sentencing judge consider that the defendant maintained his innocence after being convicted of a crime as a factor in determining the length of his sentence when the judge stated \u201cI see and hear no remorse from you about this, not one bit\u201d and then expressly included this observation in determining a ten year sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">II. Did the sentencing judge abuse his discretion when he departed from the Sentencing Guidelines which recommend a maximum four year period of incarceration and sentenced a defendant convicted of child abuse to ten years without explaining his reasons for imposing the harsh sentence in light of the defendant\u2019s respected character and lack of criminal record and where there was no record of physical or psychological trauma to the well adjusted victim and an absence of compelling circumstances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">III. Did the defendant\u2019s counsel provide ineffective assistance when he failed to call a potentially important character witness on the defendant\u2019s behalf and permitted the jury to be rushed into deciding a verdict without objection?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">Appellant\u2019s 10-year-old daughter, after identifying the appellant, testified that he made her \u201csuck his private\u201d on the \u201csofa\u201d in the basement of his house. She testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>it first occurred when she was five or six. She said that it occurred on different days and would, on occasion, happen while her mother was upstairs cooking dinner. It stopped after appellant moved out of the house for good.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">She described the nature of the incidents at some length and graphically. In light of the issues raised, we need not further describe that testimony except to say that the trial court\u2019s description of the offenses as \u201cunbelievable\u201d and \u201cheinous\u201d is an understatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The trial judge did not consider impermissible matters in fashioning the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">There was a separate sentencing proceeding on March 13, 1992, almost two months after appellant\u2019s conviction. At that hearing, speaking in the present tense, the trial court stated, \u201cI see and hear no remorse from you about this; not one bit.\u201d Saenz now claims that the trial court\u2019s statement equates to consideration of an impermissible matter, <em>i.e., </em>appellant\u2019s claim of innocence evidenced by his not guilty plea.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">We note initially that the trial court\u2019s statement referred to appellant\u2019s post-conviction demeanor. The trial court expressly referred to appellant\u2019s lack of present remorse at the sentencing hearing. The court\u2019s sentencing statement came immediately after Saenz\u2019s allocution. That allocution included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">[Ejverything that has happened here is because of a big hate and jealousy, because I have been trying for three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>and a half years to separate from my children\u2019s mother and until now haven\u2019t been able to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">She always swore that I would never be free from her---- First she used tricks, then she tried to keep me using other ways, pretending the girl was sick____ She wasn\u2019t sick. She has recurred to these dirty tricks to accuse me of something that has never been proved; it is just words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">... [A]nd it has been my wife \u2014 the child\u2019s mother\u2019s lies. She has a very smart mind to do all these tricks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfI\">Under the circumstances of this case, the trial court was commenting as an aside at sentencing on appellant\u2019s lack of remorse at that hearing. There is no indication anywhere in the record that links the trial court\u2019s statement to appellant\u2019s original decision to plead not guilty. At the time Saenz displayed the lack of remorse that generated the trial court\u2019s remark, the presumption of innocence had been gone for almost two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">It is clear to us that the trial court properly considered appellant\u2019s attitude at the sentencing hearing. In <em>Wain v. Warden, </em>215 Md. 650, 653, 138 A.2d 482 (1958), the Court of Appeals held that a sentencing judge may consider a defendant\u2019s attitude at trial in determining the sentence. As to conduct or attitude at hearings after conviction when guilt has been found as a matter of fact, we perceive that <em>Wain </em>still permits the consideration of remorse, or lack thereof, displayed after conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>274 Md. 536, 542-43, 336 A.2d 113 (1975), the Court held that it was improper to conclude that a defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected decision to plead not guilty is a factor that may influence the sentencing judge to the detriment of the accused. The relevant portion of the trial court\u2019s colloquy with the defendant in <em>Johnson </em>is distinguishable from the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-12\">What lesson have you learned when you were not telling the truth <em>... at the time of trial? </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>... The jury didn\u2019t accept it and I didn\u2019t accept it. You <em>weren\u2019t </em>telling the truth. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\">\n<em>[I]f you had come in here with a plea of guilty ... you would probably have gotten a modest sentence.... But with this attitude ... you can\u2019t receive that kind of treatment.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">274 Md. at 539-40, 336 A.2d 113. In its holding in <em>Johnson, </em>the Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">[W]hen Judge Powers said, \u201cif you had come in here with a plea of guilty ... you would probably have gotten a modest sentence,\u201d he indicated that he ... punished Johnson more severely because he failed to plead guilty \u2014 the words just quoted manifest that an impermissible consideration may well have been employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 543, 336 A.2d 113. <em>See also Herbert v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 48, 55-56, 354 A.2d 449 (1976) (holding that \u201c[t]he mandate of Johnson is clear ... protestations of innocence <em>throughout </em>the trial must not influence sentencing \u2018in any way.\u2019 \u201d) (Emphasis added.) <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Herbert </em>hold that a defendant\u2019s exercise of certain rights at <em>trial, </em>and his <em>trial </em>attitude based upon those rights, may not be considered at sentencing. As we see it, neither case forbids a sentencing judge to consider a defendant\u2019s attitude when no presumption of innocence remains, <em>i.e., </em>lack of remorse exhibited at the sentencing hearing. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we perceive the trial court\u2019s statement as a response to the attitude of appellant at the sentencing hearing. That, as we understand <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Herbert, </em>is not prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Reid v. State, 302 </em>Md. 811, 821-22, 490 A.2d 1289 (1985), was faced with a trial court\u2019s comment as to its feeling that the defendant may have lacked remorse. The trial court began its sentencing statement by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you really appreciate what you did to that young lady____ This young girl will never be the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 822, 490 A.2d 1289. In its decision, the Court of Appeals did not address that statement. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals was concerned primarily with statements contained in a victim impact statement as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>to the length of sentence and accepted the trial court\u2019s statement that it had not considered the victim\u2019s opinion on that matter. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, it quoted the judge\u2019s statement without comment. <em>Id. </em>That statement can certainly be described as a statement that the appellant did not recognize the damage he had done, <em>i.e., </em>a failure to show remorse. To the extent that there can be an inference or dicta by silence, we suggest that it may well be contained in that Court\u2019s treatment of the statement we have described contained in <em>Reid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We further contrast the trial court\u2019s statement in the case <em>sub judice </em>and the statement mentioned without criticism in <em>Reid </em>with the statement found to be reversible error in <em>Colesanti v. State, </em>60 Md.App. 185, 193, 481 A.2d 1143 (1984), <em>cert, denied, </em>302 Md. 570, 489 A.2d 1129 (1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">You didn\u2019t come into court and admit your guilt____ To me, when somebody comes into court and they admit their guilt to me, it shows they are remorseful for what they have done____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s fair to treat someone who comes into court and who publicly acknowledges their guilt with the same hand that you would treat somebody who comes in and denies their guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Later, at a reduction hearing, the trial judge in <em>Colesanti </em>reiterated that he gave consideration to the exercise of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to plead not guilty when he said: \u201cWhat I have done and what I will continue to do ... when a person pleads guilty then I do give them some additional considerations. It\u2019s a reward to them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even though the trial judge in <em>Colesanti </em>said he did not penalize those who pled guilty, we opined otherwise: \u201c[T]he trial judge expressly advised ... that he rewarded those who pleaded guilty. Necessarily, it follows that he penalized those who pleaded not guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195, 481 A.2d 1143. In the present case, the trial judge limited his consideration to defendant\u2019s lack of remorse <em>at sentencing. Colesanti </em>is therefore distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>In <em>Hurley v. State, </em>60 Md.App. 539, 560-65, 483 A.2d 1298 (1984), <em>cert, denied, </em>302 Md. 409, 488 A.2d 500 (1985), the trial court commented extensively on the fact that no one had testified describing the circumstances leading up to the killing, that it had no evidence of mitigation, that there was no evidence in regards to the location of the body. The court then said that if the defendant would reveal the location of the body, that would have some impact on the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Hurley argued on appeal that the trial court\u2019s comments indicated that it had considered the fact that he had remained silent in fashioning its sentence and thus had impermissibly considered his exercise of a constitutional right in imposing the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 560, 564, 483 A.2d 1298. We disagreed saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">We note ... that the court\u2019s comments are to be read in full context; isolation of a particular passage serves no purpose____ [I]n their entirety, we do not find the impermissible considerations suggested by <em>Johnson </em>or <em>Herbert; </em>we find only the court\u2019s recognition that appellant\u2019s conduct <em>continues </em>to cause the victims of his crime to suffer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 565, 483 A.2d 1298 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">In <em>Vogel v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 56, 69-70, 543 A.2d 398 (1988), <em>aff'd, </em>315 Md. 458, 554 A.2d 1231 (1989), the trial court commented to the defendant at sentencing that <em>\u201cyou have to this morning maintained your innocence; </em>... <em>it means that they have concluded that you are in a state of denial and while you are in that state there is no help that is available ... that can be ... effective.'\u201d </em>Vogel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>alleged that the trial court\u2019s statements indicated that it impermissibly considered his claim of innocence in fashioning its sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 69, 543 A.2d 398. We commented that the trial court had been \u201cthinking aloud about the efficacy of a sentence based on deterrence versus a sentence based on rehabilitation,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69, 543 A.2d 398, and that we considered his statements to be a \u201cthoughtful, a concerned, and a highly commendable consideration of all pertinent sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 543 A.2d 398. Judge McGuckian, in the present case, merely considered Saenz\u2019s present absence of remorse and contextually made no impermissible consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In <em>Johnson, </em>274 Md. at 543, 336 A.2d 113, the Court of Appeals commented that its view that it is impermissible for a sentencing judge to weigh against a defendant his exercise of his constitutional rights to counsel or a jury trial was shared by nearly all of the courts in the country. It affixed an extensive listing of authority to that effect. 274 Md. at 543, 336 A.2d 113. In respect to the appropriateness of including remorse or the lack of it exhibited during post-trial proceedings, there is substantial authority in federal case law holding that such consideration is permissible. In <em>United States v. Carter, </em>804 F.2d 508, 510 (9th Cir.1986) defense counsel and the prosecutor entered into a plea bargain as to a sentence, and the trial judge participated in that process. Later, the defendant rejected the plea bargain, chose to go to trial, and was convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 513. At sentencing his counsel informed the court that other than his client\u2019s exercise of his constitutional right to reject the plea bargain and to stand trial, nothing else had happened; thus to impose a heavier sentence would be, in effect, punishing the appellant for exercising a constitutional right. <em>Id. </em>The sentencing judge responded in a general sense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">If the facts are all established and the Government obviously has a good case and the Defendants plead guilty, the Court is entitled to give ... credit for doing just exactly that. Now, I know defense counsel say, oh no, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>you\u2019re depriving them of their Constitutional rights to exercise their freedom to have a trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\"><em>But that\u2019s not what the Court says. </em>The Court says those who plead guilty ... would be given credit for that fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, responding to the sentencing judge\u2019s remarks, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">Judge McGovern stated unequivocally that he was not punishing appellants for going to trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">He distinguished crediting those who plead from punishing those who do not____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">... Doubtless he was mindful that defendants' rejection of restitution meant that they had not fully accepted responsibility for their actions. This justified a stiffer sentence than that originally proposed in the plea bargain ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">The record fails to show that the court improperly imposed harsher sentences____ In fact, the record shows that the court expressly disavowed any such motivation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhW\"><em>Id. </em>at 514-15 (footnote omitted). <em>See also United States v. Rooney, </em>866 F.2d 28, 33 (2d Cir.1989) (\u201c[W]e reject Rooney\u2019s claim ... that he must have been penalized for insisting on his right to a trial.... Judge Stanton[\u2019s] ... sentence ... reflected his belief that Rooney had not accepted responsibility for his actions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>United States v. Hull, </em>792 F.2d 941, 942 (9th Cir.1986), noted that the trial court rejected a recommendation of probation in a presentence report because Hull had failed to express \u201cremorse and had failed to take responsibility for the theft.\u201d Hull contended that such consideration in sentencing punished her for exercising her constitutional right against self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>The court rejected the argument stating that admission of guilt is evidence of the first step in rehabilitation. <em>Id. See also United States v. Perez, </em>904 F.2d 142, 147 (2d Cir.1990), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 111 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>S.Ct. 1085, 112 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1991) (\u201cIn addition, many factors favor relative leniency for those who acknowledge their guilt \u2014 often expressing remorse____\u201d); <em>United States v. Malquist, </em>791 F.2d 1399, 1403 (9th Cir.1986), <em>cert, denied, </em>479 U.S. 954, 107 S.Ct. 445, 93 L.Ed.2d 394 (1986) (\u201c[T]he inclusion of Malquist\u2019s lack of repentance in the court\u2019s sentencing calculus was permissible.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The Ninth Circuit has also furnished an extensive discussion of the issue of remorse in its earlier case of <em>Gollaher v. United States, </em>419 F.2d 520, 530 (9th Cir.1969), <em>cert, denied, </em>396 U.S. 960, 90 S.Ct. 434, 24 L.Ed.2d 424 (1969):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">This case presents a dilemma which every trial judge faces at the time of sentence. It is almost axiomatic that the first step toward rehabilitation of an offender is the offender\u2019s recognition that he was at fault____ But to the extent that rehabilitation is the objective, no fault can be found of the judge who takes into consideration the extent of a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation at the time of sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">If the trial judge makes no mention of his thoughts on this subject, any sentence within legal limits will stand against attack. But, if the judge tells the defendant what he has in mind, the judge can anticipate an attack upon the sentence similar to the one at hand. No matter how artfully it may be put, the defendant will know that if he acknowledges that he has come to recognize his guilt, this may well result in a lesser sentence. He is then up against a hard choice of whether to forego some potential attacks upon the judgment or face a stiffer sentence. If he makes the latter choice, and his conviction is upheld, he is forced to rely upon the action of the Board of Parole. If he is in fact innocent, then he must have faith that this will ultimately be established and act accordingly. On the other hand, after the defendant has been convicted, the judge must proceed upon the basis that the defendant is guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-12\">Justice is better served by a forthright disclosure of the state of mind of the judge. While the considerations thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>exposed are difficult, at least the defendant has the advantage of knowing what they are and can make his decisions accordingly. A proper sentence takes into consideration the kind of crime committed and the kind of man who committed it____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">... He had before him a man unwilling to take the first step toward rehabilitation and he imposed sentence accordingly. Gollaher\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights were not infringed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The Supreme Court noted in <em>United States v. Grayson, </em>438 U.S. 41, 50, 98 S.Ct. 2610, 2615, 57 L.Ed.2d 582 (1978), that it acknowledged that a \u201csentencing authority may ... consider the evidence heard during trial, <em>as well as the demeanor of the accused.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) It then cited the comments of the Second Circuit as a persuasive analysis in <em>United States v. Hendrix, </em>505 F.2d 1233, 1236 (2d Cir.1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">If the notion of \u201crepentance\u201d is out of fashion today, the fact remains that a manipulative defiance of the law is not a cheerful datum for the prognosis a sentencing judge undertakes.... Impressions about the individual ... the likelihood that he will transgress no more ... the degree to which he does or does not deem himself at war with his society, \u2014 are ... central factors to be appraised____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">438 U.S. at 51, 98 S.Ct. at 2616.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">The state courts have held accordingly. The prosecution appealed a sentencing court\u2019s favorable (to the defendant) consideration of repentance in <em>Commonwealth v. Frazier, </em>347 Pa.Super. 64, 500 A.2d 158, 159 (1985). The Superior Court of Pennsylvania noted that the trial court had properly considered that \u201cappellee was contrite\u201d among its sentencing considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-11\">Among those factors used to determine a defendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation is his or her manifestation of social conscience and responsibility through contrition, repentance, and cooperation with law enforcement agencies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>500 A.2d at 160 (citations omitted). <em>See also Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em>333 Pa.Super. 42, 481 A.2d 1212, 1214 (1984) (upholding consideration of lack of contrition by the sentencing judge). In another Pennsylvania case, <em>Commonwealth v. Gallagher, </em>296 Pa.Super. 382, 442 A.2d 820, 822 (1982), the court stated that the sentencing court properly based its sentence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">upon the defendant\u2019s conduct during the sentencing colloquy which clearly indicated ... the fact that he had no remorse for his crimes and his utter contempt for the legal process---- A criminal defendant\u2019s attitude, including a lack of contrition for his criminal conduct, is one of the proper criteria upon which a court may exercise its discretion in sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The Court of Appeals of Alaska similarly held, in <em>Davis v. State, </em>635 P.2d 481, 487 (Alaska Ct.App.1981), that \u201cit was appropriate for the court, in gauging the weight realistically to be accorded to Davis\u2019 rehabilitation, to take into account its belief that Davis ... refused to accept responsibility or accountability for his conduct <em>at the time of sentencing.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>See also People v. Shaw, </em>124 A.D.2d 686, 507 N.Y.S.2d 918, 919 (1986) (rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court penalized him for rejecting a plea bargain and choosing to go to trial and noting that the trial court had \u201cproperly considered the defendant\u2019s lack of remorse____\u201d); <em>People v. Durkin, </em>132 A.D.2d 668, 518 N.Y.S.2d 38, 39 (1987) (\u201cThe fact that the sentence imposed after trial is greater than that offered as part of a plea bargain does not automatically establish that in determining the sentence, the trial court improperly increased the defendant\u2019s punishment solely for asserting his right to trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">As we view the trial court\u2019s comment at sentencing in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we do not perceive that it considered inappropriate factors. We hold that the trial court\u2019s present tense observation of a defendant\u2019s lack of remorse, so long as it is not explicitly linked to a defendant\u2019s prior claim of innocence or not guilty plea or exercise of his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>remain silent, is an appropriate factor to consider at sentencing. In light of our decision, it is unnecessary to address further the sub-arguments expressed by appellant in respect to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a ten-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The defendant asserts that the trial court\u2019s sentencing of him to a term exceeding the recommended range of the guidelines is an abuse of discretion. In <em>Teasley v. State, </em>298 Md. 364, 370, 470 A.2d 337 (1984), it was argued that the trial court had intended to follow the guidelines but had mistakenly imposed a consecutive sentence in contradiction of the guidelines. The Court of Appeals opined that even if the trial court had mistaken the guideline range, it did not require a sentence vacation and resentencing, holding that \u201c[ajppellate review of sentences is extremely limited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It described those limitations as a sentence not constituting cruel and unusual punishment or violating constitutional requirements; a sentencing judge may \u201cnot be motivated by ill-will, prejudice or other impermissible considerations; \u201d and the sentence must comply with statutory limitations. <em>Id. </em>It held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">Nothing in the law requires that Guidelines sentences or principles be applied; they complement rather than replace the exercise of discretion by the trial judge.... Nor is it an impermissible consideration, within the contemplation of our cases, for a trial judge not to apply the Guidelines, or to apply them improperly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 370-71, 470 A.2d 337. <em>See also Timney v. State, </em>80 Md.App. 356, 369-70, 563 A.2d 1121 (1989), <em>cert, denied, </em>318 Md. 324, 568 A.2d 28 (1990) (affirming the sentence because the guidelines are not mandatory nor in any way required; no impermissible considerations were used; and the sentence imposed was \u201ca constitutional, statutorily allowed sentence____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>This claim of error is further meritless in that the trial court gave its reasons for the imposition of its sentence. We have previously commented that we agree that the acts committed here were heinous acts. As we perceive it, when a father compels a 6-year-old daughter to regularly commit fellatio upon him, he commits a serious crime on a person particularly unable to defend herself. Additionally, the circumstances of the occurrences, when some of the criminal acts were arrogantly committed when the girl\u2019s mother was present in the house, further support the trial court\u2019s observations that he shuddered \u201cto think what would have happened had you spent more time with your children.\u201d We also find that the court considered the guidelines in his sentencing statement because he said that he did, and there is no evidence that he did not. A sentence outside the guidelines is not indicative that the guidelines were not considered but only that they were rejected. A rejection of guidelines is contemplated by the guidelines themselves. We perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"A_g\">The Court of Appeals said in <em>Harris v. State, </em>295 Md. 329, 337, 455 A.2d 979 (1983) <em>(Harris I), </em>that \u201cconsideration of a claim of ineffective counsel is best left to a post conviction hearing____\u201d <em>See also Harris v.

At the conclusion of the judge\u2019s sentencing statement, the only comment made by appellant\u2019s counsel was \"Thank you, Your Honor.\u201d Obviously, that statement does not constitute an objection. Thus, it is doubtful that this entire issue was preserved for appeal. We have chosen to address it to clarify that remorse, or the lack thereof, remains an appropriate consideration at sentencing so long as it is considered as it exists after the presumption of innocence no longer remains with a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\">. The trial court also gave what has come to be known as a \"Christian burial\u201d speech. <em>Id. </em>60 Md.App. at 562, 483 A.2d 1298. That speech, however, was not as effective as the one made by the Iowa police officers on their trip between Davenport and Des Moines which ultimately gave rise to the defendant\u2019s revealing the whereabouts of the body of the murder victim and the \"inevitable discovery\u201d holding of the Supreme Court. <em>Nix v.
