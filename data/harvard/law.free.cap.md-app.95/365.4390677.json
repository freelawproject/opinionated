When the elevator arrived, it did not level properly with the floor, and Swann tripped and stumbled while boarding. The elevator was \u201c[s]omewhere around a foot,\u201d \u201c[sjomewhat greater than about a foot,\u201d or as many as eighteen inches below floor level. Ordinarily, the height of the, elevator\u2019s door opening was seven feet. As a result of the incident, Swann claimed he sustained severe, painful and permanent personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">After the elevator arrived but before entering it, Swann looked into the elevator and saw no exiting passengers. Neither Swann nor Donovan noticed the elevator had misleveled until after Swann stepped into the elevator. At trial, Swann\u2019s expert in the field of human factors psychology opined that when an elevator door opens, people ordinarily \u201clook forward at essentially their own eye level, first to see that the door opens; second, to see that nobody is coming out; and if there is time later on, there are two or three seconds available, to look towards the walking surface itself.\u201d When asked if he had an opinion \u201cwhether an elevator that was between six to twelve inches below the floor level would be able to be detected in sufficient time to allow the person to keep from stepping in or falling into the elevator,\u201d he added: \u201cIf somebody knew to look, if they expected the problem to occur, yes; if they did not, no____ I would not normally expect people to do a safety inspection adequate to determine that the elevator has not leveled, because they would have no reason to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">Elevator number two, an automatic self-service elevator, was located in a building owned by Prudential, managed by CW, and leased exclusively to Swann\u2019s employer, IBM. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Dover manufactured and installed the elevator, and has been under contract with CW to maintain the elevator ever since its installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The Dover Master Maintenance Service Agreement (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d) in effect from July 1, 1985 through the date of the incident required that Dover \u201c[r]egularly and systematically examine, adjust, lubricate and, whenever required by the wear and tear of normal elevator usage, repair or replace the equipment (except for the items stated hereafter), using trained personnel directly employed and supervised by [Dover] to maintain the equipment in proper operating condition.\u201d Although the Agreement specifically excludes several elevator components and associated systems, the component that Swann contends caused the misleveling, the \u201c14 and 15 contacts\u201d, was not excluded. Further, CW agreed that it shall remain in exclusive \u201cpossession or control of the equipment\u201d and that it would prohibit \u201cothers [from] mak[ing] changes, adjustments, additions, repairs or replacements to the equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">When an elevator needed repair, IBM contacted CW. CW did not attempt to repair the elevators; rather, it turned the elevator off when a problem arose and placed a call to Dover. Joan Berman, CW\u2019s senior vice-president in charge of property management, testified that \u201c[CW] cannot do anything on th[e] elevator ... [b]ecause the only people that are allowed to work on the elevator based on the [Agreement] are the people who come from Dover Elevator.\u201d David Geist, CW\u2019s chief building engineer, testified that he was not permitted to work on the elevator. When asked why, he responded: \u201c[b]ecause that is why we have a contract with Dover to repair the elevators. I do not know anything about repairing the elevators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Ronald Bothell (\u201cBothell\u201d), a maintenance repairman for Dover, testified that he would spend six hours every other week performing preventive maintenance on the four elevators in Prudential\u2019s building. On as many as four occasions within a span of six weeks preceding the incident \u2014 December 17, 1986, January 7, 1987, January 21, 1987, and Janu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>ary 28, 1987 \u2014 and on the day of the incident, Dover was advised of misleveling problems with elevator number two. A repair order dated January 7 indicates that the 14 and 15 contacts were \u201cburned closed\u201d and that Bothell cleaned the contacts and replaced brushes. According to Donald Moynihan (\u201cMoynihan\u201d), Swann\u2019s expert in the field of elevator engineering, installation, design, and maintenance, elevator number two misleveled because the 14 and 15 contacts were filed clean rather than replaced. Although Dover did not present expert testimony on elevator maintenance and repair, Bothell testified that the elevator could not have misleveled any more than an inch based upon his observations and experience and, in any event, cleaning the 14 and 15 contacts was proper and adequate because the contacts were not welded together, they merely had an accumulation of crystallized dust particles.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Other facts will be provided, <em>infra, </em>as appropriate to the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Swann first contends that the trial court erred when it excluded testimony and other evidence that was both relevant and material to the issues in dispute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">\u201cFor an item of evidence to be admissible, it must be both relevant and material. Evidence is material if it tends to establish a proposition that has legal significance to the litigation. Evidence is relevant if it is sufficiently probative of a proposition that, if established, would have legal significance to the litigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-10\"><em>Wilson v. Morris, </em>317 Md. 284, 291, 563 A.2d 392 (1989) <em>(quoting Paige v. Manuzak, </em>57 Md.App. 621, 632, 471 A.2d 758, <em>cert, denied, </em>300 Md. 154, 476 A.2d 722 (1984)). This notwithstanding, we must adhere to \u201cthe long-standing principle that the admission or exclusion of evidence is a function of the trial court which, on appeal, is traditionally viewed with great latitude.\u201d <em>Ellsworth v. Sherne Lingerie, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>Inc., </em>60 Md.App. 104, 118, 481 A.2d 250 (1984), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>303 Md. 581, 495 A.2d 348 (1985). \u201cAn appellate court will only reverse upon finding that the trial judge\u2019s determination was \u2018both manifestly wrong and substantially injurious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lomax v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>88 Md.App. 50, 54, 591 A.2d 1311 (1991) <em>(quoting Paige, </em>57 Md.App. at 633, 471 A.2d 758).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">With these principles in mind, we shall consider whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to admit the evidence Swann proffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Newmont Elevator Company Study</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Swann offered evidence of an evaluation report the Newmont Elevator Company (an elevator consulting firm) prepared at Prudential\u2019s request. According to Swann, the report criticized Appellees for failing adequately to stock spare parts on site and failing to retain repair orders from Dover\u2019s service calls. Swann argues that the study is relevant and material to two issues: first, the inadequate supply of spare parts is relevant to the jury\u2019s resolution of whether a particular electrical contact should have been replaced during the service call immediately prior to the incident; and second, the failure to maintain call back and repair order records prevented recognition of the pattern of misleveling incidents occurring before the incident. Swann contends the study defines the standard of care owed by Appellees with respect to the care and maintenance of the elevator and therefore, is an exception to the rule excluding evidence of subsequent remedial measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Appellees point out, however, that the study was not prepared until November 1987 \u2014 nine months after the incident \u2014 and, therefore, the trial court properly excluded it. They assert that the report was not probative of a breach of duty owed by Prudential, CW, or Dover, or of any notice they may have had that the elevator would mislevel. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>The report was prepared nine months after the incident and is, therefore, not probative of notice or a breach of duty. The report is not a \u201csubsequent remedial measure\u201d because it is not a change in Appellees\u2019 conduct. Thus, the report does not define the standard of care. <em>See </em>5 Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Practice </em>\u00a7 407.1 (1987 &amp; Supp.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Also, the proffered evidence is cumulative to Moynihan\u2019s testimony. Moynihan testified that the spare parts maintained in the elevator control room were inadequate for preventive maintenance. Further, Moynihan testified that CW\u2019s failure to keep the call back and repair order records was a poor management technique and prevented them from recognizing the repetitive nature of the problem. The trial court \u201cmay exclude evidence deemed to be cumulative.\u201d <em>Lomax, </em>88 Md.App. at 54, 591 A.2d 1311. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude the report was not \u201cmanifestly wrong and substantially injurious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Post-Accident Misleveling Incidents</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Swann contends that the trial court precluded him from introducing evidence of misleveling incidents that occurred immediately after the February 2nd incident. Swann argues that subsequent misleveling incidents were relevant and material facts necessary to give the jury a perspective that demonstrates that Bothell, Dover\u2019s repairman, did not correct the problem with the elevator on the occasions prior to the incident. Swann maintains that this ruling prohibited him from fully developing his theory of negligence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">During a pre-trial hearing on a motion <em>in limine, </em>Swann argued that the post-incident occurrences were probative of the issues of notice and Appellees\u2019 ability to correct the misleveling problem. To support his position, Swann relied on <em>Hagan v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm \u2019n, </em>20 Md.App. 192, 314 A.2d 699 (1974), and cases cited therein, and in his brief cites <em>Wilson, </em>317 Md. 284, 563 A.2d 392. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Swann\u2019s reliance is misplaced. These cases involve situations where the plaintiff attempted to introduce evidence of subsequent remedial <em>measures, </em>or changes in subsequent <em>practices, </em>not evidence of similar post-incident <em>occurrences. </em>In <em>Wilson, </em>for example, the Court of Appeals held that a change in patient monitoring policies made after a patient was injured as the result of a fall from a wheelchair was \u201cadmissible as evidence of the standard of care required under the circumstances,\u201d although inadmissible as an <em>\u201cadmission </em>of negligence or culpability.\u201d 317 Md. at 301, 563 A.2d 392 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">It is clear that the subsequent incidents were not \u201csubsequent remedial measures,\u201d which based on Maryland law are admissible under limited circumstances. It was undisputed that the elevator misleveled on February 2nd. Evidence of mislevelings after the incident was irrelevant and would have been unduly prejudicial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Corporate Officials\u2019 Deposition Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"AEB\">The trial court refused to admit into evidence the deposition testimony of four Dover officials. Swann contends that the deposition testimony was relevant and material because it established: 1) there were numerous misleveling incidents nationwide greater than the one to two inches Bothell claimed was the maximum extent the elevator could mislevel; 2) Dover knew of the large number of misleveling accidents on similar elevators and was on notice of this type of problem; 3) Dover had a preventative maintenance checklist for use by mechanics; 4) Dover had a document retention policy; 5) the frequency and percentages of tripping accidents caused by misleveling accidents prior to February 2, 1987; and, 6) Dover knew of the existence of a substantial number of misleveling problems in its elevators and was on notice of the magnitude of the problem prior to February 2, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Appellees argue that since Count II, the product liability-count, was dismissed, the only remaining count was negligent elevator maintenance and repair, and therefore, much of the evidence Swann attempted to introduce was irrelevant. Appellees maintain that evidence of nationwide claims may have been relevant to Count II, but had no relevance as to whether they had notice of misleveling resulting from the improper maintenance or repair of elevator number two. Accordingly, the evidence would have confused the jury and prejudiced Appellees. As to the use of the exhibits during cross-examination of Bothell, Appellees contend that the court simply refused to allow cross-examination of Bothell on issues involving elevators that were not serviced by him or of which he had no personal knowledge. Appellees explain that all other excluded evidence was cumulative to the testimony of other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">We perceive no reversible error. Dover\u2019s document retention policy was admitted into evidence during Swann\u2019s direct examination of Moynihan. Furthermore, Bothell testified that Dover had a preventive maintenance checklist. Thus, the deposition testimony regarding Dover\u2019s document retention policy and preventive maintenance checklist was cumulative and its exclusion was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The deposition testimony indicating that Dover knew of misleveling problems in other elevators is not material to this case since Count II was dismissed. Other elevators could have had mechanical problems while elevator number two was operational. Conversely, elevator number two could have had mechanical problems while other elevators, nationwide, were operational. The jury could not make any rational inference regarding the alleged negligent repair and maintenance of elevator number two from the proffered deposition testimony. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See </em>McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 401.1, 402.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Swann attempted to impeach Bothell\u2019s testimony by introducing deposition testimony of misleveling incidents greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>than the one to two inches he claimed was the maximum extent the elevator could mislevel. As discussed in Section 11(C), <em>infra, </em>Bothell testified as a fact witness to his observations concerning elevator number two. The trial court, by excluding evidence of misleveling incidents that Bothell did not observe, properly limited cross-examination to Bot-hell\u2019s experience with elevator number two.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Swann next contends that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting testimony and other evidence otherwise inadmissible under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Evidence of Collateral Source Payments</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Swann argues that the court erred by allowing questions regarding Swann\u2019s receipt of workers\u2019 compensation and IBM\u2019s medical disability plan payments. Swann maintains that the evidence was being used in an attempt to reduce Appellees\u2019 liability by showing that Swann continued to receive income after the incident. Swann contends that the collateral source rule allows admission of collateral source payments only if there is a preliminary showing of malingering or exaggeration of injury and that there was no evidence supporting malingering or exaggeration <em>sub judiee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">In <em>Kelch v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>42 Md.App. 291, 400 A.2d 440 (1979), <em>aff'd, </em>287 Md. 223, 411 A.2d 449 (1980), we were faced with a near identical situation. In that case, the trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion <em>in limine </em>in which they requested that the trial court restrict the defendants \u201cfrom mentioning social security disability benefits being paid to the [plaintiff] since they were funds paid ... from a collateral source and the [defendant] was entitled to no credit in determining the jury\u2019s assessment of damages because of such collateral funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295, 400 A.2d 440. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>We turned to <em>Leizear v. Butler, </em>226 Md. 171, 172 A.2d 518 (1961), in which the Court of Appeals</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADYn\">noted with approval that the evidence of collateral payments is admissible if there is evidence in the case of malingering or exaggeration of injury but evidence as to collateral payments is inadmissible in the absence of evidence of malingering or exaggeration or where the real purpose of the evidence offered as to collateral sources is the mitigation of liability for damages of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><em>Kelch, </em>42 Md.App. at 296, 400 A.2d 440 (citations omitted). We held that the defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANh\">raised the issue of exaggeration of the plaintiffs injuries by the [defendants\u2019] cross-examination of the attending physician during which the physician conceded that there was, at least, a suggestion that the [plaintiff] was unwilling to work to seek employment possibly because the social security benefits the [plaintiff] received were greater than he might have earned if he were employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqv\"><em>Id. </em>at 296-97, 400 A.2d 440.</p>\n<p id=\"AN-T\">In the case <em>sub judiee, </em>the Appellees made clear during the pre-trial hearing on the motion <em>in limine </em>that the evidence was to be introduced solely to show Swann\u2019s motivation for not returning to work. During the trial, there was, \u201cat least, a suggestion\u201d of malingering and exaggeration. For example, Swann\u2019s job at IBM was sedentary in nature. Medical experts testified that Swann was capable of sedentary work. There was also evidence that there was \u201cno psychiatric disability that would keep [Swann] from working, and little in the way of physical.\u201d A vocational rehabilitation consultant testified that he saw no reason why Swann could not be in the work force. Furthermore, one of Swann\u2019s own treating physicians said that he \u201c[could] get on with his life.\u201d Swann testified that he never tried to get another job. In 1989, Swann was able to drive a car for long periods of time and cut his lawn. In 1990, he worked out at a gym three times a week, two hours each time, for three months. At the time of trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Swann did his own laundry and dishes, and bought his own groceries.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">At the conclusion of the trial, the court properly instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">Now, whenever evidence has been admitted for one purpose you should not consider it for any other purpose. If you decide that the plaintiff is entitled to recover lost earnings you are not to use any evidence of payment received by the plaintiff for sick leave or disability payments or workman\u2019s compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">Evidence of those payments have been admitted in this case for purposes other than the calculation of lost earnings such as it bears on the plaintiff\u2019s motivation to work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Furthermore, there was sufficient evidence of malingering and exaggeration, and Swann failed to establish that \u201cthe real purpose of the evidence offered as to collateral sources [was] the mitigation of liability for damages____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296, 400 A.2d 440. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted evidence of collateral source payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Late Disclosure of Expert Witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">Swann argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to exclude the testimony of improperly disclosed expert witnesses. He contends that Appellees were asked in interrogatories, on May 2, 1989, to identify expert witnesses expected to be called at trial, but, at the time, did not respond to the question. In a letter dated December 4, 1991, CW and Prudential first identified experts they intended to call at trial. The experts were also identified in CW and Prudential\u2019s calendar call statement filed December 19, 1991, in Dover\u2019s calendar call statement filed December 26, 1991, and in CW\u2019s and Prudential\u2019s answers to interrogatories received by Swann on December 31, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Swann filed a motion to exclude the testimony of Appellees\u2019 experts, which the trial court denied on January 3, 1992. Swann argues: 1) \u201cAppellees waited until the eve of trial which was scheduled for January 6, 1992 to disclose the experts hoping that this \u2018eleventh hour\u2019 tactic would interfere with [Swann\u2019s] counsel\u2019s trial preparation\u201d; and, 2) violated the trial court\u2019s order for pre-trial procedures which provided that all discovery be completed within 15 days of the Calendar Call (scheduled for December 26, 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Appellees maintain that the trial court correctly admitted testimony of their experts because Swann was notified of the identity of the experts, albeit informally, on December 4, 1991. Appellees explain that the notification was informal in keeping with the procedurally informal tone of the case, and that Swann deposed each of the experts prior to trial; therefore, Swann was not prejudiced by any violations of discovery rules or the trial court\u2019s pre-trial order.

Alexander, </em>55 Md.App. 344, 351, 462 A.2d 1216 (1983). \u201c \u2018A trial judge is vested with a large measure of discretion in applying sanctions for failure to adhere to the discovery rules.\u2019 \u201d <em>Snyder v. Snyder, </em>79 Md.App. 448, 461, 558 A.2d 412 <em>(quoting Starfish Condominium Assoc. v. Yorkridge Serv.

Although Appellees technically violated discovery rules and the court\u2019s pre-trial order, Swann was not prejudiced. Swann had an opportunity to, and did in fact, depose the experts prior to trial. Appellees\u2019 conduct may have made trial preparation more difficult, but they did not hamper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Swann\u2019s efforts. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion under the circumstances <em>sub judice. </em>We do not in any way intend to give the impression that we approve of Appellees\u2019 actions. Counsel should comply with discovery schedules, and when violated, sanctions may be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Opinions of Non-Expert Witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Swann also contends that the trial court erred by allowing opinion testimony of three lay witnesses whose testimony was offered to rebut Moynihan\u2019s expert testimony. According to Swann, Berman, CW\u2019s property manager, testified that: 1) there had been an evolution in the field of property management in the use of consultants; 2) as of February 2, 1987, no elevator consultant had criticized the maintenance and care being provided to the elevators located in Prudential\u2019s building; 3) Prudential and CW delegated all of the responsibility for the care of the elevators to Dover; 4) she was satisfied with Dover\u2019s performance in maintaining these elevators; and, 5) Appellees did not breach a duty of care owed in the maintenance of the elevators.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Furthermore, Swann alleges that Geist, CW\u2019s building engineer, rendered improper expert testimony when he: 1) stated that no elevator consultant ever criticized the maintenance Appellees provided before the incident; 2) opined that the maintenance records and spare parts were not necessary; 3) testified regarding the frequency and the nature of the elevator misleveling problem; and, 4) stated his opinion that if a problem existed, he would have known about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Swann also complains that Bothell gave expert opinion testimony that the accident could not have happened in the way described by Swann and Donovan, including an analysis of the operation of the number 14 contact and its effect upon the operation of the elevator.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">In short, Swann alleges that, because Appellees neither identified Berman, Geist, or Bothell as experts during dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>covery, nor qualified each as an expert at trial, the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the witnesses\u2019 testimony over objection. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u201cA lay witness may testify and give an opinion on matters as to which he or she has first-hand knowledge.\u201d <em>Waddell v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 54, 66, 582 A.2d 260 (1990). \u201cWhether to allow such testimony lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Yeagy v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 1, 22, 491 A.2d 1199 (1985). Furthermore, \u201cany nonexpert may testify to facts coming under his observation, even though the facts are such as are provable ordinarily by experts.\u201d <em>Galusca v. Dodd, </em>189 Md. 666, 669, 57 A.2d 313 (1948). Of course, in order to preserve for appellate review the issue of the admission of \u201copinion\u201d testimony, the complaining party must make a timely objection. \u201cAn objection to the admission of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent. Otherwise, the objection is waived.\u201d Rule 2-517(a). \u201cWhen a party has the option of objecting, his failure to do so is regarded as a waiver estopping him from obtaining review of that point on appeal.\u201d <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Bragg, </em>76 Md. App. 709, 719, 548 A.2d 151 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">First, Swann failed to object to Berman\u2019s testimony concerning the use of elevator consultants and CW\u2019s delegation to Dover of responsibility for the elevator\u2019s maintenance. Thus, we will not address Swann\u2019s contentions. <em>See Bragg, </em>76 Md.App. at 719, 548 A.2d 151. Second, Berman\u2019s testimony was not in response to a question calling for expert testimony. CW and Prudential asked Berman the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">Can you tell us as of February 2, 1987 and before whether or not anyone \u2014 when I say anyone I mean an elevator consultant, an official from the State of Maryland, some government agency or whatever \u2014 has ever proposed or recommended to you that [CW] keep and maintain records of complaints and elevator maintenance work for themselves?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The question merely asked whether Berman, based upon her experience as CW\u2019s property manager, had ever been advised by a consultant or state official regarding inadequate record-keeping. Swann argues that by testifying that CW had never been told that they were acting improperly, Berman, in essence, testified that Appellees did not breach a duty of care owed in the maintenance of the elevators. The jury might have inferred from Berman\u2019s testimony that Appellees did not breach its duty of care; however, Berman did not so testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Geist was asked whether \u201cin your experience not only with [CW] but at any point in time since 1959 has anyone ever recommended or suggested or proposed to you that you should keep and maintain records of an elevator company relating to any call backs, complaints and the maintenance of that elevator?\u201d For the same reasons as discussed <em>supra, </em>this was a proper question for a lay witness. Moreover, Swann argues that Geist offered an opinion that the maintenance records and spare parts were not necessary, but we are unable to find support for this assertion in the record. Swann directs us to pages 841-43 of the record extract. The only question preserved for our review on those pages is the question addressed, <em>supra. </em>We have carefully reviewed the remaining portion of Geist\u2019s testimony and are unable to find what Swann says is there.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Swann next complains that \u201cGeist was permitted, over objection, to testify about the frequency and the nature of the elevator misleveling problems.\u201d The only objection Swann made which appears in the record was to the <em>form </em>of the question, not to the fact the question called for improper expert testimony. Accordingly, the issue is not preserved for our review. <em>See Great Coastal Express, Inc. v. Schruefer, </em>34 Md.App. 706, 724, 369 A.2d 118 (\u201cif counsel volunteers his grounds at the time of the objection, he is bound on appeal to the grounds expressed\u201d), <em>cert, denied, </em>280 Md. 730 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Geist also testified that if a problem existed with the elevator, he would have known about it. Swann asserts that the question called for expert opinion testimony. Although Geist gave his \u201copinion\u201d in the technical sense of the word, the opinion was based on first-hand knowledge and was not of the sort typically given by an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Swann also complains that Bothell \u201ctestified in explicit detail about the operation of the number 14 contact and its effect upon the operation of the elevator\u201d and that this was opinion testimony reserved for an expert. Again, we shall not address Swann\u2019s contention because Swann did not object to this line of questioning. <em>See Bragg, </em>76 Md.App. at 719, 548 A.2d 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Swann did, however, preserve for review the question whether the trial court erred in admitting Bothell\u2019s testimony that the accident could not have occurred in the way it was described by Swann and Donovan. Bothell testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">Q How much of a \u2014 . Basically because of the mechanism, the clutch that you are talking about, is there a point can there be a misleveling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">A Yes, there could be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">Q How much of a misleveling could there be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">MR. FISHBEIN: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\">THE WITNESS: Misleveling to what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-12\">I mean, what are you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-13\">BY MR. QUINN:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-14\">Q At the floor where the elevator, the car would stop either above or below a floor. Can that happen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-15\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-16\">Q And is there based upon \u2014 . To what extent could that be? Could it be five inches, ten inches, one inch, what could it be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-17\">MR. FISHBEIN: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-18\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>A I can only say one inch <em>because that is all I have ever seen.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">Q And the one inch would be what, could it be above or below?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">A It could be either way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">Q Now, what you have just \u2014 . Again what you have stated, <em>is that the circumstances that you have observed during the time that you have been servicing the elevator at [Prudential\u2019s building </em>]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">A Yes, to all four [elevators]. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">(Emphasis added). It is clear from Bothell\u2019s testimony that his opinion was based solely on his observations of, and experience with, the elevators in Prudential\u2019s building. During cross-examination the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">Q Now, sir, you have expressed the opinion today that an elevator cannot mislevel by more than an inch or two, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">A I said I have never seen one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">We are satisfied that Bothell did not render an expert opinion. He simply stated that he never observed Prudential\u2019s elevators mislevel by more that an inch or two. <em>See Galusca, </em>189 Md. at 669, 57 A.2d 313. Thus, the trial court properly allowed the testimony since it was based on Bot-hell\u2019s first-hand knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">(D)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">Race Discrimination Suit</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">Swann argues the trial court erred by allowing Appellees to ask Swann whether he was a party to a lawsuit against IBM. Swann contends the lawsuit, in which he alleged racial discrimination, played no part in the decision of Mr. Yingling, Swann\u2019s supervisor, or Dr. Corey, IBM\u2019s medical advisor, to recommend that Swann be placed on medical disability. Therefore, Swann maintains the suit was not relevant to the issues in the case. Swann adds that the two supervisors who made the decision to recommend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Swann for medical disability testified that they did not know of the discrimination suit until the eve of the trial <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Appellees contend the evidence was relevant to Swann\u2019s credibility, and therefore admissible. According to Appellees, Swann\u2019s theory of the case included the fact that he was permanently disabled, and retired from IBM on a medical disability as a result of the elevator incident. Appellees maintain: 1) that Swann was a disgruntled employee who was being harassed by his supervisor; 2) that, contrary to his testimony, he would not have remained at IBM until retirement age of 65; 3) that he was not motivated to return to work; and, 4) that IBM was motivated to grant him medical disability. Thus, Appellees argue the evidence was relevant to Swann\u2019s credibility, as well as to the theory that he received the medical disability for reasons other than the elevator incident. We agree. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Swann next contends that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on several theories. A party is generally entitled to have its theory of the case presented to the jury if two conditions are satisfied: \u201c(1) the instruction ... correctly state[s] the law, and (2) that law [is] applicable in light of the evidence before the jury.\u201d <em>Sergeant Co. v. Pickett, </em>285 Md. 186, 194, 401 A.2d 651 (1979). If these conditions are met, and the trial court nevertheless refuses to instruct the jury, the court errs as a matter of law. <em>See id. </em>at 204, 401 A.2d 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Res Ipsa Loquitur</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">\u201c \u2018The difficulties arising from the barrel of flour which rolled out of a warehouse window in 1863 and into the lives of tort lawyers,\u2019 compounded by Baron Pollock\u2019s casual statement (\u2018 <em>\u201cres ipsa </em>loquitur\u201d \u2019) during argument of the case <em>Byrne v. Boadle, </em>159 Eng.Rep. 299 (1863) are still with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>us today.\u201d <em>Blankenship v. Wagner, </em>261 Md. 37, 38-39, 273 A.2d 412 (1971). Swann argues that the trial court erred when it refused to instruct the jury on <em>res ipsa loquitur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Appellees do not contend Swann\u2019s requested instruction does not correctly state the law. In fact, Swann\u2019s proposed instruction was based on Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instruction 19:5. <em>See </em>MICPEL, <em>Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instructions </em>446 (1984). Appellees argue the second prong of <em>Pickett\u2019s, </em>two-part test was not satisfied, i.e., there was insufficient evidence before the jury to warrant a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">We note preliminarily that both Swann and Appellees are apparently under the impression that the proposed <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction was applicable to Prudential, CW, and Dover. The record clearly indicates, however, that the proposed instruction only made reference to Dover. It did not mention Prudential or CW. Accordingly, we shall consider only whether the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>with respect to Dover\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The law concerning the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>was reviewed at length in <em>Chesapeake and Potomac Tel. Co. v. Hicks, 25 </em>Md.App. 503, 337 A.2d 744, <em>cert, denied, </em>275 Md. 750 (1975). In <em>Hicks, </em>we recounted the evolution of what is now a three-part test to determine the doctrine\u2019s applicability. In order to invoke the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>the plaintiff must establish:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">\u201c1. A casualty of a sort which usually does not occur in the absence of negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">2. Caused by an instrumentality within the defendant\u2019s exclusive control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\">3. Under circumstances indicating that the casualty did not result from the act or omission of the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-10\"><em>Hicks, 25 </em>Md.App. at 516, 337 A.2d 744 <em>(quoting Leikach v. Royal Crown Bottling Co., </em>261 Md. 541, 547-48, 276 A.2d 81 (1971)); <em>see also Giant Food, Inc. v. Washington Coca-Cola Bottling Co., </em>273 Md. 592, 597, 332 A.2d 1 (1975); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>Ramsey v. D.P.A.

Once the tripartite test is met,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">[t]he doctrine ... provides a permissible inference of negligence. This means that the inference of negligence to be drawn from the circumstances is left to the jury. They are permitted, but not compelled to find it. As for the plaintiff, the doctrine furnishes sufficient evidence to go to the trier of fact. As for the defendant, the burden of proof is not shifted to him, nor is any burden of introducing evidence cast upon him, except in the very limited sense that if he fails to do so, he runs the risk that the trier of fact may ... find against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\"><em>Hicks, </em>25 Md.App. at 529-30, 337 A.2d 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Appellees cite <em>Beach v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, Inc., </em>18 Md.App. 645, 308 A.2d 439 (1973), for the proposition that a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction must only be given after the plaintiff proves each of the three elements by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Beach, </em>however, does not support Appellees\u2019 formulation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 328D (1964) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">(2) It is the function of the court to determine whether the inference may reasonably be drawn by the jury, or whether it must necessarily be drawn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">(3) It is the function of the jury to determine whether the inference is to be drawn in any case where different conclusions may reasonably be reached.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Comment e to \u00a7 328D adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">It is enough that the facts proved reasonably permit the conclusion that negligence is the more probable explanation. <em>This conclusion is not for the court to draw, or to refuse to draw, in any case where either conclusion is reasonable; </em>and even though the court would not itself find negligence, it must still leave the question to the jury if reasonable men might do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>(Emphasis added). Accordingly, the trial court must instruct the jury on <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>if it believes the jury, after considering the evidence, or making rational inferences therefrom, <em>could reasonably find </em>that the plaintiff proved each element by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Fields v. Morgan, </em>39 Md.App. 82, 83, 382 A.2d 1099 (1978) (discussed in Section III(A)(3), <em>infra)', Beach, </em>18 Md.App. at 649-50, 308 A.2d 439 (\u201cWhether a jury would accept appellant\u2019s testimony as credible ... is a question for the jury, not the courts, to decide.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">Before we turn to each of the three elements, it is important to address first an issue not raised by the parties. At trial, Swann introduced specific evidence of Dover\u2019s (i.e., Bothell\u2019s) negligence: 1) its failure to replace the 14 and 15 contacts; 2) its failure to spend adequate time maintaining the elevator; 3) its failure to stock an adequate supply of spare parts in Prudential\u2019s building; and, 4) its failure to use a preventive maintenance checklist. This raises the question of whether a plaintiff, who makes out a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence based on evidence of specific acts of negligence, may rely on the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>and have the jury instructed on both negligence and <em>res ipsa loquitur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In earlier cases, the Court of Appeals held that \u201cif there is direct evidence of negligence, and all the facts causing the injury are known and testified to by witnesses at the trial,\u201d <em>Frenkil v. Johnson, </em>175 Md. 592, 605, 3 A.2d 479 (1939), \u201cthere is no basis for the application of <em>[res ipsa loquitur],\" Armour &amp; Co. v. Leasure, </em>177 Md. 393, 411, 9 A.2d 572 (1939). <em>See also Smith v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>214 Md. 560, 566, 136 A.2d 386 (1957), and cases cited therein; Recent Decision, <em>Torts </em>\u2014 Res <em>Ipsa Loquitur Not Available To Plaintiff Who Attempts to Prove Specific Acts of Negligence, </em>22 Md.L.Rev. 174 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">For example, in <em>Smith v. Bernfeld, </em>226 Md. 400, 174 A.2d 53 (1961), the plaintiffs brought suit for personal injuries and medical expenses incurred as the result of a fall from a beauty salon chair. The plaintiffs attempted to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>defendant\u2019s negligence by offering evidence to indicate that the chair was defectively constructed, and that defendant\u2019s employees knew of its defective nature, yet failed to bolt the chair to the floor or provide another type of chair which would not tip over. Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e, speaking for the Court of Appeals, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">[W]e think that the plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to establish specific grounds of alleged negligence precludes recourse to the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur. Smith v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>214 Md. 560, 566, 136 A.2d 386; <em>Maszezenski v. Myers, </em>212 Md. 346, 352, 129 A.2d 109; <em>Coastal Tank Lines v.

We accordingly hold that the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>is not available to the plaintiffs here.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\"><em>Id. </em>226 Md. at 409, 174 A.2d 53. Seven months later, however, Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e qualified the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">[I]t seems desirable to point out a limitation upon the scope of [the <em>Smith </em>] opinion. In that case all of the facts with regard to the actual happening of the accident had been developed, and when developed, they were held insufficient to establish negligence on the part of the defendant. It was in that context that we said ... that \u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to establish specific grounds of alleged negligence precludes recourse to the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur.\u201d </em>Each of the cases cited in support of this statement was a case in which the facts had been similarly disclosed; and the plaintiff\u2019s difficulty was that the evidence did not stop at the point of showing the happening of the accident under circumstances in which negligence of the defendant was a permissible inference ..., but went further and showed how the accident happened and so removed the basis for invoking the doctrine ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">On the facts of <em>Smith v.

We adhere to the rule as stated by Judge Hammond in the <em>Coastal Tank Lines </em>case: \u201cWe think that \u2018the facts and the demands of justice\u2019 do not require that an inference be permitted to be drawn as a matter of right where all of the circumstances of the occurrence are shown by the testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\"><em>Nalee, Inc. v.

Wagner, </em>261 Md. 37, 273 A.2d 412 (1971), made clear that an attempt to prove specific acts of negligence does not necessarily preclude reliance on the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In <em>Blankenship, </em>the plaintiff, a delivery man, sustained personal injuries while moving a refrigerator into defendant\u2019s home.

Plaintiff then rested his case, relying on <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>and the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">On appeal, the Court held that this was a proper case for submission to the jury on <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>and stated that plaintiff \u201cmight properly have attempted to prove more than he did without weakening his reliance on <em>res ipsa </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>loquitur.\" Id. </em>at 45, 273 A.2d 412. The Court then embarked on a discussion of its earlier cases, including <em>Smith </em>and <em>Jacobs.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">Early in this Court\u2019s consideration of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>we held that when a plaintiff relies on the doctrine and its attendant inferences, it must not appear from <em>the plaintiffs own evidence </em>that something other than the defendant\u2019s negligence caused the accident. This concept was logically extended so that \u201cwhere all the facts and circumstances are shown by testimony,\u201d whether it was introduced by plaintiff <em>or defendant, </em>and that evidence shows that the injury might have been caused by something other than the defendant\u2019s negligence, <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>would not apply, because there would no longer be any need for relying on an inference. In <em>Smith v. Bernfeld, </em>Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e, speaking for the Court, stated that the <em>attempt </em>by the plaintiffs in that case to prove specific grounds of negligence precluded their relying on the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>However, in <em>Nalee, Inc. v. Jacobs, </em>an opinion also written by Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e only 7 months after <em>Smith v. Bernfeld, </em>he explained that the attempts by the plaintiffs in <em>Smith </em>to establish specific grounds of negligence had precluded their relying on <em>res ipsa loquitur only </em>because they had <em>proved all of the facts </em>regarding the accident and were unable to show that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused the injury. He specifically disavowed any intention in <em>Smith </em>of extending the rule of the earlier cases----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">If the plaintiff has circumstantial evidence which tends to show the defendant\u2019s negligence (and which is therefore <em>consistent </em>with the inference relied upon in <em>res ipsa loquitur) he should not as a matter of policy be discouraged from coming forth with it. </em>If, however, the evidence introduced by the plaintiff or the defendant shows that everything relative to the case is known, and that the injury might have been caused by something other than defendant\u2019s negligence (thereby negating the inference normally relied upon in <em>res ipsa loquitur), </em>then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the plaintiff will not be allowed to avail himself of the doctrine. In such a case, if plaintiffs proof fails to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence then it is proper to direct a verdict for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><em>Id. </em>261 Md. at 45-46, 273 A.2d 412 (citations omitted) (emphasis added in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In light of <em>Blankenship, </em>it is clear that Maryland is aligned with the majority of American jurisdictions which hold that \u201can unsuccessful attempt to prove specific negligence on the defendant\u2019s part, or the introduction of evidence of specific negligence not clearly establishing the precise cause of injury, will not deprive the plaintiff of the benefits otherwise available under the doctrine [of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>].\u201d Annotation, <em>Evidence of Specific Negligence as Affecting Reliance on Res Ipsa Loquitur, </em>33 A.L.R.2d 791, 793 (1954).

Swann also attempted to prove that Dover negligently maintained the elevator. Swann did not, however, purport to furnish a complete explanation of the accident. Indeed, Swann offered evidence establishing that Dover responded to reports of mislevelings on two separate occasions following the January 7th repair. There was no evidence of what, if any, corrective measures Dover took on those dates. It may well be that Dover negligently repaired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the elevator on one, or both, of those occasions and such negligent act or acts caused the February 2nd misleveling incident. Further, at the close of the evidence, there was a dispute as to what caused the accident. Bothell testified that it was proper to clean, rather than replace, the 14 and 15 contacts, and that the door clutch mechanism prevents the elevator doors from opening when the elevator cab is greater than an inch or two from floor level. Therefore, \u201creasonable men might [have] differed] as to the effect of the evidence before the jury.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">[E]ven though the jury could have properly found- that the accident was caused by such a specific act of negligence, and was so instructed by the trial court, it has been held that the mere fact that the plaintiff seeks to bolster his case by specific evidence should not compel him to forgo reliance on <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>or to elect between res ipsa and specific negligence, unless the proof adduced by the plaintiff actually refutes or negates the inference which might otherwise be drawn from application of the doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5:20, at 193 (citation omitted). In this case, evidence that Dover negligently repaired and maintained elevator number two neither refutes nor negates the inference of negligence supplied by the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>In fact, the evidence, if believed, supports and is consistent with an inference of negligence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">The evidence of Dover\u2019s negligent repair and maintenance may merely support one of the many possible explanations of the accident, known or unknown. If the jury finds that it was the specifically proved act of negligence which occasioned the accident, that is the end of the matter. But, if the jury deems the specific evidence unconvincing, there is no reason whatever why it may not infer that the remaining possible causes, though they be unidentified, still point to the negligence of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afb\"><em>Id. </em>at 194.

[The evidence] may, if credited, lead to a finding of specific negligence____ In that case[,] the doctrine of [res ipsa loquitur] is not needed. <em>But if the proof of that explanation fails (either because it is legally insufficient or because it is not credited), the mere fact that it was offered has no logical tendency to eliminate other explanations involving ... negligence ..., and there is no sound basis for denying application of the </em>doctrine....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">4 Fowler V.

We are likewise satisfied that a reasonable jury could rationally infer that an elevator does not ordinarily mislevel in the absence of someone\u2019s negligence. <em>See Beach, </em>18 Md.App. at 649, 308 A.2d 439 (\u201cIt is a rational inference that escalators do not ordinarily stop, then start up with a jerk, without negligence.\u201d); <em>Bigio v.

Appellees, however, take issue with the second and third elements of the <em>Hicks </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Appellees argue that Swann\u2019s alleged injuries were not \u201ccaused by an instrumentality within the [Appellees\u2019] exclusive control.\u201d Appellees contend the elevator was not within the exclusive control of Appellees because IBM was the only tenant in the building, and IBM was not named as a defendant. They reason that IBM, as sole tenant of the premises, shared control over the elevators which negates the element of Appellees\u2019 exclusive control. In light of the fact that Swann only preserved the issue of whether a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction was appropriate as against Dover, we do not consider whether Appellees had joint exclusive control over the elevator. We shall only address whether Dover had \u201cexclusive control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">We recently addressed the element of exclusive control in <em>Harris v. Otis Elevator Co., </em>92 Md.App. 49, 606 A.2d 305 (1992). In <em>Harris, </em>the plaintiff was injured when she alighted from an elevator which had misleveled three to six inches below floor level. At the time of the accident, the elevator was being used to carry passengers. At other times, however, the elevator had been used to carry freight. The plaintiff testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">\u201cA: [Persons using the elevator for freight purposes] would load it, they would bang it against the top of the elevator, if they could not fit a piece into the elevator, they would shove it in. I have seen where doors have been jammed open, and tried to \u2014 the furniture being moved out, if they have not been able to get it around the corner, it \u2014 that is what I would interpret as being mishandled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Q: Did you see them putting things in front of the door so they would not shut, so they are kind of banging open and banging open?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">A: Yes \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 54, 606 A.2d 305. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment because \u201cthe use and operation of the elevator by other tenants precluded a finding that [the elevator repair company] possessed exclusive control of the elevator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 606 A.2d 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">We held that the elevator repair company was not in exclusive control of the elevator. In doing so, we relied on <em>Smith v. Kelly, </em>246 Md. 640, 229 A.2d 79 (1967). In <em>Smith, </em>the plaintiff, a patron of defendant\u2019s laundromat, was injured when a piece of a drum of an extractor broke off and was flung from the drum which contained a spinner basket revolving at 1750 r.p.m. The trial court directed a verdict for the defendants. After summarizing the conditions required for the application of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>the Court of Appeals determined that it was not applicable to the facts of the case. The Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">The extractor located on appellees\u2019 premises was in constant use for various periods of time by members of the public who had exclusive possession and control over it while it was in use.

Thus it has been held that the inference is not permissible where the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony tends to show an exculpatory cause, or where the lapse of time and the opportunity for interference by others weakens the probability that the injury is attributable to the defendant\u2019s act or omission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgCE\">(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In <em>Harris, </em>there was substantial evidence that the elevator was subject to abuse and mishandling. Likewise in <em>Smith, </em>the washing machine was constantly used, and perhaps abused, by patrons. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, the jury could have found that there was no such exculpatory cause and that others had no opportunity to interfere with the elevator\u2019s mechanical components.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">The logical basis for [the exclusive control] requirement is simply that it must appear that the negligence of which the thing speaks is probably that of defendant and not of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">The fallacy of the \u201cexclusive control\u201d test is seen in many situations where the doctrine [of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>] is unhesitatingly applied despite absence of \u201ccontrol.\u201d Where for instance the defendant\u2019s duty of care with respect to the injuring agency is (as to the plaintiff) nondelegable, the fact that control may have been in an independent contractor will not preclude the application of the doctrine. And there are many situations where \u201cit is clear that \u2018control\u2019 is simply the wrong word.\u201d Where a fuse misfires, or a bottle explodes, the inference of negligence may still point to the manufacturer or bottler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>if the proof eliminates the probability of other causes, even though the mishap occurs at a time and place remote from defendant\u2019s control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Harper, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 19.7 (2d ed. 1986) (footnotes omitted); <em>see also Leikach, </em>261 Md. at 548, 276 A.2d 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The majority of states considering the exclusive control issue under facts similar to those <em>sub judice </em>have concluded that an elevator maintenance company is in exclusive control of an elevator it services.

The trial court instructed the jury on negligence and <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>and the jury returned a plaintiff\u2019s verdict. Defendant appealed and challenged, in part, the propriety of the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, held that the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction was appropriate given the fact that plaintiff adduced sufficient evidence of the three elements necessary to invoke the doctrine. The Court acknowledged that the second element, \u201cexclusive control of the instrumentality, [was] shown, given [the building owner\u2019s] reliance upon defendant\u2019s expertise to inspect and maintain the intricate devices of the elevator in reasonably safe operating condition, pursuant to the service agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>495 N.Y.S.2d at 380.

The building owner\u2019s director of engineering, however, \u201cperiodically inspect[ed the defendant\u2019s] work, look[ed] at the elevator and elevator rooms to insure they were in proper order, and occasionally watch[ed the defendant] service the elevators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>828 P.2d at 586. \u201c[I]f a part needed replacement [the repairman] would go to [the building owner] for authorization____\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court reasoned that \u201c[b]ecause [the building owner] retained some control over the elevators, and because its contract with [defendant] was only a limited service contract, [defendant] did not have exclusive control of the elevators.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Other states have considered the exclusive control element in cases with facts materially different from those <em>sub judice </em>and have concluded that <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>was inapplicable. <em>See, e.g., Stines v.

It may be established by evidence sufficient to warrant an inference of its existence, and circumstantial evidence may suffice. The plaintiff is not required in his proof to exclude remotely possible causes and reduce the question of control to a scientific certainty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><em>Leidenfrost v. Atlantic Masonry, Inc., </em>235 Md. 244, 250, 201 A.2d 336 (1964). Although the Agreement purported to place \u201cpossession or control\u201d of the elevator with CW, we hold that the contract\u2019s language is not controlling. <em>See Street, </em>327 So.2d at 114 (\u201cRes ipsa loquitur is applicable where, as here, the defendant manufactures, installs, and maintains an automatic passenger elevator even though the maintenance contract purports to place control or possession in the building owner.\u201d). \u201cThe crucial point is the actual control of the elevator system____\u201d <em>Id. But see Bryan, </em>163 S.E.2d at 537 (contractual provision controls).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Dover manufactured, installed, and was under a continuing contractual obligation to maintain and repair elevator number two. CW was obligated to prohibit others from making repairs or adjustments to the elevator. There was absolutely no evidence indicating that Prudential, CW, or IBM attempted to repair the elevator. At most, GW\u2019s building engineer would turn the elevator off when IBM notified him of a mechanical failure. \u201cIn sum, [CW and Prudential] relied upon [Dover], as an expert in elevator maintenance, to locate and remedy any defects, and in such capacity, [the jury could have reasonably inferred that Dover] had exclusive control of the inspection and maintenance of [elevator number two].\u201d <em>See Weeden, </em>468 N.Y.S.2d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Furthermore, there was no evidence suggesting that the elevator was tampered with, altered in any way, or subjected to abuse. The elevator was used in an office building, presumably in its intended manner. <em>Cf. Harris, </em>92 Md.App. at 54, 606 A.2d 305; <em>Parise, </em>136 N.E.2d at 116-17. During <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>a six week period preceding the incident, Dover was notified four times of misleveling problems with the elevator. Repairs were made to the elevator, and according to Moynihan, cleaning, rather than replacing, the 14 and 15 contacts caused the misleveling incident. \u201cTo require [Swann] to establish exclusive control in [Dover] with respect to <em>any possible cause </em>of the accident before permitting the application of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>would <em>emasculate the doctrine. </em>He was required, <em>as was done, </em>only to produce sufficient evidence from which it could be said that it was more likely than not that it was negligence on the part of [Dover].\u201d <em>See Briscoe, </em>572 P.2d at 537. The trial court should have left the question of exclusive control for the jury which could have reasonably inferred from the evidence that only Dover\u2019s negligence caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">We now turn to the last element of <em>res ipsa loquitur: </em>\u201cunder circumstances indicating that the casualty did not result from the act or omission of the plaintiff.\u201d Appellees maintain that Swann\u2019s negligence contributed to the accident. We addressed this issue in <em>Fields v. Morgan, </em>39 Md.App. 82, 382 A.2d 1099 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In <em>Fields, </em>the plaintiff brought suit against the driver of a car in which he was riding after he sustained personal injuries when the car crashed into a tree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 84, 382 A.2d 1099. At the close of plaintiffs case, the trial court ruled that <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>was inapplicable and granted the driver\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. We held that the doctrine was applicable and remanded the case for a new trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>During the trial [plaintiff], through the testimony of a police officer, introduced a statement made by [the driver] to the effect that after striking the pedestrian he wanted to stop but [plaintiff] insisted he continue.

The elevator had misleveled by twelve to eighteen inches, placing the distance between the floor and the roof of the elevator at five feet, six inches to six feet. Swann\u2019s human factors expert testified that it was possible an individual would not notice that an elevator misleveled under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The trial court sent the issue of Appellees\u2019 negligence to the jury. The court also instructed the jury on contributory negligence. Obviously, the court believed there was a factual dispute as to both Appellees\u2019 <em>and Swann\u2019s </em>negligence. Although we do not know, it may very well be that the jury found Swann was contributorily negligent. Never<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>theless, the jury <em>could have reasonably found </em>Swann proved all three elements of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>by a preponderance of the evidence, and therefore, the trial court erred in not instructing the jury as requested. By refusing to give a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction, the trial court substituted its own judgment for that of the jury. A new trial is ordered, but only as to Dover.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The dissent is concerned with two aspects of the majority opinion. First, the dissent points to the fact that Swann \u201cmarshalled evidence to show the precise cause of the misleveling \u2014 the malfunction of the contacts \u2014 and to show as well that Dover was negligent in not replacing those contacts prior to the accident.\u201d The dissent concludes that \u201c[w]hen the plaintiffs case is so built around a specific, articulated cause of the event and endeavors to show that that cause arose solely because of specific negligence on the defendant\u2019s part,\u201d he should not be able to \u201cavail himself of an inference that the event arose from some <em>other </em>cause, also engendered by the defendant\u2019s negligence\u201d (emphasis in original). The dissent is concerned that this would allow a plaintiff to rely on <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>in every negligence case.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">First, a plaintiff is entitled to a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction only when <em>Hicks\u2019 </em>tripartite test is satisfied. Only a minority of negligence cases call for such an instruction. Therefore, in that respect, the dissent\u2019s concern is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Second, by introducing specific evidence that the failure to replace the contacts on January 7th caused the misleveling, Swann did not purport to furnish a complete explanation of the accident. There were other unknowns. For example, Swann introduced evidence that Dover responded to two separate reports of mislevelings subsequent to the January 7th repair. Not in evidence was what, if any, corrective measures Dover took on those occasions. The jury was free to accept or reject Swann\u2019s expert testimony regarding the January 7th repair. If the jury believed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>cleaning, rather than replacing, the contact was proper, or that the alleged defective contact did not cause the misleveling, Swann should not, as a matter of policy, be precluded from relying on an inference of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The dissent\u2019s \u201csecond concern is with the notion that elevators don\u2019t mislevel absent someone\u2019s negligence.\u201d The dissent suggests that \u201c[mjechanical, electrical, and electronic devices fail or malfunction routinely [due to] [a] speck of dust, a change in temperature, misuse, [or] an accidental unforeseen trauma.\u201d It may be true that mechanical, electrical, and electronic devices fail due to non-negligent causes. The dissent, however, confuses probabilism with absolutism.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The first element of <em>Hicks </em>requires only that the \u201ccasualty [was] of a sort which <em>usually </em>does not occur in the absence of negligence.\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>25 Md.App. at 516, 337 A.2d 744 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">[T]he majority of cases hold that a plaintiff to come within the res ipsa loquitur doctrine need not show such a state of facts surrounding the accident as excludes any reasonable hypothesis except defendant\u2019s negligence. If the attendant facts raise a reasonable inference of defendant\u2019s negligence, they need not also exclude every other inference. Plaintiff under this view is not required to exclude or negative all other possible causes of the accident except that of defendant\u2019s negligence, but need only demonstrate a \u201cbalance of probabilities\u201d pointing to the defendant\u2019s negligence as a cause of the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay4\">Speiser, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2:5, at 41-42 (footnotes omitted). Consequently, <em>res ipsa loquitur</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">has been applied to a wide variety of situations, and its range is as broad as the possible events which reasonably justify such a conclusion. It finds common application, for example, in the case of objects such as bricks or window panes falling from the defendant\u2019s premises, <em>falling elevators, </em>the collapse of structures, live stock loose on the highway, the escape of gas or water from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>mains, or of electricity from wires or appliances, the explosion of boilers or other objects under the defendant\u2019s control, or the escape of dust or noxious gases from his premises, the sudden starting of machinery, the detachment of wheels from moving vehicles, injuries to passengers from causes within the control of the carrier, such as derailment, the sudden stop of a bus, or its defective equipment, some kinds of automobile accidents, such as a car suddenly leaving the highway and going into a ditch or colliding with a stationary object, or starting down hill not long after it has been parked at the curb, defective food in sealed containers, and many other similar occurrences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">W. Page Keaton et al., <em>Prosser and Keaton on the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 39, at 244-45 (5th ed. 1984) (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In <em>Montgomery Elevator Co. v. Gordon, </em>619 P.2d 66 (Colo. 1980), the Supreme Court of Colorado considered whether an elevator door closing on a passenger was the kind of event which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of negligence. The Court concluded it was, relying, in great part, bn the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">\u201cThe plaintiff need not, however, conclusively exclude all other possible explanations and so prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt.... It is enough that the facts proved reasonably permit the conclusion that negligence is the more probable explanation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 69 <em>(quoting </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 328D cmt. e (1964)); <em>see also </em>Keaton, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 39, at 248 (\u201cThe plaintiff is not required to eliminate with certainty all other possible causes or inferences, which would mean that the plaintiff must prove a civil case beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). For a misleveling case similar to the one <em>sub judice, </em>with expert testimony similar to that presented in the court below, see <em>Daniels v. Standard Oil Realty Corp., </em>145 Ill.App.3d 363, 99 Ill.Dec. 284, 288, 495 N.E.2d 1019, 1023 (1986), <em>cert, denied, </em>where the Court held that \u201c[i]n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>the normal course of events, an elevator does not operate as the elevator here did, and when it does, negligence is a more likely cause than other causes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the jury could have reasonably concluded that negligence was a more likely cause than other causes. This is all the first element of the <em>Hicks </em>test requires. The ultimate determination of negligence is for the jury. Therefore, since this is, at worst, a borderline case, the jury, and not the court, should decide. <em>See Ruiz v. Otis Elevator, </em>146 Ariz. 98, 703 P.2d 1247, 1250 (Ct.App. 1985) (whether an elevator malfunction would ordinarily not occur absent someone\u2019s negligence is a jury question in borderline cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Missing Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Swann argues that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury regarding alleged missing evidence. According to Swann, Dover failed to produce all of the repair order tickets from the repair calls made between December 1986 and the date of the incident. He claims the failure to retain these documents was in direct conflict with Dover\u2019s document retention policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Swann did not preserve the issue for our review. Thus, we do not reach the merits of his argument. Although Swann submitted a proposed jury instruction regarding missing evidence, Swann did not object to the trial court\u2019s failure to give the instruction to the jury. \u201cNo party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.\u201d Rule 2-520(e); <em>Barone v. Winebrenner, </em>189 Md. 142, 145, 55 A.2d 505 (1947) (\u201cThe purpose, of course, in requiring exceptions to be made to the instructions of the trial judge before the jury retires is to give that judge an opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>to correct or add to his instructions matters either first erroneously stated or omitted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Violation of a Statute as Evidence of Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"Az_\">Swann argues the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury that the violation of a statute is evidence of negligence. Swann cites Maryland Annotated Code article 83B, \u00a7 6-102 (1991), and asserts that it \u201cauthorizes the Maryland Department of Housing and Community [sic] to develop and promulgate appropriate building codes to protect the public when it uses buildings in this State.\u201d Swann continues by pointing out that \u201cthe Department adopted, and incorporated by reference, the ANSI A117.1 Building Code\u201d which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">Elevator operation shall be automatic. Each car shall be equipped with a self-leveling feature that will automatically bring the car to floor landings within a tolerance of <em>k </em>in (13 mm) under rated loading to zero loading conditions. This self-leveling feature shall be automatic and independent of the operating device and shall correct for overtravel or undertravel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">American National Standard Institute, Inc., <em>American National Standard for Buildings and Facilities </em>\u2014 Providing <em>Accessibility and Usability for Physically Handicapped People </em>\u00a7 4.10.2 (1986) (hereinafter \u201cANSI A117.1\u201d); <em>see also </em>COMAR 05.02.02.02(B). Swann contends that since Moynihan testified that the above provision applies in Maryland, and since he is \u201cwithin the class of people governed [sic] by these provisions,\u201d the court erred in failing to instruct the jury as requested. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">\u201cIt is well settled in Maryland that a violation of a building code can be evidence of breach of a duty owed.\u201d <em>Gardenvillage Realty Corp. v. Russo, </em>34 Md.App. 25, 30, 366 A.2d 101 (1976). It is equally settled, however, that \u201c[t]he violation of a [code] may furnish evidence of negligence ... only where the person alleging negligence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>within the class of persons sought to be protected, and the harm suffered is of the kind which the [code] was intended, in general, to prevent.\u201d <em>Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kenney, </em>323 Md. 116, 124, 591 A.2d 507 (1991) (citation omitted). Further, the violation of a code must be a proximate cause of the harm. <em>Id. </em>at 127, 591 A.2d 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Article 83B, \u00a7 6-102(a)(l) of the Annotated Code of Maryland provides: \u201cThe Department ... shall promulgate and adopt a State building code for the purpose of developing rules and regulations <em>for making buildings and facilities accessible and usable by the physically </em>handicapped____\u201d (emphasis added). In response to \u00a7 6-102(a)(l)\u2019s directive, the Department of Housing and Community Development promulgated the \u201cMaryland Building Code for the Handicapped.\u201d COMAR 05.02.02. The purpose of the code \u201cis to establish minimum requirements that will provide a reasonable degree of accessibility and usability of buildings and facilities <em>by the physically handicapped.\u201d </em>COMAR 05.02.-02.02(A) (emphasis added). Specifically,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">[t]he specifications ... are intended to make buildings and facilities accessible to and usable by people with such <em>physical disabilities </em>as the inability to walk, difficulty walking, reliance on walking aids, blindness and visual impairment, deafness and hearing impairment, incoordination, reaching and manipulation disabilities, lack of stamina, difficulty interpreting and reacting to sensory information, and extremes of physical size. <em>Accessibility and usability allow a physically handicapped person to get to, enter, and use a building or facility.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">ANSI A117.1, \u00a7 1.1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">It is crystal clear that COMAR 05.02.02.02 and ANSI A117.1 are not intended to protect \u201cthe public.\u201d Rather, the intent of these provisions is to make public buildings accessible and usable by physically handicapped persons. For example, \u00a7 4.10.2 allows individuals confined to a wheelchair ready access to elevators by requiring the elevator to have a self-leveling feature that brings the elevator to within V2 inch of floor level. As Appellees point out, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>there was no evidence that Swann was physically disabled at the time of the accident. Accordingly, Swann may have incidentally benefited from the code provision, but he was not \u201cwithin the class of persons sought to be protected.\u201d <em>Kenney, </em>323 Md. at 124, 591 A.2d 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">CD)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Non-Delegability of a Land Owner\u2019s Duty</p>\n<p id=\"AHx\">Last, Swann argues that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury that the duty a land owner owes to a business invitee is non-delegable. Swann notes that CW and Prudential\u2019s defense focused on their lack of notice \u2014 that Dover did not notify them of any problems and that they relied upon the expertise of Dover for all decisions concerning the care and maintenance of the elevator. According to Swann, Prudential, as a property owner, had a non-delegable duty to correct all unreasonable risks, or to warn invitees of them, if they knew or should have known of such risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Appellees contend that the trial court\u2019s instructions fairly instructed the jury as to a land owner\u2019s duty. Therefore, it was not necessary for the trial court to give Swann\u2019s requested instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">During the jury instruction phase of trial, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">The plaintiff in this case, Mr. Swann, is what the contemplation of law [sic] is called the invitee. An invitee is a person who is on the property of another for the interest of the owner or occupier of the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">The owner or occupier of premises has a duty to the invitee. The owner/occupier must use ordinary care to see that those portions of the property which the invitee, in this case Mr. Swann reasonably may be expected to use are safe or if not safe to give the invitee reasonable notice of the unsafe condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">If the owner/occupier of the premises sets aside a portion of the property for the common use of his tenants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>owes [sic] the tenants a duty to exercise ordinary care to keep those portions of the premises in a safe condition or if not safe to notify the tenants of the unsafe condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">Also further the landlord or occupier who has agreed to make repairs may be responsible for the injuries resulting from his failure to make such repairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Swann claims the trial court improperly refused to read to the jury the following two proposed instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">The duty of a land owner to a business invitee is a nondelegable duty. That is something of a misnomer, as the owner is free to delegate the duty of performance to another, but the owner cannot thereby avoid or delay its liability for the non-performance of the delegated duties. Where an owner invites a business invitee to come onto its premises, the duty of the owner to the invitee is not changed by the employment of an independent contractor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">A land owner has a duty to keep its property in a safe condition which it holds open to the public. That duty can not be delegated. The land owner is responsible for the condition of the property. The land owner is not responsible merely to supervise the independent contractor that it has hired to maintain the property. Although the property owner may hire someone to perform maintenance on the premises, the land owner cannot avoid or delegate the risk of non-performance of the duty by the person so hired.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">We perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">A party is generally entitled to have its theory of the case presented to the jury if: \u201c(1) the instruction ... correctly state[s] the law, and (2) that law [is] applicable in light of the evidence before the jury.\u201d <em>Pickett, </em>285 Md. at 194, 401 A.2d 651. This notwithstanding, however, \u201c[t]here is no obligation that the trial court point out any and all of the reciprocal duties and obligations of the respective parties in minute detail, provided the subject is fully and comprehensively covered in the charge to the jury.\u201d <em>Flohr v. Coleman, </em>245 Md. 254, 266, 225 A.2d 868 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>We hold that the instructions given fairly and comprehensively instructed the jury as to the duty a land owner owes an invitee. Swann\u2019s requested instructions would have overemphasized Prudential and CW\u2019s duty, and would have been unduly suggestive and prejudicial. The trial court did not state that a land owner\u2019s duty was delegable; therefore, the jury should not have been under the impression that the duty was delegable.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">JUDGMENTS IN FAVOR OF APPELLEES PRUDENTIAL AND CAREY WINSTON AFFIRMED; JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF APPELLEE DOVER REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID % BY APPELLANT AND Vs BY APPELLEE DOVER.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b444-7\">WILNER, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A22P\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">I concur in the affirmance of the judgments in favor of Prudential and Carey Winston but dissent from the reversal of the judgment in favor of Dover.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">I have two concerns with the panel majority\u2019s conclusions regarding a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction. First, although I quite agree that, under current Maryland law, the mere offering of evidence of specific negligence does not, of itself, preclude a jury, upon a proper <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction, from inferring negligent conduct, it seems to me that the plaintiff really did prove (or attempt to prove) too much for the doctrine to apply in this case. He marshalled evidence to show the precise cause of the misleveling \u2014 the malfunction of the contacts \u2014 and to show as well that Dover was negligent in not replacing those contacts prior to the accident. The focus of the case was on whether Dover was remiss in merely cleaning the contacts rather than replacing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">When the plaintiff\u2019s case is so built around a specific, articulated cause of the event and endeavors to show that that cause arose solely because of specific negligence on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>defendant\u2019s part, I do not believe that the plaintiff, if he fails to persuade the jury that his position has merit, can then avail himself of an inference that the event arose from some <em>other </em>cause, also engendered by the defendant\u2019s negligence. If that were the case, a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction would be appropriate in <em>every </em>negligence case. If that is what Mr. Speiser is selling (Maj. op. pp. 397-98), I don\u2019t buy it.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">My second concern is with the notion that elevators don\u2019t mislevel absent someone\u2019s negligence. This Court made a similar kind of bald statement, with respect to escalators, in <em>Beach v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, Inc., </em>18 Md.App. 645, at 649, 308 A.2d 439 (1973), offering no authority or rational explanation for the statement. Similar pronouncements have been made by other courts, as mentioned by the panel majority, and so I obviously cannot complain that its conclusion in this regard is without any legal support. My problem is in understanding the rationale for such a doctrine. Mechanical, electrical, and electronic devices fail or malfunction routinely \u2014 some more routinely than others. A speck of dust, a change in temperature, misuse, an accidental unforeseen trauma \u2014 many things can cause these devices to malfunction. To allow an inference that the malfunction is due to someone\u2019s negligence when the precise cause cannot be satisfactorily established appears to me to be unwarranted. The cases cited by the panel majority say it is so, but they don\u2019t say <em>why </em>it is so \u2014 at least not convincingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
