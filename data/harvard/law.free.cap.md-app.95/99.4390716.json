BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Carl Vance Montgomery was indicted in the Circuit Court for Howard County \u2014 Case Number 23152 \u2014 for distribution of a controlled dangerous substance (cocaine) and simple possession of a controlled dangerous substance. He pled guilty to the distribution of cocaine count. The remaining charge was <em>nolle prossed. </em>In accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, the charges in another case pending against Montgomery \u2014 Case Number 22402 \u2014 were to be <em>nolle prossed </em>at the time of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Montgomery was sentenced to the Maryland Division of Corrections for a 10-year period of incarceration, a sentence that allowed for the possibility of parole. The State filed a motion to correct the sentence imposed. That motion was denied by the sentencing court. The State appealed, pursuant to Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 12-302(c)(2) (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contending that the trial court erred in refusing to grant the prosecutor\u2019s requested postponement in accordance with the dictates of Rule 4-245(c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and thereafter imposed an illegal sentence. We affirm. We will first explain the basis for the requested postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Both cases pending against Montgomery in the trial court were scheduled for trial on September 11, 1991. On that date, before Montgomery entered a guilty plea to the charge of distribution of cocaine in Case Number 23152, the State announced that it was prepared to serve Montgomery with notice that it intended to seek the legislatively prescribed mandatory penalty of 10 years, without the possibility of parole, under Md.Code Ann. Art. 27, \u00a7 286(c)(1) and (2) (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">It was agreed that, in exchange for Montgomery\u2019s plea in Case Number 23152, the State would enter <em>nolle prosses </em>to the charges in Case Number 22402 at the time of sentencing. The State reiterated that it would seek a \u201cmandatory ten year without parole sentence\u201d and that notice of such would be served upon Montgomery that day. The factual predicate for the plea in Case Number 23152 was set forth by the prosecutor and the plea to the charge of distribution of cocaine was accepted by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The prosecutor then stated that he was serving Montgomery\u2019s attorney with a copy of the notice of mandatory penalty. The notice included a certified copy of the prior conviction upon which the prosecutor intended to rely. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u201coriginal\u201d of the notice<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was served upon the court and opposing counsel in open court, and after some further discussion, the guilty plea proceeding was concluded. The sentencing was to occur on a later date. At the request of the State, the sentencing was postponed several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">On April 2, 1992, Montgomery appeared for sentencing. The prosecutor recapitulated the terms of the plea agreement. He then called the court\u2019s attention to the fact that a notice of mandatory penalty had been provided to Montgomery and filed with the court, along with a certified copy of the docket entry reflecting the prior conviction. The trial judge indicated that the notice had not been filed in Case Number 23152, although his notes reflected that the prosecutor had made it clear that he intended to do such. Ultimately, it was discovered that the notice had indeed been filed, but that it bore the number 22402 rather than Case Number 23152.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Defense counsel noted at these proceedings that, although he and the prosecution had spoken about the State\u2019s intent to seek enhanced penalties, these discussions did not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFk\">\u201ccancel their requirement that they do it properly. We\u2019ve fought them and talked to them on many occasions about not filing the enhancement, they\u2019ve known my position that we\u2019re certainly displeased with their intent to try to file for enhancement but still we didn\u2019t waive our right, and [Montgomery] doesn\u2019t waive his right to have them do it properly if they seek it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Defense counsel stated that Montgomery was prepared to be sentenced that day and that Montgomery was not on notice that the State had formally registered its intention to seek enhanced punishment by filing the requisite notice in Case Number 23152. Montgomery, through counsel, maintained that he was \u201cwell within his rights to assert the State be prepared to go forward with sentencing [that day].\u201d The prosecutor sought a continuance of 15 days in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>order to file a notice with the proper case number. The prosecutor then sought the court\u2019s permission to amend the notice so that it would reflect, not Case Number 22402, but Case Number 23152. The court denied the prosecutor\u2019s requested continuance and motion to amend the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The court then entertained argument from both parties as to the appropriate sentence. The prosecutor proffered evidence that Montgomery had a prior conviction for possession of phencyclidine in sufficient quantity to indicate under all of the circumstances an intent to distribute. Montgomery\u2019s attorney acknowledged the conviction and Montgomery admitted that he had served \u201ca six month bit.\u201d The court then sentenced Montgomery to 10 years imprisonment, but did not make the term one without the possibility of parole as provided by Art. 27, \u00a7 286(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The sole argument raised in the State\u2019s brief is that the trial court erred in not granting the prosecutor a second requested 15-day postponement under Rule 4-245(c) in which to serve a notice of intention to seek an enhanced sentence. In support of its position, the State relies on <em>State v. Thurmond, </em>73 Md.App. 686, 692-93, 536 A.2d 128 (1988). <em>Thurmond </em>does not support the position that the trial judge was legally bound to grant the prosecutor a second 15-day postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Under <em>Thurmond </em>and <em>State v. Armstrong, </em>60 Md. App. 244, 250, 482 A.2d 31 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>302 Md. 288, 487 A.2d 292 (1985), on which the <em>Thurmond </em>court relied, we determined that the purpose of Rule 4-245\u2019s 15-day postponement <em>was to avert a situation in which a defendant could obviate the filing for enhanced penalties by demanding </em>sentencing immediately upon entering a guilty plea. <em>Armstrong, </em>60 Md.App. at 250, 482 A.2d 31. The <em>Thurmond </em>and <em>Armstrong </em>courts noted that this postponement provision was enacted to preclude the accused from \u201cspringing] a surprise\u201d on the State by withholding his or her intentions of pleading guilty and then demanding immediate sentencing, thereby catching the prosecution \u201cshort.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>Armstrong, </em>60 Md.App. at 250, 482 A.2d 31. <em>See Thurmond, </em>73 Md.App. at 692-93, 536 A.2d 128. Thus, under these authorities and the Rule itself, if the State has had 15 days from the entry of a guilty plea, as it did in this case, it is not entitled to <em>another </em>postponement to effect that which it had ample time to effect before.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In the instant case, the prosecution had much more than 15 days in which to file timely notice of its intention to seek enhanced penalties in Montgomery\u2019s case. Montgomery entered a guilty plea on September 11, 1991 and the ultimate sentencing hearing \u2014 after an initial postponement at the prosecutor\u2019s request and other reschedulings \u2014 was held on April 2, 1992, five months later. Under these circumstances, the prosecution had more than ample time in which to file the requisite notice in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The State does not question the propriety of the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit the prosecutor to amend the notice to reflect the case number of the case; hence, we make no comment in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY HOWARD COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\">.
