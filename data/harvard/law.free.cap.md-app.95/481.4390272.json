At his first trial, facing a charge of first degree murder, Larry Allen Breeden, appellant, admitted guilt to second degree murder but pleaded that he was not criminally responsible by reason of insanity. The Circuit Court for Washington County found that Breeden was criminally responsible and sentenced him to twenty-five years imprisonment. We vacated that judgment of criminal responsibility and remanded the case for a retrial of the issue because the trial judge failed to advise Breeden of his right to a jury determination of his criminal responsibility. <em>Breeden v. State, 87 </em>Md.App. 508, 590 A.2d 560 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">At the beginning of the second trial, the State orally moved to introduce the transcribed testimony of a psychologist who had testified for the State at the first trial. The circuit court granted the motion over Breeden\u2019s objection. Accordingly, at trial, the State read the missing witness\u2019s testimony to the jury. Subsequently, the jury found Breeden to be criminally responsible for the murder. Breeden now appeals, claiming that the trial court erred when it declared the witness to be unavailable and allowed the State to use the witness\u2019s prior recorded testimony. He also contends that, notwithstanding that testimony, the evidence was sufficient to establish that he was not criminally responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">We conclude that the State did not make an adequate showing of unavailability because it did not make a reasonable, timely attempt to secure the presence of the witness, whose location was known, by using the procedures of the Uniform Act to Secure Attendance of Witnesses from With<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>out a State in Criminal Proceedings (the Uniform Act or the Act) when it became apparent that the witness would not voluntarily appear at trial. Because the testimony was important to the State\u2019s case in rebutting Breeden\u2019s claim that he was not criminally responsible, the error was not harmless. Therefore, we reverse the judgment as to criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Appellant pleaded guilty to strangling to death his friend, Shirley Baker, on 11 February 1989. He also pleaded that he was not criminally responsible for that act, but the trial judge determined otherwise at the first trial. As we have stated, we vacated the judgment of criminal responsibility because the trial court failed to inform appellant of his right to a jury trial on that issue. Subsequently, having been properly advised of that right, appellant elected to have a jury hear his second trial on the issue of his criminal responsibility. He then had the burden of convincing the jury that he was not criminally responsible for the murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">At the second trial, both sides presented extensive testimony. A review of the events surrounding appellant\u2019s arrest and of the days immediately thereafter will help put the expert testimony regarding the issue of appellant\u2019s criminal responsibility into perspective. Officer Brenton Saur of the Hagerstown Police Department testified that on 12 February 1989 he observed appellant attempting to enter the police department building through a locked employees\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>entrance. When Saur asked appellant if he needed help, appellant replied, \u201cThere\u2019s a dead woman in my apartment.\u201d After following appellant to his apartment, Saur found the body of Shirley Baker in appellant\u2019s bed. Saur further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">I asked if Mr. Breeden had hurt the lady and he replied, \u201cI put a rag over her face.\u201d I asked him what happened. He stated, \u201cShe had trouble breathing. I tried pushing on her chest. I gave her mouth to mouth. She was unconscious and I left.\u201d I asked, \u201cYou left?\u201d And he responded, \u201cI ran.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Saur further stated that during the time appellant was transported to the police station and \u201cbooked,\u201d appellant was \u201cquiet,\u201d \u201csullen,\u201d and \u201csubdued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Jean Marie Cline was employed as a licensed practical nurse at the Washington County Detention Center when she first encountered appellant at the facility on 14 February 1989. She testified that he appeared to be nervous and depressed, and was reluctant to communicate with her. She also testified that when she attempted to give appellant his prescribed medication the next evening, \u201che backed away and I tried to show him the medicine and encourage him to take it and he exhibited very strange behavior. He told me that it was not his medicine and that I was trying to kill him.\u201d Cline also stated that appellant\u2019s fear seemed sincere and that his behavior was \u201cmentally abnormal.\u201d She added that on occasion she observed and heard appellant speaking while he was alone in his cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Corporal Jerry Landsman, Jr., of the Hagerstown Police testified that he went to see appellant at the detention center on 15 February 1989 with a court order to obtain blood and saliva samples. He testified that appellant \u201cwas extremely high strung, nervous. He was wringing his hands. He was very reluctant to allow us to complete the court order. He was afraid of the needles. He was afraid of basically everyone.\u201d Landsman stated that the appellant needed constant reassurance that Landsman, the nurse, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the detective who accompanied the officer were not going to hurt him.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\n<em>Appellant\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Appellant presented evidence of his mental health before and after the crime through both lay and expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Carol Ann Breeden is appellant\u2019s daughter. She saw her father several times a week between Thanksgiving of 1988 and February 1989. She testified that during this period, appellant became very paranoid and thought that \u201csomebody was out to get him.\u201d She further testified that appellant said that the buildings surrounding his apartment were emitting poison and that appellant unplugged televisions, microwaves, and other appliances to prevent electricity from getting into the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Margie Griffith, a close friend of appellant\u2019s for twenty years, also testified about appellant\u2019s behavior in the weeks leading up to his crime. She recalled that appellant was acting strangely and that he \u201cwasn\u2019t Larry.\u201d Also, appellant told Griffith that someone was out to kill him. Griffith testified about appellant\u2019s physical appearance. She stated that appellant was \u201cdisoriented,\u201d and progressively likely to be uncharacteristically unshaven, with his shirt untucked and hair uncombed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Another friend, Ralph Gossard, related that appellant said that he felt and heard \u201cwaves\u201d coming from the ceiling of Gossard\u2019s house and insisted on unplugging appliances. Appellant told Gossard that someone was out to get him. Gossard also testified that appellant\u2019s personal appearance was no longer as neat as it used to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Linda Murray, who lived with Gossard, was also a friend of appellant. She, too, testified that appellant felt and heard waves emanating from the walls and ceiling, and that he often unplugged appliances in Gossard\u2019s house. She recalled that appellant stated that someone wanted to kill him, and that he was very nervous and paranoid in the weeks leading up to the crime. Like Griffith and Gossard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Murray noticed that, during this period, appellant\u2019s personal appearance became increasingly disheveled.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Elaine Nahai first met appellant in 1987 when she worked at the Frederick County Mental Health facility. Appellant had voluntarily contacted the facility. Nahai testified that a psychiatrist at the facility diagnosed appellant as having \u201cschizophrenia, paranoid type.\u201d Nahai conducted individual therapy sessions with appellant on an outpatient basis. These sessions were discontinued in May 1988 because appellant was no longer having \u201cparanoid ideas,\u201d was taking his medication regularly, and was interacting better with people. Nahai met with appellant again on 12 January 1989 and testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">[h]e was quite fearful. He talked about things disappearing from his apartment which he was worried about. He talked about smelling like ammonia or burning flesh and about taking three or four showers daily. He talked about how his stomach would contract so much that his pants fall off. He talked about how he felt that he was' going to die soon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">In addition to the above lay testimony, appellant presented three expert witnesses to testify on his behalf. First, Dr. Christiane Tellefsen testified as an expert in psychiatry. Her first contact with appellant came two months after the murder, when he was admitted to the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center (Perkins Hospital), where she was Acting Superintendent. She observed appellant from April to June 1989, and again when he was readmitted to the hospital in August 1989. In her opinion, appellant was not criminally responsible for the murder of Shirley Baker because he suffered from schizo-affective disorder. Dr. Tellefsen testified that this disorder consists of schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness. She testified that manic-depressive illness is a mood disorder in which a person\u2019s mood ranges from extreme depression to extreme elation. Schizophrenia, she explained, is a brain disorder that affects how a person thinks and expresses emotion. An exacerbated form of schizophrenia is psychosis, which generally has three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>symptoms: hallucinations, delusions, and marked changes in behavior. Dr. Tellefsen testified that delusions are \u201cfixed false belief[s] not supported by reality.\u201d She believed that the lack of a rational motivation for killing Shirley Baker was significant evidence of a connection between appellant\u2019s disorder and his incapacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct. She explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">We have quite a bit of evidence from family members and from Mr. Breeden\u2019s friends and from his prior psychiatric records that Mr. Breeden had developed a paranoid delusion. That is a delusion people are out to get him. Just prior to the offense and we had some evidence that pointed to Mr. Breeden\u2019s delusion incorporating the victim. That is he believed that Shirley Baker was somehow involved in the Mafia or maybe she was involved in doing things with his apartment or changing his possessions] around in his apartment. But she was in some way involved in this conspiracy of people who were out to get him. And we had that information pointing to that motive for the offense and we had no information pointing to any other kind of motive for the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">[H]e felt like he was going to be killed. He felt like people were after him, out to get him, trying to poison him, trying to bombard him with some type of radioactive waves. People were persuing [sic] him, watching him. He was under surveillance and when he suffocated Miss Baker at that moment he felt that she was part of this conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">When asked if she thought that appellant was \u201cmalingering\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when she observed him at Perkins Hospital, Dr. Tellefsen opined that he was not. In her view, appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>extensive history of mental illness was entirely consistent with the behavior he exhibited after the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Next, Dr. Laurence J. Raifman testified as an expert in psychology. He was Director of Psychology and Co-Director of Forensic Services at Perkins Hospital. Like Dr. Tellefsen, Dr. Raifman believed that appellant suffered from schizo-affective disorder and, therefore, lacked the capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. He stated that appellant\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior in the weeks before the killing was consistent with schizo-affective disorder and demonstrated a steady progression of the disorder into a more acute, prominent phase. He believed that appellant became \u201cout of touch with reality,\u201d explaining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">[appellant\u2019s] mental disorder was such that it put him in a position that he was extremely ambivalent and confused with regard to his relationship to the victim at that moment. On the one hand he cared for her and he knew that she cared for him. On the other hand he feared from her that his life was in jeopardy____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">He seemed to care for her in death but he was so fearful of her in life. Prior to and up to the time of the killing there was fear predominating. Immediately following the killing the ambivalence showed itself in that he immediately moved over to a more caring perspective____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">[H]is actions appeared to indicate that he was not quite clear whether she was alive or not. He put her back in the bed. He pulled the covers up to her ... put her hands____ He took her dentures out and almost created an atmosphere as though she were sleeping in his bed. Leaving and then coming back to determine in fact if she was alive or dead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Dr. Raifman also rejected the notion that appellant was malingering, noting that his history and prior conduct were consistent with the diagnosis of schizo-affective disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Dr. Neil Blumberg testified as an expert in psychiatry. He also was of the opinion that appellant was not criminally responsible for the murder of Shirley Baker, though his diagnosis of appellant\u2019s illness was slightly different from the previous two experts. He concluded that at the time of the murder appellant was suffering from \u201cschizophrenia, paranoid type which was chronic but in acute exacerbation.\u201d According to Dr. Blumberg, this disorder differs from schizo-affective disorder only in that it makes the patient\u2019s mood a secondary consideration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Like Drs. Tellefsen and Raifman, Dr. Blumberg emphasized appellant\u2019s paranoid delusions as the primary characteristic of his illness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">I think here there\u2019s a very clear link between his delusional beliefs, his confused thinking at that time, his hallucinations, the involvement of Shirley Baker in the delusional theme and his actions, his basically killing her thinking that she is part of a plot to harm him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">And what ... I\u2019ve come to the opinion of is that he knew that he was strangling or suffocating Shirley Baker, he knew he was ending her life but he didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t appreciate that what he was doing was wrong. He was acting as if Shirley Baker was part of a conspiracy to harm him. And in his own mind was doing something that was justifiable, that was right and it was not wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\n<em>State\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">In addition to offering the testimony of the police officers involved in appellant\u2019s arrest, the State presented the testimony of two experts. First, over appellant\u2019s objection, the State read to the jury the transcript of the testimony given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>by Dr. Mario Torres at the first trial. Dr. Torres had testified as an expert in psychology. He was a staff psychologist at the Perkins Hospital and first met appellant in May 1989. Dr. Torres concluded that appellant: (1) had \u201can organic mental disorder n.o.s. which means not otherwise specified,\u201d with evidence of alcohol dependence and marijuana abuse; (2) had \u201ca personality disorder, n.o.s., ... with passive aggressive and dependent features\u201d; and (3) was malingering. Based on these diagnoses, he believed that appellant was criminally responsible for the murder. Dr. Torres thought that appellant\u2019s case was a difficult one, but concluded that there was not enough evidence of a connection between appellant\u2019s mental illness and his behavior at the time of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Dr. Torres attached little weight to the descriptions of appellant\u2019s behavior in the three months before the crime because, in his view, appellant was not \u201creliable\u201d or consistent in exhibiting or reporting the symptoms he claimed to have experienced. He also found significant the lack of an increased hostility by appellant in the time immediately before he strangled Ms. Baker. Because appellant\u2019s actions, especially after the crime, were \u201cbizarre\u201d but not characteristic of a \u201ctrue psychotic,\u201d Dr. Torres thought that appellant was malingering. He testified that malingerers can fake bizarre behavior, but not psychotic behavior. On cross-examination, Dr. Torres admitted that there were numerous documented reports and other historical evidence of appellant\u2019s mental illness that were inconsistent with a diagnosis of malingering. This evidence, however, did not change his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Dr. Faramarz Mokhtari also testified for the State, as an expert in psychiatry. Unlike Dr. Torres, Dr. Mokhtari delivered his testimony in person. He was the Acting Clinical Director at Perkins Hospital. His expert opinion was that appellant was criminally responsible. He believed that appellant suffered from alcohol abuse and dysthymia, a disorder that is a type of continuous depression. Dr. Mokhtari testified that a dysthymic person does not experience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>psychosis or exhibit psychotic behavior. He also believed that appellant was malingering. Like Dr. Torres, however, Dr. Mokhtari admitted that there were records and diagnoses dating back to 1987 that were inconsistent with his conclusion that appellant was malingering.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Appellant attempted to impeach Dr. Mokhtari\u2019s testimony on rebuttal. He recalled to the stand Dr. Tellefsen, who read Dr. Mokhtari\u2019s treatment notes for appellant for 24 September 1989. Those notes indicated that Dr. Mokhtari believed that there was \u201ca possibility of paranoid psychosis,\u201d and that he prescribed Haldol to deal with that possibility. Dr. Tellefsen testified that Haldol is an anti-psychotic medication. And when asked about the disorder of dysthymia, she explained that \u201c[b]y definition^ dysthymic patients] cannot have psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. If they do have those symptoms, they do not have dysthymia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\n<em>The Absence of Dr. Torres</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">As indicated, Dr. Torres testified for the State at the first trial on criminal responsibility in January 1990. On the morning of the second trial, 6 January 1992, the State orally moved to allow the introduction of the prior testimony of Dr. Torres on the basis that he was unavailable as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">In support of the State\u2019s motion, the State\u2019s Attorney for Washington County recited to the court the prosecution\u2019s efforts to locate and secure Dr. Torres\u2019s attendance at trial. He related that in early November 1991 he learned that Dr. Torres no longer worked at the hospital. The hospital staff provided the prosecutor with the address of Dr. Torres\u2019s parents in Puerto Rico. On 6 November 1991, the State mailed a letter to Dr. Torres, in care of his parents, asking him to contact the Washington County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office to discuss the possibility of testifying at appellant\u2019s second trial. There was no response. On 26 November, the State sent another letter to the same address; again, there was no response. Then, a member of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Office composed a letter in Spanish, asking Dr. Torres to contact the office. The State mailed this letter on 16 December, again in care of Dr. Torres\u2019s parents at their address. Dr. Torres called the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office on 27 December, which was a Friday. He informed an assistant state\u2019s attorney that he was residing in a monastery in Puerto Rico and in the process of becoming a Jesuit priest. He further advised that, after a discussion with the head priest, he learned that he would not be available until August 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">On the following Monday morning, 30 December, the State informed the trial court of its efforts to secure Dr. Torres\u2019s presence at trial. The prosecutor was asked if he had attempted to use the Uniform Act. When he answered in the negative, the court advised him to do so. The State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office contacted the United States Department of Justice in Puerto Rico on 31 December and was advised of the appropriate court in Puerto Rico to which the subpoena for Dr. Torres should be sent. The State mailed the appropriate paperwork via Federal Express, which was to have delivered the paperwork on 2 January 1992. The State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, as of the morning of trial on 6 January, had not received a response to its Uniform Act request. The record does not disclose that the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office made any effort to inquire what the authorities in Puerto Rico did with its request.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In the meantime, an assistant state\u2019s attorney attempted to contact Dr. Torres by telephone on Monday, 30 December 1991. First, he called the monastery where the doctor was living. Someone at the monastery told the assistant state\u2019s attorney that Dr. Torres had gone to spend the weekend with his family, and gave the attorney the family\u2019s phone number. When the attorney called the number, he spoke with someone who said that he was Dr. Torres\u2019s father. That person stated that he would ask Dr. Torres to call the assistant state\u2019s attorney. That call never came, and the State decided to rely on Dr. Torres\u2019s prior transcribed testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Appellant asserts that the circuit court committed reversible error when it permitted the State to read into evidence the transcript of the testimony given by Dr. Torres at the first trial on criminal responsibility. The heart of this alleged error is the court\u2019s finding that the State had established Dr. Torres\u2019s unavailability.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Introduction in evidence of prior recorded sworn testimony involves the right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Article 21 of the Declaration of Rights of the Maryland Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Two significant purposes lie at the core of the right of confrontation. One is to provide the defendant with an adequate opportunity for cross-examination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 418, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 1076, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965); <em>Crawford v. State, </em>282 Md. 210, 214, 383 A.2d 1097 (1978). The other purpose is to give the judge and jury opportunities to observe the testifying wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>ness\u2019s demeanor. In <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), the Supreme Court, recognizing the importance of demeanor evidence, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">The Court has emphasized that the Confrontation Clause reflects a preference for face-to-face confrontation at trial, and that \u201ca primary interest secured by [the provision] is the right of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 418, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 1076, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965). In short, the Clause envisions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abv\"><em>\u201ca </em>personal examination and cross-examination of the witness, in which the accused has an opportunity, not only of testing the recollection and sifting the conscience of the witness, but of compelling him to stand face to face with the jury in order that they may look at him, and judge by his demeanor upon the stand and the manner in which he gives his testimony whether he is worthy of belief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\"><em>Mattox v. United States, </em>[156 U.S. 237, 242-43, 15 S.Ct. 337, 339-40, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">448 U.S. at 63-64, 100 S.Ct. at 2537-38 (first alteration in original) (footnotes omitted). The Court of Appeals has also recognized the importance of ensuring that the fact-finder has an opportunity to evaluate a witness\u2019s credibility. <em>See Crawford, </em>282 Md. at 214, 383 A.2d 1097 (primary purpose of requiring confrontation is to prevent depositions and other non-live testimony from being used against an accused in lieu of a personal examination and cross-examination of the witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Despite the importance of these considerations, a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation is not absolute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">[T]here has traditionally been an exception to the confrontation requirement where a witness is unavailable and has given testimony at previous judicial proceedings against the same defendant which was subject to cross-examination by that defendant. This exception has been explained as arising from necessity and has been justified on the ground that the right of cross-examination initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>afforded provides substantial compliance with the purposes behind the confrontation requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><em>Barber v. Page, </em>390 U.S. 719, 722, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 1320, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968) (citations omitted). Prior to <em>Barber, </em>in cases in which the witness was outside the state, the mere absence of the witness from the court\u2019s jurisdiction was a sufficient predicate for a finding of unavailability. The traditional rule required no evidence of an attempt to bring the witness back to the state to testify. <em>See id. </em>at 723, 88 S.Ct. at 1321; 5 John H. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1404 (James H. Chadbourn rev. 1974). In <em>Barber, </em>however, the Supreme Court held that \u201ca witness is not \u2018unavailable\u2019 for purposes of the [traditional] exception to the confrontation requirement unless the prosecutorial authorities have made a good-faith effort to obtain his presence at trial.\u201d <em>Barber, </em>390 U.S. at 724-25, 88 S.Ct. at 1321-22. Thus, a witness\u2019s mere absence from a state, without more, was no longer sufficient to establish the witness\u2019s unavailability.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Both state and federal courts recognized the effect of <em>Barber v. Page </em>on the analysis of whether an out-of-state witness is unavailable. For example, the Supreme Court of Hawaii, in <em>State v. Kim, </em>55 Haw. 346, 519 P.2d 1241 (1974), stated, \u201cthe traditional rule \u2014 that the showing of the mere absence of the witness from the jurisdiction satisfied the constitutional requirement that the witness is \u2018unavailable\u2019 \u2014 was emphatically rejected in <em>Barber v. Page.\u201d </em>519 P.2d at 1244. And in <em>Eastham v. Johnson, </em>338 F.Supp. 1278 (E.D.Mich.1972), the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\"><em>Barber v. Page </em>discredited the old concept that a mere showing by the prosecution that a witness was in another state would constitute \u201cunavailability\u201d so as to justify the use of a transcript at a defendant\u2019s trial. Since <em>Barber v. Page, </em>the prosecution must do more than just show the witness is out of the jurisdiction of the state where the defendant is being tried.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">338 F.Supp. at 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Drawing on the principles enunciated in <em>Barber </em>and subsequent cases,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Supreme Court in <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), created a two-prong test for the admissibility of prior testimony. The prosecution must show that the witness is unavailable and that the testimony bears sufficient indicia of reliability. 448 U.S. at 65-66, 100 S.Ct. at 2538-39. <em>See also Moon v. State, </em>300 Md. 354, 368-69, 478 A.2d 695 (1984) (discussing <em>Roberts), cert, denied, </em>469 U.S. 1207; 105 S.Ct. 1170, 84 L.Ed.2d 321 (1985); <em>Cordovi v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 455, 462, 492 A.2d 1328 (same), <em>cert, denied, </em>304 Md. 297, 498 A.2d 1184 (1985). In <em>Roberts, </em>the Supreme Court further explained Barber\u2019s good faith requirement with regard to the \u201cunavailability\u201d prong of the test for admissibility of prior testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">The law does not require the doing of a futile act. Thus, if no possibility of procuring the witness exists (as, for example, the witness\u2019 intervening death), \u201cgood faith\u201d demands nothing of the prosecution. But if there is a possibility, albeit remote, that affirmative measures might produce the declarant, the obligation of good faith <em>may </em>demand their effectuation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">448 U.S. at 74, 100 S.Ct.. at 2543 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In this case, appellant does not question the reliability of Dr. Torres\u2019s previous testimony; his challenge goes to the court\u2019s finding that Dr. Torres was unavailable as a witness. Specifically, he argues that the State\u2019s untimely attempt to use the provisions of the Uniform Act precluded a finding that Dr. Torres was unavailable to testify. He stresses that initiating the Act\u2019s machinery seven days before the start of trial is insufficient to allow the Act\u2019s procedures to run their normal course.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Our inquiry then is whether the use of the Uniform Act is a necessary element of any good-faith effort by the State in securing an out-of-state witness\u2019s presence at trial. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>research has revealed that this Court, by way of dictum, has already answered this inquiry. Before discussing the relevant Maryland authorities, however, some preliminary comments about the Uniform Act are in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Without a State in Criminal Proceedings is in force in all fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Each jurisdiction\u2019s statute is modelled substantially after the act promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. <em>See </em>11 U.L.A. 1 (1936). Several courts have commented that the Act was intended as a matter of comity between states to facilitate the securing of material witnesses for criminal prosecutions, and that it does not provide for the delivery of a witness located in another state as a matter of course. <em>Kg., State v. Lesco, </em>194 Kan. 555, 400 P.2d 695, 699 (1965), <em>cert, denied, </em>382 U.S. 1015, 86 S.Ct. 628, 15 L.Ed.2d 529 (1966). It has been more recently observed, however, that the essence of the Act is \u201cto create a community of jurisdictions which will honor the request of fellow members for the appearance of witnesses at criminal proceedings under the conditions specified in the Act.\u201d <em>People v. Superior Court, </em>224 Cal.App.3d 1405, 274 Cal.Rptr. 586, 589 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The existence of the Uniform Act was an important factor in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Barber v. Page </em>to require more diligent efforts by a state in securing the presence of an out-of-state witness. In rejecting the old rule that a witness\u2019s presence outside the court\u2019s jurisdiction excused the prosecution from producing him, the Court cited the Uniform Act as an example of the increased cooperation between the states themselves and between the states and the federal government that has deprived the old rule of \u201cany continuing validity.\u201d <em>Barber v. Page, </em>390 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>719, 723 &amp; n. 4, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 1321 &amp; n. 4, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Only a few Maryland cases have discussed the Uniform Act in the context of determining the admissibility of the prior testimony of an allegedly unavailable witness.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> One of the earliest cases to discuss the Act was <em>Contee v. State, </em>229 Md. 486, 184 A.2d 823 (1962), <em>cert, denied, </em>374 U.S. 841, 83 S.Ct. 1895, 10 L.Ed.2d 1062 (1963). In <em>Contee, </em>the Court of Appeals stated the prevailing, traditional rule regarding when a witness was unavailable: \u201c[TJestimony taken at a former trial may be admitted, if it be shown that the witness is dead, insane, or beyond the jurisdiction of the court, or on diligent inquiry cannot be located____\u201d 229 Md. at 491, 184 A.2d 823. The defendant in that case was convicted of raping a woman who was an outpatient at a mental institution. The judgment was reversed. At the second trial, the State introduced the former testimony of the victim, who, the State asserted, was unavailable because she had been permanently committed to a mental institution in Michigan. <em>Id. </em>at 490, 184 A.2d 823. The director of the institution testified that the victim had been adjudicated insane and was incapable of understanding the obligation of oath. On this basis, the trial court admitted the victim\u2019s former testimony into evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 491-92, 184 A.2d 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>The defendant challenged the finding of insanity and argued that the State could have used the Uniform Act to bring the victim to trial. Because the Court of Appeals affirmed the finding that the victim was mentally incompetent to testify, it did not decide the question of the State\u2019s failure to use the Act. It did comment, however, that the Act \u201cdoes not extend the jurisdiction of any State, since it is based on comity[,]\u201d and cited two cases from other states that held that the use of the Uniform Act was permissive and not a prerequisite to a proffer of former testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 492, 184 A.2d 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">In 1967, this Court twice reached the issue that <em>Contee </em>did not. First, in <em>Britton v. State, </em>2 Md.App. 285, 234 A.2d 274 (1967), <em>cert, denied, </em>249 Md. 731 (1968), the defendant, convicted of robbery with a deadly weapon, asserted that the admission of the testimony of one of his victims from an earlier trial was erroneous because the State did not use the Uniform Act to bring the victim, who had moved out of state, back to Maryland. We held that the Uniform Act had \u201cno effect\u201d on the general rule regarding former testimony set forth in <em>Contee, </em>i.e., the Act was permissive and the State need only show that the desired witness was beyond the court\u2019s jurisdiction. 2 Md.App. at 289, 234 A.2d 274. Because the State did show that the witness was out-of-state and that it made a diligent inquiry to locate him, we affirmed the admission of the witness\u2019s former testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 290, 234 A.2d 274.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>One week later, this Court reaffirmed <em>Britton </em>in <em>Rockard v. State, </em>2 Md.App. 312, 234 A.2d 630 (1967), <em>cert, denied, </em>248 Md. 734 (1968). There, the child witness, the alleged victim of an assault with intent to have carnal knowledge, lived in Virginia at the time of the defendant\u2019s second trial, and her parents refused to return with her to Maryland. We affirmed the introduction of the transcript of the child\u2019s testimony, citing Britton\u2019s holding \u201cthat a State\u2019s Attorney is not required to utilize the provisions of that Act.\u201d 2 Md.App. at 315, 234 A.2d 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In <em>Graham v. State, </em>7 Md.App. 638, 256 A.2d 709 (1969), <em>cert, denied, </em>257 Md. 733 (1970), this Court, without opining on whether the prosecution was required to use the Act, affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the State made a good-faith effort to obtain the witness\u2019s attendance at the defendant\u2019s second trial where the State did, in fact, utilize the Act\u2019s provisions. When the prosecutor learned that the witness had moved to North Carolina, he prepared a petition under the Act and sent it to the appropriate North Carolina authorities, who were unable to locate the witness. We held that the prosecution made a good-faith effort to procure the witness\u2019s presence and, therefore, the witness was properly declared to be \u201cunavailable.\u201d 7 Md.App. at 644, 256 A.2d 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">We now turn to the case in which we find the answer to our present inquiry. The defendant in <em>Brooks v. State, </em>35 Md.App. 461, 371 A.2d 674 <em>cert, denied, </em>280 Md. 728 (1977), was convicted of an armed robbery that occurred at a restaurant in Maryland and of several handgun violations. He had previously been tried for the armed robbery of a Virginia restaurant. On appeal from his Maryland conviction, the defendant argued that the trial court erroneously excluded from evidence the transcript of the testimony given by the Virginia restaurant owner at the Virginia trial. The restaurant owner allegedly stated that the robbery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>occurred on the same date and approximately at the same time as the Maryland robbery. The defendant argued that this testimony would have substantiated his alibi for the Maryland robbery that he was in Virginia at the time the Maryland crime was committed. 35 Md.App. at 466-67, 371 A.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">This Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling, and in doing so, recognized the effect of <em>Barber v. Page </em>on the law involving the use of prior sworn testimony. First, we observed that the <em>Barber </em>rule requiring a good-faith effort in securing a witness\u2019s presence at trial applies not only to the State, but also to a defendant who attempts to introduce former testimony as a hearsay exception. <em>Id. </em>35 Md.App. at 469, 371 A.2d 674. After noting that both Maryland and Virginia have adopted the Uniform Act, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">In <em>[Britton </em>and <em>Reckard </em>], this Court held that the State need not resort to the provisions of the Uniform Act in order to invoke the rule that testimony given at a former trial may be admitted if it is shown that the witness is beyond the boundaries of the State or, on diligent inquiry, cannot be located. <em>In view of the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in Barber, were the identical issue raised here now, we would reach the opposite result. </em>Analogously, we now hold that a defendant must show that he used the provisions of the Act but was nonetheless unable to secure the attendance of an out-of-state witness before such a witness\u2019 testimony, given at a former trial, may be admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 470, 371 A.2d 674 (emphasis added). Because the defendant presented no evidence of a good-faith effort to secure the attendance of the Virginia restaurant owner at trial, we held that there was no proper showing of unavailability. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The \u201cidentical issue\u201d referred to in <em>Brooks </em>is now before us. Accordingly, we hold that before an out-of-state witness whose location is known is declared \u201cunavailable\u201d and his prior testimony is admitted, the State\u2019s (or, for that matter, the defense\u2019s) good-faith effort in procuring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>presence of that witness at trial must include a reasonable, timely attempt to utilize the provisions of the Uniform Act. In our view, the law\u2019s preference for live testimony and the spirit of cooperation between states that characterizes the Uniform Act make the requirement that the State use the Act as part of its good-faith effort a fair and reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Our holding is consistent with the trend of decisions of other states that have addressed similar situations. For example, in <em>People v. Freeland, </em>101 Mich.App. 501, 300 N.W.2d 616 (1980), the Court of Appeals of Michigan addressed the issue of whether the prosecution exercised due diligence in attempting to produce a \u201cres gestae\u201d witness at trial. The defendant was charged with the theft of goods from a retail store. His actions were observed by two store security guards, one of whom the prosecution did not produce at trial. The prosecution presented evidence that it discovered the out-of-state location of that witness just two days before trial and that, when it contacted the witness by phone on the morning of trial, the witness refused to attend voluntarily the defendant\u2019s trial. 300 N.W.2d at 618-20. The court held that use of the Uniform Act was mandatory and that when the prosecution learned on the day of trial that the desired witness would not voluntarily appear, due diligence required that the prosecution move for adjournment of the trial and attempt to secure the witness\u2019s attendance using the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In <em>Smith v. State, </em>546 P.2d 267 (Okla.Crim.App.1976), the defendant was convicted of the unlawful delivery of LSD. At his trial, the state sought to introduce the preliminary hearing testimony of a police informant who participated in the transaction for which the defendant was convicted. The state admitted that it knew the informant\u2019s out-of-state location. The state argued that its efforts to bring her to trial, consisting of serving her with an out-of-county subpoena, which, coupled with the fact that the informant honored a similar subpoena in appearing at the preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>hearing, constituted a good-faith effort to secure the witness\u2019s presence at trial. 546 P.2d at 271-72. The Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma disagreed. The court stated that the ineffective subpoena and a lack of attempts to make personal contact with the witness to persuade her to testify at trial did not rise to the level of good-faith effort and due diligence required by <em>Barber v. Page. </em>The court held that when a witness\u2019s exact out-of-state location is known, the state\u2019s failure to use the Uniform Act precludes a finding that the state exercised good faith to secure the witness\u2019s presence at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Similarly, in <em>State v. Waits, </em>92 N.M. 275, 587 P.2d 53 (Ct.App.1978), the state knew two months before trial that a critical witness who testified at a preliminary hearing was living in Texas. At that time, the state served a New Mexico subpoena on the witness. 587 P.2d at 54. The Court of Appeals of New Mexico observed that a New Mexico subpoena has no legal effect on a person living out of state, and held that, under the facts of the case, a witness is not unavailable unless the State has used the procedures of the Uniform Act. <em>Id. </em>at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">And, in <em>People v. Blackwood, </em>138 Cal.App.3d 939, 188 Cal.Rptr. 359 (1983), the Court of Appeal of California held that reasonable diligence to secure a witness\u2019s attendance by the court\u2019s process requires the use of the Uniform Act when the prosecution knows the witness\u2019s location.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The witness had left California to travel through the Northwest states and Canada to Alaska. The prosecution's extensive search efforts finally located the witness in Alaska. When the prosecutor called the witness at his hotel and offered to pay travel expenses to California, the witness stated that he would not return for the trial because he did not want to leave his wife alone in Alaska. 188 Cal.Rptr. at 363-64. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>The court rejected the prosecution\u2019s argument that the Act was not required because it was unlikely that another state would have issued a subpoena due to the undue hardship to the witness. The court stated that \u201c[t]he prosecution\u2019s duty was to invoke the Uniform Act, not to decide whether such action would be fruitful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Many other jurisdictions have held the Act to be mandatory in similar circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Anderson v. State, </em>362 So.2d 1296 (Ala.Crim.App.1978) (mere showing that witness is in another state is insufficient because the Act was available); <em>State v. Ratzlaff, </em>27 Ariz.App. 174, 552 P.2d 461 (1976) (\u201cit seems reasonable to require the State to use the Uniform Act to <em>at least attempt </em>to enforce the attendance of an absent witness, even though he is in the military service\u201d); <em>State v. Kim, </em>55 Haw. 346, 519 P.2d 1241 (1974) (when witness is out of state, the State must show a good-faith effort to ascertain the actual location of the witness, and if necessary, use the Act to secure the witness\u2019s attendance); <em>Drummond v. State, </em>86 Nev. 4, 462 P.2d 1012 (1970) (there could be no finding of good faith or due diligence where the State did not use the Act despite knowing before trial the witness\u2019s out-of-state address and that the witness was in fact there); <em>State v. Sweeney, </em>45 Wash.App. 81, 723 P.2d 551 (1986) (the State must use the procedures of the Act when it becomes apparent that the witness is no longer cooperating).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The <em>post-Barber </em>decisions that have not required usage of the Act addressed situations factually different from the case before us. <em>See, e.g., People v. Arguello, </em>737 P.2d 436 (Colo.Ct.App.1987) (reliance on Act would have been \u201cuseless\u201d where parents of child victim absolutely refused to allow child to testify at defendant\u2019s third trial for sexual assault and where child had been thoroughly cross-examined at two previous trials); <em>State v. Young, </em>20 Ohio App.3d 269, 485 N.E.2d 814 (1984) (Act not required where State did not know until after trial had begun that witness would not appear); <em>State v. Davis, </em>293 N.W.2d 885 (S.D. 1980) (Act not required when witness\u2019s location is not known).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Whether the prosecution made a diligent, good-faith effort to secure the presence at trial of a witness turns on the particular facts of each case. In our view of the case <em>sub judice, </em>the State\u2019s failure to make timely use of the Uniform Act to attempt to compel Dr. Torres\u2019s presence precluded a finding that Dr. Torres was \u201cunavailable\u201d for trial. Initiating the Act\u2019s procedures just one week before trial simply did not allow enough time for the Act to run its normal course to an ultimate disposition, whether favorable or unfavorable to the State. We recognize that the State brought the issue of Dr. Torres\u2019s possible unavailability to the court\u2019s attention almost immediately after speaking with Dr. Torres for the first time on 27 December 1991. Then, based on the court\u2019s advice, the State prepared a Uniform Act subpoena and mailed it to Puerto Rico via an express mail service. Thus, once it learned definitively where Dr. Torres resided and that he would not return to Maryland voluntarily, the State acted promptly in contacting the trial judge and issuing a Uniform Act request. The fact remains, however, that by the time the Puerto Rican authorities were to receive the Uniform Act request, 2 January 1992, only four days remained before trial. The record reveals no attempt by the State to follow up its request and no attempt to seek a continuance of the trial in order to permit time for the Act to run its normal course. Because the required events under the Act could not reasonably be expected to occur within four days, the State\u2019s failure to seek to ensure that enough time was available requires us to conclude that the State\u2019s efforts fell below the good-faith standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The Uniform Act\u2019s procedures are not complex, but they are extensive. The court in which the witness has been subpoenaed to appear (the requesting court) must send a certificate to the court in the county in the state in which the witness resides (the requested court) stating that the witness is material and necessary to the requesting court\u2019s action. The requested court, after giving notice to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>witness, must conduct a hearing at which the court, before compelling the witness to appear and testify in the requesting court, must determine that the witness is material and necessary and that the witness will not suffer undue hardship in being compelled to attend the trial. It is only after the requested court makes these determinations that measures will be taken to ensure the witness\u2019s appearance in the requesting court.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">In view of the extensive proceedings required by the Act, it is wholly unreasonable to expect the process to reach a conclusion within four days. The geographical separation of two jurisdictions as far apart as Maryland and Puerto Rico supports the unreasonableness of the situation in the case <em>sub judice.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Nothing in the Act requires the requested court to put its daily operations on hold and immediately address the requesting court\u2019s subpoena, or otherwise to expedite the process. In short, for all its usefulness, the Uniform Act is not a magic potion that cures overnight; it requires time to operate, and it is the obligation of the party that is utilizing the Act to ensure that sufficient time exists, or to .produce evidence that a conclusion was reached, favorable or not, on its request within the time elapsed. If information as to the witness\u2019s location comes to the party too late to institute the Uniform Act proceedings and obtain a judicial determination before the time set for trial, that party has the additional burden of moving for a continuance of trial and attempting to secure the attendance of the witness through the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">We recognize that our holding may require yet another trial, with undesirable costs to all of the witnesses, the State, and the overburdened criminal justice system. But, when balanced against a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation, the inconvenience of another trial cannot receive primary consideration. The confrontation clause serves purposes that are too important to dismiss when the State has used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>less than good-faith efforts to bring to the trial the witnesses with whom it seeks to establish a defendant\u2019s criminal guilt or criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">In this case, the State could have moved for a continuance to attempt to obtain Dr. Torres\u2019s presence by means of the Act, but it did not.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It knew no later than 1 July 1991, when our mandate issued in appellant\u2019s first appeal, that a new trial was to occur. This record does not indicate that the State endeavored to locate Dr. Torres until November 1991 when it learned he was no longer employed at the Perkins Hospital. For the reasons stated earlier, the State failed to show a good-faith effort to secure the attendance at trial of Dr. Torres, and we must conclude, on this record, that the trial court erred in declaring the witness to be unavailable. <em>See People v. Dye, </em>431 Mich. 58, 427 N.W.2d 501, 510-11 (among other reasons, court held that prosecution\u2019s initiation of the Act\u2019s procedures seventeen days before trial and follow-up of request just six days before trial precluded finding of due diligence where prosecution knew of retrial date three months ahead of time), <em>cert, denied, </em>488 U.S. 985, 109 S.Ct. 541, 102 L.Ed.2d 571 (1988); <em>People v. Freeland, </em>101 Mich.App. 501, 300 N.W.2d 616, 621 (1980) (after learning of location of missing witness two days before trial, prosecution was required to move for continuance to utilize the Act\u2019s provisions); <em>State v. Sweeney, </em>45 Wash.App. 81, 723 P.2d 551, 554 (1986) (State should have moved for continuance to obtain witness\u2019s presence by means of the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The error in admitting Dr. Torres\u2019s testimony at trial without first establishing that he was unavailable was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>not harmless. In determining whether an error is harmless, we consider whether \u201cthe erroneous ruling, in relation to the totality of the evidence, played a significant role in influencing the rendition of the verdict, to the prejudice of the appellant.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 653, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). Unless \u201cupon [our] own independent review of the record, [we are] unable to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u2018harmless\u2019 and a reversal is mandated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 350 A.2d 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">A jury, of course, is free to believe or disbelieve any evidence that it chooses. In the instant case, the jury obviously gave more weight to the testimony of Drs. Torres and Mokhtari than to that of appellant\u2019s experts. At a trial involving five experts (four of whom worked for the same hospital), the demeanor and credibility of those experts\u2014 and, thus, the jury\u2019s opportunity to assess their demeanor and credibility \u2014 is greatly significant. For that reason, we cannot overlook the fact that Dr. Torres was essentially one-half of the State\u2019s case against appellant, yet the jury was denied the opportunity to observe Dr. Torres render his opinions about appellant\u2019s mental disorders and his criminal responsibility. This lack of opportunity is particularly egregious in light of appellant\u2019s choice to exercise his right to a jury trial, a right he was unaware of at his first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The error in receiving Dr. Torres\u2019s transcribed testimony, based on an insufficient showing of his unavailability, constituted a denial of defendant\u2019s right to have the jury observe the witness\u2019s demeanor and make a competent evaluation of his credibility. Therefore, we cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that the error in no way influenced the finding of criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Appellant\u2019s other argument on appeal is that, contrary to the jury\u2019s finding, the evidence was sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he was not criminally responsible for the murder of Shirley Baker. We need not and do not address this issue. In criminal appeals, of course, a Maryland court of appeal is required to address sufficiency of the evidence issues even if the court has already decided to reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction on other grounds. The rationale for this requirement is anchored in double jeopardy principles. If an appellate court determines that <em>no </em>\u201crational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d <em>see Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), i.e., that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction, then double jeopardy prohibits the retrial of the defendant for the crime at issue. The court\u2019s determination that the defendant, based on other grounds, was entitled to reversal and a new trial is no longer relevant. In this case, however, it was the appellant\u2019s criminal responsibility \u2014 not his guilt or innocence\u2014 that was at issue. Thus, the danger of double jeopardy is not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">We perceive that appellant\u2019s attempt to fashion a sufficiency argument is misplaced in this case for other reasons as well. He, not the State, had the burden of proof and of persuasion. Given the factual and expert opinion testimony before it, the jury was not persuaded by appellant\u2019s evidence. We cannot substitute our judgment for that of the fact-finder under such circumstances, nor can we say as a matter of law that the jury should have been convinced of the appellant\u2019s lack of criminal responsibility on this record. Accordingly, we do not decide whether the evidence was sufficient to establish that appellant was not criminally responsible, and leave that instead to another trial and, presumably, another jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">JUDGMENT OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY IS REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY WASHINGTON COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-8\">.
