Har Sinai, a non-profit corporation, constructed the subject apartment building with a 100% loan from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under the National Housing Act of 1959. The initial mortgage loan for $4,411,100 at 9.25% interest for 40 years was obtained from HUD on August 24, 1981. In addition to its HUD financing, the apartment building is operated through tenant rent payments and federal rent subsidies. Because of the extensive involvement by the federal government, both through financing and rent subsidies, the apartment building is subject to several restrictions. For example, HUD establishes eligibility requirements for tenants and controls rent. HUD also imposes other operational and maintenance restrictions on the apartment building, such as requiring Har Sinai to fund a reserve replacement fund in order to finance repairs to the building. Furthermore, although the HUD mortgage may be assumed, its transfer to another mortgagee is subject to HUD approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore City (Supervisor) denied Har Sinai\u2019s request for a real property tax exemption and valued the property at $4,361,250. Har Sinai appealed both the denial of the exemption and the valuation to the Property Tax Assessment Appeals Board for Baltimore City where the denial was affirmed, and the value was reduced to $3,987,400. Har Sinai then appealed both issues to the Maryland Tax Court. The Tax Court affirmed both the denial of the exemption and the value assigned by the Property Tax Assessment Appeals Board, <em>i.e., </em>$3,987,400.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Har Sinai appealed the order of the Tax Court to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The circuit court affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>the denial of the exemption but remanded the determination of the property value to the Tax Court. The Supervisor appeals the valuation question to this Court; Har Sinai cross-appeals the circuit court\u2019s order affirming the denial of the exemption. At issue in this appeal then is whether the Tax Court erred in denying Har Sinai\u2019s request for exemption and, if not, whether the Tax Court erred in its valuation of the subject property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">We first consider whether the denial of Har Sinai\u2019s request for an exemption from property taxation was proper. Har Sinai contends that \u201cthe subject property is exempt from property taxation under the clear import of section 7-202\u201d of the Tax-Property Article of the Maryland Annotated Code. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann.Tax Prop. \u00a7 7-202 (1986).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Supervisor asserts (1) that another section of the Tax-Property Article, \u00a7 7-502, pursuant to which Har Sinai is clearly not entitled to any exemption, is controlling here and (2) that even if \u00a7 7-202 were applicable, Har Sinai does not qualify for an exemption under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>The statute relied upon by the Supervisor, \u00a7 7-502, was initially enacted in 1966 to authorize \u201cpolitical subdivision[s] of the State to enter into agreements ... with non-profit institutions ... for payments in lieu of taxes on real property owned by such institutions ... where the real property is used to provide rental housing facilities exclusively to elderly or handicapped families on a nonprofit basis.\u201d 1966 Md.Laws, Chap. 201 pmbl. Thus, \u00a7 7-502 is specifically designated to address the tax status of property like the building at issue here, <em>i.e., </em>multifamily residential apartment buildings for the elderly and handicapped, that are constructed with federal loans and operated on a nonprofit basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Section 7-502 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">(a) (2) Real property that meets the requirements of subsection (b) of this section is not subject to property tax if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">(i) the owner of the real property is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">1. a person who meets the ownership requirements of \u00a7 7-202 of this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">2. a nonprofit corporation that is exempt from income tax under \u00a7 10-104 of the Tax-General Article; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">(ii) the owner of the real property is engaged solely in constructing, operating, or managing multifamily rental housing and other related essential service facilities that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">1. are newly constructed on and after September 24, 1959;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-11\">2. are financed for at least 95% of the cost from loan funds provided under the National Housing Act of 1959 for senior citizen housing programs; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-12\">3. are operated on a nonprofit basis with the revenues from the operation of the housing and facilities controlled by the loan program in order not to produce any net income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-13\">(b) Procedure for exemption. The real property described in subsection (a) of this section may be exempt from property tax only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>(1) the governing body of the subdivision where the real property is located approves an agreement between the subdivision and the owner; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\">(2) under the agreement the owner pays the subdivision a negotiated amount in lieu of property tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Har Sinai, the owner of the property, meets most of the requirements for preferred tax status set forth in \u00a7 7-502. It is a nonprofit housing corporation and, thus, exempt under \u00a7 10-104. It is able to meet the ownership requirements of \u00a7 7-202 so it clearly meets the requirements of \u00a7 7-502(a)(2)(i). Its sole purpose is the ownership and operation of the subject property, which was built in the early 1980\u2019s with 100% financing provided under the National Housing Act of 1959, so it meets the requirements of \u00a7 7-502(a)(2)(ii)(l) and (2). Moreover, the subject property is operated under a Regulatory Agreement and a Housing Assistance Payment Contract, which regulate the project in order to make it nonprofit, so it meets the requirements of \u00a7 7 \u2014 502(a)(2)(ii)(3). There is, however, one more requirement that must be met in order to obtain a favored tax status under this statute. Section 7-502(b) provides that property meeting the criteria set forth in subsection (a) may be exempt <em>\u201conly if\u2019 </em>a Payment in Lieu of Taxes Agreement (PILOT) is received from the local subdivision. It is undisputed that Har Sinai has never requested or received a PILOT and, therefore, cannot be exempt under \u00a7 7-502. The Supervisor argues that the General Assembly granted local jurisdictions the discretion to enter (or not enter) into a PILOT and that this discretion would be undercut if a denial of a request for a PILOT or a failure to request a PILOT would allow a taxpayer to resort to another statute for a total exemption. There is much force to the Supervisor\u2019s argument. We need not reach it here, however, because even if Har Sinai can employ \u00a7 7-202, it is still not entitled to an exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Section 7-202 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>(b) Requirements for exemption. \u2014 (1) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, property is not subject to property tax if the property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">(i) is necessary for and actually used exclusively for a charitable or educational purpose to promote the general welfare of the people of the State, ... and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">(ii) is owned by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">$ $ * &gt;}: * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">4. a nonprofit housing corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">There is no dispute that the property meets the ownership requirements of \u00a7 7-202(b)(l)(ii)(4), that is, the. property is owned by Har Sinai, a nonprofit housing corporation. As Har Sinai asserts, \u201cthe only question which remains about the applicability of Section 7-202 is.whether Har Sinai\u2019s laudable purpose is a \u2018charitable\u2019 one which promotes the general welfare of the people of Maryland.\u201d The Court of Appeals, in interpreting Md.Ann.Code art. 81, \u00a7 9(e),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the predecessor to Tax Prop. \u00a7 7-202, has instructed that a determination of an organization\u2019s charitable status focuses on four factors.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">[It] must include a careful examination of [1] the stated purposes of the organization, [2] the actual work performed, [3] the extent to which the work performed benefits the community and the public welfare in general, and [4] the support provided by donations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-10\"><em>Super. of Assessments v. Group Health Assoc., Inc., </em>308 Md. 151, 157, 517 A.2d 1076 (1986). Har Sinai concedes that this four factor test is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Whether this test has been met is a question of fact, or an application of law to the facts, and therefore the substantial evidence test applies. <em>See Super. of Assessments v. Asbury Methodist Home, Inc., </em>313 Md. 614, 627, 547 A.2d 190 (1988); <em>Group Health, </em>308 Md. at 159, 517 A.2d 1076. Our standard of review, then, is one of deference \u2014 we must determine \u201cwhether a reasoning mind, having a proper understanding of the relevant law, could have reached the conclusion reached by the Tax Court.\u201d <em>See Asbury Methodist Home, </em>313 Md. at 627-28, 547 A.2d 190. Any exemption from taxation is to \u201cbe strictly construed in favor of the State,\u201d <em>Super. of Assessments of Baltimore Cty. v. Bosley Methodist Church Graveyard, </em>293 Md. 208, 212, 443 A.2d 91 (1982), and this rule is \u201cnot relaxed in favor of charitable or benevolent institutions.\u201d <em>Lodge No. 817, Trustees Benev. &amp; Protective Order of Elks v. Super, of Assessments of Wicomico Cty., </em>292 Md. 533, 538, 439 A.2d 591 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the Tax Court\u2019s decision in this case. As in <em>Group Health </em>and <em>Asbury Methodist, </em>the facts here are undisputed. What is very much disputed is whether the Tax Court properly applied the law to the facts. Although the Tax Court denied Har Sinai\u2019s request for tax exemption on the theory that \u00a7 7-502 \u201cprovides exclusive relief from taxes in the subject property,\u201d it also found that, even if \u00a7 7-202 was applicable, no exemption was proper. The Tax Court initially focused on the first three factors set forth in <em>Group Health </em>\u2014 stated purposes, actual work performed and extent to which that work benefits the public welfare in general. With regard to them, the Tax Court reasoned that \u201cthe mere providing of housing to senior citizens, or the provision of non-profit housing is not sufficient to entitle a taxpayer to an exemption under \u00a7 7-202. 7-202 requires that the property actually be used exclusively for and necessary for charitable purposes, to promote the general welfare of the people of the State of Maryland.\u201d The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>then found \u201cas a matter of fact ... that the property is not actually and exclusively used for charitable purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">It is uncontroverted that Har Sinai, in addition to operating and maintaining the subject property, performs only minimal other services, most of which are only for its tenants. Accordingly, Har Sinai cannot and does not assert that it provides, let alone exclusively provides, in the subject property, some charitable services, other than non-profit housing, that would qualify the property for tax exempt status. Rather, Har Sinai\u2019s only response to the finding of the Tax Court seems to be that the Tax Court erred because the plain language of the statute contains no such provision. Har Sinai is correct that \u00a7 7-202(b)(l) does not expressly state that \u201cprovision of non-profit housing alone is not sufficient to entitle a tax payer to an exemption\u201d but the statute does provide that in order to receive an exemption, property must not only be used exclusively for a charitable purpose but also exclusively for a charitable purpose which will \u201cpromote the <em>general </em>welfare of the people of the State.\u201d (emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Moreover, in <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 525 A.2d 628 (1987) and its progeny, the Court of Appeals made it clear that when pursuing the meaning of statutory language, a court is \u201cnot limited to the words of the statute as they are printed in the Annotated Code.\u201d 309 Md. at 514-15, 525 A.2d 628. <em>See also Wynn v. State, </em>313 Md. 533, 539, 546 A.2d 465 (1988); <em>Martinez v. Lopez, </em>300 Md. 91, 102, 476 A.2d 197 (1984); <em>McAlear v. McAlear, </em>298 Md. 320, 343 n. 25, 469 A.2d 1256 (1984); <em>Skinner v. First United Church, </em>88 Md.App. 434, 439, 594 A.2d 1245 (1991). Rather, a court \u201cmay and often must consider ... its relationship to earlier and subsequent legislation, and other material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose;\u201d legislative history, thus, \u201cbecomes the context within which\u201d a court reads \u201cthe particular [statutory] language ... in a given case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515, 594 A.2d 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>In this case, the legislative history is indeed telling. The statutory predecessor of \u00a7 7-202 expressly provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKH\">In the case of a nonprofit housing corporation this exemption shall not extend to the property of the nonprofit housing corporation <em>based solely on the fact that it is a nonprofit housing corporation; </em>but rather, on the fact that the corporations\u2019 <em>property is, in fact, devoted to a charitable, benevolent, educational or general public welfare purpose.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><em>See </em>Md.Ann.Code art. 81, \u00a7 9(e) (1980), superseded by Tax Prop. \u00a7 7-202 (emphasis added). This sentence was omitted in the recodification of the tax provisions of the Code into the Tax Property Article in 1985. The revisor\u2019s note for \u00a7 7-202, however, indicates that the new language was \u201cderived without substantial change from former Art. 81, \u00a7 9(a) and (e)\u201d and that the \u201creference that sets out the purposes for which property owned by a nonprofit housing corporation must be used in order to qualify for an exemption is deleted in light of the requirement of subsection (b)(l)(i) of [\u00a7 7-202].\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 7-202, Revisor\u2019s Note. In interpreting similar statutory revisions and explanatory re-visor\u2019s notes, the Court of Appeals has expressly held that a change in the phraseology of a statute does not modify the law since the legislative intent to do so is not, in these circumstances, \u201cunmistakable.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Office &amp; Prof. Employees Int\u2019l Union v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>295 Md. 88, 100, 453 A.2d 1191 (1982); <em>Bureau of Mines v. The George\u2019s Creek Coal and Lumber Co., </em>272 Md. 143, 155, 321 A.2d 748 (1974); <em>Alters v. Tittsworth, </em>269 Md. 677, 683, 309 A.2d 476 (1973). Thus, the Tax Court properly applied the law to the undisputed facts in finding that merely providing \u201cnon-profit housing is not sufficient to entitle a tax payer to an exemption under \u00a7 7-202.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The Tax Court then focused on the remaining factor to be considered in determining whether an exemption under \u00a7 7-202 was appropriate, <em>i.e., </em>whether support was provided by donations, and found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>The subsidy, the Court finds is coming from the federal government and not from the taxpayer, and consequently even under 7-202 the taxpayer could not prevail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">This finding also reflects the Tax Court\u2019s understanding of the applicable law and is supported by substantial evidence. The undisputed evidence was that Har Sinai received no private donations to support the operation of the apartment building. Rather, it was uncontroverted that the apartment building was funded entirely by federal subsidies and rent paid by tenants. The federal subsidies are made pursuant to the Housing Assistance Payments Contract executed between HUD and Har Sinai. Each tenant\u2019s contribution is calculated based on 30% of his net income, which is gross income adjusted for medical expenses and other expenses. Any difference between the total rent and the tenant\u2019s contribution is paid by HUD. In addition, HUD pays the entire rent during periods of vacancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The question of whether similar federal government subsidies may be considered \u201cdonations\u201d for the support of a property for which a charitable exemption is claimed is one of first impression in Maryland. Relevant case law in other jurisdictions suggests that the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion, that they do riot, was correct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>For example, in <em>Waterbury First Church Housing, Inc. v. Brown, </em>170 Conn. 556, 367 A.2d 1386 (1976), the court considered a nonprofit housing corporation\u2019s appeal of the tax commission\u2019s denial of its request for exemption from a sales and use tax. In holding that denial of an exemption was proper, the Connecticut Supreme Court focused on the fact that the housing corporation received no charitable donations and derived its income entirely from tenant rent contributions and federal rent subsidies. <em>Id. </em>367 A.2d at 1390. The <em>Waterbury </em>Court reasoned that \u201c[a]n institution must be exclusively charitable, not only in the purposes for which it is formed but also in <em>the manner and means </em>it adopts for the accomplishment of those purposes____ [A]n essential characteristic of a charitable organization ... is that it achieve its purpose \u2018through the means of funds, derived from the <em>gratuities of the benevolent. </em>\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1389 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Another case that is especially noteworthy is <em>Yakima First Baptist Homes, Inc. v. Gray, </em>82 Wash.2d 295, 510 P.2d 243, 246 (1973) in which the Supreme Court of Washington held that a federal rent subsidy could not be considered a public donation or private charity as used in the state\u2019s property tax exemption statute. The governing statute required that an exempted property be supported \u201cin part by public donations or private charity.\u201d <em>See id. </em>510 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>P.2d at 245. A nonprofit corporation sought to have a twelve story apartment building for the elderly declared exempt from property taxes. The primary source of funds for the construction of the building was a loan from the federal government. The building was operated and maintained \u201calmost entirely from rents and rent subsidies\u201d while \u201c[t]he amounts received from contributions appealed] ... to be extremely small.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246. The Washington Supreme Court refused to consider federal rent subsidies as donations because, as here, the subsidies were paid pursuant to a contract between the apartment building and the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><em>See also Better Living Services v. Bolivar Cty., </em>587 So.2d 914, 917 (Miss.1991) (nonprofit corporation operating low cost apartments not a \u201ccharitable society\u201d entitled to exemption when corporation received all income from HUD or tenant rent); <em>G.D.L.

Accordingly, the circuit court\u2019s order affirming that decision was entirely proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">(iii)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Having concluded that the Tax Court did not err in denying Har Sinai\u2019s request for exemption, we now turn to the issue of valuation. The value of real property for assessment purposes is \u201cits value on the date of finality.\u201d Tax Prop. \u00a7 8-102(a). \u201cValue,\u201d according to the Code, is \u201cthe full cash value of the property.\u201d Tax Prop. \u00a7 1-101(11). Generally, \u201cassessors have reasonable latitude in selecting a method of valuation, so long as they assess the property at its full cash value.\u201d <em>Verkouteren v. Super. of Assessments, </em>38 Md.App. 216, 222, 380 A.2d 642 (1977); <em>see Macht v. Dept. of Assessments, </em>266 Md. 602, 608, 296 A.2d 162 (1972). The choice of a particular method of valuation is a question of fact for which we will defer to the expertise of the taxing agency. <em>See Bornstein v. State Tax Commission, </em>227 Md. 331, 337, 176 A.2d 859 (1962); <em>Weil v. Super. of Assessments, </em>266 Md. 238, 251-254, 292 A.2d 68 (1972); <em>Super. of Assessments v. St. Leonard Shores Jt.

Thus, as with the first issue, a court must affirm the order of the Tax Court as to valuation if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>determines that \u201ca reasoning mind, having a proper understanding of the relevant law, could have reached the conclusion of the Tax Court.\u201d <em>See Asbury Methodist Home, </em>313 Md. at 628, 547 A.2d 190; <em>Fairchild Hiller Corp. v. Super. of Assessments, </em>267 Md. 519, 521, 298 A.2d 148 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The Tax Court, affirming the decision of the Property Tax Appeals Board, valued the subject property at $3,987,400.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The circuit court remanded this issue to the Tax Court for further consideration on the theory that the Tax Court failed to articulate how and to what extent \u201csignificant value influences\u201d affected the valuation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>subject property. On appeal, the Supervisor contends that the circuit court erred in remanding the case and argues that the Tax Court\u2019s valuation should be given deference. Har Sinai contends that the Tax Court erred in valuing nonprofit property using traditional valuation approaches. Specifically, Har Sinai alleges that the valuation approach adopted by the Tax Court was flawed because it did not give the HUD restrictions full effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">With this background in mind, we turn to the pivotal question of whether the Supervisor\u2019s valuation reflects the property\u2019s full cash value. Generally, full cash value is its market value, that is, \u201cthe value a willing purchaser will pay for it to a willing seller in an open market, eliminating exceptional and extraordinary conditions giving the property temporarily an abnormal value.\u201d <em>Rogan v. County Commissioners, </em>194 Md. 299, 311, 71 A. 47 (1950); <em>see Supervisor v. The Ort Children Trust Four, </em>294 Md. 195, 201, 448 A.2d 947 (1982); <em>Bornstein, </em>227 Md. at 337, 176 A.2d 859. Although market value is generally an appropriate starting point in the valuation of property, it is not a required valuation method. Indeed, the Court of Appeals has suggested that market value of property would not be an appropriate value of the property in cases where \u201cthe property is of such a special nature that no market for it exists and then its intrinsic value must be ascertained by consideration of its cost, nature, utility, and other characteristics.\u201d <em>Fairchild Hiller, </em>267 Md. at 521, 298 A.2d 148. Such was the case here, where the market value approach was rejected by both experts because the subject property was presently only marketable as non-profit housing and the experts knew of no sale of similar property.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The Supervisor\u2019s expert witness, Mr. McCann, used an income approach but included the impact on income and expenses caused by the HUD restrictions. For example, instead of adjusting actual expenses to conform with market expectations, he used actual expenses. He also used the actual mortgage sums to determine the capitalization rate and excluded a return on equity because this property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>was run on a non-profit basis. Thus, his valuation of the subject property was based on HUD supported income, HUD required expenses, a non-equity return because of the property\u2019s nonprofit status, and the assumption of the HUD mortgage; it was $4,121,000. Pursuant to state practice, the Supervisor did not request an increase of the Property Tax Assessment Appeals Board value that had been set at $3,987,400; instead, the Supervisor asked that this value be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">In contrast, Har Sinai\u2019s expert, Mr. Campbell, used a discounted cash flow approach in which \u201cthe only income on this property is the equity build up that is made by principal payments each year on the mortgage.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This approach \u201ctakes into account the property\u2019s complete lack of marketability or return on investment until the year 2022,\u201d the year the HUD mortgage will be completely repaid; in doing so, it places no value on the fact, conceded by Mr. Campbell, that, if a buyer was found, any buyer would assume the mortgage balance, which at present exceeds $4 million. The methodology propounded by Mr. Campbell resulted in a valuation of $965,000 \u2014 approximately $3,000,000 lower than the Supervisor\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">After considering this testimony and substantial memoranda, the Tax Court upheld the Supervisor\u2019s valuation. As reflected in its oral opinion, the Tax Court was well aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>of the fact that the property at issue was not an apartment building used for normal investment purposes. The Tax Court, however, refused to find, as Har Sinai urged, that the property had no value other than \u201cequity build up made by principal payments each year on the mortgage.\u201d Rather, the Tax Court found that the HUD restrictions, though certainly encumbrances to the future use and enjoyment of the property, did not make the property unmarketable. Instead, the Tax Court found that the HUD mortgage \u201ccan be assumed\u201d and that the property was marketable though its market was limited to that of other nonprofit corporations. This determination by the Tax Court is in accord with Maryland law. <em>See, e.g., Ort Children Trust Four, </em>294 Md. 195, 448 A.2d 947 (while long term lease \u2014 40 years if options are exercised \u2014 at below market rental value impeded property\u2019s capacity to produce more income, this impediment did not make the property valueless or unmarketable); <em>Meade Heights, Inc. v. State Tax Commission, </em>202 Md. 20, 29, 95 A.2d 280 (1953) (apartments were constructed by taxpayer on government leased land; apartments were subject to certain restrictions, <em>e.g., </em>they could only be subleased to military personnel and at approved rental amounts; the Court held that the leasehold interest and apartments could be valued and that \u201cthe fact that it is not wholly free of restrictions as to use does not ... render it immune from tax.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The Tax Court specifically rejected Har Sinai\u2019s arguments that the Supervisor\u2019s valuation did not consider the HUD restrictions, finding that \u201cthe Supervisor did consider the [HUD] restrictions ... in the method that he used. He may not have ... quantified it as any specific reduction. But ... I think just a consideration of those restrictions is enough.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the Tax Court found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>The property produces income, and the measurement of this income, I believe, provides a basis of valuation. The difference between the parties is substantial, almost Three Million. And it appears to result in part from [Har Sinai\u2019s] consideration of the debt service as part of their expert\u2019s income analysis methodology.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>The circuit court found that <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Super. of Assessments, </em>278 Md. 659, 366 A.2d 369 (1976) and <em>Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>308 Md. 627, 521 A.2d 734 (1987) \u201cimpose a legal standard which has not been met\u201d. The court below reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\">The lengthy \u201claundry list\u201d of assessment considerations found in <em>Shell Oil </em>was republished here to emphasize the necessity of considering significant value influence, and to some reasonable extent articulating and quantifying them. The record here does not evidence that. The best that can be gleaned from the record is that both Mr. McCann and the Maryland Tax Court believed that those influences were inherent in the McCann appraisal methodology. But how and to what extent they impact on valuation is not sufficiently clear, as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYV\">Contrary to the circuit court\u2019s suggestion, neither <em>Shell Oil </em>nor <em>Mercantile-Safe Deposit </em>requires or even implies that the Tax Court must articulate and quantify \u201csignificant value influence^],\u201d such as the HUD restrictions, when determining the value of a property case. <em>Shell Oil\u2019s </em>list of factors simply emphasizes that each parcel of land is different and that although land in the same taxing classification must be assessed and taxed uniformly, assessors may consider dissimilarities in determining value. <em>Shell Oil, </em>278 Md. at 666-667, 366 A.2d 369. <em>Mercantile-Safe </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number><em>Deposit </em>deals with covenants running with the land and their impact on valuing property; it recognized such covenants as a possible valuation influence but did not distinguish their impact on value from any other valuation influence. Rather, the Court concluded simply that \u201c[t]o the extent the covenants enhanced the value of the land they are compensable.\u201d <em>Mercantile-Safe Deposit, </em>308 Md. at 646, 521 A.2d 734. \u201cIt is firmly established in this State that the relative weight to be accorded to any relevant factor in a particular case is for the assessing authorities and not for the courts.\u201d <em>Bornstein, </em>227 Md. at 337, 176 A.2d 859. The circuit court\u2019s holding is directly at odds with this settled principle. Accordingly, it must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">In sum, the Tax Court did not err in accepting the Supervisor\u2019s valuation of the property. Its decision reflects a proper understanding of the law and is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.

In contrast, in each of the out-of-state cases relied upon by Har Sinai, the principal statutory or constitutional requirement for tax exempt status was simply that a bona fide charity <em>use </em>its property exclusively for charitable or non-profit purposes. <em>See, e.g., Yorgason v.

Other jurisdictions not identified by Har Sinai have held similarly. <em>See Rolla Apartments v. State Tax Commission, </em>797 S.W.2d 781, 792 (Mo.Ct.App.1990) (charitable exemption is granted if property is \u201cactually and regularly used exclusively for ... purposes purely charitable\u201d; federal subsidization rather than private charitable contributions \"does not dictate a different result\u201d); <em>Public Housing Assistance, Inc. v.

In ruling on the valuation issue, the Tax Court found:</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The property that \u2014 the subject property ... is a hundred and nine unit high rise apartment; has a mortgage of Four Million Four Hundred and Eleven Thousand, permanent mortgage, at nine and a quarter percent, forty years, which can be assumed____ [T]his property has a date of finality of 1/1/89.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">The property is a HUD property. It\u2019s non-profit, with a guaranteed rent. The value appealed from is Three Million Nine Hundred Eighty-seven Thousand Four Hundred Dollars. The highest and best use of the property as of the date of finality is [its] present use as a HUD project.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">The Court finds that the market for this type of property is a nonprofit housing corporation. The sale of this property ... is limited to a non-profit housing corporation. We expect that in deciding on a purchase price, the income stream of this property is an appropriate consideration in that the financial liability is necessary to promote the charitable purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">The property produces income, and the measurement of this income, I believe, provides a basis for valuation. The difference between the parties is substantial, almost Three Million. And it appears to result in part from Petitioner\u2019s consideration of the debt service as a part of their expert\u2019s income analysis methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">I am not convinced that the Supervisor\u2019s methodology is flawed, or that a value of Three Million Nine Hundred and Eighty-seven Thousand Four Hundred Dollars is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">The actual income and expenses were used. And the cap rate appears to be reasonable, considering the security of the income stream. It is considered as an acceptable appraisal practice not to include debt service as an expense which justifies \u2014 we think justifies the assessor\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">The petitioner is required to meet the burden of proof which convinces this Court of a value other than that determined by the Supervisor. Based on the evidence in the present case, I\u2019m not so convinced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b674-6\">. The value of the equity build up in present value dollars, according to Mr. Campbell, is approximately $574,000 to $610,000. In addition to the equity build up, Mr. Campbell testified that he included one other item in his appraisal of the property and that was the replacement reserve fund. According to Mr. Campbell, \"[u]nder HUD requirements, you must fund money into a replacement reserve fund each year. It is the practice of HUD that once a hundred and forty-four payments have been made, that you are not required to make any further payments into this fund, unless indeed it's used for some replacement [of certain parts of the building as they wear out]. So I feel that that is value that goes with the mortgage.\u201d The replacement reserve fund are payments that are \"put in a bank and draw[] interest.\" The present value of this replacement fund, as calculated by Mr. Campbell, is approximately $131,000 to $143,000. Also included in Mr. Campbell's calculation is the debt service reversion fund which is valued at approximately $190,000 to $208,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b675-5\">. Har Sinai heavily relies on the following testimony as assertedly demonstrating that the approach of Mr. McCann, the Supervisor\u2019s appraiser, \"took into account only the benefits provided by the HUD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>program, while completely ignoring the negative impact of the HUD restrictions\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">Q. It is true, is it not, sir, that your approach to valuing this property did not take into consideration in any quantified sense, in any dollar or percentage sense, the fact that the marketability of this property is restricted as it is by the HUD regulatory agreement until the year 2022, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">A. [by Mr. McCann] That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">Q. Okay. And it is also true, is it not, Mr. McCann, that your approach to the value of this property did not in any quantifiable sense take into account that the HUD regulatory agreement for this property restricts any owner of it from now until the year 2022 ... from deriving any operating profit of any kind or any dividend out ... of this, right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">Q. [by Mr. McCann] That is correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">All that this exchange demonstrates is that Mr. McCann did not consider that the HUD agreement restricts until 2022 the <em>marketability of </em>the property and the ability of owner to derive an <em>operating profit from the property. </em>It is undisputed, as the Tax Court found, that Mr. McCann did consider the negative impact of the restrictions imposed by the HUD agreement in reaching his appraisal. He used actual income, actual expenses, a lower capitalization rate and excluded any return on equity; Mr. McCann simply did not consider the negative impacts in the way Har Sinai wanted him to. There is no requirement that he do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b676-10\">. Thus, as the Tax Court implied, the assessment by Har Sinai's expert, based on a discounted cash flow, in which the only item considered as income was the equity build up resulting from the principal payments on the mortgage, in fact takes account <em>only </em>of the \"negative impacts\u201d of the HUD restrictions and ignores their \"benefits.\u201d Value is not only what a willing buyer will <em>pay </em>for a piece of property but also includes the mortgages or other indebtedness that a buyer is willing to assume for the seller in exchange for the property. Even Har Sinai\u2019s expert agreed, in response to a hypothetical question, that a prospective buyer of the subject property would assume any outstanding mortgage debt. To not include this assumption of debt in the value of the property would in effect mean that the property is only valued at the owner\u2019s equity. This argument was rejected many years ago. <em>See Allen v.
