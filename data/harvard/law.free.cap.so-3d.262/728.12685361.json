We grant the petition and order the circuit court to render such an order. See Espinoza-Brito v.

Because we are confident that the circuit court will promptly comply with the ruling of this court, we withhold formal issuance of the writ. Within 20 days of this order, the State of Florida shall file in this court a copy of the circuit court's written order of revocation of probation.\n  </p>\n  <judges id=\"p-7\">\n   NORTHCUTT, CASANUEVA, and SALARIO, JJ., Concur.\n  </judges>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
