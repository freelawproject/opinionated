We find no error and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On February 11, 2014, Turner entered a guilty plea to Count I, possession of a controlled substance with intent, and Count II, unlawful possession of a firearm or weapon by a convicted felon. He was subsequently sentenced as a habitual offender under Mississippi Code Annotated section 99-19-81 (Rev. 2014) to twelve years for Count I and ten years for Count II, to run concurrently, for a total of twelve years to serve in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. On February 13, 2015, Turner filed a motion for PCCR, which the trial court denied. Turner now appeals and argues: (1) his guilty plea was involuntarily entered, (2) he received ineffective assistance of counsel, (3) his sentence as a habitual offender is illegal, and (4) his constitutional rights were violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4.

Turner claims he pled guilty due to constant pressure\n   from his attorney and family. \"When a PC[C]R movant tries to get out of an already entered guilty plea, it is the movant, not the State, who bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that the guilty plea was involuntary.\"\n   <em>\n    Watkins v.

However, \"[a] lawyer's 'persuading' a defendant to plead guilty by 'every means at his disposal' does not render the plea involuntary if that persuasion does not result from fear, violence, deception, or improper inducements.\"\n   <em>\n    Brasington v.

During Turner's plea hearing, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE COURT: Before you should be a petition to enter a plea of guilty.

The record shows Turner was advised of the nature of the charges against him and the consequences of a guilty plea. Turner was further advised that by pleading guilty, he was waiving certain constitutional rights. Importantly, Turner stated his guilty plea was not the result of any force, threats, coercion, or intimidation. Instead, Turner stated he was pleading guilty because he committed both crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 10. We find Turner's guilty plea was voluntarily entered. Accordingly, this claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    II. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 11. Turner next argues he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, Turner claims his counsel failed to conduct an independent investigation into his case, was \"hostile to the facts of affirmative defenses,\" and failed to make certain objections during his pretrial hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 12. \"[W]here a defendant voluntarily pleads guilty to an offense, he waives all non-jurisdictional rights incident to trial....\"\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7034679\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/60/824/#p828\">\n    60 So.3d at 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 6). \"This waiver includes all claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, except insofar as the alleged ineffectiveness relates to the voluntariness of the giving of the guilty plea.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7034679\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/60/824/#p828\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 13. As previously discussed, Turner voluntarily pled guilty to both offenses. Therefore, he waived his right to now claim ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 14. Despite the waiver, we find Turner's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim fails. To prove ineffective assistance of counsel, Turner must show: (1) his counsel's performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 687,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). There is \"a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To overcome this presumption, Turner \"must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 15. \"The defendant must allege facts of ineffective assistance with specificity and detail.\"\n   <em>\n    Berryhill v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787100\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/938/#p941\">\n    197 So.3d 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 941 (\u00b6 10) (Miss. Ct. App. 2016)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). A \"petitioner's bare assertions are insufficient.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787100\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/938/#p941\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 16. Turner claims his counsel failed to adequately investigate his case and was \"hostile to the facts of affirmative defenses.\" However, the plea-hearing transcript shows Turner advised the trial court, under oath, that he was satisfied with the services of his counsel, that his counsel had taken the time to familiarize himself with the facts and circumstances of his case, and had explained the elements of the charged crimes as well as any possible defenses he might have to those charges. Additionally, the signed plea petition indicates Turner was \"satisfied with the advice and help [his] lawyer ha[d] given.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 17. Turner fails to offer any evidence of his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim beyond the unsupported assertions in his brief that a police officer lied and fabricated evidence in order to convict him. However, such bare assertions are insufficient.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787100\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/938/#p941\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 18. Turner further claims his counsel failed to make certain objections. However, \"counsel's choice of whether or not to file certain motions ... or make certain objections fall[s] within the ambit of trial strategy and cannot give rise to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9447581\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/815/1196/#p1200\">\n    815 So.2d 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1200 (\u00b6 8) (Miss. 2002) (internal quotation mark omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 19. Overall, Turner has failed to show that his counsel's performance was deficient and that the alleged deficient performance prejudiced his defense. Accordingly, his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    III. Illegal Sentence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 20. Turner next argues his sentence under Mississippi Code Annotated section 99-19-81 is illegal. He claims the trial court erroneously introduced certified copies of his prior felony convictions without any accompanying testimony from the certifying official. Turner contends that his inability to confront the party responsible for certifying the copies deprived him of his sixth amendment right to confrontation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 21. The Mississippi Supreme Court has set out the parameters of the right to confrontation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 3, Section 26 of the Mississippi Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him. The United States Supreme Court has held that the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause bars the admission of \"testimonial statements\" made by a witness who does not appear at trial, unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him. Though no exhaustive list defining testimonial statements exists, \"a document created solely for an 'evidentiary purpose' ranks as testimonial.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Small v.

Indeed, the certification of the documents \"indicates that the custodian of the records swore that the documents were true and correct copies, not that [Turner] actually committed any act.\"\n   <em>\n    Frazier v.

Turner last argues his constitutional rights were violated. He claims he was denied the right to confront the confidential informant in this case. He also claims that the evidence obtained by the police and used to convict him was falsified and manufactured. Turner asserts that these violations, coupled with his ineffective counsel, left him with no choice but to plead guilty. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 24. \"If a defendant pleads guilty to committing the charged offense, he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.\"\n   <em>\n    Rustin v.

Ct. App. 2014) (internal quotation mark omitted). By pleading guilty to the charged offenses, Turner's claim is procedurally barred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6958991\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/138/270/#p273\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 25.
