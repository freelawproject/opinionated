J. Investments, LLC (\"VJI\"), thereby dismissing her claims against VJI to annul the transfer of immovable property, with prejudice, and canceling the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   recorded in the records of the Jefferson Parish Mortgage Office. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant, NMP, LLC (\"NMP\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   through its managing member, defendant, Jessica Haggard, borrowed the sum of $45,000.00 from Ms. McClain in order to purchase a house situated at 13 Sarah Street in Westwego, Louisiana (the \"Property\") from the seller, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"Federal Home\"). According to the Cash Sale Without Warranty, which was executed on February 24, 2016 and recorded in the public records of Jefferson Parish on March 1, 2016, NMP purchased the property from Federal Home \"for [$48,000.00], cash in hand paid, for which acquittance [was] [t]herein granted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As evidence of NMP's $45,000.00 loan from Ms. McClain to purchase the Property, NMP executed a \"Promissory Note\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   dated February 23, 2016, wherein NMP agreed that the \"obligation would be secured by a 'Deed of Trust' [\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   a mortgage] on the Property to be executed and recorded in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.\" Ms. McClain entrusted the preparation, execution and recordation of the Deed of Trust [hereinafter referred to interchangeably with \"the mortgage\"] to Ms. Haggard, NMP's managing member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After NMP failed to pay the monthly installments and the full sum of the loan when due in accordance with the terms of the Promissory Note, Ms. McClain retained legal counsel to pursue collection of the money owed and, if necessary, was prepared to seize and sell the Property subject to the Deed of Trust (or \"mortgage\"). Unfortunately, in the process of doing so, Ms. McClain learned that not only had NMP failed to execute or record the mortgage on the Property, apparently Ms. Haggard never even prepared one, and had not otherwise perfected any recorded security interest in the Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, no mortgage of record on the Property exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. McClain, through counsel, made several attempts to reach an agreement with Ms. Haggard to repay the loan and to enforce her obligation to execute and record a security interest in the Property to no avail. On or about February 9, 2017, communications between the parties ceased. Consequently, on March 2, 2017, Ms. McClain filed the instant suit against NMP and Jessica Haggard seeking to enforce the Promissory Note, for declaratory relief to order NMP to execute and record a mortgage on the Property, and for damages \"[a]rising [o]ut of [f]raudulent [m]isconduct.\" Additionally, in the event NMP sought to transfer the Property, on March 28, 2017, Ms. McClain filed a notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   , in order to place any prospective purchaser of the Property on notice of litigation relating to the Property. The notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   recorded by Ms. McClain provided the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Please take notice that Gina McClain has filed in the above numbered proceeding a petition\n   <strong>\n    to\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    assert a security interest in the [P]roperty\n   </strong>\n   .... [Emphasis supplied.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. McClain alleges that NMP, acting through Ms. Haggard, transferred the Property by \"Quit Claim\" to Statler-Waldorf, LLC (\"Statler\"), another entity co-owned by Ms. Haggard, for the sum of $1.00. The transfer of the Property was recorded in the public records of Jefferson Parish on February 15, 2017, prior to the recordation of the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   . According to Ms. McClain, the \"Quit Claim\" transfer took place without her knowledge or consent, and was \"clearly a shell game\" made \"with the intent of selling the Property to a third party and keep[ing] for the benefit of Jessica Haggard and her entity(ies) all of the profits therefrom, to the detriment of [Ms. McClain] and in derogation of [her] rights against Haggard and NMP.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Unbeknownst to Ms. McClain, on April 10, 2017, Statler sold the Property to defendant, VJI, for $60,000.00 pursuant to an Act of Cash Sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The act of sale was filed into the Jefferson Parish conveyance records on April 11, 2017. Ms. McClain contends that the first she learned of Statler's sale of the Property to VJI was on May 1, 2017. On that day, the closing attorney\n   handling the sale for VJI notified Ms. McClain's counsel that, when updating the mortgage certificate, it was discovered that a notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   had been filed on Ms. McClain's behalf two weeks prior to the closing of the sale. After further review of Jefferson Parish's public records, counsel for Ms. McClain discovered the previous sale of the Property from NMP to Statler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ms. McClain then filed a \"Supplemental, Amending, and Restated\" petition on October 24, 2017 adding Statler and VJI as defendants. The petition states that VJI was being added \"for the reason that its title to the [Property] may be adversely affected by the resolution of some or all of the issues in this case ....\" In her amending petition, Ms. McClain asserts several claims against NMP, Jessica Haggard, and/or Statler, and seeks the following relief against them: a judgment against NMP enforcing the Promissory Note; a judgment against NMP and Ms. Haggard for fraudulently inducing Ms. McClain to loan NMP money to purchase the Property by representing that Ms. Haggard would prepare, execute and record a Deed of Trust, or mortgage, against the Property; and, a judgment against NMP, Ms. Haggard, and Statler disgorging them of all profits and benefits received from their fraudulent transfer of the Property for $60,000. None of these claims involve VJI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the claims made by Ms. McClain against or involving VJI, she seeks a judgment declaring her security interest in the Property, retroactive to the date NMP purchased the Property. Ms. McClain also seeks a judgment annulling the transfer of the Property from NMP to Statler,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which she contends would then annul Statler's transfer of the Property to VJI, and obligate Statler to return to VJI the price VJI paid for the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 10, 2018, in response to Ms. McClain's supplemental, amending, and restated petition, VJI filed an exception of no cause of action arguing that, under the public records doctrine, its Property cannot be encumbered by a mortgage that was not recorded when VJI purchased the Property. Additionally, VJI argued that, as an innocent third party purchaser of the Property for value, it was entitled to rely on the face of the public records. Here, those records evidenced a prior transfer of the Property from NMP to Statler, the entity who subsequently sold the Property to VJI. VJI also claimed that Ms. McClain's notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   was defective because it did not contain the name of the person or entity against whom it was to be effective,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Statler, and, thus, without it, there was no chance of VJI obtaining notice of the\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   against the Property in the public records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   VJI's exception of no cause of action came for hearing on April 10, 2018. At the close of the hearing, the trial court sustained VJI's exception of no cause of action based on its determination that \"there was never a mortgage filed in this matter,\" and that the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   was \"deficient for failure to note the name of the actual owner of this property.\" The trial court issued a written judgment on April 23, 2018, in favor of VJI sustaining its exception of no cause of action and dismissing Ms. McClain's claims against it, with prejudice. The judgment further ordered\n   that the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   be canceled from the public records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is from this judgment that Ms. McClain timely filed the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, Ms. McClain avers the trial court erred: (1) in finding the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   deficient because it failed to contain the name of the record owner of the property; (2) in granting VJI's exception of no cause of action dismissing her claims against it and canceling the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   on grounds that no mortgage or security interest was filed against the Property; and, alternatively, (3) in failing to take into consideration the fraud exception to the Louisiana public records doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   An appellate court reviews the judgment sustaining a peremptory exception of no cause of action\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , because the exception raises a question of law and the trial court's decision is based only on the sufficiency of the petition.\n   <em>\n    In re Succession of Gendron\n   </em>\n   , 17-216 (La. 12/27/17),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12661933\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/236/802/#p807\">\n    236 So.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 807.

Consequently, the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   was improper and without legal effect and, as such, it was proper for the trial court to order its cancellation. To reach this conclusion, the various transfers of the Property and the dates thereof are significant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    February 23, 2016\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   NMP executed a Promissory Note wherein NMP agreed that the $45,000 loan obligation to Ms. McClain for NMP's purchase of the Property from Federal Home would be secured by a Deed of Trust on the Property in favor of Ms. McClain; NMP agreed to prepare, execute and record the Deed of Trust.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    March 1, 2016\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   NMP recorded the previously executed Cash Sale for the purchase of the Property from Federal Home in the Jefferson Parish records.

At the time of the transfer, no mortgage or security interest in favor of Ms. McClain was recorded against the Property; thus, Statler acquired the Property free and clear of any such encumbrance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    February 15, 2017:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Statler recorded the transfer of the Property from NMP, thereby divesting NMP of all ownership interest in the Property.

Importantly, on this date NMP\n   <em>\n    no longer owned the Property\n   </em>\n   upon which Ms. McClain was seeking to assert a security interest, having been divested of ownership by virtue of the February 15, 2017 quitclaim to Statler. On March 28, 2017, according to the public records, Statler owned the property free and clear of any encumbrances. Statler's name is not included in the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   . At no time did Ms. Haggard (in her individual capacity) ever possess an ownership interest in the Property. No mortgage or security interest was ever recorded against the Property in favor of Ms. McClain while it was owned by NMP.\n   <strong>\n    Because NMP possessed no ownership interest in the Property and could not legally impose a mortgage on property it did not own at the time the notice of\n    <em>\n     lis pendens\n    </em>\n    was filed\n   </strong>\n   , no judgment obtained by Ms. McClain for the claims she asserted in her March 2, 2017 suit against NMP and/or Ms. Haggard (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   to enforce the Promissory Note and repayment of the loan, for declaratory relief requiring NMP to execute and record a mortgage on the Property, and for damages for fraudulent inducement) would or could affect title to the Property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.

C.C.P. art. 3752, we find the notice was without legal effect. As stated in La. C.C.P. art. 3751, the pending action or proceeding must affect title to or assert a mortgage or privilege against the immovable property. It is undisputed that Ms. McClain never had a security interest or mortgage on the Property. And, at the time Ms. McClain filed her original petition against NMP and Ms. Haggard seeking to enforce NMP's obligation to execute and record a mortgage against the Property, the specific relief Ms. McClain was seeking against NMP and Ms. Haggard could not be granted because NMP had previously been divested of all ownership interests therein upon the February 15, 2017 transfer to Statler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Put simply, NMP, the party who promised Ms. McClain to record a mortgage on the Property, could not legally record a mortgage on property it no longer owned. La. C.C. art. 3290. Thus, not only did Ms. McClain not have a mortgage on the Property, she could not get a judgment to enforce the obligation of NMP or Ms. Haggard to record one on\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   Property because neither party owned it. Consequently, at the time the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   was recorded on March 28, 2017, no judgment obtained by Ms. McClain against NMP or Ms. Haggard for the relief she was then seeking could in any way\n   <em>\n    affect title\n   </em>\n   to the Property because neither NMP nor Ms. Haggard-the persons identified in the notice against whom it was to be effective-had any ownership interest in the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The mere fact that Ms. McClain recorded a notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   on the Property does not mean that it was valid or effective as to third parties. Based upon our\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the record, and for the reasons set forth above, we find the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   filed by Ms. McClain herein was neither valid nor effective. Accordingly, given the unique facts of this case, we find the trial court's judgment ordering the cancellation of the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   recorded against the Property was proper. This assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We note that cancellation of the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   does not in any way affect the claims Ms. McClain has made against NMP and Ms. Haggard for repayment of the loan and/or for monetary damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Lack of a Mortgage, or Security Interest, Filed Against the Property\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Ms. McClain also avers that the trial court legally erred in sustaining VJI's exception of no cause of action, dismissing her claims against it, and in canceling the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   , on the basis that there was no mortgage, or security interest, filed against the Property. Specifically, Ms. McClain avers that she pled sufficient facts in her original and amending petitions, which if proven, would entitle her to annul NMP's sale of the Property to Statler, thereby invalidating the allegedly fraudulent sale from Statler to VJI, and would entitle her to have the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   remain of record. According to Ms. McClain, the fact of whether or not a mortgage was actually recorded on the Property has no bearing on the annulment of the sale or on the requisite notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   . We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Because we have concluded that the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   recorded by Ms. McClain in this case had no legal effect as against VJI, a third party, at the time it was recorded, and, thus, the outcome of the suit of which the notice was given could not bind third parties (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , VJI), we must now determine whether Ms. McClain has any valid cause of action against VJI upon which the relief she seeks can be\n   granted-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to annul the sale of the Property from Statler to VJI and to have a security interest in her favor recorded against the Property. Based upon the unique facts of this case as set forth in her original and amending petitions, we find that the law does not afford Ms. McClain a legal remedy against VJI in this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Moreover, in her prayer for relief, Ms. McClain specifically prays for a judgment declaring that she is \"entitled to recognition of a security interest in the Property,\" and further prays that the security interest be recorded.

Consequently, the failure of a creditor to record a mortgage on immovable property in the mortgage records results in the failure to protect that creditor's interest in the property as to third parties who are not a party to or personally bound by the mortgage. Similarly, the failure to record a proper or effective notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   , as we have determined that Ms. McClain failed to do herein, results in the notice having no legal effect against third party purchasers and, as such, they are not bound by the outcome of the litigation that forms the basis of the improper notice.\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

It has further been established that at the time Statler purchased the Property from NMP and, thereafter, sold the Property to VJI, a third party, the public records showed no mortgage or security interest in Ms. McClain's favor encumbering the Property. Similarly, it has been established that the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    pendens\n   </em>\n   filed by Ms. McClain had no legal effect against VJI, a third party, at the time that it was recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For these reasons, we conclude that Ms. McClain has no cause of action against VJI to record a mortgage or to recognize a security interest in her favor against the Property.

The trial court agreed and maintained Kimberly's exception, finding that the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   filed by Agnes was improper and, thus, was ineffective as to Kimberly, a third party purchaser.

Absent a mortgage,\n   <em>\n    McNamara\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable and the fraud and/or mistake exception to the public records doctrine does not apply. This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court's judgment sustaining VJI's exception of no cause of action, dismissing Ms. McClain's claims against it, with prejudice, and ordering cancellation of the notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     AFFIRMED\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    NMP, LLC is an Oregon limited liability company that is not registered to do business in Louisiana.
