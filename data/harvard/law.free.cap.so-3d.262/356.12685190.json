Dysart, Judge Tiffany G. Chase, Judge Dale N. Atkins )\n </judges>\n <opinion id=\"p-8\">\n  Judge Dale N. Atkins\n  The defendant, Tyrone Daniel, was tried for an incident that occurred on April 1, 2014, at the Untouchable Car Wash on Chef Menteur Highway in New Orleans. The jury returned a verdict convicting defendant of second degree murder for shooting and killing Dion \"Nupea\" Johnson. The defendant now appeals his conviction and assigns six assignments of error, each of which is addressed below.\n </opinion>\n <p id=\"p-9\">\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    UNDERLYING FACTS\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  The victim, Dion Johnson, nicknamed \"Nupea,\" was an employee at the Untouchable Car Wash. On April 1, 2014, Nupea was detailing a car for Ms. Linetria Johnson (no relation to the victim, Dion Johnson). Nupea and the defendant, who were first cousins, engaged in an altercation that was witnessed by Allden Franklin, another employee at the Car Wash; Ms. Johnson, whose car was being detailed; and Jujuan Holmes, who also was present at the scene. These witnesses and the defendant all testified at trial.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  Defendant's account of the shooting was that he was shining the tires of his own vehicle when Mr. Johnson, Jujuan Holmes, and an unidentified tattooed man approached him. Defendant testified that Mr. Johnson said: \"It's beef,\" which means war. Defendant testified that he responded: \"Are you serious? Me?\" The victim replied with an expletive, and defendant stood up. Defendant heard the men laugh, and the victim allegedly said: \"You ain't about that life.\" Jujuan Holmes then allegedly told the victim to \"smoke\" defendant.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-12\">\n  Defendant testified that he ran to his car, got in, and locked it. He assumed that the tattooed man was armed. Defendant said that he wanted to leave but someone had taken his keys. He looked for his keys on the floor and started to cry, thinking that he had been set up. He then heard a loud \"boom\" that sounded like someone had hit his car, possibly trying to break the window. Defendant testified that he remembered that the victim, Mr. Johnson, had left his (the victim's) gun in defendant's car. Defendant obtained the gun and testified that he reluctantly got out of the car to ask Mr. Johnson for defendant's car keys. Defendant stated that he looked Mr. Johnson in the eye and asked for his keys, and then heard Mr. Holmes say again to \"smoke him.\" The victim then obtained a ladder and, according to defendant, threw the ladder at defendant. Defendant also claims that he heard Mr. Johnson say: \"I'm gonna kill you.\" Defendant then took the gun out of his pocket and claims that with his eyes closed he fired in the direction of Mr. Johnson, Mr. Holmes, and the tattooed man.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the shooting, defendant claims that he placed the gun on top of his car and ran away confused and scared. When questioned as to why he used the gun, he stated that Mr. Johnson was \"trying to kill\" him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to other witnesses' testimony, at some point Mr. Johnson and defendant\n   exchanged words, resulting in Mr. Johnson throwing a ladder or step-stool either at defendant's vehicle, according to the testimony of Allden Franklin, Lenetria Johnson, and Jujuan Holmes; or, as defendant testified, directly at defendant. Defendant then obtained a gun, either from the console in the interior of his vehicle, as defendant testified, or from the trunk of his vehicle, according to the testimony of Mr. Allden Franklin. The defendant fired several shots at Mr. Johnson, one of which entered Mr. Johnson's back, pierced his aorta, and exited his chest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The record contains no evidence to show that Mr. Johnson also had a gun on his person. Mr. Allden Franklin testified at trial that he never believed Mr. Johnson was going to kill defendant, because Mr. Johnson didn't have a weapon on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Chief Forensic Pathologist at the Orleans Parish Coroner's Office, Dr. Samantha Huber, testified that the victim had a perforating gunshot wound that entered on the left edge of the back, hit a rib, both lungs, the liver, and the aorta, and exited at the right front of the chest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Errors Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We have reviewed the record for errors patent and have found none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error Number 1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant asserts that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction, arguing that the State failed to meet its burden of proving that the killing of Dion Johnson was not committed in self-defense. Defendant argues that the evidence shows Mr. Johnson displayed \"violent behavior\" and that Mr. Johnson attacked defendant with a ladder or stool. Defendant further points to evidence that Mr. Johnson told defendant: \"I'm going to kill you\" to support his belief that he was in imminent danger of being harmed by Mr. Johnson and two other men. Defendant claims that he closed his eyes and fired the gun, and he argues that the State failed to present any credible evidence to contradict these facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When reviewing a conviction for sufficiency of evidence, this Court must determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    State v.

La. R.S. 14:30.1 (A)(1). Specific intent is the state of mind that exists \"when the circumstances indicate that the offender actively desired the prescribed criminal consequences to follow his act or failure to act.\" La.

According to defendant, he was kneeling down and shining the wheels on his car when the altercation began. Defendant argues that Mr. Johnson initially displayed violent behavior when he threw a ladder at defendant and said, \"I'm going to kill you.\" Defendant further argues that no witness refuted the fact that Mr. Johnson threatened to kill him, and defendant points out that Jujuan Holmes told the victim to \"smoke him.\" Defendant also claims that he believed that the tattooed man had a gun in his waistband.

More specifically, defendant claims that the prosecutor \"asked the defendant whether he knew that his girlfriend told the grand jury that the gun he used to kill Nupea was not Nupea's gun\" but was the defendant's own gun.

I looked Nupea straight in the eyes and I said, \"Give me my keys, son.\" [I] heard Jujuan say, \"Man, smoke him.\" Nupea took the ladder and he hummed it at my head.

The district court sustained the objection but denied defendant's request for a mistrial. The State continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q.

C.Cr.P. art. 434.1 (C) permitted the prosecutor to refer to the grand jury. Article 434.1 (C) provides: \"The district attorney may also disclose to a witness at trial, including the defendant if the defendant testifies, any statement of the witness before the grand jury that is inconsistent with the testimony of that witness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As to defendant's reference to\n   <em>\n    State v. Ross\n   </em>\n   , we note that in contrast to the facts in\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   , no grand jury \"testimony\" or \"materials\" were actually offered in this case. Although the colloquy shows that the prosecutor questioned defendant about his knowledge of his girlfriend's grand jury testimony, the substance of that testimony was never offered or discussed. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   does not apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The State's reference in its brief to La. C.Cr.P. art. 434.1 (C) is also misplaced, because Article 434.1 (C) applie\n   s only when impeaching a witness at trial because the witness's statement before the grand jury is inconsistent with the trial testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, no actual statement was offered, much less used for impeachment, because the defendant's girlfriend did not testify at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In short, no testimony from the grand jury became a part of the trial record. When the prosecutor asked defendant about the gun a second time and without referencing the grand jury, defendant invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege. No evidence regarding any testimony given before the grand jury was elicited. But even if we determined that the prosecutor's reference to the grand jury was inappropriate under La. C.Cr.P. art. 434, the trial court\n   <em>\n    sustained\n   </em>\n   the defendant's objection immediately after it occurred. Furthermore, if there were any error in the trial court's handling of this issue, that error is harmless, because ownership of the gun had no bearing on defendant's conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The prosecutor asked: \"Did [Mr. Johnson] say anything to you when [the defendant's] car arrived at the carwash.\" Mr. Holmes replied: \"Yeah. He was like, 'Man, I hope he don't come to my job with all that.' I was like, 'just try to stay away from him.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Counsel for defendant objected that the statements were hearsay. The prosecutor indicated that the statements were not hearsay because they were not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted but were a frame of reference for the jury. The district court overruled defense counsel's objection. The prosecutor again asked Mr. Holmes if Mr. Johnson had said, in reference to the defendant, \"Get from by my job?\" Mr. Holmes said: \"He was like, 'Get from here with all that,' like, 'go ahead.' \" Counsel for defendant again objected on the basis of hearsay. The prosecution replied that the statement was not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but instead for what statements were made immediately before the shooting. The court again overruled the objection. Defense counsel then said: \"Please note our exception. And as long as the State is offering them and saying they're not truthful, we don't have a problem.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   La. C.E. art. 801(C) defines hearsay as \"a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the present trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Hearsay is generally excluded unless specifically permitted by the Code of Evidence or other legislation (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   La.

The victim was shot in the back, constituting additional evidence from which the jury may have concluded that the victim was fleeing rather than acting as the aggressor.

Therefore, a person has no duty whatsoever to retreat and may stand his ground and meet force with force. Accordingly, you may not consider the possibility of retreat as a factor in determining whether or not a person who used deadly force had a reasonable belief that deadly force was reasonable and apparently necessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The trial court denied the defendant's requested jury charge, and charged the jury as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    A homicide is justifiable if committed in self-defense by one who reasonably believes that he is in eminent danger of losing his life or receiving great bodily harm, and that the killing is necessary to save himself from that danger.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    The danger need not have been real as long as the defendant reasonably believed that he was in actual danger.

R.S. 14:20 C and D, it is clear that the requested jury instruction is not the proper interpretation of the law. Defendant's proposed instruction suggests that there is no instance in which a defendant may not use deadly force, which does not follow La. R.S. 14:20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The transcript of the jury charges shows that the district court initially charged the jury that \"\n   <em>\n    a person who is not engaged in any unlawful activity, and is in a place where he has the right to be, has no duty to retreat before using deadly force to save himself from the danger of losing his life or receiving great bodily harm. He may stand his ground and meet force with force.\"\n   </em>\n   In fact, the court so advised the jury two more times during its jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Moreover, there is no evidence of juror confusion in the record. During deliberations, the jury sent questions to the trial judge regarding the definitions of heat of blood; provocation; cooling-off period; justifiable homicide; second-degree murder; and responsive verdicts, but the jury did not ask for any clarification regarding the duty to retreat. The court's jury instructions adhere to the law and this assignment of error has no merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error Number 6\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In his sixth and last assignment of error, defendant fails to cite any legal authority (other than\n   <em>\n    Brady v.

Defendant contends that the State knew that testimony from some of the listed witnesses would have been more favorable to the defendant, but he gives no specific examples or which witnesses would have been favorable to his case or further explains how he was prejudiced. Accordingly, without any specific facts or law upon which to evaluate Defendant's sixth assignment of error, we find this assignment of error has no merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the defendant's conviction is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
