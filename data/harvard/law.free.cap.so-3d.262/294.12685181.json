It is also undisputed that, as a result of Mr. Wells' failure to make payments as required in the Child Support Case, the Jefferson Parish Juvenile Court entered a contempt judgment on July 21, 2015, making executory arrearages in the amount of $25,308.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 25, 2017, the State filed a bill of information charging Mr. Wells with one count of failure to pay a child support obligation in excess of $15,000, a felony violation of La. R.S. 14:75(C)(5) (the \"Orleans Parish Prosecution\"). The bill of information alleges that, between July 21, 2015 and August 25, 2017, Mr. Wells failed to pay child support in the amount of $25,000 or more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before arraignment, Mr. Wells filed a motion to quash\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Orleans Parish Prosecution; and the State filed an opposition. On October 3, 2017, Mr. Wells failed to appear for arraignment; and the State and defense counsel requested that the arraignment be reset. Instead, the district court addressed the motion to quash. After argument, the district court granted the motion. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

In granting the motion, however, the district court relied on a third ground not asserted in the motion-jurisdiction. In its sole assignment of error, the State contends that the district court erred in granting the motion to quash for lack of jurisdiction because the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court has jurisdiction over this prosecution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As one commentator has observed, in criminal cases, \"[t]he concept of jurisdiction encompasses several different types of limitation upon judicial authority.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   WAYNE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   R. LAFAVE,\n   <em>\n    ET AL.\n   </em>\n   , 4 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE (\" LAFAVE \"), \u00a7 16.1(a) (4th ed. 2003). Only two of those limitations- subject matter jurisdiction and venue-are at issue in this case. Because the district court did not specify on which limitation it based its decision,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   we address both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Subject matter jurisdiction is the authority of a court to hear and adjudicate certain types of cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Louisiana, subject matter jurisdiction over felony prosecutions is conferred exclusively on district courts. La. Const., Art. V, \u00a7 16 (providing that district courts \"shall have original jurisdiction of ... criminal matters [and] ... exclusive original jurisdiction of felony cases\"). Notwithstanding this jurisdictional grant, the Louisiana Constitution authorizes the Legislature to confer subject matter jurisdiction on juvenile and family courts by statute. La. Const., Art. V, \u00a7 18. (providing that, \"[n]otwithstanding any contrary provision of [ La. Const., Art. V, \u00a7 16 ], juvenile and family courts shall have jurisdiction as provided by law\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mr. Wells contends that the Legislature has, by statute, conferred on juvenile courts exclusive original jurisdiction-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , subject matter jurisdiction-over prosecutions under La. R.S. 14:75. In support, Mr. Wells cites La. R.S. 13:1599(A)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 14:92.1(A)(4)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   -both of which confer on juvenile courts exclusive original jurisdiction over prosecutions under La. R.S. 14:92.1, which defines the crime of encouraging or contributing to child delinquency, dependency, or neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Wells concedes that he is not charged with violating La. R.S. 14:92.1. He, nonetheless, contends that the grants of exclusive original jurisdiction in La. R.S. 13:1599(A) and 14:92.1(A)(4) extend to prosecutions for violations of La. R.S. 14:75 because the crime defined in La. R.S. 14:92.1\"includes descriptions of the actions that constitute the offense\" defined in La. R.S. 14:75. Stated another way, Mr. Wells contends that any time a parent fails to pay child support, the parent necessarily contributes to the dependency and neglect of the child; and, thus, under\n   La. R.S. 13:1599(A) and 14:92.1(A)(4), the two crimes are both subject to the exclusive original jurisdiction of the juvenile courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Examination of the statutory language belies Mr. Wells' argument. Contrary to Mr. Wells' contention, the language of La. R.S. 14:92.1 does not expressly refer to the actions that constitute the crime of failure to pay a child support obligation, as defined by La. R.S. 14:75.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor is the failure to pay a child support obligation a necessary or a sufficient condition to impose criminal liability for encouraging or contributing to child delinquency, dependency, or neglect. In short, they are distinct crimes; and, thus, Mr. Wells' argument would require a liberal construction of the jurisdictional grants of La. R.S. 13:1599(A) and 14:92.1(A)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It is, however, well settled that, \"the general rule is that district courts are vested with original jurisdiction and exceptions to this general rule are to be narrowly construed.\"\n   <em>\n    Gunderson v. F.A. Richard &amp; Assocs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 07-331, p. 4 (La. App. 3 Cir. 2/27/08),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8400190\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/977/1128/\">\n    977 So.2d 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1133 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeMarco v.

Thus, the jurisdictional grants in La. R.S. 13:1599(A) and 14:92.1(A)(4) cannot be liberally construed to extend beyond their plain language to confer on juvenile courts subject matter jurisdiction over prosecutions for failure to pay child support under La. R.S. 14:75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To summarize, Mr. Wells is charged with a felony grade of failure to pay a child support obligation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, subject matter jurisdiction over this case is vested exclusively in the district courts. Mr. Wells has pointed to no constitutional or statutory provision purporting to create an exception that would confer subject matter jurisdiction on the juvenile courts. Accordingly, to the extent the district court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this case, the district court erred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gandy v. Key Realty, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   , 13-712, p. 2 (La.

Although Mr.\n   Wells presented this argument as an exception of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   , it is well settled that the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   does not exist at criminal law; instead, it is a distinctly civil law concept.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because the district court granted the motion to quash without holding an evidentiary hearing, we find the judgment granting the motion to quash was premature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, we vacate the judgment and remand for an evidentiary hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is vacated; and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    VACATED AND REMANDED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   LOMBARD, J., DISSENTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   LOMBARD, J., DISSENTS,\n   The defendant's child support obligation arises out of a consent judgment entered in a child support proceeding in Jefferson Parish.

Based on this, the district court found that jurisdiction was proper in Jefferson Parish and quashed the bill of information filed by the Orleans Parish District Attorney.

R.S. 14:75 requires a sentencing court to order restitution in an amount equal to the total unpaid support obligation as it exists at the time of sentencing and permits a sentencing court to suspend all or any portion of the imposition or execution of the sentence otherwise required when restitution is made prior to the time of sentencing, these provisions do not render the Orleans Parish Prosecution a civil enforcement action. Instead, it is axiomatic that \"[a] criminal prosecution is brought in the name of the state in a court of criminal jurisdiction, for the purpose of bringing to punishment one who has violated a criminal law,\" and that \"[t]he person injured by the commission of an offense is not a party to the criminal prosecution, and his rights are not affected thereby.\" La.
