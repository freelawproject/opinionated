The murder was made capital because it was committed during a rape,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(3), Ala.Code 1975, and because the victim was under the age of 14,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(15), Ala.Code 1975. Scott was also convicted, for events involving a different victim, of first-degree rape, attempted murder, and first-degree burglary. After a sentencing hearing, the jury recommended, by a vote of 10-2, that Scott be sentenced to death for his capital-murder convictions. The trial court accepted the jury's recommendation and sentenced Scott to death for his capital-murder convictions. The trial court also sentenced Scott to consecutive terms of life imprisonment for each of the noncapital convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On direct appeal, this Court remanded the case for the trial court to correct a deficiency in the capital-sentencing order. On May 27, 2005, this Court affirmed Scott's capital-murder convictions and death sentence on return to remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

On September 16, 2005, this Court overruled Scott's application for rehearing. Scott petitioned the Alabama Supreme Court for certiorari review, and on February 17, 2006, the Alabama Supreme Court denied Scott's petition for the writ of certiorari. Thereafter, Scott petitioned the United States Supreme Court for certiorari review. On October 2, 2006, the United States Supreme Court denied Scott's petition for the writ of certiorari.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

On May 11, 2007, Scott filed a motion seeking discovery of a number of documents, including records pertaining to himself, the victims, and assorted family members of the victims'; records pertaining to assorted physical evidence; and documents pertaining to the investigation of the offenses. On May 29, 2007, the State filed an answer to Scott's petition, challenging the claims\n   in Scott's petition on preclusionary, pleading, and evidentiary grounds. On July 20, 2007, the State and Scott filed a joint status update requesting that the circuit court advise the parties if the court wanted either party to provide any additional information; the pleading further indicated that the State anticipated filing a motion to dismiss the petition \"later this year\" and that Scott would respond to the motion to dismiss \"soon thereafter.\" (C. 396.) On July 30, 2007, the circuit court issued a written order summarily denying Scott's petition on preclusionary, pleading, and evidentiary grounds. On August 10, 2007, Scott filed a motion to reconsider the summary denial of his petition and a motion objecting to the circuit court's essentially adopting the State's answer as its order denying the petition. On September 5, 2007, the circuit court denied Scott's motion to reconsider. Scott filed a timely notice of appeal on September 5, 2007, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Scott reargues most of the claims from his petition and challenges the propriety of the circuit court's summary denial on various procedural grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Scott first argues that the circuit court erred in summarily denying his Rule 32 petition without granting, or even considering granting Scott leave to amend the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Rhone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975131\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/900/455/\">\n    900 So.2d 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.2004), the Alabama Supreme Court held that \" '[a]mendments to pleadings\n   <em>\n    may be permitted\n   </em>\n   at any stage of the proceedings\n   <em>\n    prior to the entry of judgment.\n   </em>\n   ' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975131\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/900/455/\">\n    900 So.2d at 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting Rule 32.7(b), Ala.R.Crim.P.(first emphasis original; second emphasis added). However, nothing in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Rhone\n   </em>\n   , its progeny, or the cases cited therein, imposes any duty on the circuit court to grant leave to amend a petition\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the entry of a judgment on the petition. Here, Scott did not request leave to amend the petition until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the circuit court had entered its order summarily denying the petition. Thus, the circuit court's summary denial of the petition in this case does not conflict with the holding in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Rhone\n   </em>\n   or the other legal authority cited in Scott's brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Scott also opines that his amendment was filed after the judgment was entered because he logically waited to amend his petition until he received the discovery he requested. Scott challenges the circuit court's statement in its order denying his motion to reconsider the denial of his petition that \"Scott was not entitled to any discovery.\" (C. 467.) Scott cites\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Land\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11084421\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/775/847/\">\n    775 So.2d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.2000), for the proposition that \"[t]he right to seek discovery is not debatable.\" (Scott's brief at p. 14.) Although Scott is correct that a petitioner may\n   <em>\n    seek\n   </em>\n   discovery in postconviction proceedings, there is no absolute right to discovery. Rather, as the Alabama Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Land\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"We emphasize that this holding-that postconviction discovery motions\n   are to be judged by a good-cause standard-does not automatically allow discovery under Rule 32, Ala.R.Crim.P., and that it does not expand the discovery procedures within Rule 32.4.

By adopting this standard, we are only recognizing that a trial court, upon a petitioner's showing of good cause, may exercise its inherent authority to order discovery in a proceeding for postconviction relief. In addition, we caution that postconviction discovery does not provide a petitioner with a right to 'fish' through official files and that it 'is not a device for investigating possible claims, but a means of vindicating actual claims.'\n   <em>\n    People v.

Thus, for the reasons discussed more fully in Part III of this opinion, because Scott's claims were precluded, insufficiently pleaded or facially without merit, we do not find error in the timing of the circuit court's summary denial of the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Scott next challenges the circuit court's adoption of the State's answer as its order summarily denying his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The wholesale adoption of orders proposed by the prevailing party is reviewed on a case-by-case basis and has been repeatedly upheld unless the findings and conclusions set out in the order are clearly erroneous.

He asserts that this claim was adequately pleaded and that it raised principles of substantive due process immune to the procedural bars in Rule 32.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In his petition, Scott alleged that, based on his conduct in court in August 2001, he was evaluated to determine whether he was competent to stand trial.

Scott then set out assorted acts and comments he made at trial in August 2002 that he contends establish that he was not competent to stand trial. Thus, Scott concluded, the trial court erred in not sua sponte holding a hearing during the trial to determine whether Scott was competent to stand trial.

Further, it appears from Scott's pleadings that the trial court conducted a full and thorough investigation into Scott's competency following his behavior in August 2001, had Scott evaluated, and held a hearing before concluding that Scott was competent to stand trial. Thus, as there is nothing\n   <em>\n    in the petition\n   </em>\n   suggesting any new developments to call into question the earlier finding of competency, Scott failed to set out in his petition sufficiently and with specificity facts to satisfy his heavy burden of pleading.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hyde v.

An assessment of the likelihood of a result more favorable to the defendant must exclude the possibility of arbitrariness, whimsy, caprice, 'nullification,' and the like. A defendant has no entitlement to the luck of a lawless decisionmaker, even if a lawless decision cannot be reviewed. The assessment of prejudice should proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision. It should not depend on the idiosyncracies of the particular decisionmaker, such as unusual propensities toward harshness or leniency. Although these factors may actually have entered into counsel's selection of strategies and, to that limited extent, may thus affect the performance inquiry, they are irrelevant to the prejudice inquiry. Thus, evidence about the actual process of decision, if not part of the record of the proceeding under review, and evidence about, for example, a particular judge's sentencing practices, should not be considered in the prejudice determination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \"The governing legal standard plays a critical role in defining the question to be asked in assessing the prejudice from counsel's errors. When a defendant challenges a conviction, the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt. When a defendant challenges a death sentence such as the one at issue in this case, the question is whether there is a reasonable probability\n   that, absent the errors, the sentencer-including an appellate court, to the extent it independently reweighs the evidence-would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \"In making this determination, a court hearing an ineffectiveness claim must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.

Some errors will have had a pervasive effect on the inferences to be drawn from the evidence, altering the entire evidentiary picture, and some will have had an isolated, trivial effect. Moreover, a verdict or conclusion only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have been affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support.\n   <em>\n    Taking the unaffected findings as a given, and taking due account of the effect of the errors on the remaining findings, a court making the prejudice inquiry must ask if the defendant has met the burden of showing that the decision reached would reasonably likely have been different absent the errors.\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p690\">\n    466 U.S. at 694-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   After carefully reviewing the applicable legal authority, the petition, and the circuit court's order denying the petition, we conclude that although the circuit court's order does deviate somewhat from the standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , the circuit court's ultimate resolution of the claims was proper for the reasons discussed in more detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Scott further argues that the circuit court erred in considering his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims individually, without also considering the cumulative effect of the alleged errors.

(Pet. at para. 140) And at the hearing, Dr. Nagi testified that Scott had 'personality disorder' and 'was under the influence' of drugs, but that his symptoms were not a recognized mental illness, much less one that would prevent a finding of competency. (R. 64-69) Much of the claim is an attack on the correctness of Dr. Nagi's conclusions based on evidence elicited at the hearing.

The circuit court's conclusion is correct. Scott asserted in his petition that counsel should have argued the cross-admissibility test for joinder and that he would be substantially prejudiced by the joinder; however, those underlying factors were considered and addressed in this Court's opinion on direct appeal.

Scott's assertions are directed toward the alleged inconsistencies in the rape victim's testimony that her rapist forced her to bath in vinegar and poured \"glitter lotion\" in her vagina, yet no physical evidence of either substance was discovered. Scott asserts that the victim should have been further questioned about her claim that the glitter was poured in her vagina after the alleged vinegar bath to rebut testimony that the vinegar would have washed away physical evidence; that witnesses were not asked whether they smelled either substance at the scene or tested the bed sheet or items in the bathroom for those substances; that a detective was not called to affirm his statements to Scott during Scott's interrogation that vinegar would not wash away evidence of rape; and that the State's DNA expert was not confronted with the detective's comment which Scott said impeached the expert's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In its order summarily denying the petition, the circuit court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   \"Though Scott faults counsel for not challenging Wright for her failure to mention the lotion on September 11, the record shows that counsel did ask her about the lotion, and that she specifically testified that she told the detectives about the lotion that day at the hospital. (R. 432.) Detective Clark and DNA expert Roland were both asked about the failure to find the lotion (R. 726-27), but Scott persists that counsel should have somehow 'pursue [d] the matter further' to beleaguer the point that no lotion was found. Similarly, though Scott makes much of the fact that no semen was found even though Scott raped Wright\n   again after the use of the vinegar, the State expert provided alternative explanations as to why no semen was found, including that Scott would likely have produced much less given that he had ejaculated several times in the preceding hours, and that semen is sometimes simply not found. (R. 748-51.) Though the petition faults counsel for not asking Wright how Scott 'might know where to find a bottle of vinegar, let alone be aware of its cleansing potential' (Pet. at para. 125), it is obvious that such questions would have been improper, as they would have called for speculation from the witness. The facts alleged do not demonstrate that trial counsel was constitutionally deficient for not asking the precise formulations of lotion and vinegar questions that Scott proffers, nor that such questions would have changed the result. Quite simply, counsel repeatedly questioned witnesses about the lotion and vinegar, but those questions did not sufficiently undermine Wright's testimony and the other evidence that a rape occurred.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   (C. 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   There is always something more that \"could\" have been done by counsel at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lawhorn v.

However, as the circuit court found in its order denying the petition, and Scott even conceded in his petition, the juror indicated that she did not personally know the victim's father and had only met him in the community. Scott does not allege that the juror was impartial, and, further, the circuit court found in its order denying the petition that a challenge for cause as to this prospective juror on this ground would have been denied.

Specifically, Scott avers that if he waived his right to communicate with counsel as to the underlying substantive claim, then trial counsel was ineffective for allowing that waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The circuit court denied this claim as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   \"This claim is meritless. The Court allowed Scott to consult with his family about his decision to defend against the charges (either by testifying himself, presenting other witnesses, or both). It is apparent from the record that family members consulted in accordance with trial counsel's wishes, in an attempt to convince Scott not to testify. Trial counsel first raised the idea of Scott talking to his family, informing the Court that his family also opposed the idea of calling the defense witnesses, and in particular opposed the idea of Scott taking the stand. (R. 793-94.) Counsel even specifically requested that Scott's aunt be brought in because she had watched most of the trial. (R. 799-800.) When the Court asked that the defendant go to another room to speak with his family away from the lawyers and the Court, trial counsel did not object. (R. 809-10.) These facts do not implicate the Sixth Amendment because Scott had full benefit of consultation with his counsel before making his defense decisions. In addition to the consultations that occurred before the family conference, the court gave trial counsel several more hours to advise his client on which witnesses to call after the family conference but before resuming the hearing. (R. 817.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   \"Scott also fails to establish prejudice. Indeed, the record suggests that Scott's consultation with his family brought his desires more in line with defense counsel's advice; when Scott returned, he announced that he no longer wanted to call several witnesses to testify, including himself. (R. 812-813.)\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   (C. 31-33.) The record on direct appeal supports the circuit court's findings, and we adopt them as part of this opinion. It is clear from the direct-appeal record that Scott's trial counsel and Scott were in disagreement as to whether to call certain witnesses and whether Scott should testify.

Similarly, the petition suggests a psychologist should have testified about sexual abuse by Scott's grandfather (R. 205), but does not identify a psychologist that was available to testify and does not allege what the expert would have told the jury.

The trial court instructed the jury at sentencing on two aggravating circumstances: (1) that Scott had previously been convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to another person, and (2) that the present capital offense was committed during the course of a first-degree rape. The trial court did not instruct the jury on a third aggravating circumstance: that the offense was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel as compared to other capital offenses. In its sentencing order, however, the trial court considered and found the existence of that third aggravating circumstance even though it had not been presented to the jury. Scott contends that counsel should have objected to the trial court's inclusion of this aggravating circumstance in its sentencing order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Waldrop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9058437\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/859/1181/\">\n    859 So.2d 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.2002), the Alabama Supreme Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   \"Waldrop claims that the trial court's determination that the murders were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel as compared to other capital offenses-an aggravating circumstance under Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 13A-5-49(8) -is a factual determination that under\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   must be made by the jury.

Alabama law requires the existence of only one aggravating circumstance in order for a defendant to be sentenced to death. Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 13A-5-45(f). The jury in this case found the existence of that one aggravating circumstance: that the murders were committed while Waldrop was engaged in the commission of a robbery. At that point, Waldrop became 'exposed' to, or eligible for, the death penalty. The trial court's subsequent determination that the murders were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel is a factor that has application only in weighing the mitigating circumstances and the aggravating circumstances, a process that we held earlier is not an 'element' of the offense.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9058437\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/859/1181/\">\n    859 So.2d at 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, nothing in the circuit court's order here indicates that its order relied upon the language in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   that was rejected in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Taylor\n   </em>\n   , i.e., that a finding of no plain error on direct appeal automatically precludes the possibility of any finding of prejudice under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . Second, this Court has affirmed the denial of Rule 32 petitions when the circuit court erroneously relied on\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bush v.

Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Bush\n   </em>\n   , the petition was not pleaded sufficiently or with specificity to meet Scott's burden of pleading facts to indicate that counsel was ineffective for not raising this claim on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rules 32.3 and 32.6(b), Ala.R.Crim.P.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Finally, Scott claims that summary denial of his claim that death by lethal injection, as applied in Alabama, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. He argues that the circuit court improperly found the claim to be subject to the procedural bars in Rule 32.2(a)(3) and (5), and insufficiently pleaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   The circuit court found this claim to be procedurally barred by Rule 32.2(a)(3), to the extent that it raised the same claim addressed by this Court's plain-error review on direct appeal; the circuit court further found the claim barred by Rule 32.2(a)(5), to the extent that the petition expanded the allegation to challenge lethal injection as applied by Alabama. With regard to Scott's claim that the application of Rules 32.2(a)(3) and (5) was improper, we note that he did not present any facts in his petition explaining why the present Rule 32 petition was the proper vehicle in which to raise this claim, nor did he present any argument in his motion to reconsider the denial of his petition that the application of the procedural bars was improper. Thus, the additional facts he now provides on appeal are not properly before this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bearden v.

Scott did not allege in his petition that the lethal-injection procedure in Alabama, if properly performed, subjects a death-row inmate to an unacceptable or unconscionable level of pain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McNabb v.

Nor did Scott present any individualized allegations that lethal injection would be cruel and unusual punishment if performed on him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sharifi v.
