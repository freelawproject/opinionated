Martin McCubbins bought a round trip ticket from Jackson to Panama City,\n   Panama on United Airlines (United). McCubbins alleges that on February 6, 2013, before he departed Jackson and again during a layover in Houston, United employees examined his passport and ticket and assured him that everything was in order. Nonetheless, when McCubbins arrived in Panama, he was detained and informed that he would not be allowed to enter the country because his passport's expiration date was less than 90 days from the date of his travel. McCubbins was forced to spend an unpleasant night in a Panamanian holding pen before he was allowed to return to the United States the next morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. After returning home, McCubbins contacted customer service representatives at United, but United told him that he was responsible for verifying the requirements for international travel and entry into a foreign country. United did give McCubbins a coupon for ten percent off his next ticket to fly the friendly skies. Dissatisfied with blame and a coupon, McCubbins filed suit against United in Hinds County Circuit Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. McCubbins served a summons and the complaint on United's registered agent for service of process in Mississippi, CT Corporation (CT). Unfortunately, the complaint named the defendant as \"United Airlines Corporation,\" an Illinois corporation \"with a principal place of business located at 1200 East Algonquin Road, Elk Grove Township, IL.\" This information was out of date or just incorrect. In point of fact, United is \"United Airlines, Inc.,\" a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 233 South Wacker Drive in Chicago. Because the summons and complaint misnamed United, CT did not forward the documents to United, United did not answer, and McCubbins ultimately obtained a default judgment against \"United Airlines Corporation\" for $70,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. United first learned of the judgment when McCubbins's attorney mailed a letter demanding payment to United's CEO at United's headquarters on South Wacker Drive in Chicago. United subsequently moved to set aside the default judgment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   arguing that the judgment (1) was void for lack of proper service of process or, in the alternative, (2) should be set aside under the three-part \"balancing test\" applicable to a motion to set aside a default judgment under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tucker v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6773109\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/198/299/#p309\">\n    198 So.3d 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 309 (\u00b6 23) (Miss. 2016). The circuit\n   court denied United's motion as \"not well taken.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5. On appeal, United makes the same two arguments as in the circuit court. We hold that service of process on United's registered agent was sufficient. However, we agree with United that the default judgment must be set aside under the three-part balancing test. Therefore, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Additional facts are discussed below as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. SERVICE OF PROCESS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. United's first argument on appeal is that service of process was improper and ineffective because the summons and complaint named \"United Airlines Corporation,\" not United Airlines, Inc., and misidentified United's state of incorporation and address. \"In the absence of proper service of process, the court lacks jurisdiction, so any default judgment that it enters is void.\"\n   <em>\n    S &amp; M Trucking LLC v. Rogers Oil Co. of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789592\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/195/217/#p221\">\n    195 So.3d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 221 (\u00b6 16) (Miss. Ct. App. 2016). \"If a default judgment is void, the trial court has no discretion and must set the judgment aside.\"\n   <em>\n    McCain v.

Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6897158\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/90/#p95\">\n    150 So.3d 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95 (\u00b6 6) (Miss. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. McCubbins filed his complaint alleging negligence and breach of contract in circuit court on January 16, 2015. As noted above, the complaint misidentified United as \"United Airlines Corporation,\" an Illinois corporation with a principal place of business in the Chicago suburb of Elk Grove Township. In fact, United is \"United Airlines, Inc.,\" a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in downtown Chicago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. McCubbins did, however, serve a summons and the complaint on United's registered agent for service of process in Mississippi, CT. The summons and complaint were served personally on Matthew Thiebodeaux, an employee of CT, on February 12, 2015, by Melissa Rand, an employee of McCubbins's attorney, Wayne Ferrell. Rand and Thiebodeaux knew one another by name because she regularly served process on CT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. In addition, Exhibit A attached to the complaint served on CT is the eTicket itinerary and receipt issued by United to McCubbins. Notably, the ticket was sent to McCubbins from \"United Airlines, Inc.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10. United failed to answer the complaint, so McCubbins applied for and obtained an entry of default. McCubbins then filed a motion for a determination of damages and entry of final judgment. On November 25, 2015, the circuit court entered judgment in favor of McCubbins and against \"United Airlines Corporation\" for $70,000, including actual damages of $50,000 and punitive damages of $20,000. On January 8, 2016, Ferrell mailed United's CEO a letter-at United's correct, downtown Chicago address-demanding payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11. We pause our discussion of the case's procedural history here to discuss other evidence related to McCubbins's service of process on United's registered agent, CT. An affidavit from a CT employee states that CT's records show that CT sent Ferrell a letter by regular mail on February 13, 2015-i.e., the day after McCubbins served CT. The letter advised as follows: \"United Airlines Corporation was not listed on our records or on the records of the State of MS. CT was unable to forward.\" An affidavit from an employee in United's legal department confirms that\n   United did not receive notice of the lawsuit, from CT or otherwise, until Ferrell's January 2016 letter to United's CEO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12. The record copy of the February 13, 2015 letter from CT to Ferrell is not signed; however, CT states that such letters are sent out automatically and are not signed. Ferrell denied under oath that he ever received the letter. In addition, the letter purports to show that CT mistakenly sent a copy of the letter to the Hinds County\n   <em>\n    Chancery\n   </em>\n   Court; however, the chancery clerk provided an affidavit stating that the court has no record of receiving such a letter. Nor is there any evidence that the circuit court ever received such a letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13. In opposition to United's motion to set aside the default judgment, McCubbins also submitted copies of CT's policies and procedures for handling \"name discrepancies\" in documents served on CT. McCubbins obtained these documents from CT by subpoena. These documents suggest that if CT had followed its own policies and procedures, it would have identified United as the likely defendant and forwarded the complaint and the summons to United.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14. In the circuit court, United also submitted a number of its filings with the Mississippi Secretary of State, which show its correct corporate name and state of incorporation and the current address of its principal place of business. On appeal, United argues that \"[t]his Court may take judicial notice of [such] records.\" We agree. We also note that annual reports that United filed with the Secretary of State as recently as 2008 showed that 1200 East Algonquin Road in Elk Grove Township\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   United's principal place of business. United apparently moved its headquarters to downtown Chicago around that time. Thus, the address referenced in McCubbins's complaint was out of date, but it was not pulled out of thin air.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 15. Our Supreme Court has addressed the concept of a \"misnomer\" in several prior opinions. In\n   <em>\n    Campbell &amp; Campbell v. Pickens Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"764784\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/134/559/#p565\">\n    134 Miss. 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 565,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"764784\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/134/559/#p565\">\n    99 So. 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 378-79 (1924), a writ of garnishment and summons directed to the \"Bank of Pickens\" were served on the cashier for the \"Pickens Bank.\" The \"Bank of Pickens\" had been defunct for several years.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"764784\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/134/559/#p565\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"764784\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/134/559/#p565\">\n    at 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"764784\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/134/559/#p565\">\n    99 So. at 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Supreme Court later distinguished\n   <em>\n    Pickens Bank\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Delta Cotton Oil Co. v. Planters' Oil Mill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1681481\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/142/591/\">\n    142 Miss. 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20So.%20764\">\n    107 So. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1926). In\n   <em>\n    Delta Cotton Oil\n   </em>\n   , the summons was served on a man who served as an agent for two entities with similar names, and the summons failed to correctly and precisely name either entity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 596-97,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20So.%20764\">\n    107 So. at 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Supreme Court held that in that situation there was \"such uncertainty as [to] make the rule of misnomer\n   inapplicable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20So.%20764\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court reaffirmed\n   <em>\n    Pickens Bank\n   </em>\n   's holding and \"the doctrine of misnomer\" as \"a wholesome doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20So.%20764\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the Court held that the doctrine \"must be limited to the cases where the identity of the persons sued and against whom judgment is rendered is not doubtful.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20So.%20764\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, in\n   <em>\n    Delta Cotton\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that, on the facts of that case, the judgment was void.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20So.%20764\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 17. In a more recent case, our Supreme Court discussed another \"set of circumstances\" in which the \"doctrine of misnomer\" does not apply.\n   <em>\n    D.P. Holmes Trucking LLC v. Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7005494\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/94/248/#p252\">\n    94 So.3d 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 252 (\u00b6\u00b6 10-11) (Miss. 2012). In\n   <em>\n    D.P. Holmes Trucking\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff \"did not simply misname the defendant\" but rather \"sued a [party] he believed to be responsible\" when, in fact, \"he should have sued a different party.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7005494\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/94/248/#p252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 11). The Court held the plaintiff was trying to substitute one real party for another real party rather than merely correct a misnomer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7005494\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/94/248/#p252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 18. A recent decision of the Georgia Court of Appeals is also helpful and persuasive. In\n   <em>\n    Mathis v. BellSouth Telecommunications Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167726\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/301/881/\">\n    301 Ga.App. 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167726\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/301/881/\">\n    690 S.E.2d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), the plaintiff served Corporation Service Co. (CSC) with a summons directed to \"AT &amp; T Telecommunications.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 212. The intended subject of the complaint, BellSouth d/b/a AT &amp; T of Georgia (BellSouth), appeared and argued that service of process was improper and ineffective because \"there was no such entity as AT &amp; T Telecommunications.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, the Georgia Court of Appeals held that service of process was sufficient and effective because the plaintiff properly served BellSouth's registered agent (CSC), and as BellSouth's registered agent, \"CSC was obligated to recognize the trade names of its clients\n   <em>\n    and also to recognize some misstatements of its clients' names and to accept service, on behalf of its clients, of lawsuits filed under such misnomers\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 214 (emphasis added; quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 19. Based on our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Pickens Bank\n   </em>\n   and the persuasive reasoning of the Georgia Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   , we hold that service of process in this case was sufficient to give the circuit court jurisdiction over United. We recognize that there are some distinctions between this case and\n   <em>\n    Pickens Bank\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   . However, those differences do not change the outcome. This case differs from\n   <em>\n    Pickens Bank\n   </em>\n   in that process was served on the defendant's registered agent, rather than on an employee of the defendant at its principal place of business, as in\n   <em>\n    Pickens Bank\n   </em>\n   . However, the registered agent's basic purpose, especially in the case of an out-of-state corporation doing business in this State, is to stand in the shoes of the corporation for purposes of accepting service of process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2079-35-13\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 79-35-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (Rev. 2013). For this reason, CT has an obligation \"to recognize some misstatements of its clients' names and to accept service, on behalf of its clients, of lawsuits filed under such misnomers.\"\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167726\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/301/881/\">\n    690 S.E.2d at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 20. A commercial registered agent's obligation to know its clients is not limitless, but it applies in this case, when (1) the misnomer was limited to the use of \"Corporation\" rather than \"Inc.,\" (2) the complaint specifically identified the former address of United's principal place of business, (3) there is nothing to suggest that the complaint or summons identified or even suggested that the defendant was some other entity that actually exists, and, perhaps most important, (4) the complaint and Exhibit A to the complaint, McCubbins's United Airlines ticket and receipt, should have dispelled any confusion as to the true identity of the defendant. Under\n   these circumstances, we conclude that service of process was proper and sufficient; therefore, the circuit court had jurisdiction, and judgment is not \"void.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Therefore, they are only discussed below to the limited extent they are relevant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Wesley Health System\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court emphasized the three-part balancing test and appeared to hold that the trial court's failure to apply the test was a per se abuse of discretion and reversible error.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wesley Health Sys.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182287\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/200/440/#p446\">\n     200 So.3d at 446-47\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\u00b6\u00b6 23-26). The same is true in this case. Although both parties briefed and argued the three-part test in the circuit court, the circuit court's ruling did not address any of the relevant factors. We do not reverse on this ground, however, because we conclude that application of the three-part test requires that the default judgment be set aside.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Levy v.
