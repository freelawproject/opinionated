R.Crim. P. Scott's petition challenged his convictions for two counts of capital murder and his resulting sentence of death and his convictions for first-degree rape, attempted murder, and first-degree burglary and his resulting sentences of life imprisonment for each of those convictions. This Court affirmed the circuit court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

Scott then petitioned the Alabama Supreme Court for certiorari review. On March 18, 2011, the Alabama Supreme Court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   \"The trial court's verbatim adoption of the State's answer to Scott's Rule 32 petition as its order, by its nature, violates this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Ingram\n   </em>\n   [,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7046939\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/51/1119/\">\n    51 So.3d 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.2010) ]. Accordingly, we must reverse the Court of Criminal Appeals' judgment insofar as it affirms the trial court's adoption of the State's answer as its order, and we remand the case to the Court of Criminal Appeals with directions to remand the case to the trial court for that court to reverse its order dismissing Scott's Rule 32 petition and to enter a new order in light of this opinion.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12684924\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/262/1266/#p1274\">\n    262 So.3d 1266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1274 (Ala.2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In accordance with the directions of the Alabama Supreme Court, we remand the case to the circuit court.
