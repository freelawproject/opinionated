Accordingly, we reverse the district court's ruling, which excluded the prior crimes from trial, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   WEIMER, J., would deny.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
