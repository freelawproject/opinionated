Plaintiff/Appellant Cassandra Smith alleges that she was entering the Crescent City Connection building in New Orleans, when she tripped over the rug at the entrance and fell. Ms. Smith appeals the trial court's January 12, 2018 judgment granting a Motion for Summary Judgment filed by the State of Louisiana through the Department of Transportation and Development (\"DOTD\"), which dismissed Ms. Smith's suit, with prejudice. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter has a lengthy procedural history. On February 27, 2009, Ms. Smith filed a Petition for Damages against the DOTD, alleging that she tripped and fell on a rug as she was entering the Crescent City Connection building on March 14, 2008. According to Ms. Smith, she sustained serious injuries from the fall, including shoulder and neck injuries. The Petition sought damages for pain and suffering, disability and mental anguish, lost earnings and earning capacity, and medical and related expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 17, 2015, the DOTD filed a Motion for Summary, seeking dismissal of Ms. Smith's suit on the grounds that the DOTD had no actual or constructive knowledge of the allegedly unreasonably dangerous rug, which Ms. Smith asserted was too close to the door, was unusually thick, and had a turned up corner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court rendered a judgment on June 16, 2015 granting the DOTD's Motion for Summary Judgment and dismissing this action, with prejudice. On June 24, 2015, Ms. Smith filed a Motion for Appeal, which the trial court granted on June 25, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 14, 2016, this Court issued a\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   order directing the parties to show cause in writing why the appeal should not be dismissed because the June 16, 2015 judgment did not contain decretal language, and thus was not a final appealable judgment. On January 19, 2016, the DOTD filed an unopposed\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte\n   </em>\n   Motion to Amend Judgment in the trial court. The Amended Judgment, signed by the trial court on January 20, 2016, added the proper decretal language. On that date, the trial court ordered that the record be supplemented with the Amended Judgment. On January 21, 2016, Ms. Smith and\n   the DOTD each filed responses to this Court's order to show cause, and attached the Amended Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 17, 2016, this Court issued an opinion dismissing Ms. Smith's appeal without prejudice on the grounds that the record could not be supplemented with the Amended Judgment because it was an entirely new judgment that must be appealed. This Court remanded the matter, stating that \"[o]nce a final appealable judgment is rendered, a new appeal may be filed with this Court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 12, 2018, the trial court rendered a second judgment granting DOTD's Motion for Summary Judgment, and dismissing the lawsuit, with prejudice. Ms. Smith timely filed a Motion for Appeal on February 8, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Appellate courts review summary judgments under the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review, using the same standard applied by the trial court in deciding the motion for summary judgment; as a result, we are not required to analyze the facts and evidence with deference to the judgment of the trial court or its reasons for judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Orleans Parish Sch.

Ms. Fernandez attested that, as safety coordinator, she maintained a set of log books that documented any accidents that occurred in the Crescent City Connection building. Ms. Fernandez reviewed the log books spanning the period from 1987 to April 2008, and attested that there was only one slip and fall in the building, which did not involve a rug. Ms. Hepting, who is a loss prevention/safety officer, attested to the accuracy of the log books, and corroborated Ms. Fernandez's statements about the single prior slip and fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In opposition to the DOTD's Motion for Summary Judgment, Ms. Smith introduced\n   the following deposition testimony of Lynell Parker, who was a receptionist at the front desk near the entrance to the building. Ms. Parker described her experience with the rug as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q.

R.S. 9:2800 by \"reporting the defect to a governmental employee who has a duty 'either to keep the property involved in good repair or to report dangerous conditions to the proper authorities.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hanson v.

Given that the DOTD's two safety officers, Ms. Fernandez and Ms. Hepting, testified that they never received reports that the rug was a safety hazard, Ms. Smith cannot show that the DOTD had actual notice of the allegedly defective rug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"Constructive notice can be found if the conditions which caused the injury existed for such a period of time that those responsible, by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence, must have known of their existence in general and could have guarded the public from injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Gardner v.

Ms. Parker's testimony establishes that, in the one-month period prior to Ms. Smith's slip and fall, the rug at the entrance to the DOTD building had a tendency to bend or \"pucker,\" and that Ms. Parker would sometimes have to straighten or flatten the rug. With\n   Ms. Parker's testimony, we find that Ms. Smith has presented factual support sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact on the element of notice. We find that reasonable persons could reach differing conclusions as to whether the DOTD had constructive notice of the defective rug,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether it existed for such a period of time that, by the exercise of reasonable care, the DOTD should have known of its existence.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

This testimony relates to the causation element of La. R.S. 9:2800, not the notice element, which was the sole basis for the DOTD's Motion for Summary Judgment. Under La. C.C.P. art. 966(F), \"[a] summary judgment may be rendered or affirmed only as to those issues set forth in the motion under consideration by the court at that time.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
