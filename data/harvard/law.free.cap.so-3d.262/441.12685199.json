R.S. 14:27 and 40:966(C) and possession of oxycodone in violation of La. R.S. 40:967(C) -both arising from defendant's guilty pleas.

We further affirm defendant's convictions but vacate his sentences due to an error patent and remand the matter to the trial court for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 24, 2016, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney filed a bill of information charging defendant with one count of possession of heroin in violation of La. R.S. 40:966(C) and one count of possession of oxycodone in violation of La. R.S. 40:967(C). Defendant was arraigned and pled not guilty. On January 19, 2017, defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence, contending that the officers who seized the evidence at issue during a traffic stop did not have reasonable suspicion or probable cause to search his vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 16, 2017, the trial court conducted a hearing on defendant's motion to suppress evidence. The trial judge took the matter under advisement and, on May 9, 2017, issued a judgment denying defendant's motion to suppress. On July 26, 2017, this Court considered and denied defendant's writ application seeking review of the denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v. Nellon\n   </em>\n   , 17-K-336 (La. App. 5 Cir. 7/26/17) (unpublished writ decision). On November 13, 2017, the Louisiana Supreme Court declined to consider defendant's writ application as it was untimely filed.\n   <em>\n    State v. Nellon\n   </em>\n   , 17-1482 (La. 11/13/17),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12380780,12380809,12380801,12380772\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/229/478/\">\n    229 So.3d 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 26, 2018, the state amended count one of the bill of information to reflect the amended charge of attempted possession of heroin in violation of La. R.S. 14:27 and 40:966. On the same date, defendant withdrew his not guilty pleas and pled guilty to the amended bill of information. After a colloquy with defendant and the acceptance of his pleas, the trial court sentenced defendant in accordance with the plea agreement to two years at hard labor on each count with the sentences \"to run concurrently with each other, and concurrent with any other sentence.\" This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, defendant does not challenge the validity of his guilty pleas, nor does he challenge the sentences imposed for his attempted possession of heroin and possession of oxycodone convictions. In his sole assignment of error on appeal, defendant seeks review of a prior ruling denying his motion to suppress the evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Generally, when a defendant pleads guilty, he waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings leading up to the guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   , 18-197 (La. App. 5 Cir. 11/07/18),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12683577\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/259/593/\">\n    259 So.3d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205813263\">\n    2018 WL 5813263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2018 La. App. LEXIS 2184. An unqualified guilty plea precludes review of such defects either by appeal or post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    State v. Turner\n   </em>\n   , 09-1079 (La. App. 5 Cir. 7/27/10),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038467\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/455/#p459\">\n    47 So.3d 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 459. However, a defendant may preserve for appellate review a prior adverse ruling if, at the time he enters his guilty plea, he expressly reserves his right to appellate review of a specific ruling.\n   <em>\n    State v. Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9676631\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/584/\">\n    338 So.2d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 588 (La. 1976) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

The record reflects that during the guilty plea proceedings, defendant did not preserve any rulings for appeal under the holding in\n   <em>\n    State v. Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . This Court has consistently held that a defendant's failure to reserve the right to appeal under\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   precludes appellate review of a prior denial of a motion to suppress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 5th Cir. 1990). Our review reflects the following error patent:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The record reflects an inconsistency between the transcript and the uniform commitment order (UCO) that renders defendant's sentences indeterminate. The transcript reflects that the trial judge ordered defendant's two sentences to run \"concurrent with any other sentence.\" The UCO, however, more specifically states that the sentences \"shall be concurrent with any or every sentence the offender is now serving\" and additionally reflects that the sentences are to be served concurrent with \"any other sentence the Defendant may be serving [in] Jefferson, 24th JDC.\" When there is a discrepancy between the minute entry or commitment and the transcript, the transcript prevails.\n   <em>\n    State v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7638942\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/441/732/#p734\">\n    441 So.2d 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 734 (La. 1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   La. C.Cr.P. art. 879 provides that \"[i]f a defendant who has been convicted of an offense is sentenced to imprisonment, the court shall impose a determinate sentence.\" We find defendant's sentences to be indeterminate because the trial judge in sentencing defendant, did not specify whether the sentences were ordered to run concurrently with specific sentences imposed or with any other sentences imposed that defendant may have been serving at the time of his sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, we vacate defendant's sentences and remand this matter to the trial court to clarify defendant's sentences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, defendant did not object to the trial court's failure to hear these outstanding motions before pleading guilty.

We note that there was no testimony regarding the exact length of time for the stop. Based on our review of the writ application and the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying relator's motion to suppress.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    We further note, that in the event of a conviction after trial, relator has an adequate remedy on appeal.
