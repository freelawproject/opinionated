Belsome\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The defendant, Michael Baugh, was charged by bill of information with one count of battery of a police officer with injury that requires medical attention, in violation of La. R.S. 14:34.2(B)(3), and one\n   count of first offense possession of marijuana, in violation of La. R.S. 40:966(E)(1). The matter proceeded to jury trial for the battery charge in July of 2017. The bench trial for Defendant's marijuana charge ran concurrently with the jury trial. On July 12, 2017, the jury returned with the responsive verdict of simple assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for post-verdict judgment of acquittal and motion for new trial. On December 1, 2017, the trial court granted the defendant's motion for post-verdict judgment of acquittal, finding that the evidence adduced at trial was not sufficient to support the verdict of simple assault and vacated the verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Discussion\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this case, the defendant was charged with battery of a police officer with injury that requires medical attention, and the jury returned a verdict of simple assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Returning a verdict of a lesser crime is well within the jury's authority if that lesser crime is deemed a responsive verdict.

C.Cr.P. art. 920(2) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In accordance with the jurisprudence, this Court must determine if simple assault was a responsive verdict to battery of a police officer with injury that requires medical attention. La. C.Cr.P. art. 814 provides the particular responsive verdicts for charged offenses. The offense charged in this case does not appear in the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, this Court applies the precepts of La. C.Cr.P. art. 815.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   La. C.Cr.P. art. 815 requires that simple assault be a lesser and included offense of battery of a police officer with\n   injury before a verdict of guilty of the former can be responsive to a charge of the latter. Lesser and included offenses are those in which all of the essential elements of the lesser offense are also essential elements of the greater offense charged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Battery \"is a crime of general intent, meaning that the State need only prove the offender must have adverted to the prescribed criminal consequences as reasonably certain to result from his act or failure to act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, an attempted battery, one of the definitions of assault, requires specific intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   That being the case, the lesser offense of assault possesses an element (specific intent) that the greater offense (battery of a police officer) does not. The other way to commit an assault also contains an element (the intentional placing of another in reasonable apprehension of receiving a battery) that the underlying crime of battery does not. Considering those factors, assault would not constitute a valid responsive verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Further, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the Louisiana Supreme Court considered the possible responsive verdicts to a similar crime, battery of a police officer while the offender is the custody of a correctional facility\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and found that valid verdicts in prosecution were:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) Guilty as charged (battery on a police officer when the offender is in the custody of a correctional facility) (felony grade);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) Guilty of battery on a police officer (misdemeanor grade);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (3) Guilty of simple battery (misdemeanor)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (4) Not guilty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   Court did not include simple assault as a responsive verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This Court finds that the verdict returned by the jury was nonresponsive to the charged offense. As such, the verdict amounted to an acquittal of the crime charged. Although this Court's reasons differ from that of the trial court, the trial court's post-verdict judgment of acquittal is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   LOBRANO, J., DISSENTS AND ASSIGNS REASONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   LOBRANO, J., DISSENTS AND ASSIGNS REASONS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I respectively dissent from the majority opinion for two reasons. First, I find that the district court erred when it granted the motion for post-verdict judgment of acquittal filed by the defendant, Michael Baugh (\"Defendant\"). I would reverse the district court and reinstate the jury's verdict of simple assault. Second, I find that simple assault is a lesser and included offense of a felony battery on a police officer and that the majority erred by concluding otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 18, 2015, at approximately 11:30 p.m., Louisiana State Troopers Eric Thaxton and Charles Robertson were responding to a dispatch from the New Orleans Police Department (\"NOPD\"). The\n   dispatch alerted them to be on the lookout on Canal Street toward the river for a \"black pickup truck, partial license plate number B690 playing loud music and waving a 95G [handgun] out the vehicle window\" with one of the occupants wearing a black t-shirt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The troopers approached Defendant's dark grey pickup truck that was parked on South Rampart Street. The truck had darkly tinted windows and no visible license plate. A strong smell of marijuana was coming from the truck. Defendant was the sole occupant and was wearing a black t-shirt; the license plate number was C099909. After being ordered out of his truck, an altercation occurred, leaving Robertson on the ground with a fractured tibial plateau, the upper end of the shinbone, and Defendant being tased. Both required medical attention. A search of Defendant's truck found a small bottle containing about 6 grams of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant was charged by bill of information with one count of a felony battery of a police officer with injury that required medical attention and one count of first offense possession of marijuana, violations of La. R.S. 14:34.2 (B)(3)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and La. R.S. 40:966 (E)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   respectively. He was also issued traffic citations for a fake inspection sticker, illegal window tint, and improper display of a license plate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The case went to trial. At the end of testimony, the district court charged the jury using Cheney C. Joseph and P. Raymond Lamonica, 17\n   <em>\n    La. Civ. L. Treatise, Criminal Jury Instructions\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 10:28 (3d ed.) (\"Treatise\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court read the responsive verdicts to the felony battery of a police officer as set forth in Treatise \u00a7 10:28 : (1) guilty as charged; (2) guilty of battery of a police officer; (3) guilty of simple battery; (4) guilty of simple assault; and (5) not guilty. Neither the State nor the defense lodged an objection to the jury charges or filed an emergency writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   During deliberations, the jury asked the district court for a definition of simple assault. It responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Simple Assault. Assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the intentional placing of another in reasonable apprehension of receiving a battery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The jury returned a guilty verdict of simple assault, a violation of La. R.S. 14:38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant filed motions for new trial and post-verdict judgment of acquittal. The district court granted the motion stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   At this time the Court is going to grant the defendant's post-verdict judgment of acquittal under Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 821, on count I, Simple Assault, as the evidence educed at trial, in this Court's opinion, was not sufficient to support the offense charged or to support the verdict the jury returned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Under the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 821, this Court finds that the evidence viewed in light most favorable to the State does not reasonably permit a finding of guilty. The jury in this case rejected the State's \"as charged\" count I, Battery of a Police Officer with injury, and the jury came back with the lesser responsive verdict of Simple Assault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   This Court, again, finds that after exhaustively reviewing and analyzing both the testimony that was educed at trial, and viewing the evidence that was submitted in terms of photographs and live mobile cams, the body cams that were educed at trial, and that this Court finds that the jury's lesser responsive verdict is not supported by this evidence and therefore this Court vacates the jury's verdict as to count I and grants the defendant's post-verdict motion for a judgment of acquittal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    TRIAL TESTIMONY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The trial took place over two days and the following four witnesses testified: Troopers Thaxton and Robertson; Robertson's treating physician; and Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The troopers confirmed that they received the dispatch about a vehicle heading towards the river. When they got to Elk and Rampart Street, they saw a dark-colored pickup truck parked next to the curb. The troopers made a U-turn and parked behind the pickup.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At that point, the troopers did not know if this was the vehicle for which they were looking. They noticed, however, that the vehicle did not have a visible license plate and all the windows were darkly tinted. Thaxton walked to the driver's side window and asked Defendant to exit his vehicle. As he did, Thaxton testified that he could detect a very strong odor of marijuana coming out of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Thaxton explained to Defendant why he had asked him to exit the truck. Thaxton then asked for identification (\"ID\"). Defendant stated that he had just closed his barbershop and thought his ID was in the shop. Thaxton asked him to look through his wallet first. As Defendant flipped through the wallet's content, Thaxton stated that he saw the\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6888241\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/156/126/#p129\">\n    ID.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   He testified that Defendant \"glared\" at him, returned his wallet to his pocket, and attempted to run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Robertson initially approached the vehicle with his weapon. After determining that the weapon was unnecessary, he returned it to the police vehicle and came back, positioning himself behind Defendant. Robertson was concerned about Defendant's demeanor and refusal to identify himself. As Defendant turned to run, Robertson grabbed his right wrist. Defendant immediately started \"violently jerking backwards.\" Robertson stated that Defendant threw an \"uncoordinated, left jab, or punch.\" Robertson testified that he avoided the punch but that Defendant's fingernail cut him along the jawline. Thaxton\n   confirmed that Defendant threw some type of \"action\" towards Robertson. After Defendant failed to obey verbal commands to stop running, Thaxton used his Taser. Thaxton heard Robertson yell that Defendant had kicked him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant testified on his own behalf. He was sitting in his truck parked at his place of business. Defendant saw a police car going in the opposite direction at a fast speed. One of the troopers shined a flashlight into his driver's window. He saw another person on the passenger's side holding a weapon. He was scared. Defendant heard a voice telling him to get out of the car. Defendant shut off his vehicle with his keys, money, and cell phone in his hand when he exited. Thaxton asked him for\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6888241\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/156/126/#p129\">\n    ID.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Defendant testified that Thaxton was acting in a hostile manner and again asked for his\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6888241\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/156/126/#p129\">\n    ID.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Defendant could not immediately locate it. He did not see Robertson and was not thinking about the other officer during his exchange with Thaxton. He looked again and found his ID in his wallet. Before he could remove it, Defendant felt someone behind him grab his right wrist. He did not know who it was. He jerked away, waved his hands up, and backed away. At that moment, both troopers tried to grab his clothes to pull him onto the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendant denied hitting or kicking Robertson. He saw Robertson slip and hit his knee on the curb. At that moment, he saw Thaxton reach into his holster. Defendant did not know if he was reaching for a gun or Taser so he ran. As Defendant ran, he was tased in his buttocks and fell. He got up and kept running. He took a few more steps when he was tased a second time. Thaxton then handcuffed him. Defendant did not know why he was under arrest. After he was placed in the police car, he asked what he was being charged with and was told for kicking a Louisiana State Trooper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant and Robertson were taken to the hospital to treat their respective injuries. Defendant sustained injuries to his face and head and had abrasions down his back and to his face and hands. Robertson suffered a fractured tibial plateau.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Robertson's treating orthopedic surgeon, Jason Rudd, M.D., testified that he examined Robertson's fractured tibial plateau. Dr. Rudd stated that the injury was consistent with a kick. He denied that the injury could have been caused by Robertson falling onto the ground and hitting his knee on a curb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Post-Verdict Judgment of Acquittal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The State charged Defendant with battery of a police officer requiring medical attention, a felony. The jury convicted Defendant of the lesser and included responsive verdict of simple assault, a misdemeanor. Thus, the State presents one issue for consideration: whether the district court\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   erred in granting defendant's motion for post-verdict judgment of acquittal. When viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the testimony at trial reasonably permits a jury to find that the defendant attempted to commit a battery on Trooper Robertson.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   After reviewing the record on appeal and applicable law, I find ample evidence exists to support the jury's verdict of simple assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the district court erred when it granted Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A post-verdict judgment of acquittal \"shall be granted only if the court finds that the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the state, does not reasonably permit a finding of guilty.\" La. C.Cr.P. art. 821(B). This standard is similar to the standard for appellate review of the sufficiency of evidence to support a defendant's conviction: the court must determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The district court judge noted that \"the jury in this case rejected the State's 'as charged' count I.\" I find that the district court erred because the Defendant's motion post-verdict judgment\n   of acquittal focused on the credibility of the troopers and Defendant, an inappropriate consideration for the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simmons,\n   </em>\n   07-0741, p. 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8215015\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/983/200/#p209\">\n    983 So.2d at 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   I find that, in viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, a rational juror could have found that Defendant attempted and intended to punch and kick Robertson or that Defendant actually completed the act by hitting or kicking him. This was a credibility determination, which was properly made by the jury and should not be disturbed by the district court or the appellate courts.

Defendant notes that he only \"turned around and backed up\" and \"yanked away\" from the officer. Both officers testified that Defendant threw \"some type of punch\" or \"uncoordinated left jab\" in Robertson's direction. The fact that Defendant's action was clumsy or imprecise does not negate his intent to use force against the officer. Robertson said he avoided Defendant's fist, but that Defendant's nail cut him along the jawline. Thaxton also testified that he observed Robertson fall to the ground after Robertson \"dodged\" or \"attempted to dodge\" Defendant's movement. Although Defendant denied punching Robertson and indicated that he had just spun around and backed away from him, the jury was entitled to accept the officers' testimony over Defendant's version of events. Moreover, intent need not be proven as a fact and may be inferred from the circumstances and the actions of the accused.\n   <em>\n    State v.

This provides additional evidence that Defendant actively desired to cause Robertson bodily harm. Robertson testified that he felt a sharp pain in his knee and observed Defendant's foot pull back. Dr. Rudd, who treated Robertson for his knee injury, testified that Robertson's facture was consistent with a lateral kick to the knee. The record also shows Robertson used crutches and could not put any weight on his left leg for several months to allow his injury to heal. While Thaxton did not witness the kick and Defendant denied kicking the officer, Thaxton saw Robertson fall and heard him shout that Defendant \"kicked\" him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, sufficient evidence existed for the jury to find Defendant had the intent to commit a battery against Robertson and convict Defendant of simple assault.

The jury could have chosen to render the compromised verdict of assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the jury may have credited the testimony of the troopers by finding that Defendant's actions against Robertson constituted a simple assault. On the other hand, the jury may have believed that Defendant did not complete a battery but had the requisite intent to hit Robertson. Accordingly, this is not a matter of the sufficiency of the evidence but one of the weight given to that evidence by the jury.\n   <em>\n    See Materre,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036930\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/53/615/#p622\">\n     supra.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Credibility determinations and factual findings made by a jury are entitled to great deference by the district and appellate courts when deciding a motion for post-verdict for acquittal.

R.S. 14:27, which makes attempts to commit a crime a lesser and included grade of the intended crime. The majority's holding improperly limits the application of La. R.S. 14:27 contrary to long recognized practices in our criminal courts in Louisiana. This is especially significant in cases involving protected classes where the Legislature created separate crimes of felony battery, such as in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , battery of a police officer with injuries requiring medical attention ( La. R.S. 14:34.2, for which assault is listed as an Article 815 responsive verdict in the Treatise at \u00a7 10:28 ), as well as the following: disarming of a peace officer ( La. R.S. 14:34.6, for which assault is listed as an Article 814 responsive verdict in La. C.Cr.P. art. 814 (14.1) ); cruelty to the infirm ( La. R.S. 14:93.3, for which assault is listed as an Article 814 responsive verdict in La. C.Cr.P. art. 814 (5) ); battery of a correctional facility officer ( La.

His argument was predicated on the incongruity of an attempt to commit the offense. The State countered that attempted aggravated assault with a firearm is a responsive verdict in cases in which the prosecution \"does not rely on the attempted-battery definition of assault, but rather relies on the alternative theory or definition of assault,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the intentional placing of another in reasonable apprehension of receiving a battery.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7023398\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/118/1156/\">\n    118 So.3d at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Agreeing with the State, the Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   reasoned that a plain reading of the statute reveals that an assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the intentional placing of another in reasonable apprehension of receiving a battery.
