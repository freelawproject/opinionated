For the reasons stated herein, that portion of the March 19, 2018 amended judgment granting Ms. Duncan's exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and dismissing Dr. Duncan's Motion to Reduce Child Support and his First Supplemental and Amended Motion to Reduce Child Support is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History and Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties were married on June 11, 1994. Three children were born of the marriage: MacKenzie Duncan, born October 14, 1998; Parker Duncan, born July 18, 2000; and Connor Duncan, born June 22, 2003. On March 10, 2014, Ms. Duncan file a petition for divorce and incidental matters, including a request for child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 6, 2014, the parties entered into a consent judgment concerning custody and child support. The parties agreed to joint custody of the three minor children, with Ms. Duncan designated as the domiciliary parent and reasonable visitation with Dr. Duncan. The consent judgment further provided that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Scott Furm Mofford Duncan shall pay child support in the amount of $13,000.00 per month, effective March 10, 2014, to be paid in $6,500.00 installments on the 15\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   and 30\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   of each month beginning June 15, 2014. The parties agree to opt out of child support being paid through DCFS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court finds in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Stogner v.

The Court has considered the guidelines to review the adequacy of the agreed upon amount, and further finds that said support agreement is in the best interest of the minor children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 22, 2017, Dr. Duncan filed a Motion to Reduce Child Support contending that \"the parties' oldest daughter, MacKenzie Duncan, born on October 14, 2000 [sic],\" reached the age of majority and graduated from high school. He asserted that this was a material change in circumstance warranting a reduction in his child support obligation. In response, Ms. Duncan filed exceptions of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , no cause of action, vagueness, and ambiguity. In her exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , Ms. Duncan alleged that the June 6, 2014 consent judgment, which set an\n   <em>\n    in globo\n   </em>\n   child support\n   amount, could not be reduced because the consent judgment previously adjudicated the effect of their oldest child reaching the age of majority and provided that the\n   <em>\n    in globo\n   </em>\n   amount of child support would remain in effect until the youngest child attained the age of majority. Ms. Duncan's exception of no cause of action alleged that a child reaching the age of majority does not by itself constitute a material change in circumstance warranting a reduction of an\n   <em>\n    in globo\n   </em>\n   child support award. Dr. Duncan filed an opposition to Ms. Duncan's exceptions. On September 12, 2017, the Domestic Commissioner overruled Ms. Duncan's exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and sustained Ms. Duncan's exception of no cause of action, giving Dr. Duncan fifteen days to amend his Motion to Reduce Child Support. On September 13, 2017, Dr. Duncan filed a First Supplemental and Amended Motion to Reduce Child Support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 14, 2017, Ms. Duncan filed an objection to the Domestic Commissioner's judgment overruling her exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . On September 18, 2017, Dr. Duncan filed an objection to the Domestic Commissioner's judgment sustaining Ms. Duncan's exception of no cause of action as to his\n   <em>\n    original\n   </em>\n   Motion to Reduce Child Support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 5, 2017, the trial court heard both parties' objections. The parties agreed that they were only addressing Dr. Duncan's original Motion to Reduce Child Support, not his First Supplemental and Amending Motion to Reduce Child Support. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court sustained the exception of no cause of action and took the exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 18, 2017, the trial court rendered judgment sustaining Ms. Duncan's exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . On December 20, 2017, the trial court rendered another judgment granting Ms. Duncan's exceptions of no cause of action and\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . The trial court issued written reasons the same day. On January 4, 2018, Dr. Duncan filed a motion for devolutive appeal. On March 16, 2018, this Court ordered the trial court to amend both December judgments to include appropriate decretal language,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the dismissal of Dr. Duncan's Motion to Reduce Child Support. On March 19, 2018, the trial court rendered an amended judgment granting Ms. Duncan's exceptions of no cause of action and\n   <em>\n    res judicata,\n   </em>\n   and dismissing Dr. Duncan's Motion to Reduce Child Support and his First Supplemental and Amended Motion to Reduce Child Support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his first assignment of error, Dr. Duncan contends that the trial court erred in granting Ms. Duncan's exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . He asserts that child support awards are an exception to (\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., are excluded from)\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , citing La. R.S. 13:4232, and as such, child support awards are never final and\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable. Ms. Duncan contends that the 2014 consent judgment awarding an\n   <em>\n    in globo\n   </em>\n   child support award is a conventional obligation that is final and subject to\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . In his third assignment of error, Dr. Duncan also contends that the trial court improperly dismissed his First Supplemental and Amended Motion to Reduce Child Support in the March 19, 2018 amended judgment because it was not before the trial court. Dr. Duncan contends that Ms. Duncan did not file an exception or responsive pleading to his First Supplemental and Amended Motion to Reduce Child Support. Additionally, according to the October 6, 2017 minute entry, the First Supplemental and Amended Motion to Reduce Child Support was continued without date. Therefore, Dr. Duncan argues that it was improper for the trial court to dismiss his\n   First Supplemental and Amended Motion to Reduce Child Support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Appellate courts review an exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   using the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Woodlands Dev.

Dr. Duncan's new allegations might warrant a reduction of child support under La. C.C. art. 142 or La. R.S. 9:311 and therefore, fall within the exception to (\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., are excluded from)\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . Because an award of child support is always subject to modification based on a material change in circumstances, regardless of any language in a consent judgment to the contrary, upon\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, we find the trial court erred in granting Ms. Duncan's exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, the trial court's judgment granting Ms. Duncan's exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and its dismissal of Dr. Duncan's Motion to Reduce Child Support and First Supplemental and Amended Motion to Reduce Child Support is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.
