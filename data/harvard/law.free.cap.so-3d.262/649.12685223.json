(\"the father\") appeals from a judgment entered by the Fayette Probate Court (\"the probate court\") granting the petition of J.B.R. (\"the stepfather\") to adopt R.J.M. (\"the child\"). We dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 31, 2017, the stepfather filed in the probate court a petition seeking to adopt the child. On March 1, 2017, the\n   father answered and objected to the stepfather's petition. After a trial, the probate court entered a judgment on March 17, 2017, granting the stepfather's petition to adopt the child. The father filed his notice of appeal on March 30, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On appeal, this court, ex mero motu, raised the issue whether the probate court had jurisdiction over the adoption petition in light of the fact that there exists a previous judgment entered by a Florida court regarding custody of the child, which is referenced in the record on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D.C.S. v. L.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7026211\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/84/954/#p957\">\n    84 So.3d 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 957 (Ala. Civ. App. 2011) (\" ' \"[T]his Court is duty bound to notice\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu\n   </em>\n   the absence of subject-matter jurisdiction.\" ' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Baldwin Cty. v.

The parties were requested to submit briefs on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    J.L.L. v. Jefferson County Department of Human Resources\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6997214\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/127/433/\">\n    127 So.3d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. Civ. App. 2012), this court recognized that the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (\"the PKPA\"), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A, applies to adoption actions. Subsection (d) of the PKPA provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The jurisdiction of a court of a State which has made a child custody or visitation determination consistently with the provisions of this section continues as long as the requirement of subsection (c)(1) of this section continues to be met and such State remains the residence of the child or of any contestant.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Subsection (c)(1) of the PKPA provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"A child custody or visitation determination made by a court of a State is consistent with the provisions of this section only if-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"(1) such court has jurisdiction under the law of such State.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the present case, the Circuit Court of Okaloosa County, Florida (\"the Florida court\"), made a custody determination regarding the child in favor of the father and issued two pickup orders to the child's mother, J.D.H., ordering her to return the child to the custody of the father; the latter pickup order was enforced by the Fayette Circuit Court (\"the circuit court\") by an order entered on January 13, 2017, in which the circuit court recognized the exclusive continuing jurisdiction of the Florida court over the custody of the child. The stepfather attached a copy of the circuit court's order to his petition for adoption and did not contest the terms of that order. The record indicates that the father remains a resident of Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Florida court has exclusive continuing jurisdiction over the child's custody under the PKPA. Under \u00a7 1738A(f), the probate court may modify the Florida court's order only if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"(1) it has jurisdiction to make such a child custody determination;\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"(2) the court of the other State no longer has jurisdiction, or it has declined to exercise such jurisdiction to modify such determination.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The record does not contain any indication that the Florida court has declined to exercise its jurisdiction to modify custody of the child. Therefore, we conclude that the probate court lacks jurisdiction to modify the Florida court's order through the adoption process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In his supplemental brief to this court, the stepfather argues that the PKPA does not provide for exclusive subject-matter jurisdiction in this case but, instead, provides for only \"preferred jurisdiction.\" He asserts, therefore, that the father's failure to raise this issue in the adoption proceedings and in his initial appellate\n   brief to this court renders the issue of jurisdiction waived. In\n   <em>\n    Ex parte D.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8397797\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/975/940/\">\n    975 So.2d 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 2007), our supreme court held that the PKPA regulates which state court will have subject-matter jurisdiction over a child-custody case in cases of interstate conflicts. Although the concluding paragraph of the main opinion in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte D.B.\n   </em>\n   provides that Nebraska was the \"preferred jurisdiction\" under the PKPA,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8397797\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/975/940/\">\n    975 So.2d at 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that language came only after the supreme court had repeatedly recognized that the PKPA gave Nebraska exclusive \"subject-matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8397797\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/975/940/\">\n    975 So.2d at 950-51, 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
