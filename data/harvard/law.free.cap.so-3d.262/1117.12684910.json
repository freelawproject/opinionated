Sullivan moved for summary judgment at the close of discovery, arguing that the uncontradicted evidence established Harry's negligence as the sole cause of the accident.

In its order granting summary judgment, the trial court found, \"Because the four identities of res judicata are present, the Court rules that the doctrine of merger as it relates to res judicata applies to this action.\" Merger is a bar under res judicata for an action that should have been litigated, rather than a claim that actually was litigated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jeffrey Jackson &amp; Mary Miller,\n   <em>\n    Encyclopedia of Mississippi Law\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14:6 (2001).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

Helen argues that the trial court erred in barring her suit under the merger doctrine because the elements required for res judicata are not met. Helen asserts that, since Harry was not a party to the original suit, the identities of the parties are different in the two suits, and the federal district court's final judgment was \"not a judgment on the merits\" as contemplated by the doctrine of res judicata.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b611. Conversely, Harry responds that the doctrine of merger is appropriate, because Helen's claims for personal injuries resulting from the accident merged into the agreed judgment against Sullivan. As a result, Harry contends that Helen is barred from continuing to pursue her claims against Harry that could have been asserted in the federal suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b612.

Helen argues that both Sullivan and Harry were negligent in causing the accident. Helen charged in the federal action that Sullivan's liability for the wreck was based on his speeding, while Helen now contends that Harry failed to yield before entering onto Highway 45.

Here, the $ 300,000 settlement accepted in \"satisfaction of all claims,\" according to the release agreement, referred only to those claims of the designated \"Releasees\" against Sullivan. Helen made no demand against Harry, nor was Harry a party to the release agreement in the federal suit. Thus, the first element of accord and satisfaction is not met. Accordingly, we find that the trial court erred in granting Harry's motion for summary judgment under the doctrine of accord and satisfaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b636.
