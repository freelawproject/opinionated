Due to a malfunctioning of the memory device that held the files from Appellant's jury trial, no stenography notes or audio files of the trial exist. The court below attempted to reconstruct the trial record, but was unable to do so. Thus, Appellant was unable to receive a transcript of his jury trial. The State concedes, and we agree, that Appellant is entitled to a full transcript containing appealable issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hardy v.
