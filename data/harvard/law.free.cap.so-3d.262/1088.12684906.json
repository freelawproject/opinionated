Ms. Derouen provided daycare services for children in her home in exchange for compensation. On the day Averi was bitten, Ms. Derouen was caring for two of her grandchildren in addition to six other children, including Averi. When the children were napping, Ms. Derouen heard a child crying and went to check on the child. Upon entering the room where the children were napping, she found Averi crying and two other children, one sitting on either side of her. Averi had been bitten on both of her legs and her sides. One of the children sitting by Averi was Ms. Derouen's grandchild; the other child was one she regularly cared for. Ms. Derouen's testimony indicates Averi may have been bitten by either or both of these two children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Allstate filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking to have the Latours'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   claims against it dismissed. Allstate based its motion on a provision of its policy which excludes liability coverage for injuries \"arising out of ... business activities of any insured.\" It argues that because Ms. Derouen was providing daycare services for Averi when Averi was injured by another child in her care, Averi's injuries arose out of her business activities; therefore, the Latours' claims are excluded from the personal liability coverage provision of its policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Latours asserted to the trial court that Averi was bitten by Ms. Derouen's grandchild and that because Allstate's policy definition of \"business\" excepts daycare services for an insured's relatives from the definition of business activities, the exclusion is inapplicable. Therefore, they urged that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Averi's injuries arose out of Ms. Derouen's daycare business and that this issue precludes summary judgment. They also argued that language contained in Allstate's premises liability exclusion confirms coverage for Averi's injuries or, in the alternative, creates an ambiguity which also precludes summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court denied Allstate's motion, finding that the difference between the pertinent language of the personal liability exclusion as compared to the premises liability exclusion of the policy \"create[d] an issue.\" Allstate filed a writ application, seeking reversal of the trial court's judgment and the grant of summary judgment in its favor.

First and foremost is the rule that an insurance policy is a contract between the parties and should be construed using the general rules of interpretation of contracts set forth in the Civil Code. According to those rules, the responsibility of the judiciary in interpreting insurance contracts is to determine the parties' common intent; this analysis is begun by reviewing the words of the insurance contract. When the words of an insurance contract are clear and explicit and lead to no absurd consequences, no further interpretation may be made in search of the parties' intent, and courts must enforce the contract as written. The determination of whether a contract is clear or ambiguous is a question of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"Exclusionary provisions in insurance contracts are strictly construed against the insurer, and any ambiguity is construed in favor of the insured.\"\n   <em>\n    Ledbetter v.

Because the probable source of the child's bite was not a child for whose care the homeowner was compensated, the Latours argue that the injury did not \"arise out of\" the operation of a daycare facility in Ms. Derouen's home per the terms of the Allstate policy. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Insurance is purchased to protect the insured against exposure from liability. This principle is embodied in the insuring agreement, which, in this case, provides, \"Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this policy,\n   <strong>\n    Allstate\n   </strong>\n   will pay damages which an\n   <strong>\n    insured person\n   </strong>\n   becomes\n   <strong>\n    legally obligated to pay because of\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    bodily injury\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    property damage\n   </strong>\n   arising from an\n   <strong>\n    occurrence\n   </strong>\n   to which this policy applies, and is covered by this part of the policy.\" Liability insurance payment is always predicated upon the\n   <em>\n    insured's\n   </em>\n   legal liability. In this matter, the allegations against the homeowner involve failure to supervise \"the minor child,\" which, throughout the petition, refers to the injured child. The risk that a minor child would be injured at the operator's home is precisely the risk Allstate avoided in excluding coverage for operating a daycare. The acts or omissions of the homeowner/insured is the proper focus in determining whether the exclusion applies. This approach mirrors those previously used in similar cases, and it provides a more concrete foundation upon which subsequent homeowners and insurers can structure their dealings in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Elorza v.

However, she allowed the daycare charges to play on the trampoline. The business pursuits exclusion was held to exclude coverage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The accident in question occurred during the course of Massey's [the homeowner's] ordinary working day, while she was performing her customary business tasks. Kayla [the injured child] was present at Massey's house because Massey's business was an \"at home\" business; Kayla was at Massey's house because it was Massey's business to care for a group of children. Kayla was hurt while she was tussling with another one of the children Massey was paid to watch. And the fact that the accident arose out of Massey's negligence on the job does not negate the fact that it arose out of her business or somehow render inoperable the business exclusion contained in her homeowner's policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Massey argues that because the trampoline was purchased \"primarily\" for family use, it was not part of the equipment used for the day care. This argument is unavailing, however. It is defeated by Massey's own testimony: Massey herself testified that the day care charges were allowed to use the trampoline. Need we hear any more?

The agency of injury is irrelevant to the inquiry into coverage in this case. What is relevant are the alleged actions or omissions of the insured upon which liability is asserted and whether those actions further the operation of the daycare. In the context of the present case, the omission for which the Latours seek to impose liability on Ms. Derouen is her negligent supervision of their minor daughter.

Plaintiffs allege their child, Averi, was injured while in daycare at Defendant's residence. It is undisputed that Defendant operates a daycare business\n   out of her home and was being paid by Plaintiffs to keep their child daily. It is also undisputed that Defendant was watching over two of her grandchildren on the day of the alleged incident and they were not there as paying customers of her daycare business. Though it is not disputed that Averi had bite marks on her body, it is in dispute as to which child or children inflicted the bites on Averi. Defendant testified in deposition she did not see which child bit Averi but when she came into the room in response to hearing a child crying she observed one of her grandchildren sitting next to Averi and that grandchild was laughing while Averi was crying. She therefore assumed her grandchild bit Averi. She also said another child was near Averi on the opposite side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Allstate filed a motion for summary judgment asserting its homeowner policy contains a specific business exclusion which states: \"We do not cover bodily injury or property damage\n   <em>\n    arising out of\n   </em>\n   the past or present business activities of an insured person.\" (emphasis added) Allstate asserts this language in the policy applies to the situation at hand regardless of whether the child who bit Averi is one of Defendant's grandchildren, who by definition in the Allstate policy were not part of her day care business, or one of the other daycare customers' children. Allstate maintains Defendant had a duty to protect Averi from harm and she breached that duty, and that such \"arises out of\" the operation of her daycare business. The trial court denied Allstate's motion for summary judgment because it found there are competing provisions in the insurance policy regarding coverage, the application of which is affected by whether Averi was bitten by one of Defendant's grandchildren or one of the daycare customers or both. This, said the trial judge, \"creates an issue\" and thereby denied summary judgment.

First and foremost, we must understand from the outset that by the very terms of Allstate's policy language (\"arising out of\") the exclusion on which Allstate relies\n   <em>\n    does not turn on Defendant's duty owed to Averi as a day care customer\n   </em>\n   , as the majority finds, but, rather, turns on the \"\n   <strong>\n    source of the injury\n   </strong>\n   \" to Averi.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lucas v.

Section X of the policy excludes coverage for any bodily injury or damage to property \"\n   <strong>\n    arising out of\n   </strong>\n   \" the business activities of its insured. By definition in Allstate's policy, taking care of a grandchild\n   <strong>\n    is not a business activity\n   </strong>\n   . The majority acknowledges this fact. As Defendant asserts, the \"source\" of Averi's injuries was likely Defendant's grandchild, thus the injuries to Averi did not \"arise out of\" Defendant's business activities. The evidence presented in support of the motion for summary judgment as to who bit Averi is equivocal. But more importantly, there is no evidence in support of Allstate's motion for summary judgment that Averi was only bit by another paying customer's child. Without that evidence Allstate fails to show that Averi's injuries\n   <em>\n    arose out of\n   </em>\n   Defendant's day care business and are thus subject to the policy exclusion. The majority finds it is the breach of Defendant's duty to Averi as her daycare client that determines whether the injury to Averi \"arose out of\" Defendant's business activities. This finding is incorrect. By use of the phrase \"arising out of\" Allstate's policy bases liability for Averi's injuries on\n   <em>\n    the source of Averi's injuries\n   </em>\n   , not on the grandmother's duty owed to either child. If the source of Averi's injuries is one of Defendant's grandchildren, who by definition in the Allstate policy are not part of Defendant's business activities, then the Allstate exclusion relied on does not apply. The injuries would not \"arise out of\" the daycare business. I reiterate that neither the trial court, nor this court on de novo review, can determine from the evidence submitted on summary judgment who bit Averi, or whether Defendant failed to meet any legal duty, without making credibility determinations and resolving competing factual allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Allstate's argument is belied by its own policy provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   , our state supreme court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   An insurance policy is a contract between the parties and should be construed employing the general rules of interpretation of contracts set forth in the Louisiana Civil Code.\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Thus, Defendant's taking care of her own grandchildren at her home does not constitute operating a day care business, i.e. it is not a business activity. Allstate does not argue otherwise and the majority agrees. Defendant's grandchild was placed under her care and supervision and she was responsible for that grandchild's actions. Any failure in Defendant's duty to supervise her grandchild\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (if such failure is factually established) makes her legally responsible for her actions unless otherwise exempted from such responsibility by contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    But the question of Defendant's duty to Averi and/or her grandchild is not determinative of liability for Averi's injuries. It is the source of the injury, i.e. who bit Averi, that determines liability and a fortiori whether such liability is excluded from coverage.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   It is alleged that the source of Averi's injury is Defendant's grandchild. If this proves to be true at trial then the business exclusion relied on by Allstate will not apply, otherwise the recited policy provision exempting Defendant's grandchildren from inclusion in her business activity would have no meaning. Such an application would also render meaningless the phrase \"arising out of\" the business activity as such phrase turns on the\n   <em>\n    source of the injury\n   </em>\n   which would not be related to Defendant's business activities if that\n   source, i.e. the biter, is Defendant's grandchild. The policy provides coverage for Averi's injuries, as recited above, under Coverage Y because she is a person \"on the insured premises with the permission of [the] insured person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   I have included certain provisions of Allstate's policy in this discussion even though they have no direct relation to this case because the language in these provisions demonstrate that Allstate knows how to, and could have, written its business exclusion provision differently if it desired to. If Allstate intended for its business exclusion to reach the actions of Defendant's non-business related invitee (like her grandchild) it could have used language like it used elsewhere in the policy such as the phrase \"caused by\" used in relation to acts of war, or such as \"reasonably expected to result from\" like it used in the context of intentional or criminal acts. In each instance in the policy where Allstate employs the phrase \"arises out of\" it is clear this reflects the notion of the\n   <em>\n    source\n   </em>\n   of the \"bodily injury or property damage.\" For example, under Coverage X, item 7, Allstate does not provide coverage for injury or damage \"\n   <em>\n    arising out of\n   </em>\n   the negligent supervision by an insured person of any person, or any liability statutorily imposed on any insured person, arising from the ownership, maintenance, use, occupancy, renting, loaning, entrusting, loading or unloading of any aircraft, watercraft...\" Thus, the\n   <em>\n    source\n   </em>\n   of such responsibility is the negligent supervision of any person loading or unloading a watercraft. Likewise, another example is found under Coverage X, item 15, in which Allstate's policy does not cover \"any liability an insured person assumes\n   <em>\n    arising out of\n   </em>\n   any contract or agreement,\" clearly making the contract or agreement the\n   <em>\n    source\n   </em>\n   of such liability. If we accept Allstate's argument that the source of Averi's injury is Defendant's failure to perform her duty to supervise Averi implicitly required in her contract with the Latours, this provision would be applicable, yet Allstate does not maintain such an assertion.\n   <em>\n    The only interpretation of this provision and the business exclusion provision that renders both meaningful is that \"arising out of\" in both instances means causality, i.e. the phrase speaks to the source of the injury.\n   </em>\n   In the one provision the source of the injury must be the business activity to be excluded and in the other example from the policy the source must be the contract or agreement. The reason neither applies to Defendant's grandchild must be because the policy defines Defendant's care of her grandchild as not part of her day care business and the actions of her grandchild in biting Averi would not arise out of any contract or agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Yet another example is found in Item 14 of the policy regarding mold, fungus, wet rot or dry rot. The policy specifically excludes coverage for bodily injury which \"arises out of,\" in whole or in part, or \"results from mold, fungus, wet rot or dry rot.\" But, as all of us in Louisiana are too well aware, hurricanes can cause much interior water damage which results in a great deal of mold, fungus or wet rot. Such damage is covered by the homeowner policy despite this typical mold exclusion because the\n   <em>\n    hurricane is the source\n   </em>\n   of the mold damage, thus the hurricane related mold damage does not arise out of mold caused by other means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The majority's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Elorza v.

The testimony was undisputed that none of the training maneuvers practiced during the session involved striking the back in any manner. Thus, we find Frisard's action of striking Jackson's back was not an activity associated with the defensive training session, but was in this instance only casually related to the business activity of the training session, and ordinarily incident to non-business pursuits. The trial court properly found the 'business pursuits' exclusion of the State Farm policy did not exclude coverage for Jackson's injuries resulting from the incident. We find no inconsistency in the trial court's findings on the issues of vicarious liability and insurance coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

There was additional language in the Farm Bureau policy in\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   that modified the business exclusion which made it clear that the business activities exclusion did not apply to actions \"incident to non-business pursuits.\" Though that provision is not part of the current Allstate policy, it does contain a provision which amounts to the same thing, i.e., it provides that the business activities exclusion does not apply to Defendant and her relatives, which includes her grandchildren. Thus, under the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Elorza\n   </em>\n   when properly applied, Allstate's business activity exclusion does not apply to injuries caused by Defendant's grandchild while in her care because the Allstate policy defines such as a non-business activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   For the reasons stated, Allstate is not entitled to summary judgment either as a matter of law or fact.
