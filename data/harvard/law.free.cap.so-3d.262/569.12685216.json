Roger Dale Latham owned land in the Mississippi Delta. He used his land primarily to hunt ducks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. In 2004, Latham hired Terry W. Johnson to perform excavation work on his land. Latham and Johnson continued their business relationship with other projects, and they became friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. John W. Robinson III and Craig Trahan were also Latham's friends. Robinson and Trahan paid Latham for the right to hunt ducks on his land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. In the summer of 2007, Johnson told Latham about his interest in certain land in Sunflower County, Mississippi. This tract of land consisted of 170 acres of abandoned catfish ponds, and it was offered for sale at a price of $750 per acre. Johnson and Latham looked at the property and agreed that it would be a good\n   investment for duck hunting. They determined that the property was offered for sale at an amount below the land's market value. They asked Robinson, Trahan, and Mike Dickson (another of Latham's friends) if they were interested in purchasing the property. Dickson declined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5. Latham, Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan met in August of 2007 to look at the property. They met again at the property on September 15, 2007, and they discussed the purchase of the property in more detail. Their discussions included the financing, improvements, and access rights to the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6. According to Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan, they agreed to form a partnership to purchase the property during their September 2007 meeting. In fact, Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan claim that they, along with Latham, agreed to purchase the property as a partnership, and each man would contribute an equal amount of money for the purchase. In addition, they testified that they agreed that Latham would investigate financing options for the purchase, Johnson would determine what improvements needed to be made to the property, Trahan would bush hog the property, and Robinson would research and investigate the adjacent landowner's claim of access rights over the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7. On October 8, 2007, Latham submitted a loan application to the Federal Land Bank Association of North Mississippi (the \"Land Bank\") for the proceeds necessary to purchase the property. On the loan application, in the section about ownership, Latham checked \"partnership.\" Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan contend they were not aware of Latham's loan application with the Land Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8. In October of 2007, Latham called Robinson to discuss the financing. Robinson testified that Latham said he had talked to Johnson and Trahan, and because of their personal issues,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the group should finance the purchase of the property in Latham's name, individually. Latham also said that the group could convey title to the property to the partnership when they were ready.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9. Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan also testified that the decision to finance the purchase of the property in Latham's name only was a group decision. They agreed to share equally in the expenses and understood that, upon Latham's receipt of title to the property, it would be partnership property, not Latham's property individually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 10. On October 18, 2007, Latham submitted a second loan application to the Land Bank. This application was solely in his name. As a result, Latham obtained a loan commitment for $144,500, which included the purchase price of $127,500 and an additional amount for settlement charges, adjustments, and property improvements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 11. Latham executed a promissory note to the Land Bank, on November 8, 2007, and closed on the purchase of the property. A warranty deed was executed, and the property was conveyed to Latham, individually. The warranty deed was recorded among the land records of Sunflower County. At the closing, Latham was disbursed $13,454.58 for property improvements. Latham deposited this money into a bank account at Wachovia Bank. The account was opened in the names of Latham and his wife d/b/a \"Lonesome Pine.\" Shortly after closing, Latham gave the original\n   closing documents to Robinson for safekeeping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 12. The promissory note was to be paid in fifteen annual installments beginning October 1, 2008. On October 1, 2008, Trahan wrote a check to Latham for $3,626.40, and he included a note on the memo line of the check that it was for \"land.\" On October 19, 2008, Johnson wrote a check to Latham for $3,625.40, and he included a note on the memo line of the check that it was for \"land payment.\" On October 22, 2008, Robinson wrote Latham a check for $3,625.40, and he included a note on the memo line that it was for \"Lonesome Pine.\" The checks totaled $10,877.20, and they were deposited in Latham's \"Lonesome Pine\" bank account at Wachovia on October 31, 2008, along with Latham's check in the amount of $3,623.60. Shortly thereafter, Latham wrote a check from the \"Lonesome Pine\" account and paid the Land Bank the full amount of the 2008 payment due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 13. The following year, in 2009, Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan again gave Latham checks for their share of the Land Bank note. On October 21, 2009, Johnson wrote a check to Latham for $3,668 for \"Land Payment Lonesome Pine.\" On October 27, 2009, Robinson wrote a check to Latham for $3,700 for \"Lonesome Pine.\" On November 1, 2009, Trahan wrote a check to Latham for $3,787. The checks totaled $11,155, and Latham deposited these checks and his check for $3,115.81, in the \"Lonesome Pine\" account at Wachovia. Latham then wrote a check from the \"Lonesome Pine\" account to the Land Bank for the amount necessary for the 2009 loan payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 14. In early 2010, Mike Retzer bought the property adjacent to Lonesome Pine. Gil Ray, Retzer's manager, hired Johnson to do some work on Retzer's property. As part of their discussion, Ray informed Johnson that he thought Retzer would also be interested in buying Lonesome Pine. Johnson then told Latham, Robinson, and Trahan about Retzer's possible interest in the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 15. Retzer called Latham and offered to buy Lonesome Pine. Retzer agreed to purchase Lonesome Pine for a price of $2,150 per acre or $365,500.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The sale closed on March 16, 2010. Before the closing, Latham received $15,000 as an earnest money deposit. As a result of the closing, the Land Bank note was paid in full, along with all other expenses of the sale-including commissions, taxes, and attorney fees. Latham received a check for the net proceeds in the amount of $223,963.31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 16. On March 31, 2010, Latham deposited this check into his company's commercial checking account at Trustmark National Bank. The check was not deposited in the Lonesome Pine account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 17. On May 20, 2010, Robinson wrote a letter to Latham. In this letter, Robinson asked for all information and documents related to the sale of the property; the amount and whereabouts of all partnership funds in his possession, custody or control; and all other information and documents necessary for the partnership to settle its accounts and to make final distributions to the partners. Robinson indicated that the letter was also on behalf of Johnson and Trahan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 18. Latham testified that he did not receive this letter. However, Latham admitted that he went to Robinson's house on May 23, 2010. Latham testified that he spent two hours with Robinson discussing this matter. Latham also testified that Robinson made clear, during this meeting,\n   that there was a partnership among Latham, Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 19. After several months, on September 25, 2010, Robinson had another conversation with Latham. He again explained to Latham that the proceeds from the sale, $223,963.31, and any remaining funds borrowed from the Land Bank for property improvements, should be divided equally among the partners. The following week, Johnson had another conversation with Latham. In this conversation, it was clear to Robinson that Latham did not agree with his position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 20. On March 14, 2011, Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan filed a complaint against Latham in the Circuit Court of Sunflower County. The complaint asserted claims for breach of partnership agreement; breach of fiduciary duties; misappropriation and conversion of partnership assets; malicious, intentional, and wanton conduct; and fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation. The complaint asserted claims for both compensatory and punitive damages, and it asked for equitable relief in the form of an accounting, judicial dissolution of the partnership, and settlement of accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 21. Latham served his answer and defenses. As part of his answer, Latham claimed that venue was improper in Sunflower County. Latham filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of venue or, in the alternative, to transfer the case to the Circuit Court of Rankin County, where Latham resided. The circuit court found a substantial alleged act or omission and a substantial event that caused injury had occurred in Sunflower County and denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 22. Latham also asserted an affirmative defense on the grounds that the claims were barred by the statute of limitation and statute of frauds. Latham filed a motion to dismiss on these grounds, and it too was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 23. In his answer, Latham denied that a partnership existed. He testified that the money paid by Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan in 2008 and 2009 was \"only for rights to hunt\" on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 24. At trial, Latham agreed that the parties formed a partnership to purchase the property in September 2007. He further agreed \"that the idea was that all of the partners would contribute equally, both money and time and effort.\" However, Latham claimed that sometime between October 8 and October 18, 2007, he advised Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan that \"they [would] need to sign a promissory note if they wanted it to be a partnership.\" Because Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan did not submit individual loan applications to the Land Bank by October 18, 2007, Latham claimed that the partnership no longer existed. However, Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan disagreed, and each testified that Latham never asked them to submit a loan application or to sign a promissory note. They also testified that the 2008 and 2009 checks they sent to Latham were for their one-fourth shares of the Land Bank note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 25. This case was tried before a jury in Sunflower County. The jury returned a verdict for Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan in the amount of $176,352.24. The circuit court denied their request to for a hearing on punitive damages. The court also denied their motion for attorney fees and prejudgment interest but granted their motion for post-judgment interest. The court entered a judgment that was consistent with the jury's verdict. Latham then filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or, in the alternative, for a new trial. The court denied this post-trial motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 26. Latham now appeals from this judgment, and he asserts ten assignments\n   of error. He argues that the circuit court erred in: (1) denying his motion to dismiss or, alternatively, to transfer venue; (2) denying his motion to dismiss based on the applicable statutes of limitation; (3) denying his motion to dismiss based on the statute of frauds; (4) denying his motion to dismiss for Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan's failure to perform an accounting; (5) denying his ore tenus motion regarding an alleged discovery violation; (6) allowing the use of a deposition for impeachment; (7) allowing the admission of parole evidence to explain a series of emails between Robinson and a third party, (8) denying his motion for a mistrial; (9) denying his motion for a JNOV; and (10) denying his motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 27. Johnson, Robinson and Trahan cross-appeal and argue the circuit court erroneously denied their request for prejudgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    I. Latham's Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    A. Venue\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 28. Latham contends that the circuit court committed reversible error when it determined that venue was proper in Sunflower County, Mississippi. Latham argues that the court should have dismissed the case or transferred venue to Rankin County, where he resided. Latham claims venue was improper in Sunflower County because \"no party to the suit retain[ed] any interest [in] said real property\" and \"the real property is no longer vested in any of the parties to this action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 29. \"The standard of review for a change in venue is abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Hedgepeth v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8390289\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/975/235/#p237\">\n    975 So.2d 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237 (\u00b6 7) (Miss. 2008). A circuit court's decision on venue will not be disturbed \"unless it clearly appears that there has been an abuse of discretion or that the discretion has not been justly and properly exercised under the circumstances of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8390289\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/975/235/#p237\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 30. Venue is determined by Mississippi Code Annotated section 11-11-3(1)(a)(i) (Rev. 2004), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Civil actions of which the circuit court has original jurisdiction shall be commenced in the county where [1] the defendant resides, or, [2] if a corporation, in the county of its principal place of business, or [3] in the county where a substantial alleged act or omission occurred or [4] where a substantial event that caused the injury occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 31. Latham cites section 11-11-3 for the proposition that since he is a resident of Rankin County, Mississippi, he was entitled to venue in Rankin County. If the plaintiffs had filed the complaint in Rankin County, under Mississippi Code Annotated section 11-11-3, venue would have been proper in Rankin County. But, the plaintiffs did not file their complaint in Rankin County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 32. Because the complaint was filed in Sunflower County, we must determine whether venue was proper there. The plaintiffs argue that venue is proper in Sunflower County because that is \"in the county where a substantial alleged act or omission occurred or where a substantial event that caused the injury occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8390289\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/975/235/#p237\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 33. We agree. As discussed above, Sunflower County is where the land was located, where the decision was made to purchase the property, where the partnership was formed, and where the sale occurred that resulted in the profit. Indeed, virtually all of the conduct occurred that gave rise to the plaintiffs' claims and where the events that caused the injury occurred. The fact that the property was subsequently sold to a third party and \"is no longer vested in any of the parties to this action\" is of no consequence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 34. We find that venue was proper in Sunflower County, pursuant to section 11-11-3(1)(a)(i), and the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Latham's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    B. Statutes of Limitation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 35. Latham next argues the circuit court erred in denying his motions to dismiss for Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan's failure to timely assert their claims within the applicable statutes of limitations. \"This Court applies a de novo standard of review to the statute of limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    Fletcher v. Lyles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8188446\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/999/1271/#p1276\">\n    999 So.2d 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1276 (\u00b6 20) (Miss. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 36. Latham asserts the plaintiffs' intentional-tort claims were subject to a one-year statute of limitations under Mississippi Code Annotated section 15-1-35 (Rev. 2015) and that their remaining claims were governed by a three-year statute of limitations under Mississippi Code Annotated sections 15-1-29 (Rev. 2015) and 15-1-49 (Rev. 2015). However, regardless of the claim or the statute that applies, the limitation period does not begin to run until the cause of action accrues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 37. \"[A] cause of action accrues when it comes into existence as an enforceable claim, that is, when the right to sue becomes vested.\"\n   <em>\n    Fletcher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8188446\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/999/1271/#p1276\">\n    999 So.2d at 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 23) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"[A] statute of limitations begins to run when all the elements of a tort, or cause of action, are present.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8188446\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/999/1271/#p1276\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While there are various elements to the separate claims asserted by the plaintiffs, all require the common element of damages. Thus, until Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan suffered damages, their cause of action did not accrue, and the statutes of limitation did not begin to run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 38. Here, Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan allege to have suffered damages as a result of Latham's refusal to turn over proceeds from the sale of the property, as well as the remaining funds borrowed for improvements to the property. The property was not sold, and Latham did not receive the sale proceeds until March 16, 2010. As the complaint was filed on March 14, 2011, the plaintiffs' claims were timely asserted within the applicable statutes of limitation. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in denying Latham's motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    C. Statute of Frauds\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 39. Latham next argues the circuit court erred in denying his motion to dismiss based on the statute of frauds. \"This Court reviews de novo a [circuit] court's grant or denial of a motion to dismiss.\"\n   <em>\n    Delta Health Group, Inc. v. Estate of Pope ex rel. Payne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8192014\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/995/123/#p125\">\n    995 So.2d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 125 (\u00b6 9) (Miss. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 40. Our statute of frauds states, in part, that \"[a]n action shall not be brought whereby to charge a defendant or other party ... upon any contract for the sale of lands ... unless ... the promise or agreement upon which such action may be brought ... shall be in writing, and signed by the party to be charged therewith ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-3-1\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 15-3-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (Rev. 2015). Latham argues that Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan's alleged verbal partnership agreement to purchase the property in Sunflower County was a contract for the sale of lands and consequently barred by the statute of frauds. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 41. Under the Mississippi Uniform Partnership Act, Mississippi Code Annotated section 79-13-101(9) (Supp. 2015), a partnership agreement is defined as an \"agreement, whether written, oral or implied, among the partners concerning the partnership, including amendments to the partnership agreement.\" Here, Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan assert that the parties formed their partnership for the purpose of investing in land for a profit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   While the partnership may have been formed for the purpose of buying and selling land, the verbal partnership agreement to purchase, improve, and sale the property for profit does not constitute a contract for the sale of lands within the statute of frauds. The plaintiffs' claims do not involve a dispute over a contract for the sale of lands. Instead, the plaintiffs' claims involve a dispute over partnership profits and assets. Nothing in sections 15-3-1(c) or 79-13-101(9) suggest that an otherwise enforceable verbal partnership agreement constitutes a contract for the sale of lands under the statute of frauds simply because the purpose of the partnership includes the purchase of real estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 42. We find no merit to this issue. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    D. Accounting\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 43. Latham next argues the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan's damages claim since an accounting was never ordered or completed. However, under Mississippi Code Annotated section 79-13-405(b)(1)-(2) (Rev. 2013), an accounting is not required before a partner may assert a claim against another partner to enforce the partner's rights under the partnership agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 44. Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan filed an action to enforce their rights under the partnership agreement, including their right to an equal share of the partnership profits, to information concerning the partnership's business and affairs, and to compel Latham to abide by his fiduciary duties and duties of care to the partnership and his partners. As an accounting was not required under section 79-13-405(b), Latham's argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    E. Discovery Violation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 45. Latham next argues the circuit court abused its discretion and committed reversible error when it denied his ore tenus motion on the first day of trial to prohibit Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan from calling witnesses other than the parties due to an alleged discovery violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 46. \"[Circuit] courts have considerable discretion in discovery matters, and their decisions will not be overturned unless there is an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Beck v. Sapet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8947814\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/937/945/#p948\">\n    937 So.2d 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 948 (\u00b6 6) (Miss. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 47. According to Latham, the circuit court should not have allowed the witnesses to testify since Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan did not supplement their response to an interrogatory before trial, requesting them to identify every person they intended to call as a witness at trial. However, as the circuit court properly noted, Latham was not prejudiced by this failure to supplement discovery as \"the list of potential witnesses for this trial was exchanged [in a pretrial order] as early as August [2014].\" Thus, Latham was aware of the individuals whom Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan intended to call as witnesses long before his ore tenus motion was made at trial. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the circuit court's denial of Latham's ore tenus motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    F. Deposition Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 48. Latham further argues the circuit court erred when it allowed Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan's trial counsel to impeach Latham with a transcript of Latham's deposition testimony from his divorce proceeding. \"The admission of deposition testimony is within the sound discretion of the [circuit] court.\"\n   <em>\n    Figueroa v. Orleans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7037136\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/42/49/#p52\">\n    42 So.3d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52 (\u00b6 8) (Miss. Ct.

The pretrial order expressly excluded \"exhibits to be used for impeachment only.\" Moreover, it is undisputed that Johnson, Robinson, and Trahan did not obtain a copy of Latham's deposition transcript until three days before trial.

The circuit court noted that although one could reasonably assume that one of the four shares was Latham's, clarification was nonetheless needed. As a result, the circuit court sent a note to the jury, which stated: \"Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury: There are three Plaintiffs. You have presented a verdict which calls for division of $235,136.32 by 4. Please clarify your decision.\" The jury subsequently responded, \"Sale of Land Minus Payout of Loan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 57. The circuit court then brought the jury in and explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   The note that I sent explained that there are three plaintiffs in this case and that the verdict that you brought out initially called for a sum of money to be divided by four which creates confusion as to what your actual verdict is, what the number is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   In response you sent out this note which says, the sale of the land minus the payoff of the loan.

After the jury left the courtroom, Latham's counsel moved for a mistrial and argued that the jury \"did not know what its verdict [wa]s\" and should not be allowed to \"keep going back to the jury room to try and figure it out.\" The circuit court reserved ruling on the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 59.

Thus, the jury's final verdict of $176,352.24 was consistent with the original verdict, which provided \"damages at $235,136.32 \u00f7 4 = 58,784.08 equal payment.\" Accordingly, despite the alleged \"confusion,\" the jury was able to \"rationally come to a decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 63. Pursuant to Rule 3.12 of the Uniform Rules of Circuit and County Court Practice, the circuit court may declare a mistrial if \"there occurs during the trial, ... misconduct by the party, the party's attorney, or someone acting at the behest of the party or the party's attorney, resulting in substantial and irreparable prejudice to the movant's case.\" Additionally, under Rule 3.12, the circuit court may grant a mistrial if: \"(1) [t]he trial cannot proceed in conformity with law; or (2) [i]t appears there is no reasonable probability of the jury's agreement upon a verdict.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 64. Here, there is no evidence of misconduct by a party, a party's attorney, or someone at the behest of the party or party's attorney during trial which resulted in substantial and irreparable prejudice to Latham. Moreover, there is no evidence that the trial was unable to proceed in\n   conformity with the law and, as the record shows, the jury was able to agree upon a verdict. Thus, Latham failed to provide evidence that a mistrial was warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 65.

Trahan testified that he disclosed his interest in the property to the IRS and that the lien-issue was subsequently resolved. Trahan denied Latham's claim that he was \"seeking to fraudulently avoid the IRS tax lien.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 78. Additionally, Johnson testified he did not want to put his name on the deed since he was having marital issues and \"didn't want to tie [the] partnership up in a divorce proceeding.\" On cross-examination, Johnson testified that he \"guessed\" he was \"trying to defraud\" his wife by not putting the property in his name.

I therefore must disagree with the majority. The circuit court properly noted that \"[liquidated damages] were not set forth in the alleged partnership agreement itself ....\" And because there is neither a liquidated damages provision nor a contract with which to provide context, this common-law legal term of art should not\n   be made applicable to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u00b6 109. Courts may also award prejudgment interest in cases in which there is a frivolous or bad faith denial of a claim.\n   <em>\n    Moeller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9434924\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/812/953/#p959\">\n    812 So.2d at 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 31). The majority states that there was \"no bona fide dispute regarding the amount of damages.\" However, in its opinion, the circuit court identifies three genuine disputes: \"(1) the existence of a partnership agreement; (2) whether Latham breached the alleged partnership agreement; and (3) the amount of damages.\" The circuit court also found that the denial of the claim was not made in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u00b6 110. When there are no liquidated damages and there was no bad faith denial of a claim, then courts consider a trial court's decision on prejudgment interest to be discretionary.\n   <em>\n    Upchurch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8357436\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/964/1100/#p1117\">\n    964 So.2d at 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 15).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, I am inclined to conclude that the trial court was guided by sound legal principles in denying prejudgment interest. Accordingly, I cannot agree with the majority's conclusion that the trial court was obligated to award prejudgment interest. I would, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court in toto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   CARLTON AND TINDELL, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Upchurch\n    </em>\n    , the trial court's decision on prejudgment interest was based on Mississippi Code Annotated section 75-17-7 (Rev. 2000), which continues to state, \"[a]ll other judgments or decrees shall bear interest at a per annum rate set by the judge hearing the complaint from a date determined by such judge to be fair but in no event prior to the filing of the complaint.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
