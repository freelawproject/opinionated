On appeal, Plaintiffs-Appellants argue that the trial erred in granting summary judgment because there existed a genuine issue of material fact making summary judgment improper. They further allege that in granting summary judgment, the trial court incorrectly applied the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    force majeure\n   </em>\n   . For the reasons that follow, we reverse the trial court's granting of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 1, 2015, Plaintiffs-Appellants Karen Guy (\"Ms. Guy\"), Steven Guy (\"Mr. Guy\"), and their dependent, Zak Guy (collectively \"Appellants\") visited Spanish Plaza, which is adjacent to the Mississippi River and the New Orleans Riverwalk. While there, it began to rain and Appellants took refuge from the weather under a kiosk/display cart. A tent collapsed onto the kiosk/display cart under which Appellants were standing, pinning and injuring Ms. Guy. As a result, Ms. Guy suffered an amputated finger, cognitive defects, mental anguish associated with an amputated finger, and an inability to play the piano, which is her trade; Mr. Guy and\n   their dependent son suffered mental and emotional injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellants filed a petition for damages against Defendants-Appellees Riverwalk Marketplace, L.L.C., and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, alleging that Defendant-Appellees' negligence caused Ms. Guy's injuries. Following discovery, Appellants amended their petition for damages to name as defendants Scurlock Rentals, L.L.C., and Western Heritage Insurance Company (collectively, all of these parties are referred to as \"Appellees\"). Thereafter, Defendant, United States Fire Insurance Company, filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to dismiss all claims pursuant to the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    force majeure\n   </em>\n   ; all other Defendants joined the motion. In opposition to Defendants-Appellees' motion for summary judgment, Appellants provided the depositions of two (2) expert witnesses - meteorologist Edwin Roy and engineer Frederich W.L. Gurtler. On February 15, 2018, the trial court granted Appellees' motion for summary judgment, and dismissed Appellants' claims. It is from this judgment that Appellants now appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, Appellants raise the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1.

Mr. Roy opined that Appellees' failure to properly anchor or secure the carts, tents, and kiosks contributed to Appellants' injuries. Conversely, Appellees provided no evidence to negate the testimonial evidence offered by Appellants' expert witnesses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, we find that the trial court committed error when it granted summary judgment.
