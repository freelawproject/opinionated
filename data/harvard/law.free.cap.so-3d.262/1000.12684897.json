The trial court denied Appellant's motion for default judgment and dismissed his petition citing his failure to address any evidence in support of any of his claims made in his petition. For the following reasons, we vacate the trial court's judgment dismissing Appellant's petition and remand this matter for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter arises out of a child support obligation imposed upon Appellant in support of his minor female child with whom he avers Appellees have prevented him from interacting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 30, 2017, Appellant filed a\n   <em>\n    Petition to Stop the Extortion and Fraud\n   </em>\n   with the Twenty-Ninth Judicial District Court. Defendants/Appellees, Ms. Ebony Wright Alexander (Ms. Wright)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Mr.\n   Frank \"Nitti\" Alexander, failed to answer Appellant's petition; thus, Appellant filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion on the Pleadings\n   </em>\n   on July 31, 2017. The trial court issued an order denying Appellant's motion on August 3, 2017. In its denial, the trial court suggested that Appellant seek legal counsel or self-remedy errors contained in his motion. The trial court further encouraged Appellant to review the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure's provisions concerning service of process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 21, 2017, Appellant submitted a\n   <em>\n    Request of Service\n   </em>\n   with the St. Charles Parish Clerk of Court upon Appellees. On November 9, 2017, Appellant re-filed his\n   <em>\n    Motion on the Pleadings\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   with the trial court, which set a hearing to show cause for January 22, 2018. On the 19\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   of January, Ms. Wright submitted a handwritten letter to the trial court requesting a continuance due to work hardship. Appellant objected to the continuance at the January 22\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   hearing, and the court proceeded with the hearing on Appellant's motion. In a judgment rendered January 23, 2018, the trial court denied Appellant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, citing Appellees' failure to provide an answer to Appellant's petition as a barrier to Appellant's ability to pursue a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Through its written\n   <em>\n    Reasons for Judgment\n   </em>\n   , the trial court informed Appellant that the only viable recourse available to him was a Preliminary Default and default judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant filed a Motion for Preliminary Default Judgment which was filed stamped by the Clerk's office on March 6, 2018. However, on February 23, 2018, the trial court entered a preliminary default in favor of Appellant and scheduled a hearing to show cause for April 6, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Three days prior to the scheduled April 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing, Appellee, Ms. Wright, submitted a second, hand-written letter to the court requesting a continuance. The court denied Ms. Wright's request and on April 6, 2018, the trial court allowed Appellant to present evidence in support of his\n   <em>\n    Petition to Stop the Extortion and Fraud\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 11, 2018, the trial court issued both a judgment and its written\n   <em>\n    Reasons for Judgment\n   </em>\n   as to Appellant's\n   <em>\n    Petition to Stop the Extortion and Fraud\n   </em>\n   . Within its reasons, the trial court outlined seven areas in which it believed Appellant sought relief and addressed each area in turn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After its review of the record, the trial court held that Appellant failed to meet his burden of proof on every claim for relief; therefore, the court denied his\n   <em>\n    Motion for Preliminary Default Judgment\n   </em>\n   and dismissed his petition with prejudice and at his cost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Default Judgment\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This case is before us on review of the trial court's denial of Appellant's motion for default judgment and dismissal of Appellant's\n   <em>\n    Petition to Stop the Extortion and Fraud\n   </em>\n   with prejudice upon finding that Appellant failed to establish a prima facie case to support his request for a judgment of default. An appellate court's review of a judgment of default is generally governed by the manifest error standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Arias v.

A judgment of default may be entered against a properly served defendant who fails to answer or file other pleadings within the time prescribed by law or the court. La. C.C.P. art. 1701. A judgment of default is sometimes referred to as a \"preliminary default.\"\n   <em>\n    ASI Fed. Credit Union v. Leotran Armored Sec., LLC\n   </em>\n   , 18-341 (La.

La. C.C.P. art. 1702(A). A prima facie case must be established with competent evidence, as fully as though each of the allegations in the petition were denied by the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Apex Realty, LLC v.

The proof of the demand required by the Code of Civil Procedure is dependent upon the nature of the obligation (i.e., whether it is conventional or delictual). La. C.C.P. art. 1702(B). When a demand is based on a delictual obligation, as in the present case, plaintiff's testimony may be supplemented with corroborating evidence such as affidavits and exhibits. La. C.C.P. art. 1702(B)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    Arias\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7064606\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/9/815/#p818\">\n    9 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   822 n. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thus, to seek the confirmation of a judgment of default, \"the plaintiff must present competent evidence that convinces the court that it is probable that he would prevail at trial on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Arias\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7064606\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/9/815/#p818\">\n    9 So.3d at 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The standard of review for a trial court's evidentiary ruling is abuse of discretion, meaning the trial court's ruling will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    Gorman v. Miller\n   </em>\n   , 12-0412 (La. App. 1 Cir. 11/13/13),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6963125\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/136/834/#p840\">\n    136 So.3d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 840.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After an in-depth review of the record, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Appellant failed to meet his burden of proving a prima facie case against defendants. Specifically, the trial court found that Appellant failed to submit any tangible, documented evidence during the April 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing to corroborate his testimony and the allegations made in his petition. For example, Appellant alleges in his petition that he made several attempts to contact the daughter he shares with Ms. Wright\n   but was prevented from speaking with her because of the actions of the Appellees; yet, Appellant failed to produce phone logs evidencing his attempts to contact his daughter and his subsequent discussions with Appellee, Mr. Frank Alexander. Further, Appellant failed to produce any affidavits from individuals who may have witnessed the threats and harassment he alleges he endured from Appellees. Finally, Appellant failed to produce documentation evidencing Appellees' use of Appellant's daughter, and his desire to interact with her, as a means to obtain money from him. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant's motion for preliminary default. However, for the reasons discussed below, we find that the trial court erred in dismissing Appellant's\n   <em>\n    Petition to Stop the Extortion and Fraud\n   </em>\n   with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Dismissal of Appellant's Petition\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A trial court may not dismiss a lawsuit with prejudice at a hearing to confirm a default judgment.\n   <em>\n    Dahan Novelties &amp; Co., LLC v.

The Code further sets forth the grounds for voluntary and involuntary dismissal of a demand. In article 1671 of the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure, a plaintiff is allowed to dismiss his or her own demand without prejudice when he or she has paid costs associated with his or her claim and the defendant has not yet appeared.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is referred to as a voluntary dismissal. However, an involuntary dismissal may occur at the application of any\n   party or by the court, on its own motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.

However, we find that the trial court erred when it dismissed, with prejudice, \"any and all claims brought\" by Appellant against Appellees. In doing so, the trial court dismissed Appellant's demand based on his failure to produce sufficient evidence to warrant a default judgment during a hearing to show cause; thus exceeding his authority to dismiss the lawsuit as this right has been reserved by the legislature for parties who appear before the court.
