Prior to the accident, David Hernandez was at the home of his aunt, Maritza Hernandez, and her husband, Mauricio Bendeck, who owned the van. At the time of the accident, David Hernandez did not have permission to operate the van.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 27, 2015, Geovera filed a petition for damages as subrogee of the Johnsons against Rosa Hernandez,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking reimbursement for the amounts paid under Geovera's homeowner's policy issued to the Johnsons. The petition alleged a claim of negligent entrustment. On August 6, 2015, Geovera filed an amended petition adding David Hernandez as a party to the suit. On October 15, 2015, a second amended petition was filed by Geovera adding Allstate as a defendant. The second amended petition alleged that Allstate is liable to Geovera pursuant to the following policies of insurance issued by Allstate: an automobile insurance policy providing coverage to Rosa Hernandez, a homeowner's insurance policy issued to Rosa Hernandez, and an automobile insurance policy for the vehicle driven by David Hernandez.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 9, 2016, Allstate, as the homeowner's insurer for Jose S. and Rosa\n   Hernandez,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the homeowner's policy in question excludes coverage for property damage arising out of \"the ownership, maintenance,\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   , occupancy, renting, loaning, entrusting, loading or unloading\n   <em>\n    of any motor vehicle\n   </em>\n   or trailer.\" (Emphasis added.) Allstate argued that the property damages Geovera alleges it paid under its policy of homeowner's insurance arose from David Hernandez's unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, and thus the Allstate homeowner's policy expressly excludes Geovera's claims for damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In opposition, Geovera argued that Allstate wrote and issued both automobile and homeowners policies to Jose S. and Rosa Hernandez. Geovera showed that the automobile policy covers permissive use and excludes \"use\" without permission. Geovera reasoned that because of this, it would be reasonable that the automobile exclusion in the homeowner's policy only included permissive \"use\" otherwise covered under the auto policy. If it didn't, Geovera argued, then there would be a gap in coverage,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , there would be no coverage at all under either policy for non-permissive use of the vehicle. Geovera contended that the term \"use\" in the homeowner's policy could be construed as providing coverage for use with permission, use without permission, or both. Geovera argued that this renders the term \"use\" ambiguous, and thus, the policy should be construed in favor of the insured so as to provide coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following a hearing on March 8, 2017, the trial court issued a judgment on April 21, 2017 granting Allstate's motion for summary judgment and dismissing the claims against it regarding the homeowner's policy in question with prejudice. In its written reasons for judgment, the trial court found that the term \"use\" in the homeowner's policy was not ambiguous. The trial court found that the word \"use\" in the homeowner's policy is \"reasonably understood as the operation of a vehicle and no differentiation between use with and without permission is warranted given the plain meaning of the policy.\" Having found the insurance policy unambiguous, the trial court noted that it did not consider the wording of the automobile policy, as such is extrinsic evidence not contained within the body of the homeowner's policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW AND ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A motion for summary judgment is a procedural device used to avoid a full scale trial when there is no genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    Pouncy v.

Geovera asserts that since the automobile policy issued by Allstate provides coverage only if there is a \"use\" with permission, the term \"use\" in the automobile exclusion in the homeowner's policy should be likewise construed such that non-authorized use of a non-owned vehicle would be covered. According to Geovera, if found otherwise, there would be a gap in the coverage provided by both policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Allstate homeowner's policy in question provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     General\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Definitions Used In This Policy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1. \"You\" or \"your\" - means the person named on the Policy Declarations as the insured and that person's resident spouse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   2. \"Allstate\" \"we\" \"us\" or \"our\" - means the company named on the Policy Declarations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   3. \"Insured person(s)\" - means you and, if a resident of your household:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   a) any relative; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   b) any dependent person in your care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Under Coverage X-Family Liability Protection and Coverage Y-Guest Medical Protection, \"insured person\" also means:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   c) any person or organization legally responsible for loss caused by animals or watercraft covered by this policy which are owned by an insured person.

(Emphasis added.) However, this exclusion does not apply to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [The enumerated exceptions to the exclusion are not pertinent herein.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Upon\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, we find that the term \"use\" in the subject homeowner's policy is unambiguous and should be applied as written. The automobile exclusion of the homeowner's policy functions to broadly exclude coverage for bodily injury and property damage \"arising out of the ... use ... of any motor vehicle.\" The policy is not made ambiguous simply because Allstate did not specify if the \"use\" of any motor vehicle is with or without permission. This limitation of \"use\" does not conflict with any statutory provisions or public policy and therefore is enforceable as written.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Geovera relies heavily on the argument that because Allstate also issued an automobile policy that excluded coverage for \"use\" of a vehicle without permission, then the term \"use\" of a motor vehicle in the automobile exclusion of the homeowner's policy should be construed to only exclude \"use\" of a vehicle with permission. Otherwise, it argues, there would be a gap in the coverage provided by both policies. We find, however, after being able to simply construe the homeowner's policy based on the language of the policy, we need not consider any extrinsic evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doerr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11159977\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/119/\">\n    774 So.2d at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the terms of the Allstate automobile policy are not considered in this analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   David Hernandez was a resident of Jose S. and Rosa Hernandez's household, and thus was an \"insured person\" under the policy. It is undisputed, as alleged in Geovera's petition, that David Hernandez was driving the vehicle when he lost control and crashed into the Johnsons' home. The Louisiana Supreme Court found in\n   <em>\n    Edwards v. Horstman\n   </em>\n   , 96-1403 (La. 2/25/97),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7444095\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/687/1007/#p1012\">\n    687 So.2d 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1012, for conduct to constitute \"use\" of an automobile, that conduct must be essential to the defendant's liability and the specific duty breached by the insured must flow from the use of the automobile. Here, it is undisputed that David Hernandez's use of the automobile resulted in the property damage to the Johnsons' home. His use of the vehicle was an essential element of the case, and a duty was breached by his failure to operate the vehicle in a prudent manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In conclusion, we find that Allstate met its burden of proving that the claims brought by Geovera fall within the automobile exclusion of the subject homeowner's policy, and thus, the trial court properly granted Allstate's motion for summary judgment. Considering the foregoing, we find that no genuine issue of material fact remains and that Allstate is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Geovera's arguments on appeal are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the trial court's judgment granting Allstate's motion for summary judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     AFFIRMED\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Although the judgment under review was granted in favor of \"Allstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company,\" the record reflects that the motion for summary judgment in question was actually filed by \"Allstate Indemnity Company.\" All of the various Allstate entities named and identified in various places in the record will simply be referred to herein as \"Allstate.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The petition erroneously named Rosa Hernandez as David Hernandez's grandmother and owner of the van.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    A suit was also filed by the Johnsons against Rosa Hernandez, Maritza Hernandez, and Allstate.
