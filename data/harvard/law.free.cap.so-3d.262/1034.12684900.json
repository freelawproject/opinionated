(the \"Wood Companies\"), and dismissing the City's reconventional demand seeking to enforce an alleged \"use violation\" against the Wood Companies with prejudice. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This litigation involves the commercial composting activities of the Wood Companies, who operate a composting facility located in the Non-Urban Batture District (the \"Batture\"), which is situated within the City's corporate limits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The facts in this matter are not in dispute. Since the 1960's, the Wood Companies have been involved in various activities at their industrial materials facility located on the Batture of the Mississippi River. Specifically, between the hours of 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., the Wood Companies perform dredging, excavating and selling of sand, mooring, and towing out of its facility within the Batture. In particular, the Wood Companies have been engaged in composting activities on their property since 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 19, 2011, the East Jefferson Levee District issued a construction permit to the Wood Companies for the construction of an \"organic soil composting site\" within the Batture. The operating permit, also issued on December 19, 2011 for the calendar year 2012, contained a \"[d]escription of [p]ermitted [a]ctivity\" that included \"[c]onstruction and operation of sandpits and limestone stockpiles &amp; organic soil composting.\" The operating permits subsequently issued to the Wood Companies for the calendar years 2013 through 2016 also describe composting activity as a permitted activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August 2012, the Wood Companies were hired by the City to store, grind, and dispose of trees and other organic debris left behind in the City following Hurricane Isaac. In order to fulfill its obligations under the contract, the Wood Companies collected and composted the hurricane debris at its facilities located within the Batture. In October 2012, the City paid the Wood Companies $23,413.00 for the composting work they performed pursuant to the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 9, 2016, the Wood Companies filed a declaratory judgment action against\n   the City with regard to the validity of Proposed Ordinance No. 2016-3. The Proposed Ordinance would, among other things, amend section XV of the City Zoning Ordinance (\"CZO\") to remove \"barge mooring and holding facilities\" from the permitted uses for the Batture and impose an hours-of-operation restriction. Specifically, the Wood Companies sought a declaration that its composting operations within the Batture constituted a nonconforming use in accordance with La. R.S. 9:5625, and that any attempt to hold the Wood Companies in violation of the CZO is prescribed by La. R.S. 9:5625(C) and the grandfather provision found in La. R.S. 9:5625(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The City responded by filing a reconventional demand, which sought a declaration that the Wood Companies' operation of a composting facility within the Batture is prohibited by the CZO, and which sought injunctive relief enjoining the Wood Companies from continuing to operate the composting facility. In response to the City's reconventional demand, the Wood Companies raised the exception of prescription. Specifically, the Wood Companies argued that, based upon the City's concession that it had written notice of the Wood Companies' composting activities, that are now alleged to be violations of zoning and use regulations, no later than February 15, 2012, more than three years prior to filing suit on July 21, 2016, the City's right to enforce any alleged violation of the CZO regarding their composting operations had prescribed pursuant to La. R.S. 9:5625(C), which establishes a three-year prescriptive period for public instrumentalities within Jefferson Parish, including the City of Harahan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In opposition, the City argued that La. R.S. 9:5625(A)(3) -not La. R.S. 9:5625(C) -was the applicable provision for actions challenging zoning use regulation violations. Pursuant to La. R.S. 9:5625(A)(3), all municipalities (except the Parish of Orleans, the City of New Orleans and East Baton Rouge Parish) have five years from the date on which the municipality was first actually notified in writing of such violation in which to bring an action. Consequently, the City averred that its action against the Wood Companies had not prescribed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Wood Companies' exception came for hearing on April 25, 2018. At the close of the hearing, the trial court took the matter under advisement. Thereafter, on May 4, 2018, the trial court issued judgment, with written reasons, maintaining the Wood Companies' exception and dismissing the City's reconventional demand against the Wood Companies with prejudice. The trial court determined that the City had actual notice in writing of the Wood Companies' alleged violation no later than October 2012, and, thus, under La. R.S. 9:5625(C), the City's suit brought more than three years later was prescribed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   It is from this judgment that the City timely filed the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, the City avers that the trial court erred: (1) in its interpretation of La. R.S. 9:5625 in concluding that the enforcement provisions set forth in La. R.S. 9:5625(C) apply to the City of Harahan; and (2) in failing to find that the five-year prescriptive period found in La. R.S. 9:5625(A)(3) controls this action, which period commenced from the date upon which the City's zoning authority received actual notice in writing of the Wood Companies' violation of the CZO's use regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review and Statutory Construction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The issues in this case turn on the proper interpretation of La. R.S. 9:5625.

Legislation is the solemn expression of legislative will and, thus, the interpretation of legislation is primarily the search for the legislative intent. We have often noted the paramount consideration in statutory interpretation is ascertainment of the legislative intent and the reason or reasons which prompted the Legislature to enact the law. The starting point in the interpretation of any statute is the language of the statute itself. When a law is clear and unambiguous and its application does not lead to absurd consequences, the law shall be applied as written and no further interpretation may be made in search of the intent of the [L]egislature. However, when the language of the law is susceptible of different meanings, it must be interpreted as having the meaning that best conforms to the purpose of the law. Moreover, when the words of a law are ambiguous, their meaning must be sought by examining the context in which they occur and the text of the law as a whole. Further, the legislature is presumed to act with full knowledge of well-settled principles of statutory construction.

R.S. 9:5625\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The City argues that the trial court committed legal error in applying the three-year prescriptive period set forth in subsection (C) of La. R.S. 9:5625 to the City's enforcement action against the Wood Companies for its violation of one of the City's use regulations. Specifically, the City argues that the five-year prescriptive period for the violation of a use regulation found in subsection (A)(3), governs the City's enforcement action against the Wood Companies, not subsection (C). The City further contends the record is devoid of any evidence that it had actual written notice of the Wood Companies' violation of the City's zoning ordinance use regulations at any time prior to July 25, 2011. Because this date is within five years of the date the City filed suit on July 25, 2016 to enjoin the composting activity, the City contends its action against the Wood Companies to enforce the alleged nonconforming use violation was timely, and therefore, not prescribed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In contrast, the Wood Companies aver, and the trial court agreed, that with respect to enforcement actions challenging violations of a zoning restriction, building restriction, subdivision regulation or use regulation, all political subdivisions that are located within the Parish of Jefferson, including the City of Harahan, are subject to the prescriptive periods set forth in subsection (C), rather than the prescriptive period contained in subsection A(3). With respect to enforcement actions challenging the violation of a use regulation, in particular, the Wood Companies argue that subsection (C) provides a three-year prescriptive period, which commences upon receipt of actual notice in writing of the violation. Because the City conceded that it had actual notice in writing of the Wood Companies' composting activities no later than October 2012, the Wood Companies argue that the instant suit filed by the City against them in July 2016 is prescribed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Based upon our reading of La. R.S. 9:5625 in its entirety, specifically when reading subsections (A)(3) and (C) together, we find that the language is susceptible of different meanings. Consequently, we turn to the statute's legislative history in order to ascertain the Legislature's intent and purpose in enacting these provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benjamin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7000073\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/113/197/#p201\">\n    113 So.3d at 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    Legislative History of La.

R.S. 9:5625(C) applied to any parish entity, any municipal entity, or their instrumentalities, located within Jefferson Parish,\n   <em>\n    which included the City of Harahan\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Accordingly, following the 1993 amendment to La. R.S. 9:5625 enacting subsection (C), we find that any enforcement action that involved the violation of a zoning restriction, building restriction, or subdivision regulation occurring within the Parish of Jefferson, including the City of Harahan-whether the restriction and/or regulation violated was created by the City or the parish-at-large-had to be brought within three years from the date written notice of the violation was received and no later than five years \"from the first act constituting the commission of the violation.\" And with respect to enforcement actions involving the violation of a use regulation, we find that La. R.S. 9:5625(C), as enacted in 1993, required the City, by virtue of its being located within a parish whose population exceeded 325,000, to institute such an action within three years from the date it received actual notice in writing of the violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    2. 2011 Amendments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In 2011, following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and the resulting shift in populations occurring in particular areas of the State as reflected in the 2010 U.S. census, Senate Bill 9 was introduced into the Legislature to amend certain provisions within Title 9 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes (including subsections (C), (D) and (F) of La. R.S. 9:5625 ), which were \"limited in applicability to certain political subdivisions or local areas based upon population classifications[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the preface of Senate Bill No. 9, the act, entitled \"Census[,]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   was intended \"to specify applicability to one or more political subdivisions or local areas[ ]\" and \"\n   <em>\n    to adjust population categories to retain applicability\n   </em>\n   [.]\" [Emphasis supplied.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   With respect to the Legislature's amendment to La. R.S. 9:5625(C), in particular, the 2011 amendment removed the statute's prior reference regarding its applicability based upon a population threshold of 325,000, and replaced the numerical reference with the particular parishes affected; namely, East Baton Rouge Parish and Jefferson Parish. The table attached to Senate Bill No. 9, Engrossed, suggests to us that the Legislature intended for La. R.S. 9:5625(C), as amended, to apply to the entirety of East Baton Rouge and Jefferson Parishes, as the two identified \"affected locations[,]\" including all political subdivisions located within those parishes, rather than solely to the parishes-at-large or specific governmental instrumentalities as posited by the City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Our review of the legislative history for La. R.S. 9:5625(C) convinces us that\n   the Legislature's intent in amending subsection (C) was to retain and/or continue the applicability of La. R.S. 9:5625(C) to all of Jefferson Parish, including the City of Harahan. We glean nothing in the statute's legislative history that supports the City's contention that the 2011 amendment sought to alter or impose a more restrictive prescriptive period applicable only to Jefferson Parish or its \"instrumentalities,\" and a less restrictive prescriptive period applicable to the municipalities located within Jefferson Parish. In this regard, we agree with the Wood Companies that \"it is simply not logical to interpret the amendment to reduce the applicability of [La. R.S.] 9:5625(C) contrary to the [L]egislature's stated intent to 'retain applicability.' That intent can only be to have [La. R.S.] 9:5625(C) apply throughout Jefferson and East Baton Rouge Parishes\" as it did prior to the 2011 amendment. In short, we find that the Legislature did not intend to alter the scope of La. R.S. 9:5625 in 2011 when it amended the statute; rather, the Legislature merely intended to update the specified reach of La. R.S. 9:5625(C) by specifically naming the affected parishes and retaining applicability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    Applicability of La. R.S. 9:5625(C) to the City of Harahan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The City argues that pursuant to La. R.S. 9:5625, as amended in 2011, subsection (A)(3), not subsection (C), which applies to the Parish of Jefferson \"or [its] instrumentalities,\" governs the applicable prescriptive period for its enforcement action against the Wood Companies because the City is an \"instrumentality\" of the State, not of Jefferson Parish. According to the City, subsection (C), as amended, applies only to zoning restriction violations enacted by the Jefferson Parish government and does not apply to zoning restriction violations enacted by the municipalities or other governmental entities situated within Jefferson Parish, which the City claims are governed by La. R.S. 9:5625(A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We find no merit to the City's argument. The language of La. R.S. 9:5625(C) states that its provisions \"shall be applicable only to the Parishes of East Baton Rouge and Jefferson\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   their instrumentalities.\" [Emphasis supplied.] Clearly, the City of Harahan is located within Jefferson Parish and, as such, relying upon the statute's legislative history, we find subsection (C) applies to all political subdivisions within Jefferson Parish, including the City of Harahan. To apply a literal interpretation of the 2011 amendment to subsection (C) as the City urges (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to distinguish the larger political subdivision, Jefferson Parish, from the smaller political subdivisions located within it, including \"municipalities,\" \"agencies\" and \"instrumentalities\"), would lead to an absurd result, and would be tantamount to concluding that the Legislature intended for the City, and other political subdivisions within Jefferson Parish, to enjoy a greater latitude in enforcing its restrictive zoning laws than the parish-at-large. This argument is simply not supported by the statute's legislative history, nor does the City cite any legal authority to support its position. In fact, the City's argument is actually contrary to the Legislature's stated intention \"to retain applicability,\"\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to restrict or expand it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Accordingly, we find the trial court did not legally err in concluding that the City of Harahan is subject to the prescriptive periods governing enforcement actions as set forth in La. R.S. 9:5625(C), as amended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Applicability of La. R.S. 9:5625(C) to \"Use Violations\" Occurring Within Jefferson Parish\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Now that we have established that the City is subject to the enforcement provisions\n   of La. R.S. 9:5625(C), we turn to the City's argument that La. R.S. 9:5625(C) does not apply\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   to violations of use regulations, except for \"use violations\" occurring in East Baton Rouge Parish.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the City, enforcement actions for use violations occurring in every other parish of the State, including Jefferson Parish, are subject solely to the provisions of La. R.S. 9:5625(A)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the City posits that La. R.S. 9:5625 distinguishes those actions involving zoning restrictions, building restrictions, and subdivision regulations from those actions involving use regulations. In this regard, the City argues that La. R.S. 9:5625 mandates a five-year prescriptive period applicable to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   use violations occurring in every parish throughout the State (except the Parish of Orleans and the City of New Orleans); the only distinction between use violations occurring in East Baton Rouge Parish and those occurring in all other parishes being the date upon which the five-year period begins to run. For use violations occurring in East Baton Rouge Parish, the five-year prescriptive period commences from the date of the \"first act\" constituting the use violation, whereas for use violations occurring in every other parish of the State (except the Parish of Orleans and the City of New Orleans), including the Parish of Jefferson, the five-year prescriptive period commences from the date upon which the parish first had actual notice of the use violation in writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Moreover, the City argues that the three-year prescriptive period found in La. R.S. 9:5625(C) applies\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to actions seeking to enforce a \"zoning restriction, building restriction, or subdivision regulation\" where actual notice in writing of a violation is received, and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to enforcement actions for use violations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the City, the express language of subsection (C) excepts \"use violations\" from its effect. Specifically, the City posits that after establishing the three-year prescriptive period for actions involving actual notice in writing of a violation of a \"zoning restriction, building restriction, or subdivision regulation,\" subsection (C) then provides that \"... and except for violations of use regulations, all such actions ... must be brought within five years from the date of the first act constituting the commission of\n   the violation.\" The City maintains that subsection (C)'s exception for actions involving use violations occurring in Jefferson Parish actually \"conforms\" subsection (C) to subsection (A)(3) such that, the five-year prescriptive period for violations of use regulations occurring in\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   parishes (except East Baton Rouge Parish, the Parish of Orleans and the City of New Orleans), commences to run from the date actual notice in writing of the violation is received. Because \"actual notice\" of a violation of a use regulation is what is required by La. R.S. 9:5625(A)(3), the City contends that use violations were excepted from the \"three year actual notice/five year first act\" rule established in subsection (C) for the Parishes of East Baton Rouge and Jefferson \"so that there is no confusion.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We find that the City's interpretation of La. R.S. 9:5625 -that enforcement actions for violations of use regulations are not covered\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   by La. R.S.9:5625(C), except for use violations occurring within the Parish of East Baton Rouge (and the Parish of Orleans and the City of New Orleans)-is inaccurate; therefore, we reject it. As it relates to Jefferson Parish, our interpretation of the statute leads us to conclude that the second sentence of subsection (C), when read in its entirety, provides a three-year prescriptive period for all enforcement actions challenging zoning restrictions, building restrictions, subdivision regulations or use regulations commencing from the date of actual notice in writing, and a five-year peremptive period for these actions,\n   <em>\n    except for violations of use regulations\n   </em>\n   , commencing from the date of the first act constituting the violation. In short, we conclude that subsection (C) excepts enforcement actions for the violation of a use regulation occurring in Jefferson Parish from the scope of the five-year preemptive period, thereby maintaining both the three-year prescriptive period and the requirement for written notice for actions involving a use violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Further, we find that there would have been no reason for the Legislature to specifically include the exception for \"use violations\" within subsection (C) if it did not intend for subsection (C) to apply to use violations\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   . In this regard, we find the City's interpretation,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    that\n    <strong>\n     all\n    </strong>\n    use regulations are subject to the five-year prescriptive period found in subsection (A)(3)\n   </em>\n   , renders the reference within subsection (C) excepting violations of use regulations meaningless. Moreover, had the Legislature intended for the excepted actions to be governed by the five-year prescriptive period in subsection (A)(3), and not the three-year prescriptive period in subsection (C), it could have stated as such directly within subsection (C). It did not do so. This omission leads us to conclude, therefore, that it was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the Legislature's intent for enforcement actions involving use violations occurring within Jefferson Parish, including the City of Harahan, to be governed by the prescriptive period found in subsection (A)(3) as the City contends, but rather, the Legislature intended for subsection (C) to govern these actions. This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In sum, based upon our review of the legislative history of La. R.S. 9:5625, we conclude the trial court correctly determined that La. R.S. 9:5625(C) governs this action. We find that the Legislature intended for the enforcement provisions set forth in subsection (C) to apply to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   political subdivisions within Jefferson Parish, including municipalities such as the City of Harahan. Accordingly, we hold that any enforcement action by the City for the violation of a use regulation provided within its zoning ordinance and established through the authority granted to the City by the Legislature to enact zoning regulations,\n   is governed by La. R.S. 9:5625(C) and, thus, subject to a three-year prescriptive period commencing on the date actual notice in writing of a use violation is received by the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The record confirms, and the City concedes, that the City had written notice of the Wood Companies' composting activities no later than October 2012, when the City paid them $23,413.00 for completing work under a contract they had with the City to store, grind, and dispose of trees and other organic debris following Hurricane Isaac. The City did not file suit to enjoin the Wood Companies' composting activities until July 25, 2016. Thus, the City's right to enforce the Wood Companies' alleged use violation at issue herein was prescribed prior to the City's filing of its reconventional demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we find the trial court properly maintained the exception of prescription brought by Wood Materials, L.L.C. and Wood Resources, L.L.C., and in dismissing the City of Harahan's reconventional demand filed against them, with prejudice. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     AFFIRMED\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   DISSENTS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   JJM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   MOLAISON, J., DISSENTS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For the following reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority's decision to affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   This Court has previously recognized in\n   <em>\n    In re Declaratory Judgment For City of Harahan\n   </em>\n   , 01-928 (La.

The term \"municipality\" is defined in La.

However, my review of jurisprudence and various statutes leads me to conclude that the City of Harahan is not an \"instrumentality\" of Jefferson Parish in the same sense in which the term is commonly used in other circumstances. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Polk v.

These included: whether the entity was accountable to other branches of government \"through a system of audits, reports, and legislative oversight, and through financial disclosure,\" whether it could enter into a contract over a certain amount without authorization, and whether it could promulgate its own rules or regulations without legislative authority and publication of notice. Importantly, the court observed in relevant part, \"[p]olitical subdivisions, which include municipal and parish governments, are entrusted with the power of taxation and expropriation, and as\n   mentioned above, are not instrumentalities of the state.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 526.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   I am also guided by the framework for analysis used by the Louisiana Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Slowinski v.

The 2011 amendments deliberately struck references to \"municipalities\" in sections C, D, and F.

R.S. 9:5625(C) and (D) state that their provisions \"shall be applicable only to the parishes of East Baton Rouge and Jefferson or their instrumentalities.\" In accord with\n   <em>\n    Polk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Slowinski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , I decline to extend the definition of \"instrumentality\" to include an autonomous municipality within a parish. Further, I do not find that the exclusion of the City of Harahan from La. R.S. 9:5625(C) produces an \"absurd consequence\" which requires an interpretation of legislative intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Moreover, the analysis of the legislative history of La. R.S. 9:5625 in the majority opinion begins with the 1993 amendments, which added the three-year prescriptive period in Subsection (C) as an exception to the five-year prescriptive period in Subsection (A)(3). The first sentence of Subsection (C), as enacted in 1993, stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A, the following provisions shall be applicable only to any parish, municipality, or its instrumentality having a population over three hundred twenty-five thousand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As I read this language, the phrase \"having a population over three hundred twenty-five thousand\" modifies everything that comes before it, namely, \"any parish, municipality, or its instrumentality.\" The population of the City of Harahan has never exceeded 325,000. Based on a plain reading of the statutory language, which is clear on its face and is not ambiguous, the three-year prescriptive period in Subsection (C), as enacted in 1993, did not apply to the City of Harahan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The majority interprets the quoted portion of Subsection (C), as enacted in 1993, to mean that it was intended to apply to all forms of government, including municipalities, \"so long as they were situated within a parish whose population exceeded 325,000.\" This interpretation, which is not consistent with the language used by the legislature, forms the basis for the majority's conclusions that the City of Harahan was included in Subsection (C), as enacted in 1993, because it was located in Jefferson Parish, which had a population of over 325,000, and that the City of Harahan is still subject to the three-year prescriptive period in Subsection (C), rather than the five-year prescriptive period in Subsection (A)(3), because the legislature did not intend to alter the scope of law when it amended Subsection (C) in 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In my view, the City of Harahan did not meet the population threshold for placing it within the scope of Subsection (C), as enacted in 1993, and it was not brought within the scope of Subsection (C), as amended in 2011, because it is not an instrumentality of the parish. Accordingly, the prescriptive period of five years from the date the City had written notice of a use violation, as set forth in La. R.S. 9:5625(A)(3), should apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As noted by the majority, the underlying facts of this matter are not in dispute. Wood Companies' facility on the City of Harahan's river batture has been active since the 1960's, operating pursuant to the appropriate permits. The City concedes that it had written notice of the Wood Companies' composting activities no later than February 15, 2012. The City's original reconventional demand was subsequently filed on July 21, 2016. Here, because the City of Harahan is not an instrumentality\n   of Jefferson Parish, La. R.S. 9:5625(A)(3) instead applies to impose a prescriptive period of five years from the date the City had written notice of the violation, as opposed to the shorter three-year prescriptive period found in La. R.S. 9:5625(C). Thus, the City of Harahan's cause of action had not prescribed at the time its reconventional demand was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Accordingly, I would reverse the trial court's judgment in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The Batture is comprised of certain land within the municipal boundaries of the City, but outside the protective levees that separate much of the City from the Mississippi River.

In\n    <em>\n     Bordelon\n    </em>\n    , the Louisiana Supreme Court vacated a decision of this Court and held that a suit to enjoin a \"use regulation\" was prescribed under La.

Because the violation of the use regulation at issue occurred in St. Charles Parish-and\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    in East Baton Rouge Parish or Jefferson Parish, which are the only parishes subject to La.
