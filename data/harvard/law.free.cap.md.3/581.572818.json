That <em>Richard Hoddy, </em>the lessor of the plaintiff, before the commencement of this suit, married <em>Alary, </em>the daughter of the said <em>Robert Boyd </em>and <em>Ruth </em>his wife, and that the said <em>Hoddy </em>and wife live in the state of <em>Virginia ; </em>that the said <em>Robert Boyd </em>died in the same state six years past, and that the said <em>Ruth </em>his wife died about fifteen or sixteen years past.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>The defendant offered in evidence the grant of the tract of land called <em>Shaw\u2019s Fancy </em>to the said <em>Christopher Shaw ; </em>that the said <em>Shaw </em>died leaving two sons, <em>Thomas, </em>the eldest son, and <em>Christopher, </em>the youngest. The grant of the land called <em>Shaw\u2019s Delight </em>to the said <em>Christopher Shaw </em>the elder. That Christopher, the grantee of <em>Shaw\u2019s </em>Privilege, was the brother of the said <em>Thomas, </em>and youngest son of <em>Christopher </em>the elder. The admissions of the plaintiff, that the said land called <em>Shaw\u2019s Privilege </em>waslocated and contained within the lines and location of the land called <em>Shaw\u2019s Fancy. </em>That <em>Thomas Shaw </em>died leaving an only son and heir at law <em>Christopher Durbin Shaw ; </em>that the said <em>Christopher Durbin Shaw </em>entered upon, held and had possession of part of the said land called <em>Shaw\u2019s Fancy, </em>at the time <em>Christopher Shaw </em>had possession of part thereof. That <em>George </em>Harryman, more than fifty years ago, entered upon, held, used and claimed the said land called <em>Shaxv\u2019s Fancy </em>as his own proper estate and right. The bond for the conveyance of the said land executed by <em>Christopher Durbin Shaw, </em>and conditioned for the conveyance of the said land <em>George Harryman </em>and his heirs, dated the 11th of <em>February, </em>1737-8. That the said <em>George Harryman </em>entered upon, qccupied and was possessed of the whole of the said land called <em>Shaw\u2019s Fancy, </em>and afterwards died so seised thereof, leaving <em>George Harryman </em>his eldest aou and heir at law. That the said <em>George Harryman, </em>the heir at law, after the death of his father, entered upon, and became seised of, the said land as the law required, and afterwards died so seised thereof, leaving <em>William Harry-man, </em>the defendant, his eldest son and heir at law, who, after the death of the said <em>George Harryman, </em>his father, last mentioned, as heir at law, entered upon the said land called <em>Shaw\u2019s </em>Fancy, and hath ever since held and possessed the same, and is now in possession thereof, and is the defendant in the present cause.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>Martin, </em>(Attorney-General,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"Az7J\">It is equity and humanity to protect the rights of married women. The deed being a void deed cannot be argued from : the deed from <em>Christopher Durbin Shaw </em>is for one undivided moiety. This shows plainly what the one party meant to sell, and what the other meant to buy. Under this deed <em>George Harry man </em>was entitled to one moiety only. On the 11th of February, 1/39, <em>Christopher Shaw </em>made his will, and devised the other moiety to <em>Ruth Bayes </em>and <em>John </em>Ingle, to them and their heirs for ever <em>; </em>and the will was proved the 3d of May, 1/39. The deed from <em>Boyd </em>and wife, dated in December, 1/42, to <em>George </em>Harryman, recites the devise from <em>Christopher </em>Shaw, and is for one half part, and recognises <em>Christopher Shaw's </em>right. Then <em>George Harry man's </em>right is good as long as <em>Boyd </em>lived, (and he died in 1/91,) and no longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">There might have been a will from <em>Christopher </em>Shaw, senior, for there was no law at that time making it necessary to record wills. It may be said that this presumption is to defeat an ancient possession, but it is not so : it is to strengthen an ancient possession, a possession which all parties acknowledged; but, according to his title, the defendant\u2019s possession ceased on the death of <em>Boyd, </em>and ours begins. For presumption to legalize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>long possession, cites <em>Helms's Lessee </em>v. Howard, <em>(October </em>term, 1734,) and <em>Lloyd </em>v. Gordon, <em>April </em>term, 1789,) where a patent was presumed although against long possession, say fifty years. But the presuming the patent was to strengthen and legalize possession. In the case of <em>Greenhawk and Wife's Lessee </em>v. Cumberford, the defendant supported his title under a patent of 1762. The ejectment was brought about 1780. The defendant set up a title under a patent to <em>A. </em>Hutchings, dated in 1762. No patent could be found for the land for which the ejectment was brought. There was a certificate for <em>Rigby, </em>{the name of the land,) by which it appeared tha.\" the land had been surveyed in 1679 for <em>John </em>Wooters- Me conveyed it, in 1694, to <em>Josiah </em>Bradbury. A deed from <em>Bradbury </em>in 1735, was made to <em>Thomas Hutchings </em>for a moiety. In 1747 <em>Thomas Hutchmgs </em>died, and had lived on the land. He left a son named Thomas, his heir, who enlisted in the army in <em>Braddock's </em>war in 1756, and never returned. This <em>Thomas </em>left an only daughter, who married one <em>Greenhawk </em>before she was of age. <em>A. Hutchings </em>was the brother <em>to Thomas. To </em>get clear of the patent to <em>A. </em>Hutchmgs, it was necessary to presume a grant, and it was presumed; and it was presumed to show that the possessions were held under title, and not to destroy title.</p>\n<p id=\"Acc\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Whereupon the plaintiff\u2019s counsel desired the court to declare to the jury their opinion, that on this evidence, if they believed the testimony given, they might and ought to presume a will or conveyance to have been executed by <em>Christopher </em>the grantee, under which his son <em>Christo</em>pher, and his grandson <em>Christopher </em>Durbin, were entitled to the said land called <em>Shaw's </em>Fancy, as tenants in common, or as joint tenants, though no such deed or will was produced at the trial; and that the court would so direct the jury notwithstanding the evidence so offered by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>So in the case at bar, the defendant being in under title until <em>Boyd's </em>death, the presumptions is not to destroy title-</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b593-6\">Key, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"AYm\">In 1680 <em>Christopher Shaw </em>took up <em>Shaw's Fancy ; </em>he left two sons, <em>Thomas and </em>Chris<em>topher. </em>In 1725 patent issued to <em>Christopher </em>the son, for the same land, called <em>Shaw's Privilege ; Christopher Durbin Shaw </em>is heir at law to <em>Shard\u2019s Fancy ; Christopher, </em>the son, the patentee of <em>Shaw's Privilege. </em>The fact whether <em>Christopher Shaw </em>entered under the patent of 1725, or tin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>dcr a deed to be presumed from his father, is for the jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"A9e\">There is no evidence to show the assent of the heir at }aw t0 ^he entry of <em>Christopher </em>under the patent; and the bond from <em>Christopher Durbin Shaw, </em>in 1738, is for the whole.

To this opinion the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">In the course of the trial of the cause, <em>Key, </em>for the defendant, offered to read in evidence a copy of a deed, (the book in which it was recorded being lost,) dated in the year 1707, and which did not appear to have been acknowledged. He cited <em>Esp. </em>747. 773. The act of 1715, c. 47. s. 6, 7. 2 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>tit. <em>Evidence, </em>308, 309. The copy of the deeds appeared to be taken from <em>Liber </em>H. W.
