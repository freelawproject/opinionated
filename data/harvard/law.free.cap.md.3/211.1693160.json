The plaintiff declared generally for the penalty of the bond, without assigning breaches. The defendants demurred to the declaration, but the court overruled the demurrer and gave judgment for the plaintiff, with leave to enquire. Upon this the defendants noted an appeal. After this the breaches were assigned upon the inquisition and final judgment rendered for the plaintiff. The defendants then filed their bond and prosecuted their appeal.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-10\">The cause was argued before Eggleston, Mason and Tuck, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-11\"><em>T.
