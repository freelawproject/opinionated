Green and Philip Trammell, <em>vs. </em>Michael Trieber.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b19-4\">A debtor in insolvent circumstances executed a conveyance, in which, alter -reciting his indebtedness to certain creditors, parties of the third part, named in the deed, and his desire to pay the debt of one of them, and such of the others named as should sign the deed, he conveyed all his property to trustees in trust: \u2014 1st, to permit the grantor to possess and enjoy all said properly, paying no rent therefor, until a sale be made according to the deed, he giving bond, with security, to deliver the property on the day of sale, said bond to be held on the trusts declared in reference to the property. 2nd, if the grantor should not pay one of said creditois his debt in three semi-annual instalments, and the other parties signing the deed their debts in four such instalments, and all costs, &amp;c., the trustees should sell the property, and, (if the proceeds proved sufficient,) pay two of said creditors, and such others named in the deed as should sign the same, and the balance, if any, to pay over to the grantor. 3rd, if the proceeds be insufficient for tills purpose, then to pay a certain claim of one of said creditors, and distribute the residue ratably to another creditor, and to sucli of the others named in the deed as might sign the same. 4th, the deed to ho void, if the grantor should pay all the debts mentioned in it, with costs, commissions, &amp;c ; and 5th, the creditors named in and signing the deed, covenanted with the grantor to extend to him a credit of six, twelve, eighteen and twenty-four months on their claims, subject to the power to sell in case default be made in paying these instalments as they fell due. There was no provision stipulating for releases from the creditors who might sign, and no time limited within which they were to signify their assent to the deed by signing it. Held, that this deed was fraudulent and void as against creditors.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b19-5\">if this deed be regarded as an assignment for the payment of his creditors on terms proposed by the grantor, it is void, because, instead of passing the properly over to the trustees for the benefit of the creditors, it is retained by the debtor himself, for six and perhaps twenty-four months, and for so Jong a time as the trustees may deem proper, provided none of the assenting creditors require the sale to be made.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b19-6\">A debtor cannot rightfully put bis property beyond the reach of his creditors, arid turn them over for their debts to the rents and profits uncertain in quantity and fluctuating in value, nor has he a right to transfer his property and substitute his own bond in its placo.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b19-7\">The law makes a debtor\u2019s property liable for his debts, and if the bond be as good as the property, it does not affect the question, because the effect of the arrangement is to change the property and frustrate the recovery of just demands hy pursuing it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b19-8\">If this deed be regarded as a security in the nature of a mortgage, it is equally void, because the clause containing the,equity of redemption, secures to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>debtor no right he would not otherwise possess, and cannot give effect to .an instrument that would be void but for its insertion.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b20-5\">But the right to redeem in this case is not to be exercised as to all the debts named in the deed, but only as to such of the creditors as may assent to it3 provisions, the effect of which is to gain time by coercing the creditors who may come in, and to hinder and delay those who may refuse the terms of .the .deed as well as those not provided for.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b20-6\">The law does not tolerate any hindrance in assignments for the benefit of creditors., beyond what may be reasonable and necessary to the purposes of the trust; if no time be named within which the assent must be given, or if the time be unreasonable, the deed is void.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b20-7\">Reservations for the support of the insolvent debtor and his family, must be treated like any other reservation of his property for his own use, and all such are void as against creditors.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b20-8\">These assignments must be made in good faith, for the purpose of paying debts, and without any intent to lock up the property from other creditors for the use of the debtor: a conveyance by the owner to another in trust for himself, is in effect a conveyance to himself, and the grantor in such a deed can have but one motive, and that must be to defeat or hinder the claims of others.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b20-9\">This court will hereafter follow the decisions jn the cases of <em>McCall </em>re. <em>Binkley, </em>4 <em>Gill, </em>128, and <em>Kettlewell vs. St.ewart, </em>8 <em>Gill, </em>472, sustaining the validity of assignments, exacting releases from creditors who may assent to the deed, and embracing all the grantor\u2019s property, without reservations to himself.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b20-10\">If the assignment contain but a part of the property of the debtor, or if before the full payment of the entire claims of creditors, any part of the property assigned be reserved to the debtor, such an assignment is fraudulent and void.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b20-11\">An assignment for the benefit of creditors, exacting releases as the condition on which they may participate in the fund, must transfer all the debtor\u2019s ^estate.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b20-12\">The principle on which such assignments are sustained, is, that the statute of <em>Elizabeth </em>does not operate on one\u2019s time and future labor, but only devotes his property to the payment of his debts, and prevents that only from being placed beyond the reach of his creditors by fraudulent conveyances.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b20-13\">The case of <em>Estwick vs. Caillaud, </em>5 <em>Term Rep., </em>420, was the case of a debtor securing a portion of his creditors the full payment of their claims ultimately, and leaving other property to pay other debts, and is manifestly distinguishable from the deed in this case, and is not applicable to it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b20-14\">The case of <em>Kevan vs. Branch, </em>1 <em>Grattan, </em>274, sustaining a deed containing reservations to the grantor, similar to those of the deed in this case, is opposed to nearly all the cases in which the subject has been discussed, and this court cannot acknowledge its authority.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b21-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The case of <em>Wilkes vs. Ferris, </em>5 <em>Johns. Rep., </em>335, was decided on the authority of <em>Fstwickvs. Caillaud, </em>5 <em>Term, Rep., </em>420, and has been followed by scarcely any subsequent case in New York, while most of them have\" adopted the opposite doctrine.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b21-4\">Later decisions in New York have gone so far in vacating deeds containing such reservations, that the decision of tlie Court of Errors, in the case of <em>Murray vs. Riggs, </em>15 <em>Johns., </em>571, may be considered as justly exploded.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b21-5\"><em>A </em>debtor cannot make a reservation, at the expenso of his creditors, of any part of his income or property for his own benefit, nor can he stipulate for any advantage to himself oi' family.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b21-6\">'Where a deed reserves to the grantor the power of making leases, or of revoking or altering the trusts, or of charging the estate, or gives the trustee power to change the order of preferences, it is void.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b21-7\">There is a distinction between conveyances of the whole or a paj-\u2020, of the debt- or\u2019s property, as a security for particular debts, on an agreement with the creditors for further time, and voluntary conveyances by debtors for the payment of their debts. The character and design of the instruments are not the same; in the former, the object is to gain time by agreement with \u2022the creditor, in which it is consistent with the nature of the transaction that the debtor shall keep possession, in the latter, satisfaction to the extent of the whole property is proposed, and the law presumes them to be \u2022executed with reference to the benefit of the creditors.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b21-8\">The reservation to the grantor of the surplus that may remain after paying the assenting creditors, will avoid the assignment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b21-9\">When the court can see that the deed is fraudulent on its face, there is nothing for the jury to pass upon; if the law'imputes to the grantor a design in making the deed, no evidence of intention can change the presumption; if the law declares such deeds to be void, it is no matter how the question of fraud in fact may stand.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b21-10\">The written laws of a foreign State or country should be proved by the law itself as written, and the common customary or unwritten law by witnesses acquainted with the law.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b21-11\">Appeal from Allegany county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-12\">On the 4th of January 1849, an <em>attachment </em>on warrant was issued out of Allegany county court, at the instance of Michael Trieber, the appellee, to affect the goods, chattels, lands, tenements and credits, of one John Gamber, a non resident debtor. This attachment was levied by the sheriff upon certain personal property, consisting of two wagons, twelve mules, and twelve sets of harness for the same, and upon the petition of the attaching creditor, under the act of 1839, ch. 39, Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Wiesel, one of the judges of said court, on the 15th of January 1849, passed an order for the sale of said property, which was accordingly sold by the sheriff, on the 23rd of the same month, for $823.38-g-, on a credit of ninety days, and the proceeds brought into court to await the event of the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-5\">At April term 1849 of said county court, the appellants, Green and Trammell, upon motion, came in as claimants, and being allowed to appear, pleaded; \u2014 1st, that the goods and chattels attached, were not the property of said Gamber when the attachment was issued and levied, but were the property of said .claimants, as trustees under a certain deed of trust executed to them by said Gamber, on the 1st of June 1848. 2nd, that the proceeds of sale ought not to be paid over to Trieber, by order of the court or otherwise, because the goods belonged to said claimants, as trustees as aforesaid, and not to said Gamber, when the attachment issued and the levy and sale were made. 3rd, <em>non assumpsit </em>for Gamber.

J., and Marshall, A. J.,) gave, upon the ground that the said deed is to be regarded as a deed of trust, and that it is void at common law and under the statute of <em>13th Elizabeth, chap. </em>5, on account of the reservations therein contained in favor of the grantor. To this direction to the jury the claimants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-7\"><em>2nd Exception. </em>The plaintiff then proved, that Susan J.

It is simply a deed of mortgage, by way of trust to third parties, for the benefit of \u25a0creditors. It contains no provisions requiring creditors to release, and the only point in which it differs from a common mortgage, is the covenant for the extension of time to the grantor. The difference between a deed of trust and a mortgage is, that in the former no redemption is contemplated by \u25a0the grantor, whereas, in the latter, a redemption is always contemplated by the mortgagor. Here a redemption is clearly \u2022contemplated, and the clause by which possession is to be \u25a0retained by the mortgagor does not alter the nature of the deed, for such clauses, as well as a power to sell, a?e usually inserted in such instruments, both in this country and in England. 4 <em>Kent's Com., </em>146. <em>Coote on Mortgages, </em>325. 6 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>219. The mortgagor is not liable <em>to the </em>mortgagee for rents and profits. This is his privilege implied from the assent of the mortgagee to his possession, in the absence of a covenant for possession. <em>Coote on </em>Mort., 332. 4 <em>Kent's Com., </em>164.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-9\">Any creditor not a party to this deed could have recovered his debt against the debtor, hence the reservation of the rents and profits could not be in fraud of creditors under the statute of <em>Elizabeth.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-10\">In Virginia a deed of trust reserving possession to the grantor, even where a release was required, is good, though no redemption by the grantor is contemplated by it. 1 Grattan, 274. 10 <em>Leigh, </em>186. 6 Randolph, 285.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-11\">The execution of such a mortgage as this on personal property, though it may hinder creditors from levying their <em>ft. fas,, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>has never yet been regarded as such a hinderance, as will render the deed fraudulent under the statute of Elizabeth, for the creditor still has his remedy in equity. <em>Alcock vs. Harris, </em>10 <em>G. </em>&amp; <em>J., </em>226.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-6\">A debtor in failing circumstances may prefer one creditor to another; he has 4 legal, .equitable and moral right to do this. 8 <em>Leigh, </em>426, 427. 6 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>205. 7 <em>Peters, </em>614. 11 <em>Wheat., </em>98.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqX\">Where a deed expressly declares that no one who does not execute it and sign the release, shall receive the benefit thereof, a creditor standing out may still in equity receive the benefit of the surplus. 8 <em>Leigh, </em>294. 7 <em>Peters, </em>615. The provision in this deed, that in case the proceeds should not be sufficient to pay all, to pay Peabody, clearly shows that no fraud was intended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5g\">I shall now notice briefly some of the authorities cited by the counsel on the other side in their brief. In 2 <em>Kent\u2019s Com., </em>534, 535, the author is speaking of deeds requiring releases, and containing reservations to the grantor <em>out of the proceeds of sale, </em>and the cases cited by him are not simply cases where the possession, and the rents and profits are reserved as here, but cases where, out of the <em>proceeds of sale, </em>large sums are reserved to the grantor \u2014 he evidently means onerous, durable and beneficial reservations in favor.of the grantor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJh\">In the case of <em>Murray vs. Riggs, 2 Johns. Ch. Rep., </em>580, the absence of a clause requiring a release rendered the deed valid, although there was an enormous reservation to the grantors. In 5 <em>Cowen, </em>554, there was a reservation of a like nature out of the <em>proceeds of sale, </em>of more than $2000 for the benefit of the grantor and his family; this deed also contained a power of revocation. The deed in 14 <em>Johns., </em>464, required a release, contained a power of revocation and appointment to other uses, and was to be void if <em>any one </em>of the creditors should refuse to sign it. The case in 1 <em>Cranch, </em>309, only decides that absolute sales are not within the statute and is entirely foreign to the present case. See 3 <em>Cranch, </em>87, 88.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-11\">The deed in 11 Wendell, 187, required a release from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>certain class of creditors, in order that they might obtain the preference therein provided for, and the question here first arose and was decided, that the mere requiring of a release was sufficient to avoid the deed. This is the strongest case to be found in the books.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-5\">The Court of Appeals in this State have not been able to agree upon the bold proposition decided in 11 <em>Wendell. </em>They have decided it both ways, but the question does not arise in this case, because no release is required.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-6\">2nd. Susan Gamb.er is spoken of in the deed as a <em>creditor </em>of the grantor. The deed upon its face does not show that she is the wife grantor, it merely provides for her debt as for that of any other creditor of the mortgagor. The consideration for a deed of trust need not be a legal claim, for an equitable claim will do. But the prayer concedes that the relation of debtor and creditor may exist between husband and wife-\u2014 this .concession is all we need, for it concedes a sufficient consideration for the deed. This court must decide upon the deed as it stands, and in order to sustain the prayer in the second exception, the .court must establish the bold, naked, proposition, that a wife never can be, either at law or in equity, a creditor of her husband \u2014 that the relation of debtor and creditor never can exist between them. But the authorities cleqrly show, that such a relation may exist and may arise after marriage. 2 <em>Story\u2019s Eq., sec. </em>1373. 2 <em>Royer on Husband, and Wife. </em>32 <em>Law Lib., </em>79, 81, <em>(marg.) </em>1 <em>Gill, 1.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-8\">3rd.

The court were disposed to accede to this request, in view of the contrariety of decisions in other courts in which assignments for the benefit of creditors had been contested, and, especially, because of the embarrassing fact, that although the subject o\u00ed such assignments had been three times before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the Court of Appeals of Maryland, the ultimate judgment was rendered by three of the judges only, the others being of the opposite opinion, by which the question then under review was left, as it was in the first of these cases, <em>in equilibrio. </em>Having carefully examined the authorities referred to in both cases, with the general principles applicable to the subject, we proceed to express our views upon the exceptions in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">John Gamber being indebted to the appellee, an attachment was issued and levied on certain personal property, which had been conveyed, with other personal and a large real estate in Virginia, to the appellants, as trustees. This deed was executed in Virginia, where the grantor and the trustees resided, and where all the property then was. In the progress of the cause the appellants came in, by petition, and claimed to be the owners of the property on which the attachment had been laid, in virtue of this conveyance. The plaintiff proved his debt, that Gamber was a non-resident, that he was insolvent at the date of the deed, and that he thereby conveyed all his property. The court below decided that the deed was void as against creditors, on account of the reservations in favor of the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">This conveyance recites Gamber\u2019s indebtedness to Samuel Brady, and to other parties of the third part named in the deed, and his desire to secure the payment of said debts to Brady, and to such of the olher creditors named in the deed as should sign the same. The property is conveyed to the appellants in trust, for the following purposes:</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">1st. To permit the grantor to hold possession of all the property, real, personal and mixed, to take the rents, issues and profits, and to possess and enjoy the use and benefits thereof, paying no rent therefor, until a sale should be effected according to the- provisions of the deed, the grantor giving bond, with security, for the delivery of the property at the day of sale, which bond was to be held on the trusts declared in reference to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">2nd. That if the grantor should not pay to Brady, in three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>semi-annual payments, the debt due to him, and to such of the other parties as should sign the deed, in four semi-annual payments, the amounts due them, and all costs and commission, the trustee should sell the properly, and (if the proceeds of sale proved sufficient,) pay Peabody &amp; Co., then Brady, and such other of the parties of the third part as should sign the deed, and the balance, if any, to pay over to the grantor himself. There is no time limited within which these creditors are required to signify their assent by signing the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">3rd. If the proceeds of sale should prove insufficient for the above purposes, then to pay .a certain claim of Peabody &amp; Co., and to distribute the residue ratably to Brady, and such other of the creditors named in the deed as might sign the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">4th. The deed to be void if Gamber should pay all the debts mentioned in the deed, with costs, commission, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">5th. The creditors named in the deed, by signing the same, covenanted and agreed with Gamber to extend to him a credit of six, twelve, eighteen and twenty-four months on their respective claims, subject to the power to sell in case default should be made in paying these instalments as they might fall due.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">It will be observed that this deed does not stipulate for releases from the creditors who might sign. In this respect it differs from the instruments which were the subjects of controversy in the cases <em>of McCall vs. Hinkley, </em>4 <em>Gill, </em>128; <em>Albert and Wife, vs. Winn and Ross, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>446, and <em>Kettlewell vs. Stewart, </em>8 <em>Gill, </em>472, to which allusion has been made. But the grantor reserves to himself the possession and enjoyment of all the property for at least six, perhaps for twenty-four months, and, indeed, for an indefinite time, if the trustees should not think proper to sell, and none of the preferred creditors should require the sale to be made. He also reserves to himself the surplus, after payment of the claims of the assenting creditors, and of Brady, (whose assent is not required,) to the exclusion of all other creditors, who can in no event obtain any part of their claims by the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the deed, and these benefits, confined as they are to such of the named creditors as might assent, are extended to them only on the condition that they will, while the debtor is using and enjoying the property, grant further time on their claims against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Various questions have arisen in the .courts of the several States upon the construction and effect of assignments of this description. The contest, however, has been carried on, principally, between those who affirm and those who deny the validity of preferential deeds requiring releases, as one class of such instruments has been designated in this court. 8 <em>Gill, </em>506, With whatever force of argument or weight of authority these have been sustained, there is little difference among the authorities, as to the necessity of the debtor\u2019s conveying all his property for the benefit of his creditors. And although there are cases in which deeds, reserving a part of the property or the whole, for- a limited time, for the use pf the grantor or his family, have been held to be valid, yet much the greater number of decisions have condemned them as fraudulent and void. Those in which partial assignments have been thus stigmatized, have but asserted a plain principle of justice \u2014 that a debtor, confessedly unable to pay his debts, when he asks to have his future earnings released from liability, must accompany this appeal to the humanity of his creditors, by a tender of all the property that he has, and that if he wishes to retain any portion for the benefit of-himself or family, it must be done with the assent of all those who have a just and legal claim upon it; because if a debtor can rightfully coerce his creditor into releases of this kind, it must be on the principle that the statute of <em>Elizabeth </em>does not operate on one\u2019s time and future labor, but only devotes that which is the subject of assignment \u2014 his property \u2014 to the payment of his debts, and protects that only from being placed beyond the reach of his creditors by fraudulent conveyances; and that, therefore, while exercising his undoubted right to prefer some creditors to all the others, by paying them in full or by assigning property in satisfaction of their claims, he may so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>discriminate as to protect his future earnings, provided he parts with all that he has. 5 <em>Rawle, </em>221.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">It is not our purpose to examine the decisions on this point. The subject has been elaborately discussed in most of the States, and in none with greater ability than in the late Court of Appeals. It is much to be regretted that a difference of opinion among the judges should have left so material a question unsettled, and it is because the subject has been fully argued before us, and the counsel in both cases have suggested the importance to the public of having it settled, whether assignments, as common as those are said to have been in this State, are valid or void, for the reasons assigned in those cases, that we feel warranted in saying, that hereafter, as to deeds presenting the question which we understand to have been before the Court of Appeals, we shall follow the decisions in 4 <em>Gill </em>and 8 <em>Gill. </em>The first of these was decided in 1846, since when the same question arose in 8 <em>Gill, </em>and in the Circuit Court of the United States, in the case of <em>White, Warner </em>&amp; <em>Co., vs. Winn and Ross, </em>in which Chief Justice Taney delivered the opinion of the court, affirming the validity .of the same deed which the Court of Appeals, in 7 <em>Gill, </em>declared to be void. These decisions have probably induced the belief, with the community and the profession, that such .conveyances would thereafter be sustained, and it is not unlikely that, under this impression, much property is now held by titles of this kind. These considerations, and the state in which we find this question in Maryland, are, we think, of sufficient weight to render unnecessary a re-examination of the principles on which the doctrine adverted to has been maintained. We, therefore, content ourselves with recognising the law as declared in the two cases to which we have referred, as more conducive to the public interest, than that these decisions should now be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The deed before us does not require releases from the assenting creditors, and it was on this ground, as we understood the appellants\u2019 counsel, that he mainly contended that it is valid; because, as he urged, most if not all such instruments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u25a0which had been declared void, contained this coercive stipulation, while others have been sustained, notwithstanding the possession of the property was reserved to the grantor. Several cases were referred to in support of these positions, and especially that of <em>Estwick vs. Caillaud, </em>5 <em>Term Rep., </em>420. This decision has been remarked upon in many of the cases in which the subject has been presented; efforts have been made to lessen its authority, on various grounds, and judges have sought to avoid its effect, either by denying its authority or by distinguishing it from the cases before them. See Senator Golden\u2019s opinion, in <em>Mackie vs. Cairns, </em>5 <em>Cowen, </em>569, and Ch. J. Savage\u2019s, <em>same case, </em>583. It will be found, on comparing this deed with that in 5 <em>Term Rep., </em>as explained by the judges in their opinions, that in terms and effect they are very different. The names of the creditors were mentioned as here, but the trust was created with the assent of the creditors themselves, and after he had offered payment, out of other property which he retained, to the creditor in whose behalf the deed was contested. It required no release from any of the creditors, it did not exclude any for dissenting, nor impose conditions or restraints of any kind upon them. It was the case of a debtor securing a portion of his creditors for the full payment of their claims, ultimately, and leaving other property to pay other debts. This was the view taken of the case by Savage, Ch. J., in 5 <em>Cowen, </em>583. See 1 <em>Hopkins, </em>397. We do not deem this case as entitled to the authority, on the present appeal, ascribed to it by the appellants\u2019 counsel, for it is manifest that there are several stipulations in the deed of Gamber, which do not appear in that of Lord Abingdon, and which, in our opinion, render it void.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The appellants\u2019 counsel has also referred to the cases of Rose\u2019 <em>Adm\u2019x, vs. Burgess, </em>10 <em>Leigh, </em>186. <em>Claytor vs. Anthony, </em>6 <em>Randolph, </em>285, and <em>Kevan vs. Branch, </em>1 <em>Grattan, </em>274. The deed in the first of these cases was executed by an administrator, to indemnify the sureties in his official bond; and the property might, without objection, remain with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>grantor until it became necessary to take it for the purposes of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">In the second the deed was for personal property to secure a particular debt, with power in the trustee to sell, and did not, in any sense, partake of the character of an assignment for the benefit of creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The last of these cases, however, is very much like the one before us, as respects the reservation of the property to the grantor, and does sustain the view taken, on the part of the appellant, of this branch of the case. But there is no opinion of the court, nor statement of the grounds of the decision; under which circumstances, and being opposed by nearly all the cases in which the subject has been discussed, we cannot acknowledge its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The counsel for the appellant has also relied on the case of <em>Halsey vs. Whitney, </em>4 <em>Mason, </em>218, to show that the assignment need not transfer all the debtor\u2019s property. It was suggested at the bar that the debtor had no other property; but Judge Story did not deem it material, in that case, to introduce the fact by amendment of the pleadings. The only reason assigned by the judge is this: \u201cBut if he has other property, then the presumption of fraud is less cogent; for a debt- or, conveying part only of his estate to certain privileged creditors, does not thereby necessarily impair the rights of other dissenting creditors. The argument has generally come from the other side, as repelling any inference of fraud, such was the reasoning of <em>Estwick vs. Caillaud, </em>4 <em>Term. Rep., </em>420, and <em>Wilkes vs. Ferris, </em>5 <em>Johns. Rep., </em>335.\u201d We have shown the character of the case, in 4 <em>Term Rep., </em>420, and that it does not in our opinion, apply to cases like the one before us. The case in 5 <em>Johns., </em>335, also referred to by the learned judge, was decided on the authority of <em>Estwick vs. Caillaud, </em>and has been followed by scarcely any case in New York, since, while most of them have adopted the opposite doctiine.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">It is worthy of remark, also, that Judge Story in deciding <em>Halsey vs. Whitney, </em>sustained a deed exacting releases from the creditors, against his own judgment, upon the authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>of cases, in which it was held that the transfer of all the debt- or\u2019s property is necessary to the validity of such assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"ABHR\">In the case of <em>Riggs vs. Murray, 2 Johns. Ch. Rep., </em>565, Chancellor Kent pronounced against a deed which reserved to each of the insolvent grantors two thousand dollars per annum, for the support of their families, until the creditors executed releases, or until one year after they were discharged by law, for the reason that this and other conditions were onerous and oppressive to creditors, using in his opinion (pag 582,) this language: \u201cIf an insolvent debtor may make sweeping dispositions of his property to select and favorite creditors, yet loaded with such durable and beneficial provisions, for the debtor himself, and incumbered with such onerous and arbitrary conditions and penalties, it would be impossible for courts of justice to uphold credit, or to exact the punctual performance of contracts.\u201d This decree was subsequently <em>(15 Johns., 571,) </em>reversed by the Court of Errors. Afterwards Ch. J. Spencer, in sustaining a similar deed, <em>(20 Johns., </em>447, <em>Austin vs. Bell,) </em>on the authority of this case, said. \u201cWe are bound by that decision,\u201d (the decree of reversal,) <em>\u201cwhatever our private opinions may he as to its accuracy and </em>solidity.\u201d Later decisions in the courts- of New York have gone so far in vacating deeds containing such reservations to the grantor, that Chancellor Kent, in his <em>Com., 2nd Vol., </em>535, <em>note, </em>says, that the decision of the Court of Errors, in <em>Murray vs. Riggs, </em>may be considered as justly exploded, <em>Mackie vs. Cairns, 5 Cowen, </em>547, was a deed reserving $2000 per annum for tile benefit of the grantor, until he should be discharged from his debts. <em>Golden, senator, </em>thus states this case:- \u201cMr. Cairns being insolvent, assigned, by several instruments, all his property to S. and L., in trust, that they should allow him out of the proceeds, or out of the rents and profits, $2000 a year, till he should be discharged from his debts, but the allowance was not- to extend beyond four years; and upon the further trust, that the residue should be distributed among certain of his creditors.\u201d This is not very dissimilar to the deed before us,- the material difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>is, that here all the property, with the income and profits, is reserved to the grantor, for six, twelve, eighteen or twenty-four months, according as the debtor might or might not meet his engagements in the deed, with a reservation, after paying certain debts, of the entire residue to himself. In the one case the creditors would receive payment out of the income after deducting the $2000, annually; in the other they could get nothing, however large the profits might be, until the time specified in the assignment. There was no release required, nor other provision to coerce the creditors, nor any reservation of the residue. Of that deed, however, Senator Golden said: \u201cHere then is a conveyance by which an insolvent debtor reserves to himself, out of his property, such revenue as he sees fit, for such time as he thinks will suit his convenience; and when his creditors, who are not among those he has chosen to favor, and who are dissatisfied, obtain an execution against his estate, they find in their way a conveyance which not only hinders them from levying their debt, but secures the property, in part at least, to their debtor.- If there be such a thing as natural equity; if we may ever appeal to those perceptions of right and wrong, which are independent of all learning, if seems to me that we may do so on this occasion, and cannot hesitate to decide that such a disposition of property is invalid.\u201d And Savage, Ch. J.-, in the same case, says, (580:) \u201c Suppose the debtor finding himself in failing circumstances, had conveyed the whole of his property to assignees,in trust for himself, could there be a question on the subject? An insolvent will not be permitted thus to defraud his creditors, and mock the insulted majesty of the laws. When a debtor fails, either from misfortune or folly, or from dishonest motives, his property, in moral justice, belongs to his creditors. He is permitted to prefer in payment such creditors as he pleases. This is giving him power enough, but when he appropriates the property to his own use the act becomes fraudulent.\u201d \u201cIf he may take to his own use $2000 a year, why not $5000? And if for four years, why not for ten or even twenty? To state -such a proposition is a sufficient refutation. It offends the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>moral sense; it shocks the conscience and produces an exclamation. It is directly against the statute and cannot stand before it.\u201d See also <em>Goodrich vs. Downs, </em>6 <em>Hill, </em>440. The <em>Commercial and Rail Road Bank of Vicksburg </em>made an assignment of its effects to trustees, with authority to collect all debts due, to complete the railroad, for which purpose they were authorised to bo'rrow $250,000, to allow claims against the bank, and out of the proceeds, first to pay the loan, to pay the trustees $8000 per annum, each, and to distribute the balance ratably among creditors who should file their claims against the bank. The Supreme Court (7 <em>Howard, </em>276, <em>Bodley vs. </em>Goodrich,) said: \u201cUpon its face, this deed shows an intention by the bank to postpone its creditors, use the effects of the bank for the completion of the railroad, pay the trustees enormous salaries, and make no dividend among the creditors of the bank until these objects were accomplished,\u201d and declared the assignment <em>to </em>be void.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u201e And the same law prevails in Virginia, whose courts sustain assignments requiring releases from creditors. In <em>Skipwith vs. Cunningham, </em>8 <em>Leigh, </em>290, Judge Tucker?' says, in speaking of assignments requiring releases: \u201cOn this? subject a distinction has been made in the cases, between the conveyance of the <em>whole </em>and the conveyance of <em>part </em>only of the debtor\u2019s property, upon condition that the creditors should compound and accept a part of their debts, and give releases for the residue. The former is considered admissible and valid, the latter as oppressive upon the creditors, and as fraudulent and pernicious in its tendencies. The English cases are all founded upon the <em>concessum </em>of the principle, that such compositions are lawful, where the party has conveyed the <em>whole </em>of his property, and there is no concealment or underhand agreement with particular creditors.\u201d And in <em>McCullough vs. Sommerville, 8 Leigh, </em>428, the same court said: \u201cThere is no evidence of fraud, nothing to show an intention to withdraw the effects of the firm from the creditors. On the contrary the whole property, of every kind and description, not only of the firm, but of the individual partner, McCul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>lough, is conveyed, thus stripping himself and the firm (so far as the grantor could,) of every atom of property, and subjecting it to the payment of the creditors named.\u201d The same doctrine is maintained in 13 Louisiana, 454, <em>Graves vs Roy. The Watchman, Ware, </em>232. 5 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep., </em>229. 14 <em>Johns., </em>458. 6 <em>Binny, 338. 2 Pick., 129. 2 Comstock, </em>365. 17 <em>Vermont, </em>310, 390. 6 <em>Hill, </em>440.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">And in Pennsylvania, where also assignments for the benefit of creditors and stipulating for releases, arc held to be valid, it has been decided, that conveyances of this kind by partners in trade, must transfer all the separate estate of the individual partners, as well as the effects of the firm. <em>Thomas vs. Jenks, </em>5 <em>Rawle, 221. Hennessy vs. Western Bank, </em>6 <em>Watts and Serg't, </em>300. In the last of these cases it is said: \u201cA debtor cannot make a reservation, at tho expense of his creditors, of any part of his income or property, for his own benefit, nor can he stipulate for any advantage either to himself or family;\u201d which Chancellor Kent, in his <em>Com., 2nd Vol., </em>535, also states to be the result of the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">And so where deeds reserved to the grantor the power of making leases, or of revoking or altering the trusts, or of charging the estate, or gave the trustees power to change the order of preferences, they have been held to be void. 2 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep., </em>579, 580. <em>Tarback vs. Marbury, 2 Vern., </em>510. 4 <em>Barb., S. C. Rep., </em>539, <em>Strong vs. Skinner. </em>9 <em>Gill, 216, Beatty vs. Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">And however the judges of the Court of Appeals may have differed in the cases to which allusion has been made, on the question then before them for decision, it is manifest that they sanctioned this doctrine. In 4 <em>Gill, </em>136, Dorsey, J., says: \u201cIt was admitted in the discussion of this case, (and such is the principle established by a current of authorities,) that if the assignment contain but a part of the property of the debtor, or if before the full payment of the entire claims of creditors, any part of the property assigned be reserved to the debtor, such an assignment is fraudulent and void.\u201d And Magruder, J., page 158, says: \u201cThe deed, it is true, must not be so framed as to keep the property in the power of the debtor.\u201d And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Frick, J., (7 Gill, 478,) says; \u201cThe assignment is conceded to be void, if there be any reservation in it for the benefit of the debtor.\u201d See also 8 <em>Gill, </em>502. 9 <em>Gill, </em>211.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">We must observe the distinction between conveyances of the whole or a part of the debtor\u2019s property, as a security for particular debts, on an agreement with the creditors for further time, and voluntary conveyances by debtors for the payment of their debts; the latter the law presumes to be executed with reference to the benefit of the creditors, and not to the advantage of the debtor,, further than the exaction of releases, where such a provision is allowed without avoiding the deed. In one class the object is to gain time for the debtor by agreement with the creditor, in which it is quite consistent with the nature of the transaction that the former shall keep possession. In the other the debtor oilers his property to his creditors in payment of their claims, or for distribution according to such priorities as he may prescribe. Payment being the professed object of the assignment, it must not contain any provision to defeat or hinder this purpose, beyond such reasonable delay as may be incidental and necessary to the proper execution of the trust. <em>Hart vs. Crane, 7 Paige, </em>37. 4 <em>Wash. C. C. Rep., </em>235, 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Applying these principles to the deed under consideration, we are brought to the conclusion that the court below committed no error in condemning it as void. If it be regarded as an assignment for the payment of his creditors, on terms proposed by the grantor, it cannot be sustained, because, instead of passing the property over to the trustees for the benefit of the creditors, it is retained by the debtor himself for six, and perhaps for twenty-four months, and indeed for so long a time as the trustees may deem proper, provided none of the assenting creditors require the sale to be made. During this time the property would be protected from process issued at the instance of the other creditors, as well those not named in the deed, as those who were named and might not accept its terms. It is not a satisfactory answer to say, that jthe income and products of the property would be liable, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the meantime, to be seized under such process. It does not appear what would be the character of these products, whether liable to execution or not. Besides, we are ascertaining and dealing with the intent of the party in making the deed, and not whether a remedy was or was not open to the other creditors. 4 <em>Mason, </em>227. A debtor cannot rightfully put his property beyond the reach of creditors, and turn them over for their debts to the rents and profits, uncertain in quantity and fluctuating in value; nor has he a right to transfer his property and substitute his own bond in its place, as in this case. The law makes one\u2019s property liable for his debts, and even if the bond should be as good as the property, this does not affect the question, because the effect of the arrangement is to change the property, and to frustrate and defeat the recovery of just demands by pursuing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">If it be regarded as a security in the nature of a mortgage, as was insisted on the part of the appellants, it is equally objectionable; because, if the equily of redemption relieves this \u25a0deed from the imputation of fraud, we cannot perceive that it would not have the same effect in other deeds which would be fraudulent without it; and thus a clause which secures to the debtor no right that he would not otherwise possess, and which is, therefore, wholly unnecessary, would give effect to an instrument that would be void but for its insertion. But this right to redeem is to be exercised, not as to all the debts named in the deed, but, only, as to such of the creditors as may assent to its provisions. By this means, the debtor, in his efforts to retain the use of the property, seeks to coerce his creditors to sign the deed by a double motive \u2014 the security and preference offered, and the hope, which this provision is calculated to excite, that he really intended and would pay the debts from the rents and profits of the estate \u2014 and if the object of the debtor was, as we must now assume, to secure his creditors, he had no right to subject them to the alternative of agreeing that he should have further time, and pay bv instalments prescribed by himself, as the price of the security offered, or lose all benefit of his property, and chance of be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ing paid in that way, in case it should require the whole to satisfy those who might assent to the deed. The effect is to gain time by coercing the creditors who may come in, and to hinder and delay those who may refuse the terms of the deed, as well as those not provided for. If it be asked, why not allow a debtor craving time on security offered, to prescribe terms, as well as one who is making a general assignment^ to stipulate for releases? the answer is (as before observed,) that the character and design of the instruments are not the same. In one class of these deeds satisfaction to the extent of the whole property is proposed; in the other indulgence is demanded by the debtor, and many persons would be willing to compound with their debtor, at once, for a fair proportion of the assets, and take what he can pay, who would not grant further time, stipulated by the debtor to suit himself, on an uncertain security, the debtor in the meantime to have the use and enjoyment of the estate, however large the profits, without applying\u201dany portion thereof to the reduction of the debts while the security may be daily depreciating. And, besides, this indulgence cannot be demanded at the option of the debtor, and on his own terms. If he may thus restrain his creditor for six months, he may as rightfully do so for as many years. The law does not tolerate any hindrance in assignments for the benefit of creditors, beyond what may be reasonable and necessary to the purposes of the trust. Thus if no time is named, as in this case, within which the assent must be given, or if the time be unreasonable, the deed cannot stand. 4 <em>Wash. C. C. Rep., </em>235, 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The argument, that a party may be honestly endeavoring to pay his debts, and that for that purpose and to support his family, the property should be allowed to remain in his possession until default in paying the instalments, was well answered by the chancellor in 1 <em>Hopkins, </em>403. \u201cIt is now urged that the support of the grantor, from his own estate, is an object, which if notlawful is at least so reasonable, as to entilet these provisions to some favor. This object is clearly illegal. The fundamental principle of law and justice, is, that all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>property of an insolvent debtor, should be applied to the discharge of his debts. If the debtor may want sustenance so also may the creditor, and if one of them must suffer, the misfortune must, according to law and morals, fall on the debtor. But if it is reasonable that some moderate portion of the property of an insolvent debtor, should be allowed for his sustenance, what shall be the allowance, and by whom shall it be made? Shall the debtor, finding himself insolvent, determine both for himself and his creditors, what allowance will be reasonable or convenient for his own wants, and the period during which he shall be maintained from his own estate ? Can an insolvent debtor, first set apart a portion of his estate for himself, and leave the residue for his creditors? Is it law, that every insolvent debtor in this State may, by assigning all his property in trust, secure to himself an allowance for two thousand dollars a year, or any other sum, from his own property? Reservations for the support of the insolvent debtor must be treated like any other reservations of his property for his own use; and all such are void against creditors.\u201d These assignments must be made in good faith, for the purpose of paying debts, and without any intent to lock up the property from other creditors, for the use of the debtor. A conveyance by the owner to another in trust for himself, is in effect a conveyance to himself. Such a measure never can be necessary for any honest purpose, and the grantor, in such a deed, can, in the general course of human conduct, have but one motive, and that must be to defeat or hinder the claims of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">There is also, in this deed, a reservation to the grantor of the surplus that might remain after paying the assenting creditors. It is unnecessary to examine this question, in this opinion, as it is presented in two aspects in the case of <em>Sangston vs. </em>Gaither, in which the authorities particularly applicable to this feature of the assignment are cited. We there decide that such a reservation avoids the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The counsel for the appellants suggested that the circumstances attending the transaction should have been left to the jury, before whom the question of fraud could better have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>been inquired into. There is nothing for that tribunal to pass upon, when the court can see that the instrument is fraudulent on its face. We are to look to the character with which the law stamps the deed, without reference to extrinsic facts as to motive. If the law imputes to the grantor a design in making the deed, no evidence of intention can change the presumption. Here is a creditor, with process in his hands, contesting this conveyance. We see that by it the debtor has attempted to place his property beyond the reach of this process, upon certain trusts in favor of himself. If the law declares such deeds to be void, it is no matter how the question of fraud in fact may stand.-</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">It is said, also, that the laws of Virginia must govern this case, according to which the deed would be treated as a mortgage. There is no evidence before us of what the foreign law is. The mode of such proof is stated in <em>Gardner vs. Lewis, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>377.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">From the view taken of this conveyance, under the first exception, it is unnecessary to express any opinion on the points arising under the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
