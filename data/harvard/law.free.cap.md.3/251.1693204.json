The protest of the first, after setting out the note, states, that on the 2nd of February 1849, the due-day of the note, the notary, \u201cat the request of the trustees of the bank of the Metropolis, presented at said bank, (the drawer having re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>moved from Washington, and having been previously informed at his late place of business, that he had not left any funds or made any provision for his notes,) the original note,\u201d \u201c and demanded payment <em>thereof, </em>which could <em>not </em>be obtained as <em>the </em>drawer had not any money to his credit, therefore,\u201d &amp;c.; \u201cand same day deposited in the post office of Washington city notice of protest to the first endorser, viz., R.

Notes, sec. </em>236. He has the right to look to the endorser, without any presentment, when such a state of facts occurs. This is one of the chances which the endorser takes when he makes his contract. Here the notary went to the late place of business of the maker, and was there informed that he had left the jurisdiction of the notary. This is a substantial compliance with the law, it is due diligence. 9 <em>Wheat., </em>598.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-6\">As to the protest of the second note: This case is distinguishable from the case of <em>Graham vs. Sangston, </em>1 <em>Md.

If there was other evidence which would have made the protest admissible, it ought to appear on the record, otherwise this court cannot reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-10\">As to first note: The question is, whether the protest states a sufficient excuse for a non-demand? Now the words of the protest are not evidence of the facts they recite. We must look to the act of 1837 to see for what purpose the protest is admissible. It is only made by that act evidence off <em>demand </em>and <em>notice, </em>not of the <em>excuse for non-demand. </em>The notary says he did not make demand, because he had been <em>previously </em>informed that the maker had left Washington and had left no funds at his late place of business. When informed is not stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>In the case in <em>Wheat., </em>and in all other cases,, the fact of the removal is proved <em>aliunde </em>the protest. Here the note is dated at <em>Marlborough, </em>and therefore given in Marlborough, in Maryland, and where a note is drawn in a particular place, it is presumed to be the place of the maker\u2019s residence, and inquiry must be made there. <em>Bailey on Bills, </em>198. 4 <em>Searg. and Rawle, </em>480. He should moreover, on finding the place of business closed, have made inquiry as to the maker\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-6\">As to the second note: The case of <em>Boehme vs. Carr, ante, 202, </em>is conclusive.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-8\"><em>Teaclcle </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-9\">The case of <em>Hunter vs. Van Bomhorst, </em>1 Md. <em>Rep., </em>504, affirms the case in 4 <em>Gill, </em>as to the words <em>\"notice of protest.\u201d </em>Upon this point, then, the first note is unobjectionable. The act of 1837 has made the protest <em>per se, prima facie </em>evidence of demand and non-payment.- This relieves the party from the necessity of proving a demand <em>aliunde. </em>The mere <em>fact </em>of protest is evidence sufficient to cast the <em>onus </em>on the other side, \u2014 we are not bound to prove that we presented it any where for payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-10\">As to the first exception: The court is bound to decide upon the admissibility of the evidence at the time it is presented, and if refused, the party lias the, right to except. How could the court know whether there was other evidence or not? The act of 1837 makes the protest <em>prima facie </em>evidence, and we had a right to have it read to- the jury.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b263-12\">Tuck, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8h\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">The appellant sued the appellee as payee and endorser of two notes of John Waring, payable, respectively, at eighteen and twenty-four months from date. Having proved the making and endorsement of the notes, and that the appellee resided and had his place of business in Baltimore when they became due, he offered in evidence the protests set out in the record, for the purpose of proving demand and notice. The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ant objected to this evidence' as inadmissible for the purpose for which it was offered, which objection was sustained.- In this we think that the court erred, because, as part of the evidence tended to prove the issue, and was admissible, the whole should not have been excluded from the jury. <em>Budd vs. Brooke, </em>3 <em>Gill, </em>220. 1 <em>Md. Rep., </em>474.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The protest of the first note states, that on the due-day the notary demanded payment at the Bank of Metropolis, \u201cthe drawer having removed from Washington, and having been previously informed at his late place of business that he had not left any funds or made any provision for his notes.The liability of an endorser is conditional; the holder takes the note, with the understanding that demand and notice are precedent to his right to recover, and the endorser is entitled to strict notice. Bell vs. <em>Hagerstown Bank, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>225.- The demand at the bank is conceded to have been insufficient. But it is said, that the averment in the protest shows that the-maker'had left Washington, and that a demand was made at his late place of business. Upon the subject of demand where the maker has removed, we take the-law to be correctly stated by Chancellor Kent, in 3 <em>Vol. </em>of his <em>Com., Lecture </em>44, <em>page </em>96: \u201cThe general principle is, that due diligence must be used to find out the party and make the demand, and the inquiry will always be,- whether, under the circumstances of the case, due diligence has- been used ?\u201d \u201c If the party has <em>absconded, that </em>will, as a general rule, excuse the demand. If he has changed his residence to some other place, within the same State or jurisdiction, the holder must make endeavors to find it, and make the demand there; though, if he has removed out of the State subsequent to the making of the note or accepting the bill, it is sufficient to present the same at his former place of residence\u201d (or of business.) \u201cIf there be no other evidence of the maker\u2019s residence than the date of the paper, the holder must make inquiry at the place of date, and the presumption is, that the maker resides where the note is dated, and that he contemplated payment at that place. But it is presumption only; and if the maker resides elsewhere within the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>when the note falls due, and that be known to the holder, demand must be made at the maker\u2019s place of residence,\u201d or of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Although the drawer may have removed from Washington, it does not necessarily follow that he could not have been found, on inquiry, at some other place within the same jurisdiction. Nor are w\u00e9 to infer that a demand was' made, from what the notary says was the information he received at the drawer\u2019s late place of business. Whether he presented the note there, or- had it with him, does not appear. \u201cThe <em>mode </em>of demand is well settled. A demand without the presentation of the note, would in genera] be equivalent to no demand;, and wdien it is made, the holder should be prepared and ready to produce it.\u201d 7 <em>G. &amp; </em>J., 89, <em>Farmers Bank vs. Duvall. </em>But the law is equally stringent as to the <em>time </em>of the demand; The word \u201cpreviously,\u201d does- not necessarily imply that it was made on the\" same day. It would have been quite proper for the holder or the notary to have made inquiry for the maker several days before the note became due, that he might make the demand at the proper place, and this word may have referred to some such inquiry. In the case of <em>Whiteford vs. Burckmyer and Adams, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>142, a question arose as to the time that notice of demand and refusal was given to the endorser. It was held that \u201cplain and satisfactory proof as to the time of service,\u201d was necessary. Applying the principle of that decision to the present ease, the evidence must point, not to a demand at <em>some </em>time, but show that it was made on the day prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Where the notary in the protest slates, that \u201cnotice of protest\u201d was sent to the endorser, and the manner of such notice, it implies a demand and refusal to pay by the maker or acceptor. 4 <em>Gill, </em>194, <em>Barry vs. Crowley </em>1 <em>Md. Rep., </em>512, <em>Hunter vs. Van Bomhorst. </em>Bat this presumption cannot arise when the protest itself shows that no sufficient demand and refusal had taken place. For these reasons we decide, that the first protest was insufficient and properly rejected by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>We entertain a different view of the protest of the second note. That shows a demand on the maker in person and his refusal to pay. To this extent, and for the purpose of proving due demand and refusal, it was sufficient <em>prima facie </em>evidence. But the notice to the appellee, as stated in the protest, was clearly insufficient. It did not inform him of a demand and refusal. 1 <em>Md. Rep., </em>59, 504. <em>Boehme vs. Carr, ante, </em>202. This defect, perhaps, could have been supplied. It does not- appear that the plaintiff had closed his case when the objection was made. <em>Wolfe vs. Hauver, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>84. He was not obliged to rely solely on the protest. In the case in 1 <em>Gill, </em>151, before referred to, notices for the endorsers, of demand and refusal had been sent, under cover, to the cashier of the bank. The court said that these facts could be proved by the protest, and their subsequent delivery to the parties to be charged, by other evidence. And so in 1 <em>Md. Rep., </em>512, where the protest did not show sufficient notice to the endorser, he was held liable upon his acknowledgment that he had received a \u201cnotice of protest.\u201d A party cannot always prove his case by one witness, or by one paper \u2014 several may be required. He may commence with any part of his <em>evidence</em>\u2014Caton <em>vs. Carter, </em>9 <em>G. </em>&amp; <em>J., </em>476\u2014and it is error to reject any that is <em>per se, </em>pertinent to the issue. When the plaintiff has closed, if there be a failure of proof as to any fact necessary to be proved, the defendant may ask an instruction that the evidence is not legally sufficient to maintain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We approve of the court\u2019s refusal to grant the plaintiff\u2019s prayer contained in the second exception, for the reason that both the protests on which the prayer is predicated, had been rejected by the court, and were no longer in the cause; and also because the prayer assumed that the plaintiff was entitled \u2022to recover on both notes, when, as we have seen, the evidence as to each, if it had not been rejected, was insufficient to maintain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Dissenting from the ruling of the court below, as to the admissibility of the protest of the note faffing due on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>2nd August 1849, we reverse the judgment and order a procedendo.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
