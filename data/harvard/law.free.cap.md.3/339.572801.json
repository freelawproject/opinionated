</em>and the single question is, whether the said <em>William and John </em>are tenants in common of that tract under the will by which they claim <em>l</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">It appears to me that the greatest ingenuity is necessary to raise an argument in support of the appellants; and that a plainer case never existed than the present in favour of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">By the first clause of the will, the testator gives a plain declaration of his intention to give all his land among his three sons, without designating any part for \"either. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Had the will stopped there, they would have been joint tenants of the whole; but he then goes on and declares his two sons, <em>William </em>and <em>John, </em>shall have <em>Thomas\u2019s Ad</em>vent\u00fare, part of <em>Good Luck, Thomas\u2019s </em>Range, and the <em>Glebe </em>Land,, to be equally divided between them in <em>quan</em>tity, without regard to <em>quality ; </em>and that <em>Daubney </em>should have the lands of division on <em>Deer </em>Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"A6H\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The case was continued under a <em>curia </em>ad. <em>vult. </em>until this term, when the general court gave judgment upon the point saved, and verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"A0yH\">The defendant appealed to the court of appeals, and the cause was argued at <em>June </em>term, 1796.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>If the will had stopped here, <em>William </em>and <em>John </em>would have been <em>tenants in common </em>of those four tracts devised to them, and <em>Daubney </em>would have had a separate estate in the lands on <em>Deer Creek.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The testator further goes on to declare that in the division to be made between <em>William </em>and <em>John, William </em>should have in his part the <em>Glebe </em>Land, and <em>John </em>should have <em>Good Luck. </em>As to these two tracts, the testator has separated them and given a separate estate in the <em>Glebe Land </em>to <em>William, </em>and a separate estate in <em>Good Luck </em>to <em>John ; </em>but as each is to have an equal quantity of acres, the other two tracts are to be so divided as to make the quantity of the whole which each has equal, and until that division is made, <em>William </em>and <em>John </em>are tenants in common of <em>Thomas\u2019s Adventure </em>and <em>Thomas\u2019s </em>Range, because it is not known what part of either will belong to <em>William, </em>or what part of either to <em>John.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Suppose, for instance, the <em>Glebe Land </em>contained 100 acres, the plantation called <em>Good Luck, </em>300 acres, <em>Thomas\u2019s </em>Adventure, 200 acres, and <em>Thomas\u2019s Range, </em>400 acres, in all 1,000 acres; as <em>Good Luck </em>must be in <em>John\u2019s </em>part, and contains 200 acres more than the <em>Glebe, </em>which must be in <em>William\u2019s </em>part, out of the remaining 600 acres <em>John </em>can only have 200, that is, 100 for <em>Thomas\u2019s </em>Adventure, and 100 acres of <em>Thomas\u2019s Range, </em>which would make the whole of his quantity <em>500 </em>acres, and the residue of 400 acres would be the property of <em>William; </em>or it might happen that in the partition of <em>Thomas\u2019s Adventure </em>and <em>Thomas\u2019s Range, </em>the whole of <em>Thomas\u2019s Adventure </em>would fall into the part of John, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the whole of <em>Thomas\u2019s Range </em>into the part of William,\u00bb but surely as to these two tracts, as they were in common, and it could not be known whether the whole or what part of either will belong to <em>William </em>or <em>John </em>before the partition, till that event takes place they must be tenants in common of those two tracts. They were not separate tenants of either, nor joint tenants, because there could be no survivor. The 1,000 acres was to be equally divided in quantity between them; then they must be tenants in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">I need not cite cases to show that if there are two tenants in common of four tracts of land, that upon partition, it is not necessary that <em>each </em>must have a part of <em>each </em>tract. Certainly if the whole together is equally divided, it is good, though one entire tract should fall into the lot of one, and another entire tract into the lot of the other; yet till the partition is made, they are tenants in common of the whole. But if the law was otherwise, it would not operate against the appellee; for as to <em>Thotnas\u2019s Adventure, </em>it is not separated by the will, nor by the act of the parties, and until it is, they can hold no other estate in it but as tenants in common.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b348-11\"><em>Pinkney, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"Aqmz\">A tenancy in common depends, not upon unity of interest, title or time, but upon unity of possession. <em>Thomas\u2019s Adventure </em>(which is the only tract for which the ejectment was brought) is not severed by the will, or by any act of the parties. There is no particular part of it of which <em>William </em>or <em>John Partridge </em>can be said to be <em>sole seised, </em>nor is either of them sole seised of the whole. Until a partition takes place, the distinct right of possession of the two tenants, as to <em>Thomas\u2019s Adventure </em>and <em>Thomas\u2019s Range, </em>(which contain <em>unequal quantities, </em>as well as <em>Good Luck </em>and the Glebe,) is not ascertained, and of consequence there is, and must be, a community of possession; neither knew his part, and of course neither can be separately seised ; and ip <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>virtue of their unity of possession they are tenants in Common.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b349-4\"><em>Martin, </em>(Attorney\u25a0'General,) for the Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"AO0x\">The devise to <em>William </em>and <em>John Partridge </em>cannot be determined to be a tenancy in Common, consistent with the plainest and most familiar principles of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The testator being seised of a body of land composed of tracts adjacent to each other, to wit, <em>Thomas\u2019s Adventure, </em>part of <em>Good Luck, Thomas\u2019s Range, </em>and the <em>GlebeLand, </em>devises the <em>Whole </em>to his sons <em>William </em>and <em>John, to </em>be divided equally in <em>quantity </em>without regard to <em>quality, </em>and declares his meaning to be, that <em>William </em>should have in his part all the <em>Glebe Land, </em>and <em>John </em>should have in his part, the plantation, to wit, the part of <em>Good Luck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The true construction of which is, that the whole body of land should be divided in two equal parts according to quantity, by a line or lines drawn there through, so as to leave the <em>plantation </em>on the one part, and the <em>Glebe Lands </em>on the other; and that <em>John </em>was to hold in severalty the half containing the <em>plantation, </em>and <em>William </em>the half containing the <em>Glebe Lands. </em>The testator doth not say that he gives the <em>Glebe Lands </em>to <em>William </em>and the <em>plantation </em>to <em>John, </em>and <em>then, </em>that he gives <em>Thomas\u2019s Range </em>and <em>Thomas\u2019s Adventure </em>to them, to be equally divided. The words equally divided, are expressly applied as much to the <em>Glebe Lands </em>and the <em>plantation, </em>as to the other tracts; they are applied to all the tracts as forming an aggregate whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Nor was it his intention that <em>Thomas\u2019s Range </em>and <em>Thomas\u2019s Adventure, </em>should be equally divided between <em>William </em>and <em>John. </em>He only intended so much of them should be annexed to the <em>Glebe Lands </em>as would make the number of acres to <em>William, equal </em>to the number of acres held by <em>John, </em>contained in <em>Good Luck, </em>and the residuary part of <em>Thomas\u2019s Adventure </em>and <em>Thomas\u2019s </em>Range. He also intended the part of <em>Thomas\u2019s Range </em>and <em>Thomas\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>Adventure, </em>which should be held by <em>William, </em>should be the part adjacent and most convenient to the <em>Glebe Lands, </em>and the part of those tracts which should be held by <em>John, </em>that which was adjacent to, and most convenient to the <em>plantation, </em>or the part of <em>Good Luck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The direction that the lands were to be equally divided in <em>quuntity </em>without regard to <em>quality, </em>also prove the testator had no design to create a tenancy in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Tenants in common are to have lands divided, having regard both to <em>quantity </em>and <em>quality.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">Each tenant in common has an equal interest in the lands, wherever situate, and an equal chance to have the lands in any part allotted to them on a partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">If one tenant in common enters upon any part of the land and makes a profit, the other tenant can compel him tolUccount for a share of those profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">But in the present case, the lands are not to be divided with regard to <em>quality.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"b350-14\">\n<em>John</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p id=\"A-M\">had no interest in the <em>Glebe Lands, </em>nor in a certain part of <em>Thomas's Range </em>and <em>Thomas's Adventure, </em>adjacent and convenient to the <em>Glebe Lands; </em>nor had <em>William </em>any interest in the <em>plantation, </em>and the other parts of <em>Thomas's Adventure </em>and <em>Thomas's Range; </em>nor could <em>John </em>have had the <em>Glebe Lands </em>and the portion of <em>Thomas's Adventure </em>and <em>Thomas's Range, </em>next adjacent, allotted to him on a partition; nor could <em>William </em>have the other part allotted to him.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b350-15\">\n<em>William</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p id=\"Ayh\">had, from the first, a right to enter into the <em>Glebe Lands, </em>and a portion of the other lands adjoining, and take the profits without accounting to <em>John; </em>so had <em>John </em>a right to enter into the other parts and take the profits without accounting to <em>William; </em>each would have been trespassers had they entered upon the other parts respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-16\">A man possessed of lands lying together, devises them to be equally divided between his two sons in <em>quantity, </em>without regard to quality, the eastern half to his son <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number><em>A. </em>and the western to his son <em>B., </em>they are not tenants in common, but tenants in severalty, each of their half.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">The difficulty of ascertaining a division line in this or any other case, has no effect upon the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The devise in the present case, directs the land to be laid off in two equal halves, leaving the <em>Glebe Lands </em>in one half, and his <em>plantation </em>in the other; and gives <em>John </em>the half in which his <em>plantation </em>is, and the other half to <em>William. </em>They take their respective proportions in severalty, allotted by the testator, not to be allotted on a writ of partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the general court at <em>June </em>term, 1796.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b351-13\">Martin, (Attorney-General,) for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b351-14\">Cooke, <em>Hollingsworth </em>and Pinkney, for the appellees.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
