This act prescribes a precise and particular form which must be substantially complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The justices, in making the certificate, act <em>ministerially </em>and not judicially.</p>\n<p id=\"AhTM\">Whether the form prescribed by the act of assembly has been pursued, mu3t depend on an inspection of the certificate, and comparing it with the act It can derive* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>no aid or support from possession having been held under it. Long uninterrupted possession creates a presumption that every thing has been legally transacted ; but that presumption is encountered and defeated by resorting to the deed, and inspecting the certificate, which in this case appears to be defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">A deed, to be good, and operate as such, must be acknowledged to be the deed of the party. The writing in question is not acknowledged by the <em>feme to </em>be her <em>d\u00e9sela</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">No inference or implication can arise from the words <em>u </em>that she acknowledges the lands to be the right and estate of the party, his heirs and assigns,\u201d to make it her acknowledgment of the deed; nor can it be made a good acknowledgment by the concluding words, \u201c according to act of assemblyfor that is the judgment or deduction of the justices, and is not warranted by the preceding part of the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The defendant brought a writ of error to the court of appeals, but for want of prosecution the case was nonprossed in that court at <em>June </em>term, \u00ed \u00a1T98.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
