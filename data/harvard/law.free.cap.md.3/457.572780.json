That the witnesses went into the next room, which was on the same floor, to sign ; and the deponent, <em>Jannet Vayne </em>and Mrs. <em>Williamson, </em>signed their names to the will; but did not recollect they were'requested to go there.

The deponent further declared that Mrs. <em>Lux </em>was in bed when she signed the will, and set up i\u00f1 hed to sign it: the room where the witnesses signed adjoined that where Mrs. <em>Lux </em>lay when she signed the will; that the door was opep, hut the bed in which Mrs. <em>Lux </em>lay was so situated she could not have seen the witnesses sign as she lay wh\u00e9n they left the room. That Mrs. <em>Lux </em>was very ill, and complained of being\u201d hardly able to write. Mrs. <em>Vayne </em>proposed that some person should write her name, which the deponent supposed was on account of her weakness. That she does <em>not know </em>Mrs. <em>Litx got </em>out of bed whilst the witnesses were attesting the will, and believed she was not able to get out of bed without assistance, and that if she had gbfc out of bed, the deponent must have heard her; that after Mrs. <em>Lux </em>had signed the will, she immediately lay down in bed. The witnesses went into the other room to subscribe the will, and, immediately after subscribing, the deponent returned into the room and found her in bed in the same situation they had left her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-3\">\u201c It was ato\u00f3 proved by the testimony of <em>Elizabeth Williamson, </em>another subscribing witness to the will, that her name, subscribed to the attestation of the will of Mrs. <em>Lux, </em>is her hand-writing, but that she did not see Mrs. <em>Lux </em>sign the will; that the witness knew nothing of Mrs, <em>Lux\u2019s </em>intention to execute a will, till she was called from below stairs into her room to be a witness; she did not. recollect who called her up, nor that any other persons were in Mrs. <em>L:-x\u2019s </em>room except the witnesses and Mn <em>William </em>Russell. That the witnesses were asked into' another froom to subscribe their names, arid were only absent while they were signing their names, \u00e1nd returned again to Mrs. <em>Lux </em>in a few minutes; that Mr. <em>Russell </em>was present with the witnesses in the room where they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>signed, and laid the will on the desk, and directed them to see each other sign, and while the witnesses were signing no person was in the room with Mrs. <em>Lux; </em>that the deponent came to Mr. <em>Lux's </em>house the day before and found Mrs. Ltofill, who had been taken with a vomiting of blood ; that she was as weak as she could be to live, and could not have got out of bed without assistance, and that it was not possible she could see the witnesses subscribe from the bed in which she lay. That after the will was subscribed by the witnesses, it was returned to Mrs. <em>Lux </em>by Mr. <em>Russell; </em>that the deponent continued with Mrs. <em>Lax </em>some days after, who was confined to her chamber in a very weak state, and had no conversation tvith her on the subject of her will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-17\">\u201c It was also proved by the testimony of <em>Jannet </em>Vayne, another subscribing witness to the will, that her name, subscribed to the will of Mrs. Lux, is her hand-writing j that the witness saw Mrs. <em>Lux </em>sign the will, and declared the same to be her will, and saw the other witnesses subscribe their names ; that Mrs. <em>Lux </em>was at the time in a very weak state, and raised herself up to sign her name with difficulty, and said she did not know if she should be able to do it. The deponent believed it impossible for her to get out of bed without assistance 3 that the witnesses to the will Went into another room to sign their names, and that it was not possible for her to see them, in the position in which she lay, subscribe their names. That they were but a short time in the room where they signed their names, and when returned to Mrs. Lux, they-found her laying in the bed where they had left her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-19\">\u201c It was also proved by the testimony of <em>Richardson </em>Stewart., that some time after the bill filed in chancery he was showed the room, and the bed, and the position of the said bed, as it was alleged by <em>Mary </em>Chambers, in which Mrs. <em>Lux </em>lay at the time she executed her will, and also the room and position of the desk when the V/itnesses to the will subscribed their names, at which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>they wrote; th\u00e1t from the bed he could not see the desk in the other room ; that <em>Mary Chambers </em>set down at the desk to write, where she alleged the witnesses set when they subscribed the will; and he stretched himself over the foot of the bed as far as he could, and could then only see the skirt of Miss <em>Chambers\u2019s </em>petticoat as she sat at the desk, but could not see her write; that when he made his observations the bed was not removed from the. wall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-4\">\u201c It tvas further proved by the testimony of <em>Samuel Johnson, </em>Esq. that he drew the will of Mrs. <em>Lux </em>from minutes delivered to him by Mr. <em>Russell, </em>and agreeable thereto; that Mr. <em>Russell </em>urged him at the time to use expedition, lest Mrs. <em>Lux </em>should not be able, or be in a situation to execute it, and seemed anxious to have the will ready and executed with the least possible delay j and that the said will was delivered to the said <em>William .Russell, </em>who was, at the time, and had been for some years before, one of the justices of the orphans\u2019 court of <em>Baltimore </em>county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-5\">\u201c It was also given in evidence, by the subscribing witnesses to the said will, that they formed their opinion of Mrs. <em>Lux's </em>being unable without assistance to leave her bed, from their general idea of her situation and apparent weakness, and not from any exertions they had seen her make for that purpose, and failing therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-6\">The court also certify the evidence of Mrs. <em>Mary Robinson, </em>as contained in her deposition taken on a commission sent to <em>Philadelphia. </em>[The testimony of Mrs. <em>Robinson </em>is, that she was acquainted with Mrs. <em>Lux </em>from the year 1778, to the day of her death, and that there subsisted the most strict intimacy and friendship between them; that Mrs. <em>Lux </em>died in <em>Philadelphia </em>on or about the 8th or 9th of <em>February, </em>1790. That she had repeated conversations with Mrs. <em>Lux </em>respecting her having made a will; but that Mrs. <em>Lux </em>never mentioned anything about it to her in the presence of a third person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>excepting on the afternoon of the day on which she died, and then in the presence of her husband, Mr. <em>George Lux. </em>She said she had neglected some small matters in , _ her will, and wished either her said husband or the witness to take a memorandum thereof, upon which Mr. <em>Lux </em>did take a memorandum as Mrs. <em>Lux </em>had de\u00bb scribed. That at other times when Mrs. <em>Lux </em>and herself were together, she mentioned the particulars of her will to her, and asked her her opinion of the legacy she had left Miss <em>Bird, </em>and of that to the children of Mr. <em>Russell, </em>and upon the witness expressing her approbation thereof, Mrs. <em>Lux </em>declared that she was very happy therein, and all her friends approved of what she had done. And Mrs. <em>Lux </em>acquainted the witness that Mr. <em>Russell </em>had approved of her will, and had, before she executed itB taken the heads thereof to a gentleman of eminence in the law. That she knows <em>William </em>Russell, the defendant, and has had conversations with him respecting the will of Mrs. <em>Lux; </em>that the witness went from <em>Philadelphia ;to </em>Chatsworth, the seat of Mr. Lux, near Baltimore, <em>to </em>attend the funeral of Mrs. Lux, and that some time after the funeral, about the 15.th of February, 1/90, she and Mr. <em>Russell </em>being alone, he mentioned the will of Mrs. <em>Lux </em>in terms of approbation, and said that she, the wit\u00bb ness, might make herself easy as to the will, and that she might acquaint Mr. <em>Biddle's </em>family, in Philadelphia, that all the wishes of the deceased should be complied with, jt being in his power to have her will executed in conformity to those wishes, and that he would do so.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-10\">\u201c Whereupon the court, at the instance of the defendant\u2019s counsel, gave the following opinion, and direction to the jury, viz. * All the necessary forms to the due execution of this will are agreed to have been complied with, except that of the witnesses subscribing, as such, in the presence of the testatrix.

On that day, after hearing the counsel on each side, the chancellor thought proper to postpone the final hearing until the defendants should have an opportunity of obtaining a certificate from the judges of the general court, stating their opinion of the said finding. A certificate has accordingly been obtained from two of the said judges, stating the whole proceedings on the trial, the evidence, the direction of the court, and the explanation of that direction, which appears not at first to have been understood. They do not expressly say that the finding of the jury was inconsistent with their direction, but, from a view of the evidence, the direction and explanation, the chancel lor cannot conceive otherwise than that the finding of the jury in favour of the complainant was not, in the opinion of the judges, warranted by the evidence. The chancellor cannot but regret that the aforesaid opinion of the judges does not coincide with his own sentiments j he apprehends that agreeably to the principle of sundry decisions in <em>England, </em>the will of <em>Catharine Lux </em>was attested in the manner prescribed by the statute. The law cannot, he presumes, admit of such distinctions as these \u2014 -the attesting a will in the same room with the testator shall be good, although the testator\u2019s face was turned from the witnesses \u2014 -so likewise \u201c the attesting a will shall be good, although the testator was not in the house with the witnesses, nor actually saw the attestation, provided only he could have seen the attestation from the coach in which he sat during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>transaction. But the signing of the witnesses in s room communicating by a door with, and divided by a partition <em>from, </em>the room in which the testator stood, sat or lay, shall not be good, unless the testator, without moving from the spot where he stood, sat, or lay, might have seen the signing had he been disposed to look that way.\u201d The requisite of law is the presence of the testator. There is no certain precise definition of the word presence ; but the chancellor conceives the true meaning of the law to be this; that the witnesses, at the request of the testator, shall immediately proceed to the attestation, without any material change of place, or interval of time, or intervening material circumstances, and that the testator, at the moment, shall be conscious of what the witnesses are about. A testator is sitting with his face towards the chimney place, and the witnesses attesting behind his back, in a distant corner of the room ; this shall be good, provided there was only vacant space between him and the witnesses. This is admitted: but can it be supposed that, if at the instant before the signing, a screen were accidentally interposed between the testator and witnesses, the attestation would be therefore bad ? certainly not. As the chancellor does not think it proper for him, on a point of law, to decide contrary to the opinion of the judges of the general court, or, on their opinion, to decree against his own sentiments, he proposes that the <em>&gt; </em>case be stated for the opinion of the judges of the court of appeals. <em>Not that he </em>presumes <em>he </em>has a right to demand an opinion from the judges of a superior court; but that he hopes, under the peculiar circumstances of this case, their honours will deem it not improper to give an opinion, which will be decisive. Should they decline it, the chancellor must, in the end, determine according to his own conscience.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-4\">A. <em>C. </em>Hanson, <em>Chancellor.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-5\">It is presumed the court of appeals did not'give the opinion requested by the chancellor 3 for he afterward^, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>at <em>February </em>term, 1793, made viz. the following decree,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AUu\">\u201c This cause standing ready for a final decision on the equity, and being submitted to the chancellor, the bill, answers, and all other proceedings were by the chancellor read and considered 5 and all the matters stated in the bill, except the due execution of the last will and testament of <em>Catharine Lux, </em>being admitted by the answers; and the conscience of the chancellor being satisfied, from' the transcripts and certificates of the proceedings in the general court, relative to the issue directed to be there tried, that the said last will and testament was duly executed in the manner required by the statute of frauds and perjuries in the case of a will for passing land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-7\">\u201c <em>It is thereupon, </em>this 15th day of <em>April, </em>1793, by <em>Alexander Contee </em>Hanson, chancellor, and by the authority of this court, adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the defendant, <em>William Russell, </em>do execute the trust reposed in him by the deeds in the bill mentioned, and the last will and testament aforesaid, and pursue the directions in the said will contained relative to the complainant, and that the said defendant and trustee, <em>William Russell, </em>do account with the complainant, <em>Moor Falls, </em>for the annual sums or interest, which, agreeably to the said deeds of trust, and the directions of the said last will and testament, ought to have been paid, and are in equity due to the complainant; and that the auditor of this court do state the said account, and return to this court, subject to the objections of each party, and to be done with as the chancellor shall think proper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-8\">\u201c A.

If she could.not see from <em>this </em>situation, the will is bad.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-10\">To construe the word situation to mean such a situation as the testatrix might have been in from <em>change </em>of place, will destroy the statute, and make any will good.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-11\">The witnesses might sign in a room below stairs, or in another house, and it may be said the will is good, because the testator might have removed from the situation in which he was, to such a situation as might enable him to see.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-12\">But in this case, if the law was so, there was a physical impossibility of the testatrix\u2019s getting from her bed. See the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-13\">The cases of the curtain, &amp;c. which says the testator might see, means in the situation he was in, and as it would be impossible to say whether he did or not, as he might see through the curtain, put it gently back, or remove a little the leaf, of the screen, it has been dete#<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>jnined from the almost impossibility of such negative proof, that the will was good.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ap9A\">But all the cases speak of the <em>then </em>situation of the testator, and none say, that if by moving to a different place he could see, though he could not where he was, that the will should be good.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-8\">The case in <em>Bro. Ch. </em>Rep. 99. proves this: the coach being <em>put back </em>so that the testatrix could, from her situation in the coach, see the office. But suppose the coach had not been put back, and she could not have seen from it, would the will have b 'en good, under the idea that she might have so changed her situation by putting back the coach as to have been enabled to See. Why was the circumstance of putting back the coach mentioned, or material? Only to show that by putting it back she might see in her then situation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-9\">Ours is nearly a similar case. The judges of the general court were of this opinion, and so the chancellor mentions. He differs from them; but his reasoning does not amount to prove what the law is, (which is manifest from all the cases,) but to induce an opinion that the law ought to be altered so as to validate this will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-10\">Though the chancellor has not expressed this, his reasoning in support of his opinion amounts to it.

I will admit that where the transaction is fair and open, the court ought, and have leaned in favour of the will: and that in some instances they have given a construction to the meaning of the words of the statute, in favour of the intention of the legislature to support a fair will where it was not possible there could be any fraud or mischief arise from such construction. But <em>those cases </em>are plainly distinguishable from the present; and if this will is supported, one of the strongest guards imposed by the statute is wholly evaded and rendered of no effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-9\">Soon after the passing of the statute a question arose about what was <em>a signing </em>within the words of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-10\"><em>Stanly </em>wrote his will in his own hand, and upon a single sheet of paper: \u201c <em>I John Stanly? &amp;c. </em>put his seal, and it was subscribed in his presence by three witnesses. 3 <em>Lev. </em>1. 1 <em>Eq.

It is a positive regulation, and cannot be dispensed with no more than the signing by the testator, or that the will must be written. But perhaps it was intended to prevent interpolation, to prevent putting in other clauses, &amp;c. 1 he testator must be in such a situation that he <em>may </em>see. But if changing his position is necessary to enable him to see, it is void. Powell, 92. and cases cited, and 1 <em>Bro. Parl.

It is admitted that the general court appointed to hear a motion for a new trial at the next term; that before that term, the chancellor took up the cause on the application of <em>Moor </em>Falls, (the appellee,) on producing a transcript from the clerk of the general court of the proceedings in said court; .and that the chancellor did not grant a new trial, as requested by <em>Lux </em>and Russell, (the appellants,) and that afterwards the chancellor decreed in favour of the <em>will; </em>and from this decree <em>Lux </em>and <em>Russell </em>appealed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-6\">It is contended on the part of <em>Moor Falls, </em>(the appellee,) that the court of appeals are not to take any, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>least notice of the direction of the general court, or of their explanation of their direction to the jury ;or of the certificate of the judges, and their state of the evidence; or of the application to the chancellor for a new trial, and his refusal to grant it, for the following reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-3\">1. Because the direction of the court is not according to the law, and the verdict of the jury is agreeable to it; that the direction of the court, with their explanation, is contrary to the law <em>; </em>that the chancellor was not bound by the opinion of the court as to the law, but if he thought they were mistaken in the law, (as they certainly were,) he was obliged in duty to decree as the law appeared to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-4\">2. Because the evidence might appear different to the jury from what it did to the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-5\">3. Because the rule, <em>(Powell on </em>Devises, 92.) that if the testator might see the witnesses, or if it was in his power to see them, that what they do shall be construed to be done in his presence, is a rule of presumption of evidence, and not a presumption of law, and this presumption of evidence the jury might properly make in a fair and honest transaction, (as the present case,) when the court might not make the same presumption. <em>Vide 7 </em>Bro. 272.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-6\">4. Because there was no appeal from the refusal of the chancellor to grant a new trial, but only from his final decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-7\">If the court of chancery grant a new trial, an appeal will lie from such order. 4 <em>Bro. </em>614. 3 <em>Bro.

It was argued that the party should have appealed from refusal of new trial, inistead of proceeding to hearing of the cause. 7 <em>Bro. </em>505.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmC\">An issue directed and verdict not a literal answer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the issue, and no application for a new trial, and a decree that the will be established, and the trusts thereof be \u201e . performed, and the appeal from the decree dismissed. 7 <em>Bro. </em>511.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-8\">If the verdict was contrary to law it could only be set right by a new trial, to be granted by the chancellor, and as he refused to grant it on the application of the appellants, they ought to have appealed from such refusal, and have now by their own neglect lost the benefit of such objection. As the appeal is only from the final decree on the equity reserved, the only question that can arise properly is this, whether the decree is erroneous or not ? The decision of this question must depend on this other consideration alone, whether the verdict is complete, and answers the issue directed? or, in other words, whether the verdict found that the will of Mrs, <em>Lux </em>was duly executed in the manner required by the statute of frauds and perjuries ? It is immaterial whether the verdict was. contrary to the direction of the general court, and their explanation, even on the admission that they were according to law, because, if the verdict was contrary to the law, it could only be corrected by a new trial, which the chancellor only could grant or refuse. Under this impression it will only be necessary to show that the verdict was complete and perfect, and answers the issue. Every verdict is general or special. <em>Co. Lit. </em>226. b. A general verdict is where the whole matter in issue is found generally, <em>e. g. </em>as guilty or not guilty, <em>a sumpsit </em>or <em>non </em>assumpsit, or for plaintiff or for defendant, which is precisely the same thing as guilty or not guilty, fee. &amp;c. A special verdict is when the matter in issue is found specially, <em>e g. </em>where the jury find only the matter of fact, and submit some question of law arising on the fact to the court. In a special verdict the jury state the naked facts as they find them to be proved, and pr \u00a1y the advice of the court thereon, concluding conditionally, that if, upon the whole matter, the court shall be of opinion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>the plaintiff had cause of action, they then find for the <em>plaintiff; </em>if otherwise, for the defendant. 3 <em>Bl.

That Mrs. <em>Lux </em>might have seen the \u2022witnesses sign, provided, ,&amp;c. but they conclude with \u25a0finding a verdict for the plaintiff, <em>i. e. </em>that Mrs. <em>Lux </em>did make and execute a paper, &amp;c. in the words of the issue, and so such a verdict would be entered. It is impossible to contend that the verdict is a special <em>verdict; </em>lo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Because the matter in issue, viz. whether Mrs. <em>Lux </em>made, &amp;c. is not found specially.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-3\">2. Because the jury do not find matter of fact only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-4\">3. Because the jury do not submit any question of law arising on the fact to the court; and,</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-5\">Lastly, because they conclude by finding generally for the plaintiff; that is, that Mrs. <em>Lux </em>did make, &amp;c. and such general finding is precisely the same thing as if the verdict had been expressed in such words at length; if it had, such conclusion would be, that as she might have seen the witnesses sign, provided she had made exertion, that she did see them sign; and if admitted to be contradictory, (which it is not,) the former part would be rejected as surplusage. It is incumbent on the appellants to show that the verdict is imperfect and incomplete. The conclusion is a complete and perfect finding for the plaintiff Does the former matter control or destroy the general finding ? The verdict is agreeable to the direction of the court, and the direction of the court, without the explanation, was according to law. But if the court consider it proper, on the present appeal from the decree, to pay no regard to the verdict of the jury, and to determine whether, from the evidence stated in the judges\u2019 certificate, and the circumstances found by the jury, the will of Mrs. <em>Lux </em>was attested and subscribed by the witnesses in her presence, the appellee considers that the evidence well justifies the conclusion that Mrs. <em>Lux's </em>will was attested in her presence. It is admitted that the finding of the jury in favour of <em>Moor Falls, </em>the plaintiff, was not, in the opinion of the judges of the general court, warranted by the evidence. The chancellor was of a different opinion, and he was ultimately to decide the law. The following facts were admitted by the answer of <em>Lux </em>and <em>Russell, </em>and also on the triaL</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALF\">1. That the will was in writing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-6\">?;\u2022 That it was signed by Mrs, <em>Lux.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>3. That it was attested and subscribed by three credible witnesses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-3\">The only fact in controversy on the trial \u00bbvao, whether the will was attested and subscribed by the witnesses in the presence of Mrs. <em>Lux. </em>The evidence as to this fact was, 1. That alter Mrs. <em>Luo; </em>executed her will, the witnesses, for the convenience of subscribing the will, went into a room on the same floor, which adjoined that in which Mrs. <em>Lux </em>lay, very ill and very weak on a bed, when the witnesses left the room ; that the door leading from the one room to the other was open from the time the witnesses went out of Mrs. <em>Lux\u2019s </em>room until after they attested the will, and returned in a few minutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-4\">2. That Mrs. <em>Lux </em>could not see from the bed, laying Oil it, the witnesses when they subscribed her will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-5\">3. That there is no evidence that Mrs. <em>Lux </em>moved from the place in her bed in which she lay, when the witnesses left the room.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-6\">4. That Mrs. <em>Lux </em>might have seen (or that it was iu her power to have seen) the witnesses when they subscribed her will, from the room in which she was, if she had made an exertion for that purpose,</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-7\"><em>5. </em>That the will, immediately after it was attested, ivas returned to Mrs. <em>Lux </em>by Mr. Russell, the trustee in the will. It is contended by the counsel for the appellants, that it was necessary that Mrs. <em>Lux, </em>at the time of the attesting the will by the witnesses, might have seen them without changing the <em>position; </em>that is, without changing the situation of her body from the place she lay in the bed. The counsel for the appellee contend, that it is sufficient, if it was in the power of Mrs. <em>Lux </em>to have seen the witnesses when they subscribed her will, from the room in which she was, although she did not actually see the witnesses at the time. The requisites prescribed by the statute of frauds and perjuries, is the attestation of the witnesses in the presence of the testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>'tor; but there is no precise definition in any of the law books, of the word <em>presence.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN8o\">The statute of frauds and perjuries (s. 5.) requires four circumstances in the case of a devise of lands ; 1st. That the will be in <em>writing; </em>2d. That it be signed by the testator, or by some person in bis presence, and by his direction ; 3d. That it be attested and subscribed by three or four credible witnesses; 4th. That it be so attested in the presence of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-5\">Although the statute has rendered these four circumstances necessary to the validiiy of a will of land, yet it is frequently a question in courts of law and equity, \u201c where in legal construction these requisites have been complied with, e. <em>g. </em>The second solemnity required by the statute is that the will be signed by the testator. In a few years after making the statute, (33 <em>Car. </em>II. See <em>Eq. Ab. </em>403. 409. 3 <em>Mod. </em>219.) doubts were entertained as to what the legislature meant by the wo: d <em>signing; </em>whether it should be constiued in its strict cense, and by analogy to other instruments, or whether it should be liberally expounded, and left open as a question of construction upon intention to be inferred from the facts and circumstances attending each particular case. On the latter principle courts of law put a liberal construction on the word signing by the testator, and held that the name of the testator being written by himself in any part of the will was a sufficient signing within the statute. <em>Powell, </em>61, 62. This construction upon the word <em>signed </em>was apparently eentrary to the natural import and received interpretation thereof. 1 he word <em>signing </em>is a mere simple idea, viz. the writing the name of the agent at the bottom of the act. This construction was to favour alienation by will. The third and fourth .solemnities required by the statute are the attestation and subscription, in the presence of the devisor, by three or more witnesses. The liberal construction which the \u00abcurte put upon the word <em>signing </em>necessarily raised a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>question upon the import of the word attesting, as applied to the will. 1st. Whether the witnesses were to attest the very act of signing, or whether an acknowledgment by the testator that the act was done by him, and that it was his hand-writing, was not sufficient to enable the witnesses to <em>attest; </em>and it was held that the acknowledgment was sufficient. Powell, 72. 74. 3 <em>P. Wms. 253. </em>2 <em>Vez. 454. </em>2d. Whether the witnesses are to attest and subscribe at one and the same time ? and held that it might be at different times. Powell, 110\u2014112.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArE\">3d. The next question was on the words \u201c in the presence of the testatorand the courts held that <em>in the presence </em>was synonymous to <em>within the view ; </em>that is, that it was within the power of the testator to see ; that he might see, but not necessary that he should actually see. <em>Salk. </em>688. <em>Garth. 81. 1 Eq. Ab. 403. Powell, </em>90. 3 <em>Salk. 395. Nicholas </em>v. <em>Smirk. </em>If it v\u00edas possible for the testator to see the witnesses subscribe \u2014 -the rule is, if it is in the power of the testator to see the witnesses, what is done shall be construed to be done in his presence. <em>Powell, 92. </em>If not possible, <em>ahter. </em>See cases put, Powell, <em>92. </em>(bottom.) 93, 94. All these instances show that ever since the statute, the courts of law and equity will lean in support of a fair will, and not defeat it for a slip in form, where the meaning of the statute has been complied with. Powell, 97. <em>Doug. </em>241. Whether witnesses attest in the presence of the testator, is a fact for the consideration of the jury upon all the circumstances of the case. Powell, 98. <em>Com. Rep. </em>531. Characters of witnesses is one circumstance. The rule that if the testator might see, or that if it was in his power to see that the act was done in his presence, is a rule of presumption of evidence, not a presumption of law, and every presumption of evidence or law must stand <em>donee probatur in contrariara. 2 Bro. Ch. Gas. </em>516, 517. Under this idea, when proof is offered that it was in the power of the testator to see, the jury may and ought to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>that he did see; but when it is proved that it was not in his power, the conclusion fails. The case of curtains drawn, turning his back, shutting his eyes, &amp;c. &amp;c. all turn on this principle. All the cases are, 2 <em>Salk. </em>688. 1 <em>Eq. Ab. </em>403. pl. 8. cited <em>Carth. </em>81. <em>Comb. </em>158. and 3 <em>Mod. </em>359. 12 <em>Mod. 37. 3 Salk. 395. Esp. 188. </em>If not possible for the testator to see the witnesses subscribe the will, it is void. <em>Carth. 79. </em>S. C. <em>Comb. </em>156. 1 <em>Show. </em>89. <em>Cases temp.

It is not law that Mrs. <em>Lux </em>ought to have it in her power to see the witnesses attest her will, from her position in bed, nor supported by any one case cited by <em>Potuell on </em>Devises, from 93\u2014100. inclusive, but directly the contrary, if the cases are carefully examined. All the cases show that it is sufficient if from the place, or chamber, or room, the testator can see the witnesses when they subscribe his will. <em>Powell on </em>Devises, 92; says, \u201c Though the signing be in a room or chamber immediately contiguous, yet the devise will be void, unless the testator is in a position in which he can, if he please, without changing his situation, see the witnesses subscribe,\u201d and cites cases to maintain this opinion,, What Mr. <em>Powell </em>meant by the testator being in a position to see the witnesses subscribe without changing his situation, can only be ascertained by examining the authorities to which he refers, and none of them justify the argument of the counsel for the appellants, (or the opinion of the general court,) that the signing of the witnesses in a room, communicating with the room in which the testator might stand, set in a chair, or lay in a bed by a door which remained open during the transaction, shall not be good, but the will void, unless the testator might have seen the witnesses when they attested the will, without moving from the spot where he stood, sat or lay. The .case most applicable to the present is that of <em>Davy &amp; Nicholas </em>v. <em>Smithy </em>3 <em>Salk. 395. </em>and can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>not be distinguished from the case before the court, either in facts or principle.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AXpS\">\n<em>Martin,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAb\">(Attorney-General,) on the same side. In addition to the observations of the counsel who last addressed the court, I would add a few both as to the facts and the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-6\">First as to the facts. The judges of the general court\u2019s certificate doth not state the facts correctly. It was made out some time after the trial. There was no previous-communication between them and the appellee\u2019s counsel, for the purpose of refreshing their memories, and settling the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-7\">The witnesses who conceived that Mrs. <em>Lux, </em>from her position in bed, could not see them sign the will, spoke only from their general idea and recollection, at that distance of time, of the place where the bed stood, and where the table or desk stood, and not from any observations made by them at the time when the will was signed, to discover whether she could see them, as they declared} for they declared they did not know it was necessary she should be able to see them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-8\">A small difference as to the places of the bed or the desk from their ideas, might make a material difference as to the one object being visible from the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-9\">When <em>Richardson Stewart </em>made the experiment mentioned by him, the bed was standing close to the walls } but nothing is more probable than that Mrs. <em>Lux's </em>bed was removed at some distance from the adjacent walls, for the convenience of the nurses and servants having access to her for different occasions ; also Mr. <em>Stewart </em>had no knowledge where the bed or the desk were at the time of the signing, except by the information of <em>Mary Chambers, </em>who could, and did only, speak from her general recollection of circumstances which had long passed, and which were not then supposed, or attended to as material.</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>In opposition to the idea which the witnesses had of the extreme weakness of Mrs. Lux, which had induced one of them to think she could scarce write her name, the original will, which was before the jury, showed that she had written her name fairly, and with a steady hand, without any marks of such imbecility.</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-3\">It appears also from the evidence, as stated by the court, that Mr. Russell, a judge of the orphans\u2019 court, long in the habit of receiving the probate of wills, and perfectly and familiarly acquainted with the necessity of its being signed in the presence of the testatrix, was the person whom Mrs. <em>Lux </em>confided in, as her particular friend, to have her will properly prepared and executed, so as to effect such dispositions as she was anxious to make ; that he directed Mr. <em>Johnston to </em>draw it; when drawn, received it from Mr. Johnston, and with an apparent zeal undertook the whole charge of the execution. He was the person who took the witnesses into the adjoining room to sign the will; the will itself, as appears now on the record, in the form of the attestation, written thereon, states its being signed in the presence of the testatrix. Independent of his familiar knowledge of that circumstance being necessary, the form of the attestation of the paper, then in his hand, pointed out the necessity, and could not but have refreshed his memory ; the judges5 notes of the evidence show that he appeared very particular in pointing out the witnesses to sign in the presence of each other; can it be presumed he was less attentive to a circumstance so much more essential ? It must be supposed he took care to observe that the desk was in such a relative situation <em>kq </em>the bed, that the testatrix might see them ; that the door was left open (for it was left open) in order that it might be in her power <em>% </em>and that although the other witnesses, not knowing it was necessary, did not attend to that circumstance, he, who knew the necessity, and who had undertaken to have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>will properly executed, did attend to it. The will must, in this respect, have been well executed, or we must suppose he intentionally abused the confidence of Mrs. <em>Lux </em>in what might have been almost her last moments; and while he was ostentatiously professing to serve her, was privately defeating every anxious wish she had formed, intrusted to him, and which he had engaged to fulfil.</p>\n<p data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-5\">The execution of the will having been under the superintendance of Mr. <em>R. </em>and under such binding and confidential circumstances, is, to the human mind, a million of times stronger proof that it was duly executed, than the vague ideas of the witnesses as to the relative positions of the bed, &amp;c. and this was proper for the jury to consider, and was strongly urged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-6\">In <em>Com. Rep. </em>531. the witnesses to the will were all dead. The attestation did not state that it was signed in the presence of the testator. The court determined it was proper to be left to the jury; and one of the witnesses to the will having been a lawyer of good character, and, therefore, likely to know the necessity, and to see to the due execution of the will, is urged as a circumstance which ought to have weight.</p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-7\">Our case is infinitely stronger under all the circumstances ; ours is a judge of the orphans\u2019 court, well knowing the necessity, in the constant habit of taking probates of wills, and peculiarly confided in, and employed by one who considered him as her particular friend, to see every thing necessary and proper done to effect her last wishes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIqT\">As to the law. It is solemnly determined, and that by decisions soon after the statute of frauds, that it is not material whether die testator doth see the witnesses write their names, and so the court declared in this C^S6\u00ab</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-9\">The appellants rely on the position in <em>Powell </em>at the bottom of p. 92.</p>\n<p data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-10\">\u201c But though the signing be in a room or chamber immediately contiguous, the devise will be void unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>testator is in a position in which he can, if he please, without changing his situation, see the witnesses subscribe.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFo\">The law is so ; but all that is necessary is to determine what is meant by changing his situation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-6\">The man who is in bed, with curtains closely drawn, by opening the curtains might see the witnesses. The man who is sitting in the room with his back towards the table, by turning round might see ; where a screen happens to be intervened between the testator and the witnesses, the testator by removing a little the one way or the other might see, but in all these cases, in a strict sense of the word, a change of situation is necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-7\">The court by their explanation have declared that the per\u00bb son must be able to see the witnesses sign, without any change of position, meaning, if I can conceive their meaning, that there must be no change in the local position of the body of the testator, or any part of it; for if they will allow it in any part, it may be curious to know in what part; and if they will allow it in no part, then the opinion given is a <em>felo de se, </em>for, on such a construction, it would b&amp; impossible that the person should not see, provided he could see; since to see an object which in any position is not seen, must requir\u00e9 a change of the position of the body, or some part of the body. But perhaps the court means the testator might turn round ; yet this would be a change of his position. Perhaps they would let him stretch forward his neck to see; in that case there would also be a change of position, and it would also make the validity of a will depend on the length of a man\u2019s neck. Perhaps they only mean that the testator\u2019s feet shall remain firmly fixed to the spot, but to give him leave by every exertion of body, to project his head as far as possible in any directions to see the witnesses; in that case a tumbler would have a better chance than another in similar circumstances, because he might project his body its full length, and, by a dexte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>rous spring, <em>recover </em>his former position <em>; </em>and a man six foot long would have three chances that his will should be duly executed, where a man of four foot long would have but two, provided their dexterity was equal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An2\">To my conception there never was a more absurd opinion given, nor more contrary to the true meaning of the passage cited from <em>Powell.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-7\">An the position which was the groundwork of their opini n is taken frdm Powell, it is but fair that <em>Powell </em>should illustrate and explain it, which, in the following pages, he doth, and refers to a variety of cases. In explanation of this position, and to show what he means by that change of situation which is inadmissible, he goes on immediately in the following words : \u201c Thus where, on a trial at bar,\u201d &amp;c. and puts a number of cases, all which prove that by a change of situation, he means the testator must be able to see without leaving the room, the coach, the chamber, &amp;c. in which he is at the time, and not that he must be able to see without leaving the particular spot in the room, the coach, or the chamber, &amp;c. which hr might occupy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-8\">In the first case put, the will was signed by the testatrix in the bedchamber, the witnesses signed in the hall j to go to this hall they had to go into a passage, and to go down a flight of eight or ten winding stairs. The rooms were on different stories of the house, and no possibility of seeing from the bedchamber what was doing in the hall below. The case is express that it was \u201c not possible from her chamber to see what was done in the hallit is not said from the place where she sat or lay in her chamber. There was also positive proof that the testatrix did not leave her chamber.</p>\n<p data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-9\">So the next, the will was signed by the witnesses down stairs in another room, consequently, could not be seen from the room where the testator was.</p>\n<p data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-10\">In the third case from Shower, the court and counsel thought it a proper case for a special verdict, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>jury there obstinately found against the will, for which they are censured in <em>Shorter.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADM5\">The statute of frauds was passed in the 29th of <em>Charles </em>II. The case in 2 <em>Shower </em>was in the 35th <em>Charles </em>II. This was the first case after the statute in which this point came in question. The court and counsel wished for a special verdict, that it might be considered and the law settled. But the jury finding a general verdict against the will, and persisting therein, was in that case conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-6\">The next case was that of <em>Shiers </em>and Glascock, Powell, 91. which was about four or five years after, to wit, the 3 <em>Jac. </em>II. There the court settled the principle, and the decisions have been consonant ever since. There is reason to believe had a special verdict been found in the case in 2 Shower, the court would have decided in favour of the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"181\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-8\">In the case of <em>Skiers </em>and Glascock, the witnesses went out of the room, passed through a lobby into a gallery <em>; </em>this lobby had glass doors and some panes broken; the case states that the testator might have seen from his bed, through the lobby and the broken glass, the table wh&lt; re the witnesses subscribed. It is not stated that he could see from the part of the bed where he then lay, or that, in the position he then lay, he could see without changing it; indeed, from the description, it is almost impossible that, laying horizontally on the bed, and without raising himself up therein, he could have seen the table, much less persons writing upon it; it is certain he could not see the paper in any manner so as to know its identity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"182\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-9\">In the case of <em>Davy </em>v. Nicholas, 3 <em>Salk. </em>395. Powell, 91. the witnesses left the room, went through a small passage into another room, and signed it on a table standing in the middle, and opposite the <em>door; </em>both doors were open. The case states as a material circumstance, that the table stood opposite the door, for otherwise, as there was an intervening passage, the testator could <em>not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>have seen them from his <em>room. </em>But the case doth not state, nor was it necessary, that the bed of the testator was opposite to the other passage door, or that from the bed, or while the testator lay thereon, he could have seen the witnesses sign.</p>\n<p data-order=\"183\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-4\">The case of the lady who signed her will in the coach, <em>Fowelif </em>92. the witnesses returned into the lawyer\u2019s office to sign it; her coach having been put back opposite the window of the office, and it being proved by a person in the coach that the testatrix might have seen what passed, it was sufficient. No proof in this or the other cases, no pretence that she did actually <em>see; </em>no proof that she could have seen from the particular part of the coach on which she was seated. But if she might have seen from the coach it was sufficient. The coach necessarily put back to bring it into a situation similar to the case of a room or chamber.</p>\n<p data-order=\"184\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-5\">The one or the other must have a certain relative situation to the place where the witnesses sign, so that from the coach or from the room, &amp;c. they might be seen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"185\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-6\">Our case is stronger than either of these three. In ours, the witnesses signed in a room immediately adjoining, on the same floor; the door wide open. In each of the other cases, some intervening space between the room of the testator and the room where the witnesses signed,</p>\n<p data-order=\"186\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-7\">The design of the statute was, that a false will may not be palmed on the witnesses, or on the testator. In going from the bedroom through the lobby into the gallery, in the case of <em>Skiers </em>v. <em>Glascock; </em>from the bedroom through the passage into another chamber, in the case of <em>Davy </em>v. Nicholas, and from the coach into the lawyer\u2019s study or office, in the case of <em>Casson </em>v. <em>Dade$ </em>afforded as much opportunity for interposing a false will as there could possibly be in the present case; nor could those who made the respective wills in those cases, possibly, from any view they could have had, been more ca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>pable of distinguishing the identity of the paper signed, than Mrs. <em>Lux </em>in our case. Yet the courts there, satisfied the transactions were fair, held the statute of frauds suf- ... . ficiently complied with.</p>\n<p data-order=\"187\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-7\">Here is no possible doubt but the will is genuine; that is admitted by all; Mrs. <em>Lux </em>signed it; but a few moments intervened for the attestation; it was instantly brought back and delivered into her own hands, and all this under the immediate view and direction of her friend and confidant, who would prevent all imposition. And Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>in <em>Douglas\u2019s Rep. </em>241. <em>Powell, 97. </em>declares, when a will in other respects has been fairly and duly executed, its not being witnessed in the presence of the testator is but \u201c a slip in form,\u201d and the court will not defeat it, in any case where there is a measuring cast, and room for presumption.</p>\n<p data-order=\"188\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-8\">In fine, it is admitted that in our case the meaning of the statute has been fully complied with. A slip in form lias been alleged. The chancellor might have himself decided on the evidence ; or might have sent it to a jury to satisfy his conscience. He did the last. The question was fully investigated. The jury found the will duly executed as to its being signed in the presence of the testatrix. They had evidence from which they had a right, and they ought to have presumed it, in favour of a will admitted in ail other respects to be duly executed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"189\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-9\">Their finding, and the evidence, was consistent with the law, as originally declared by the court; as the court explained their opinion, that opinion was erroneous and absurd.</p>\n<p data-order=\"190\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-10\">The chancellor was satisfied with the verdict, both as <em>to </em>law and fact. His conscience was satisfied. It would \u25a0have been absurd to have granted anew trial, when, upon the facts, as disclosed, and the law, as by him rightly understood, the verdict was proper. But, if the appellants wished to have had a new trial, they ought not to have gone to final hearing, but have appealed for that cause. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Had they even then appealed, I am satisfied the consciences of the judges of the court of appeals would have been as well satisfied as was the chancellor\u2019s, and that they would have thought a new trial as unnecessary as the chancellor <em>did; </em>and that now they will sustain a conscientious and equitable decree, carrying into execution a will fairly and honourably executed, by a most amiable worthy lady, having a perfect right to make the disposition she made; a disposition which from many motives she was induced to make, and whose last moments would have been embittered, could she have supposed it would have been contested.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"191\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-5\"><em>Cooke, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"192\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHv\">In this case the chancellor might, if he pleased, have proceeded to the issuing a commission, and have brought the whole testimony before him in the first instance, upon which a decree might have passed. And upon such proceeding, an appeal, it is certain, would lay, and this court, having the evidence before them upon which the decree was founded, might certainly revise the case, and either affirm, reverse, or alter the decision as they should think justice required. But the chancellor has thought proper to order an issue to be tried to ascertain whether the will was executed in the manner and according to the directions of the statute of frauds. Upon the trial of which issue, a bill of exceptions was taken, upon which the whole evidence given is stated, and upon which the judges of the general court have given their directions, also stated, to the jury; a verdict was found, which is also stated, a motion for a new trial, and the rejection thereof, and final order and decree of the chancellor. And the defendants\u2019 objection is, that this court ought not to take notice of any of these facts,</p>\n<p data-order=\"193\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-6\">1st. Because the chancellor was not hound by the direction of the court to the jury, nor by their opinion of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"194\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-7\">I admit it. But the chancellor is as much bound by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the law as the general court were, and if he has erred in his judgment, this court ought to correct his decision. But how is this court to know whether he erred or not, unless the evidence is before them ? That evidence is now brought forward, and this court is no more bound by his opinion than he was by the opinion of the judges. They will respect the opinion of both; but judge for themselves from the evidence <em>given; </em>from the facts the law arises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"195\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-5\">2d. Because the evidence might appear different to the jury than to the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"196\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-6\">That is impossible. The evidence given to both was the same, and must appear the same. The jury might draw conclusions of fact from the evidence, but ought not of law; if they do, and it is erroneous, the court ought to correct it. The court do so at law, by setting aside the verdict, and granting a new trial, and may do so in chancery, by decreeing according to the evidence, where it is brought before the court stated upon a bill of exceptions; or of ordering a new trial, if from the report of the judge who tried the issue, he was dissatisfied with the verdict. But if the chancellor refuses a new trial, and proceeds to a decree where the evidence is made part of the proceedings, this court, having all the facts before them, may certainly correct any errors in that decree j but if no evidence is returned, and the chancellor refuses a new trial on motion, if the party does not appeal, but acquiesces in that dcteimination, and go on to a final hearing, this court would not probably have any evidence before them to show what the facts were but the verdict, and if it was a general verdict, it would show no facts at all upon which this court could act to correct errors which did not appear upon the general equity of the case. Our case, however, is quite otherwise ; all the facts do appear, and if there has been erro? in law, or fact, this court must correct it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"197\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Suppose a special verdict is found, upon which the chancellor decrees, will not an appeal lie from his decision ? There can be no doubt of it, and this court would correct such decree if erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"198\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-3\">Suppose the jury state the facts, and draw an erroneous conclusion in law, will not the court correct it ? But if the facts are stated on a bill of exceptions, has not the court the same power ? It would be strange, indeed, if they had not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"199\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-4\">3d. Because the fact, it is said, whether the testatrix could see the witnesses, is a presumption of evidence, and not of law, and this presumption the jury have a right to draw, and might do it different from the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"200\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-5\">Whether the testatrix did see or not, is certainly a presumption arising from evidence; but that she must be in a situation to be able to see without changing her position is the declaration of law ; otherwise, to say that if she had changed she might have seen, as the jury have said in this case, is in fact to defeat the law altogether j for a person might see if the witnesses had gone into another house, and she would have followed them. <em>But to </em>say that if she had changed she might have seen, is a negative strongly implied that as she did not^change, she could not see. But we add, further, there is proof she could not change, and, therefore, she could not see.</p>\n<p data-order=\"201\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-6\">4th. Because there ought to have been an appeal from the refusal to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"202\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-7\">All the cases cited to this point are very far from being similar to the case now before the <em>court; </em>most of them are cases where he chancellor ordered a new trial, <em>(7 Bro. </em>272. 4 <em>Bro. </em>614. 3 <em>Bro. </em>220. 5 <em>Bro. </em>191. <em>7 Bro. </em>208.) and that order was appealed from. In most of these cases the judge and the chancellor were of the same opinion as to the verdict, and in no instance was there a verdict given against the- opinion of the judge upon any point of law, nor in any instance cited any bill of exceptions stating the evidence. These, toe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Were all cases of simple facts before the jury, and genefal verdicts given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"203\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajx\">The other cases cited, (6 <em>Bro. </em>442. <em>7 Bro. </em>9. 243. 522. 505.) are cases where a new trial was refused <em>\u00a1 </em>but in all of them there were further orders and decrees made, merely on the refusal to grant a new trial. Upon a motion for new trial, if it is refused, there is no order or decree made, and, consequently, no appeal could lie on the mere refusal; but if the chancellor then goes on to make an order, or decree, on the merits, there may be an appeal, and upon that appeal the propriety of refusing the new trial in the cases cited was argued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"204\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-6\">In one case, <em>(7 Bro. </em>243.) in the argument of counsel, it is said that the party ought to have appealed from the refusal to grant a new trial, and that, as he acquiesced in that refusal, and was satisfied with it, it was too late to object to the verdict on an appeal from the decree on the final equity. But in that case, both the judge, who tried the cause, and the chancellor, were satisfied with the verdict, and there is nothing in the case to show that the decree was affirmed, because the party omitted to appeal when a new trial was refused.</p>\n<p data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-7\">I have carefully examined, and there is no <em>dictum </em>in any book, which says the objection against the verdict v/ill not lie upon an appeal from a decree on the merits, and I add, it is impossible the law should be so, if it appears upon the record what the evidence was upon, which that verdict was given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"206\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-8\">Because it appears there has been appeals in cases where, by an order of the court, a new trial was granted, and where it has been refused, and another order made, as in the case now before the court, (see <em>7 </em>Bro. 9. 505. 6 <em>Bro. </em>442.) does that prove that no objection will lie to the verdict upon an appeal from the final decree? Why was not that objection made in <em>7 Bro. </em>9. 505. and 6 <em>Bro. </em>442.? In those cases, upon an appeal on subsequent orders, the house of lords rectified the arder respecting a new trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"207\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWAk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>It is said this is a general verdict, and that the jury having stated the evidence was surplusage, and ought to be rejected. But I differ widely from this assertion, and think the law quite the contrary; for if a jury state the facts, and draw a wrong conclusion, the court will set aside the verdict in all cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"208\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-3\">But I care not whether this was a general or a special verdict. It was taken merely to satisfy the\" conscience of the court. The court was not bound by it if the verdict had been much more general, but might have decreed even against the verdict. The court could be under no restraint to do so, after the whole evidence was returned to the chancellor. Nor can this court be restrained, having fully the means of judging upon the whole case whether the jury or the chancellor erred upon the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"209\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-4\">If the chancellor was not concluded by the verdict, but might have directed a new trial, or even decreed against it, certainly this court, knowing the facts, may do the same, or they have not the power of doing complete justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"210\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-5\">It is, then, only to be considered whether this will was executed as the statute of frauds directs. To this point I refer the court to my former argument; and, I think, dispassionately considered, the case will not admit of a doubt. If this court should think so also, their decree must be generally to reverse the final decree of the court of chancery.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"211\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b504-6\"><em>The decree of the Court of </em>Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">After hearing counsel on this appeal, <em>ordered and adjudged, </em>that the aforesaid decree, so by the said chancery court made and decreed, be reversed and annulled; and we do order and decree, that another trial be had therein before the judges of the general court upon the same issue; and it is further ordered by the court here, that a copy of this decree be transmitted by the clerk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>this court to the court of chancery, that the chancellor may cause justice to be done in the said suit between the said parties according to the tenor hereof, and the course of the said court: and that the court of chancery give .. . <em>r </em>. , . all necessary directions tor carrying the above into execution.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b505-6\">Jenings, <em>S.
