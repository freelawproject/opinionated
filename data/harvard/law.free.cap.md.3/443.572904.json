That the said <em>Walter </em>Evans, by virtue of the said patent, was seised and possessed of the said tract of land, and being so seised, on or about the 10th of <em>August, </em>1724, did execute a deed of conveyance to <em>James Herbert </em>and <em>Eleanor </em>his wife, by which he conveyed \u201c unto the said <em>James Herbert, </em>during his lifetime, and <em>Eleanor </em>his wife, and the heirs of her body, lawfully begotten, for ever, all the said <em>Walter </em>and <em>Ann </em>his wife\u2019s right of, in and to the aforesaid tract and parcel of land called <em>The Dunghill, </em>lying in <em>Prince George\u2019s </em>county aforesaid, beginning, &amp;c. including 100 acres j to have and to hold the said <em>Walter </em>and <em>Ann </em>their right of, in and to the aforesaid tract of land, with the premises and appurtenances, unto him the said <em>James </em>during his lifetime, and <em>Eleanor </em>his <em>wife, and heirs, </em>lawfully begotten, for ever, to the only proper use, benefit and behoof of them the said <em>James Herbert </em>and <em>Eleanor </em>his wife as aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-11\">It is further agreed that in virtue of the said deed, the said <em>James Herbert </em>and <em>Eleanor </em>his wife, (daughter of the said <em>Walter </em>Evans,) entered into the 100 acres mentioned in the declaration, and were seised and possessed thereof, and had issue <em>Wiliiam Herbert, </em>who is since dead without issue, and <em>Linney </em>Herbert, (now <em>Linney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Hopkins, and one of the lessors of the plaintiff,) and the said <em>James Herbert </em>departed this life, intestate, about ^ year <em>1740; </em>that his widow afterwards intermarried with a certain <em>William Pritchard, </em>by whom she had issue a daughter named <em>Mary Pritchard, </em>now <em>Mary </em>Housar, by virtue of her marriage with <em>Martin </em>Housar, which said <em>Mary </em>and <em>Martin </em>are lessors of the plaintiff, and, with <em>Linney Hopkins </em>aforesaid, claim the land mentioned in the declaration. That the said Mary, at the time of her first intermarriage with a certain <em>Nathan Offutt, </em>on the 2d <em>February, </em>1767, was of the age of 16 years, and no more, and that she continued under cover? ture until the month of May, in the year 1777, when the said <em>Nathan Offutt </em>died, and afterwards, some time in the month of <em>June, </em>1770, the said <em>Mary </em>intermarried with <em>Martin </em>Housar, her present husband. That <em>Linney Hopkins, </em>formerly <em>Linney </em>Herbert, intermarried with a certain <em>James Hopkins </em>some time in the year 1761, which said <em>James </em>departed this life in the year 1780.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-3\">It is further agreed that <em>Eleanor </em>Herbert, in the deed mentioned, after the death of her husband <em>James </em>Her? <em>bert, </em>continued in the possession of the premises until the time of her death, which happened in the year 1762, when she died intestate, and left issue as aforesaid. That <em>William Herbert, </em>the son, on the 19th of <em>October, </em>1753, made a deed of bargain and sale with warranty of the land in question to <em>Henry Threlkeld. </em>That afterwards, in the same year, the said <em>William Herbert left </em>this state, and died in the month of <em>April, </em>1783, intestate, and without issue, in <em>North Carolina. </em>That in the year 1762, after the death of the said <em>Eleanor, </em>the said <em>Henry Threlkeld </em>entered into the premises in virtue <em>of </em>the deed to him, and continued seised and possessed under the said deed until the time of his death in 1783, when he died intestate leaving the defendant, <em>John Threlkeld, </em>his only son and heir at latv, to whom the said land descend\u00bb</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>ed, and who hath been ever since the death of his father, and still is, seised and possessed of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AuiZ\">If, upon this state of the case, the court are of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled, then judgment, to be entered for possession and costs; if not, judgment of nonsuit to be entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-4\"><em>Cooke, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AG5\">On the 10th of <em>August, </em>1724, <em>Walter Evans </em>conveyed, in the <em>premises </em>of the deed, to \u201c <em>James </em>Herbert, during his life and the life of his wife <em>Eleanor, </em>and the heirs of her body,\u201d the premises in question. The <em>habendum </em>is, \u201c to the said <em>James, </em>during his life and the life of the said <em>Eleanor, </em>and her heirs, lawfully begotten.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-6\">This deed conveys no estate to <em>Eleanor, </em>unless by implication, either in the premises or in the <em>habendum. </em>If this is the construction, then the limitation to the heirs of <em>Eleanor, </em>in the habendum, is a <em>contingent </em>interest to vest in such person as should be her heir, at the time of her death, in fee-simple ; because the property passing by deed, the <em>habendum </em>does not limit of what body the heirs should be, it cannot be restrained by intendment to make it an estate tail. See 1 <em>P. Wms. 70. </em>2 Ld. Raym. 1144. <em>Salk. </em>620. <em>3 Salk. </em>336. <em>Cro. Eliz. </em>478. <em>Mo. </em>424. <em>Vin. Grant, </em>I. K. L. &amp; M. 3 <em>Bac.

And moreover, a descent has been cast by the death of <em>Henry Threlkeld, </em>and more than five years\u2019 adverse possession thereafter by his son, the present defendant. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-5\">A tenant in tail may discontinue, but he cannot disseise the heir; because the heir has no claim but in representation after his death. <em>Gilb.

Lit. </em>327. b. 328. a.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-8\">If the estate is discontinued, then the action of ejectment will not lie, and the heir is put to his <em>formedon. Runn. Eject. 12.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-9\">The lessor must have a right of entry to support an ejectment; therefore, if there be a descent cast, or a discontinuance, the issue is put to his <em>formedon. Runn. Eject. </em>11, 12. 3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>206.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJs\">I consider the general operation of the statute of limitations to be, that if there be a disseisin or ouster when there is no disability, it will overrun infancy or coverture which may afterwards intervene. But if the ouster is against an infant, &amp;c. then he has twenty years from the time of the ouster, or ten years after the disability is removed, as it may be most for his advantage. In this case, supposing the conveyance of the son, in 1753, did not operate as a disseisin, yet the tortious holding commenced in 1756, and continued after the death <em>o\u00ed Eleanor, </em>who died in 1762. It then commenced at least as against <em>William, </em>and all others claiming through him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-11\">If the issue of <em>Eleanor </em>took an estate in fee-simple, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>conveyance and warranty without assets is a bar to him, and all others claiming through him. If he would have taken an estate tail, then it operated as a discontinuance, and the action of ejectment will not lie. In either case, the tortious holding, and descent cast, would bar the right of entry, and the case seems not void of merits on the point of limitations.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-3\"><em>Duvall, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AG9U\">On the 10th of <em>August, </em>1?24, <em>Walter Evans </em>conveyed by deed to <em>James Herbert, </em>during his lifetime, and <em>Eleanor </em>his wife, and the heirs of her body, lawfully begotten, for ever, the land in question, being part of <em>The Dunghill. </em>These are the expressions in the premises of the deed. <em>Habendum </em>unto him the said <em>James, </em>during his lifetime, and <em>Eleanor </em>his wifea and heirs, lawfully begotten, for ever; as may be seen fay reference to the deed. Mr. <em>Cooke </em>is inaccurate in his state of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-4\">It must be admitted that the expressions of the deed are not clear and explicit, and the <em>habendum </em>is different from the premises. But taking the whole together, I think the intention is apparent, and I conceive that <em>the </em>words made use of are sufficiently clear to designate the estate intended to be given. In the creation of an estate tail, it is requisite that the words show from whose body the heirs must proceed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-5\">It appears to me that the deed above mentioned conveyed to <em>James Herbert </em>an estate for life in the land in dispute; remainder to his wife and her heirs in tail; Or it conveyed an estate for life to the husband and wife, remainder to her issue in tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-6\">To create an estate in tail, it is requisite that words be used to show from whose body the heirs must proceed. Such words are used in <em>Evans\u2019s </em>deedj the lands are given to <em>James Herbert </em>during his lifetime, and <em>Eleanor </em>bis wife, and the heirs of her body, lawfully begotten.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-7\">For the defendant, <em>1 </em>P. Wins. and several other author <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>j-Jt\u00edes are cited to prove that the deed conveyed a fee to the children of the wife. All the authorities cited speak of the same ease, which case is very different from that under consideration; it arose on a deed of surrender <em>ad opus et usum peedicti Zacharim </em>for his life, and after his decease, to the use of <em>Valentine </em>Cliffhis eldest son, and Alice, his wife, <em>pro et durante termino vitarum suarutn et htsredum et assignatorum prwdictorum Valentini et </em>Alicice, Sic.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-4\">If <em>Evans\u2019s </em>deed had conveyed the premises to <em>James Herbert </em>for life, and afterwards to his wife and her heirs and assigns, then the cases would have been similar, and in the cases cited the judges were divided in opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-5\">In all cases where a limitation in a deed has been adjudged in fee-simple, it has been for want of proper words to describe of what body the issue should be, and this is the reason given. In the case under consideration, it is plain that the heirs were to proceed from the body of <em>Eleanor </em>Herbert, who was a daughter of the donor, <em>Walter Evans.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-6\">If I am right in my construction of this deed, then the deed of <em>William </em>Herbert, the son, dated the 29th of <em>October., </em>1753, cannot work a discontinuance of the entail; because <em>William </em>was not <em>tenant </em>in life, his mother being then alive, and in possession of the premises, and she continued in possession until the time of her death, which happened in 1762.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP9\">The counsel for the defendant states, that tenant in tail may discontinue, &amp;c. but it will not be contended that the deed of the heir in tail, in the lifetime of the ancestor, and while the ancestor is seised and possessed, to a stranger, will discontinue the estate tail. The deed of <em>William </em>is wholly inoperative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-8\">The defendant\u2019s case, I apprehend, has no merits oa the point of limitations. Mrs. Herbert, the mother of the lessors, died seised in 1762, in the infancy of her children; and although they claim through her; and not through William, yet they had no right of action until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>after his death, which happened in 1783, and this ejectment was brought before a lapse of ten years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-4\">The defendant never entered until after the death of Mrs. <em>Herbe\u25a0 </em>t, in 1762; the lessor was then an infant, and married during her infancy, and she was a <em>feme covert </em>at the time of the death of her brother, and has continued so ever since.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-5\">The warranty cannot affect the lessors of the plaintiff, the son, <em>William </em>Herbert, not being in possession.
