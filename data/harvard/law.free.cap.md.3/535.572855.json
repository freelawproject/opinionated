If it did issue regularly, there can be no condemnation of the property returned in the schedule as attached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-14\">Out of the first objection two points arise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-15\">1st. That the act of assembly is unconstitutional so far as it relates to the property of the defendant, he being a citizen of another state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-16\">By the 2d section of the 6th article of the constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>of the <em>United </em>States, \u201c This constitution, and the laws of the <em>United States </em>which shall be made in pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-3\">And by the second section of article 4. M The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-4\">The act of 1795, c. 56. says, \u201c If any person whatsoever, not being a citizen of this state, and not residing therein, shall or may be indebted unto a citizen of this state, or of any other of the <em>United </em>States, or if any citizen of this state, being indebted unto another citizen thereof, shall actually run away, abscond, or fly from justice, or secretly remove him or herself from his or her place of abode, with intent to evade the payment of his or her just debts, such creditor may, in either case, snake application,\u201d See.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-5\">Under this act an attachment will not lie against a citizen of the state, unless under the particular circumstances mentioned in the act, such as actually running away, absconding, or secretly removing from one\u2019s place of abode with intent to evade the payment of just debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-6\">By the terms \u201c privileges and immunities,\u201d I understand the right of holding property by the citizens of any state, and having the protection of their property and persons in the same manner as the citizens of this state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-7\">The government of the <em>United States </em>is not a government of states; it is a government emanating immediately from the people. If the government of each state had retained its independent sovereignty at the dissolution of the articles of the old confederation, the citizens of each state, in relation to the citizens of other states, would be aliens. The inconveniences which might result from such a state of things, were intended to be obviated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>second section of the fourth article of the constitution. In this section the word <em>rights </em>is left out, in order to .prevent the right of voting, and holding offices, by the citizens of one state in another state. If this construction be right, it follows that a law putting the property of a citizen of another state in a different condition from that of the property of a citzen of this state, is a violation of this article of the constitution. The law of this state must have the same and no other influence on the persons and property of the people of the general government. By this clause of the constitution, the citizens of each state have a right to hold property, and are entitled to the protection of their property. This act of assembly puts the foreign citizen in a worse situation, and he may be deprived of his property in a different manner from that by which a citizen of this state is deprived of his property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-7\">Antecedent to the adoption of the constitution of the <em>United </em>States, the creditor might follow the debtor to any part of the <em>United States, </em>and sue him where he \u25a0was found. But under the constitution of 'the <em>United States, </em>a citizen must be sued in his own state; and by the act of congress of 1789, c. 20. s. 9. the debtor must be sued in the circuit court where he resides, or is found when the process is served. If the act of 1795 is to have operation, the citizen of a different state will be deprived of the advantage of a trial in the circuit court, and of being sued in his own state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-8\">The construction contended for on behalf of the defendant, does not operate to the prejudice of any person, but the contrary construction may be productive of the utmost inconvenience <em>; for </em>this act of assembly gives power to the courts of this state to draw, under their jurisdiction, contracts between individual's residing in two extreme states, at the time the attachment issues ; for the citizen of any state may have an attachment under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>act of assembly. A citizen of <em>Vermont </em>might have an attachment against a citizen of <em>Georgia.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj-v\">In this case the plaintiff was not without his remedy, if he had not resorted to the attachment, for he might have sued in the circuit court of the <em>United </em>States, the sum being large enough. The defendant is subjected to many inconveniences by being, sued out of his own state\u00bb The attachment law, then, of this state contravenes the constitution of the <em>United States, </em>and, therefore, the attachment is void and inoperative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-5\">2d. The court has no jurisdiction in this case farther than is derived from congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-6\">By the act of 1791, c. 45. s. 2. \u201c All that part of the territory of Columbia, which lies within the limits of this state, is ceded to the congress and government of the <em>United States, </em>in full and absolute right and exclusive jurisdiction as well of soil as of persons residing, or to reside thereon, pursuant to the tenor and effect of the eighth section of the first article of the constitution of government of the <em>United States. </em>Provided, that nothing herein contained shall be so construed to vest .in the <em>United States </em>any right of property in the soil, as to affect the rights of individuals therein, otherwise than the same shall or may be transferred by such individuals to the <em>United States; </em>and provided also, that the jurisdiction of the lavts of this state over the persons and property of individuals residing within the limits of the cession aforesaid, shall not cease or determine until congress shall, by law, provide for the government thereof, under their jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-7\">The first proviso protects the rights and property of individuals. The second proviso retains the jurisdiction over the persons and property within the district. The jurisdiction is retained only over- the persons and property within the district 5 there was no reason why it should be retained over persons not within the district. This law passed four years after the cession of the territory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>The act of congress of <em>July, </em>1790, c. 28. provides\u2019 that the operation of the laws of the state within the district, shall not be affected by the acceptance of the territory, until the time of the removal of the government to it. It may be contended that this law of congress left sufficient power in the state to pass the act of assembly, but the power given by congress only extended to such laws of the state as were in existence at the time, and not to any new acts which might be passed; for if the state, under the acceptance of congress, had power to enact new laws to extend to the district of Columbia, they might pass laws to defeat the object of congress, and congress certainly did not intend to revest an authority in the state, whereby the views of congress might be frustrated. It may, therefore, be concluded the attachment has issued illegally.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-8\">Another objection made is, that the defendant cannot appear without putting in bail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-9\">The defendant cannot contest the claim of the plaintiff without putting in bail; but he may come in and show cause why condemnation should not be had.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-10\">The act of 1715, c. 40. s. 3. commands the sheriff, at the time of issuing the attachment, to make known to the persons in whose hands the goods are attached, to appear on the return of the attachment to show cause why condemnation should not be had; and if the defendant or garnishee does not appear, the goods shall be condemned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-11\">The defendant also, by the same section, may, within a year and a day, come in, and, either in person or;. Attorney, appear to the original action and contest the claim of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-12\">Under this act, the defendant has a day given him to come in and show cause why condemnation ought not to pass; and judgment of condemnation canpot pass until the defendant has been called; and it appears he may come into court without giving bail, and move to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>the attachment quashed; or show cause why the judgment of condemnation should not pass.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8G\">2d point. If the attachment did issue regularly, there can be no condemnation of the property attached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-4\">The act of 1795 is a supplement to the act of 1715, and the same proceedings are to take place in the one as the other. The act of 1715 says, attachment may be \u201c awarded against the goods, chattels and credits, which are, or shall be, in the hands or possession of any person or persons whatsoever.\u201d The defendant, then, having only an equitable interest in the property attached, condemnation cannot be had.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-5\">An equitable interest cannot be attached. Goods pawned, goods in execution, cannot be attached. There can be no attachment unless the subject can be condemned. 1 <em>Roll. Abr. 551.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-6\">It has been determined in this and the chancery court, that an equitable interest cannot be taken on a <em>fieri fa</em>cias, and if an equitable interest cannot be taken on a <em>fi. fa. </em>it cannot be condemned under an attachment. It was also determined only the other day, that property when attached and condemned, must be sold on execution ; the court, therefore, ought not to pass judgment to condemn property which cannot be taken by execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-7\">The case of an attachment against a garnishee is different. When an attachment issues against the garnishee, the goods alone in the hands of the garnishee, and returned in the schedule, are condemned; but where the garnishee comes into court, and contests the debt, there the defendant, after judgment, is liable in <em>bonis propriis </em>generally.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-8\">When the garnishee is called to answer on oath whether he has any property of the absentee in his hands, such property as may be subject to execution is meant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-9\">Under the act of 1715 and 1795, an attachment cannot be laid on property in the hands of the defendant, but in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>the hands of a third person: the law contemplates property in the hands of a garnishee. The defendant cannot be garnishee ; if he can, he has all the advantages with respect to formalities to be used by a third person, a garnishee, and may come in and plead in the same manner.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b546-6\"><em>Shaaff, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqrj\">This is one of the most important questions which can come before the <em>court; </em>and a question coming before the court on motion, deserves the most serious consideration, as there is no appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-7\">The act of 1795 is not incompatible with the constitution of the <em>United States. </em>The constitution never meant to give foreign citizens all the advantages of the citizens of any particular state. Suppose the state of <em>Maryland </em>gives certain privileges by its local institutions, the constitution of the <em>United States </em>did not mean to ' say that these privileges should extend to the citizens of every state in the union. The. constitution only meant that the citizens of each state should have the right of citizenship in every state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASxh\">It is not a principle of natural justice that a man should be heard before his property is taken from him. Neither is it against the rights of citizenship that his property should be condemned before his appearance. It cannot be against the rights of citizenship to make aman pay his debts in this or that way, for all governments have a right to prescribe the recovery of debts to be after the manner they think proper, and, in so doing, do nothing contrary to the rights of citizenship.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-10\">The defendant is not put in a worse situation by an attachment, for he may appear and plead upon his giving bail. The act of assembly does in no way strike at the rights of citizenship, it only points out a particular mode of recovering debts, and a citizen of another state is not in a worse situation than the citizens of our own state. The act of assembly gives a remedy against the property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>silly when the person cannot be reached by the process of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-3\">It is said that this property lying in the district of Columbia, is not liable to the jurisdiction of this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-4\">By the act of assembly the cession is made with a proviso, that the jurisdiction of the laws of the state, over persons and property, shall not cease until congress shall provide for the government of the district.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-5\">In the law accepting the cession, there is a proviso that the operation of the laws of the state within the district, shall not cease till the. time fixed for the removal of the government thereto, and until congress shall otherwise by law provide.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-6\">The cession cannot be more extensive than the acceptance; they must go together^ and so far as the cession is not covered by the acceptance it is void, and so far the jurisdiction remains in the state. Suppose the government should not remove at all to the territory of <em>Columbia, </em>will it be said that only the laws of the state passed prior to the cession are to extend to the territory, and that the territory is not to have the protection or benefit of any other laws which may hereafter be made by the state? Their argument leads to this absurdity. The great object of the qualified acceptance was to put the property under the jurisdiction and protection of the state of <em>Maryland.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-7\">As to the objection that the property is an equitable interest. If such property as this cannot be attached, most of the property in the state would be exempted; he thinks there has been no decision in the court of chancery, that an equitable interest cannot be. taken on a <em>fieri facias.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-8\">As to the last objection.. The object of the act of <em>If IS </em>is to enable the creditor to force the appearance of the debtor, and recover his debt, where the debtor is not amenable to the process of the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>The clause of <em>scire facias </em>is introduced in the attachment to warn the garnishee that he may come in and defenci his claim. Both the defendant and the garnishee may appear; but the defendant cannot appear without bail. The defendant has no day to appear unless it is to appear and give <em>bail; </em>if he does appear, he must do it to all purposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-4\">The attachment is a compulsory process to bring the defendant into court. <em>2 Bl. </em>835. <em>Doug. </em>363.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b548-5\"><em>Martin, </em>(Attorney-General,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa7\">The act of assembly is contrary to the law of congress, by which suits may be brought in the circuit court of the <em>United States </em>for debts above five hundred dollars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-6\">The lands in the district of <em>Columbia </em>are not attached as being in the hands of a garnishee, but are attached as property in the defendant\u2019s hands. The true construction of the attachment law is, that property cannot he attached in the hands of the defendant. The law in this state never has justified the taking by attachment property in the defendant\u2019s own hands. Our attachment law is derived from the law of foreign attachments of <em>London, </em>and under the custom of <em>London </em>property cannot be attached unless it be in the hands of a third person, or in the hands of the plaintiff himself. If the defendant .be summoned, or <em>nihil </em>is returned, the plaintiff makes suggesti\u00f3n that the defendant has property in the hands of a third person, and prays it may be attached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-7\">In the attachment, according .to the custom of London, there is no summons sent to the garnishee, but the sheriff returns that he has attached the defendant by his goods in the hands of the garnishee; then a <em>scire facias </em>issues to the garnishee for him to show cause why the property should not be condemned. The garnishee may dissolve the attachment by putting in bail to the original action, and he may do this even after execution has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>issued, if satisfaction has not been made. And so may also the defendant. <em>Priv. Lond. </em>260. 257. 259.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmG7\">The case cited from 2 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>835. which fully shows she practice in attachments under the custom of London, only shows that a summons to the defendant must appear on the face of the record of the court below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-8\">Attachment laws have existed in this state from the year 1647. The law of January, 1647, c. 3. is not to be found on record. The first law to be found on this subject, the act of 1669, c. 8. <em>(Lib. C. </em>W. H. folio 172.) Confined the laying the attachment on goods in the hands of a third person. This law was practised under until the act of 1682, c. 2. <em>(Lib. </em>W. H. folio. 248.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-10\">By the act of 1692, c. <em>62. (Lib. </em>L. L. 172.) an attachment may be laid on property which shall be in the hands of any person or persons whatsoever, even in the plaintiff\u2019s own hands. It is the same with the act of 1715. By this law, the condemnation having passed on the goods of the defendant, the plaintiff may have his execution ; and it authorizes no property to be attached unless it be in the hands of some person, and the attachment must contain a clause of notice to the garnishee, for him or the defendant to come in and show cause why condemnation should not be had. And the goods can-Hot be condemned unless it be for want of the appearance of the garnishee or the defendant. After a judgment has been previously obtained in the original suit, and an attachment sued out, condemnation will pass unless the garnishee or the defendant appears. How, then, as is contended, is the defendifRt to give bail ? To what \u25a0is he to give bail ? Not to the original action, for bail there has already been given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-12\">Anterior to the law of 1795, c. 56. a <em>capias </em>must have issued, and a <em>non est </em>be returned before judgment for an attachment could be obtained j but this law gives the plaintiff the power to take oiit the attachment in time, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>vacation, at the same time he takes out his writ, and ^i8 is done with the view of binding the property, and preventing the transmission of the property in the mean time. But the proceedings under this law are the same as they were under the former law, and under this law no property can be attached but such as is attachable un\u00bb der the original law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-3\">It has been contended that it has always been the practice under the attachment laws to take the goods of the defendant in the hands of the defendant. But it is denied that this was ever done until ninety years after the first attachment law. The first case in which it was done was in the year <em>1745.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-4\">If, then, there is no mode that can affect the property-under our attachment laws, let us see how far the com\u00bb mon law will authorize it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-5\">Under the common law the body could not be taken. The process under the common law could only affect the pi-operty ; and, to force the appearance of the defendant, they proceeded to outlawry, and until this process was passed through, the property could not be got at. The property is, then, forfeited to the crown, when the defendant, on application to the crown office, may have his debt paid. This is the only mode to affect property in <em>Great Britain </em>under the common law where the person could not be found.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-6\">Process of outlawry will lie in this state, and has been so decided in this court in the case of <em>The State </em>v. <em>Hughes. </em>The defendant, then, might have been prosecuted to outlawry, and the plaintiff was not without remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-7\">This is a case under the attachment law, or it is not; if it be under the attachment law, the proceeding must be according to these laws, which say that condemnation shall be had, unless the garnishee or the defendant come in and show cause <em>% </em>how can the defendant come in and show cause on \u25a0 an attachment where there has been a final judgment, unless by way of motion. Can it be sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>posed that after a final judgment, and attachment on that judgment, that the defendant is to give bail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ab0q\">But it is said that if the defendant is allowed to come in and allege facts to set aside the attachment upon motion, the party would lose the benefit of his trial by jury, and of his appeal, this inquiry being only on motion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-8\">To this objection it may be answered, that in case of motion for a rule to oblige the plaintiff to give security for costs, the court will inquire whether the plaintiff is a foreigner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-9\">This court; on inquiry, quashed an execution in the ease of <em>Oxley &amp; Hancock </em>v. Lane, at <em>May </em>term, <em>1795, </em>on a <em>fieri facias. </em>The defendant showed and delivered <em>to </em>the sheriff, on oath, his property real and personal. It was contended that the execution was irregular, the plaintiffs being aliens, and incapable of holding real property in this state<em>; </em>proof was made to the court, and admitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-11\">Although this is a question which involves the construction of the constitution of the <em>United </em>States, the defendant will not lose his appeal from the decision of this court, by this mode of proceeding, for he may <em>by </em>suggestion, by way of plea, display the matter on the record, and carry it up to the supreme court. There is no impropriety in admitting the defendant to plead as garnishee and defendant.

If at the time of our independence, some stipulations had not been-made, the citizens of each state would have been to each. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>other as aliens; an agreement was necessary to make them citizens of every state. This was done by the fourth article of the confederation, which says, \u201c The better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different states in this union, the free inhabitants of each of these states shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens of the several states.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahe\">When the new constitution was formed, some provisions securing the privileges of the citizens in the different states was the more \u2019 necessary; for our citizens, while they are citizens of the general government, are component parts of the state government; and there was reason to fear that particular states might not allow the citizens of other states the same privileges enjoyed by their own citizens ; and had a provision securing them been omitted in the constitution, they might have been deprived of them. A citizen of another state may hold real property in any state of the union, subject to the laws and regulations of that state, and his property and his person are entitled to the protection of the laws in the same manner as the citizens of the state. When a citizen of another state comes into this state, he is entitled to all the benefits of our judiciary, and he is also subject to the process of the same in the same manner as the citizens of this state. Another privilege secured to the citizen by this clause is, that he may go into a different state without being under the necessity of taking an oath of allegiance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-4\">If the laws of this state puts the citizens of another state in a worse situation than the citizens of this state, it is a violation of the social compact. By the act of assembly an attachment cannot issue against a citizen of this state, unless he is about to depart with a design to defraud his creditors; whereas in the case of a foreign citizen, it is only necessary to prove he lives out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>state, and, without any default on his part, he is compelled by attachment to come into court, and submit himself to imprisonment. In the case of the citizen of this state, it is proper, because he ought to be amenable to the laws of the state wherever he may be. There is no question but that the state cannot make any law that interferes with the constitution or the laws of the <em>United States.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-4\">With respect to the laws of cession and acceptance of the district. It is contended that' the clauses of the constitution respecting the ten miles square precludes congress from all jurisdiction until they remove there. This cannot be a just construction; for if congress have no power to make regulations with respect to that territory until they remove, how can they do such acts as will enable them to prepare for the removal of the government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-5\">It was intended to reserve the jurisdiction of the state in the district, over its own citizens and their property, but not over the property of a non-resident.

Are the greatest questions of law to be decided without appeal; and facts of intricacy to be inquired into, and a decision on these facts to take place, without any notice being given to the plaintiff, or without giving him the benefit of a trial by jury ? This shows that we are placed under a great <em>inconvenience; </em>not knowing that the property we have taken was an equitable interest^ and not coming prepared to answer the fact that <em>Robert Morris </em>is a citizen of <em>Pennsylvania; </em>\u2018but if the court compels the party to give special bail, the defendant can suffer no inconvenience j he will then have an opportunity to bring his merits into view, and let the decision be as it may, each party may have an appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-3\">It has always been the practice to take the property of the defendant by attachment, if he leaves it, though it be. not in the hands of a third person. If it were not so he might abscond, and keep himself out of the reach of the sheriff so that he could not be arrested, and then there would be no remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-4\">The garnishee may appear to the attachmen<em>t, </em>but when the defendant appears he does not appear to the attachment, but to the original suit, and must give bail, and when he gives bail the attachment is dissolved. The defendant, therefore, has no day in court to the attachment j and it is a certain truth that the attachment goes against the property, but not against the person. The sheriff is also commanded to give notice to. the garnishee to appear if the goods should be in the hands of the garnishee. In the case of <em>Martin v. </em>Osborne, the attachment issued against the goods of the defendant without the clause of <em>scire facias. </em>If the garnishee appears as defendant it is not to defeat the debt, but only to show the attachment issued illegally. If he appears as garnishee he may appear for all purposes, and without bail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>If attachment issue against the defendant, there is no necessity for the clause of <em>scire facias. </em>If against the garnishee, there must be.

Why should not an equitable interest be attached to compel an appearance <em>l </em>If an attachment be laid on an equitable estate, it will be a lien on the property, and on application to the court of chancery, suggesting that <em>fi. fa. </em>would not lie to sell, the chancellor would decree a sale of the property.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b555-4\">\n<em>Mason,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcZ\">on the same side. The act of assembly cannot be considered unconstitutional. It will not be contended that we have lost our sovereignty so far as to prevent us from providing remedies to recover debts. This act of assembly only authorizes a procedure against the property where the person is not to be had. The act of <em>1713 </em>requires two <em>non est </em>to found the attachment on j the act of <em>1793 </em>only changes the species of evidence which is to ascertain that the party is about to evade the law, and render his property liable to the attachment. The constitution of the <em>United States </em>does not prevent the state of <em>Maryland </em>from making provisions for the recovery of debts, and the mode prescribed by the act of assembly is not contrary to the constitution, because there is no authority given to touch the person, but only by means of his property, within the jurisdiction of the state, to coerce his appearance. This act of assembly does not prevent a citizen of another state from having the advantage of coming in and pleading in the courts of the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-5\">Congress can exercise no exclusive legislation over the district till they remove there. Their acceptance of the territory must be the limits of the cession. According to the construction on th\u00e9 other side, the laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>of the state, so far as they respect the federal territory, are immutable, and cannot be altered or amended until congress remove to the place.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-3\">An appearance is a technical expression.

It is agreed it does not mean the right of election, the right of holding offices, the right of being elected. The court are of opinion it means that the citizens of all the states shall have the peculiar advantage of acquiring and holding real as well as personal property, and that such property shall be protected and secured by the laws of the state, in the same manner as the property of the citizens of the state is protected. It means, such property shall not be liable to any taxes or burdens which the property of the citizens is not subject to. It may also mean, that as creditors, they shall be on the same footing with the state creditor, in the payment of the debts of a deceased debtor. It secures and protects personal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The way to expound a clause in the general government or constitution of the <em>United </em>States, is by comparing it with other parts, and considering them <em>together; </em>and to lay\u2019 a foundation for a right exposition in the present case, it will be proper to suggest a few plain principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">1st. That congress can exercise no power as a legislative body but what is vested in them by the constitution^ it being under and by virtue of that instrument alone they derive their power.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">2d. All power, jurisdiction, and rights of sovereignty, not granted by the people by that instrument, or relinquished, are still retained by them in their several states, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>\u25a0arid in their respective state legislatures, according to their forms of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Uniformity of laws in the states is contemplated by the general government only in two cases, on the subject of bankruptcies and naturalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The legislative powers of congress are particularly defined in. the 8th section of the 1st article.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Those powers do not interfere with, or abridge, the power of the states to make local regulations, the operation of which'is confined to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The restrictive clauses in the 10th section of the 1st article, limiting the powers of the states, are confined to certain enumerated cases, none of which comprehend the subject under consideration: the power of regulating process for the more effectual recovery of debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">A restriction of the power of the state legislatures to establish modes of proceeding for the recovery of debts, is not to be inferred from the clause under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The mode of proceeding for the recovery of debts, is variant in the several states, and congress, has not established a uniformity of proceeding in the circuit courts, but in each state the proceedings are pursuant to the laws of the state in which the. suit is instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">This proceeding by attachment is to compel an appearance, and the attachment, by the defendant\u2019s appearing and giving bail, would be dissolved; and he would be in the same situation with any citizen of this state taken on a <em>capias ad </em>respondendum, who appears and gives bail to the suit, and so will his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">It would be a strange complaint for a citizen of <em>Pennsylvania </em>to make, that he was not allowed the same immunities and privileges with a citizen of <em>Maryland, </em>which he is informed he may enjoy by conforming to the laws of the state, in appearing and giving bail to the suit commenced against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">The law of congress, 1789, c. 20. in my opinion, does aot prohibit or discountenance this proceeding, but if any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>inference can be made the one way or the other, rather warrants it by not allowing the jurisdiction of the state courts to be ousted except where the debt claimed exceeds five hundred dollars, and by the defendant\u2019s complying with certain requisites.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\">Section 11. gives the circuit courts concurrent jurisdiction with the state courts, in suits between citizens qf different states, where the sum exceeds five hundred dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Section 12. provides for the removal of a suit, brought by a citizen in the state court against a citizen of another state, to the circuit court, if the sum exceeds five hundred dollars, upon petition and giving security to give bail to the suit in the circuit court, if the suit requires bail, and the defendant is at liberty in this case to make his election, and may remove this suit to the circuit court upon complying with the law of congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">This, then, is the only case in which there is an interference with the original jurisdiction of the state courts as to the recovery of debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The latter part of the clause recognises the mode of proceeding 'in some of the states by attachment, as a compulsory process to oblige the party to appear, and allow the party to hold the goods or estate attached to answer the final judgment, in the same manner as by the laws of the state they would have been holden. This law, then, takes notice of the proceeding by attachment, to compel the appearance of the defendant, and warrants it <em>% </em>and the court are of opinion that the act of 1795 does not contravene the constitution, and is not incompatible with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">As to the question whether the lands, goods and chattels, &amp;c. of the defendant, not in the hands of a third person, are attachable: the court are of opinion the lands, goods' and chattels of the defendant may be attached wherever they are found, within the reach of the process of the state, and may be condemned, unless the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>fendant comes in and gives bail, and thereby dissolves the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\">The court are also of an opinion that an equitable interest cannot be attached, for a plain and obvious reason. It is an incorporeal right, not in its nature tangible, and cannot be attached and taken into the custody of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The <em>cestui que use </em>was no longer tenant of land at law, nor was the land liable to be subjected to his encumbrances, as dower, executions, &amp;c. 1 <em>Bl.

The reason is, because they cannot be taken in execution. <em>Esp. 427.

The act of assembly of this state making the cession, must receive such construction as will correspond with the plain intent and meaning of the constitution of the <em>United States </em>and the law of congress ; wherefore the court are of opinion, that the jurisdiction of the state of Maryland, and of its laws over such part of the district of <em>Columbia </em>as lies within the limits of the state, will not cease and determine before the first <em>Monday </em>in December, in the year 1800. Another reason may be subjoined in support of this opinion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>of the court. 1'he legislature of <em>Maryland </em>could not transfer or suspend the power of legislation over the said part of the district which lies within the limits of the state but in pursuance of, and in conformity to, the constitution of the <em>United </em>States, under which alone such power of transmitting or suspending the legislative authority is derived.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">The returns made upon the said attachments by the sheriffs of <em>Prince Geo&gt;ge's </em>and <em>Frederick </em>counties were quashed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Three bills of exceptions were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\"><em>First exception. </em>In the case of the return from <em>Prince George's </em>county, the plaintiff offered in evidence a deed to <em>Robert Morris </em>and <em>John </em>Nicholson, for the lands and tenements mentioned in the return from <em>James Greenleaf, </em>dated the 13th of <em>May, </em>1796, being for a number of square lots in the city of <em>Washington, </em>in the county of <em>Prince George's, </em>to be held by them as tenants in common, and not as joint tenants, subject to liens created by mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Whereupon the plaintiff, <em>William Campbell, </em>prayed judgment that a moiety of all the following lands and tenements mentioned in the return of the sheriff of <em>Prince George's </em>county, on the attachment issued in this cause, should be condemned to satisfy the debt aforesaid of the said <em>William, Campbell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The defendant, to show that the said <em>William Campbell, </em>the plaintiff, was not entitled to the judgment aforesaid, offered in evidence to the court, the attested copy of a deed from the said <em>Robert Morris, John Nicholson </em>and <em>James Greenleaf, </em>to <em>Thomas Law, </em>dated the 4th <em>September, </em>1795, conveying the said squares, among others, to the said <em>Thomas Law, </em>and which said deed recites that <em>Morris, Nicholson </em>and <em>Greenleaf </em>were jointly and severally bound to <em>Thomas Law, </em>in the sum of 100,000/. <em>Pennsylvania </em>currency, with a condition to convey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>2,400,000 square feet of land in the city of <em>Washington </em>to secure the payment of which money, or the convey* ance sa^anc^ deed, by way of mortgage, was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The defendant also offered in evidence three other deeds, one from <em>James Greenleaf to John </em>Nicholson, dated the 6th of <em>August, </em>1795, for sundry lots in the city of <em>Washington, </em>subject to mortgages made to <em>Thomas Law. </em>One other deed from <em>James Greenleaf </em>to <em>Robert Morris, </em>dated the 7th of <em>August, </em>1795, for sundry lots in the city of <em>Washington; </em>and another deed from the said <em>James Greenleaf to </em>the said <em>Robert Morris, </em>for sundry lots in the city of <em>Washington, </em>subject to mortgages to <em>Thomas Law </em>and <em>Wihiam, M.

There are three other deeds from <em>James Greenleaf to John Nicholson, </em>and <em>Robert Morris, </em>separately, dated the 6th and 7th of Augustj 1795, which it is not necessary to state or consider, as the principles upon which the propriety of the court\u2019s opinion must depend, are involved in the consideration of the deeds from <em>Morris, Nicholson </em>and <em>Green-leaf </em>to <em>Law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The plaintiff below showed a deed from <em>James Green-leaf </em>to <em>Robert Morris </em>and <em>John Nicholson, </em>dated the 13th of <em>May, </em>1796, for all the property in question; also a deed from <em>Thomas Law </em>to <em>Morris, Nicholson </em>and <em>Green-leaf, </em>releasing a great part of the property, dated 5th October, 1797.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\"><em>Morris </em>offered a deed from <em>Morris, Nicholson </em>and <em>Greenleaf, to Henry Platt </em>arid others, dated 26th of July, 1797, for all their interest in the property in <em>question; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>that they gave notice to <em>Law </em>that this deed had been executed, and that he said that the plaintiff had agreed to spend money in case he succeeded in the attachments, on the <em>New-jfersey </em>avenue, and that Morris, <em>Nicholson </em>and <em>Greenleaf.\\ </em>at that time, resided out of the state, and had no person to receive the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">On the return of the attachment from <em>Frederick </em>county, <em>Morris </em>showed a patent for the land to another person* and the plaintiff did not derive any title from the patentee.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">In this case the court were of opini\u00f3n that <em>Robert Morris </em>had not such an estate whereof condemnation could <em>go; </em>that <em>Robert Morris </em>had only an equitable interest, not liable to attachment; that the attachment from <em>Frederick </em>should be quashed, because the plaintiff did not show a title in Morris, from the patentee ; to which opinions of the court, separate exceptions were taken. The propriety of the opinion of the general court will depend on the decision of four different questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\"><em>First. </em>Can the act of 1795, c. 56. have the effect to make the property in this state, of a citizen of a different state, liable to attachment, in a case where the property of a citizen of <em>Maryland </em>would not be ?</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\"><em>Second. </em>Is property in the territory of <em>Columbia </em>belonging to <em>Robert </em>Morris, not residing in the state, attachable since the act of 1791, c. 45.?</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\"><em>Third. </em>Can the court, on the attachment, examine into the title on the showing of <em>Robert Morris?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\"><em>Fourth. </em>Is the interest of <em>Robert </em>Morris, in the property attached, liable to an attachment ?</p>\n<p id=\"b568-14\">On the first point it must be observed, that this law makes a distinction between our own citizens and others, in this, that an attachment cannot be obtained against a citizen of Maryland, who is out of the state, unless he .has absconded from justice, whereas one may be had against a citizen cf any other state, who does not reside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>here; and hence they contend for the defendant that this law is repugnant to the 4th article of the federal constitution, sec. 2. by which it is declared, \u201c That the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The object of the convention in introducing this clause into the constitution, was to invest the citizens of the different states with the general rights of citizenship; that they should not be foreigners, but citizens. To go thus far was essentially necessary to the very existence of a federate government, and in reality was no more than had been provided for by the first confederation in the fourth article.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">But it never could have been the intention of the framers of our national government, to melt down the states into one common mass; to put the citizens of each in the exact same situation, and confer on them equal rights : this principle would have Keen wholly destructive of the state governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The expressions, however, of the fourth article convey no such idea. It does not declare that \u201c the citizens of ea'ch state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of the citizens of the several states.\u201d Had such, been the language of the constitution, it might, with more plausibility, have been contended that this act of assembly was in violation of it; but such are uot the expressions of the article; it only says that \u201c The citizens of the several states shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.\u201d Thereby designing to give them the rights of citizenship, and not to put all the citizens of the <em>United States </em>upon a level; consequently, the injury, as to the effect of a law of any state, will not be whether it makes a discrimination between citizens of the several states; but whether \u25a0it infringes upon any civil right, which a man as a member of civil society must .enjoy. In the present case we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>must inquire whether the law of 1795, c. 56. takes from <em>Robert Morris </em>any of the privileges of a citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">It is difficult to conceive how the act of assembly can have such an effect; how the general provisions of the law can do injury or injustice to any man. To be sure, in particular instances, like all general regulations, it may effect injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">A man who resides out of the states, would have a complete exemption from his creditors as to his property in this state, if it was not liable to attachment. He cannot be arrested because no process of the state can reach his person. This property, the only fund for the payment of debts, would be protected, if in such instances as this it may not be seized on attachment, or some other process of a similar nature. If resident in any part of America, he may be proceeded against in the federal courts, but if out of the <em>United </em>States, there would be no remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">This act of assembly can <em>never </em>be in violation of a man\u2019s civil rights, until it is proved that to make his property liable for the payment of his debts constitutes the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">In the present instance the interest of the absent-person is abundantly protected by the provisions of the law. A writ must issue at the time of the attachment, to which the defendant may appear and dissolve the <em>attachment; </em>if he neglect to appear, the property is condemned and sold on <em>\u2022a. fieri facias ; </em>he has a year to come in after the attachment, and controvert the propriety of the claim. Can a law of this nature be considered as infringing on the rights or privileges of a citizen ? If it were' so, a knave could secure his property against all the authority of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">If the state, at the adoption of the general government, ought to have retained any portion of independent power, it should be that of legislating on the subject of its own jurisprudence, and the manner of proceeding ia courts of justice <em>; </em>the goodness or badness of the pro\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>visions made on those subjects, is for the legislatures to decide ; the execution of the laws only remains for the &gt; courts. The obvious necessity of some mode to recover . . debts from an absent person, has given rise to the different attachment laws of this state. The law of 1/15, c. 40. requires the return of <em>non est, </em>against a non-resident, before an attachment can be obtained; this will take in our own citizens, provided they reside out of the state. The act of 1/95, c. 56. does not authorize an attachment against a citizen of Maryland, unless he absconds from justice, but gives remedy against \u201c any other person not being a citizen of this state, and not residing therein.\u201d This expression affects citizens of other states. In this way has the assembly thought proper to legislate on this subject; they have made the mode of recovery somewhat more dilatory against the citizens of our own state, than against those of other states; still there is no infraction of the privileges and immunities of a citizen, and, of consequence, no violation of the fourth article of the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">2d point. It will only be necessary to have recourse to the acts of congress, and of the <em>Maryland </em>legislature, to form a proper opinion on this subject. /</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">By the act of congress 1/90, c. 28. a district not exceeding ten miles square, &amp;c. was accepted for the permanent seat of government, \u201c Provided that the operation of the state laws within the district, shall not be affected by the acceptance until the time fixed for the removal of congress thereto, and until congi-ess shall otherwise provide.\u201d The time fixed for the removal of congress is the first <em>Monday </em>of December, 1800.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">After the location of this district was made, the legislature of <em>Maryland </em>made a final cession of that part of the district which was in this state, by the act of 1/91, c. 45. with a proviso,\u00a3\u00a3 That the-jurisdiction of the laws 'if the state, over persons residing within the limits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the cession, shall not cease until congress shall by law Provide for the government thereof,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"Adp\">Under this law a difficulty was stated in the trial of this cause, that as the act of assembly only excepted the jurisdiction of the laws of this state as to the property and persons of those who resided in the limits of the cession, it did not authorize the proceedings against the. property of <em>Robert Morris </em>within the territory of <em>Columbia, </em>as he did not reside there.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">To refute this objection it is only to be observed, that the law of congress of 1790, c. 28. expressly provides that the operation of the state laws shall not be affected within the district until the time fixed for the removal of congress ; so that even if the legislature of <em>Maryland </em>could have designed to go further, yet this law of congress would not have authorized a cession so as to prevent the operation of the state laws before the limited time. The inconvenience of such a construction is such as to prevent it from obtaining, because, until the time fixed for the removal, congress cannot legislate for the territory, and this interpretation goes to limit to a certain extent the power of the state legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">On these two points I shall make no further remark \u00bf the general epurt, on full argument, having determined both of them in favour of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">3d point. The proceedings under the law of 1795 are to b# regulated by that of 1715, by which law the property attached is to be condemned unless the defendant shall appear, or the garnishee in whose hands the goods are attached, to show cause to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Both the defendant and the garnishee are by this law permitted to appear, though the manner and terms of their appearing are very different, and each must be in a legal mode. The defendant can appear to the action, but his appearance can only be by giving bail, which dissolves the attachment. The garnishee may appear to the attachment, because he is a party to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>The different interest and situation of the garnishee and the defendant plainly point out that part of the proceeding to which each are entitled to appear. The defendant, being the original debtor and the party to the action, he is authorized to appear to it and to controvert the demand, but in this respect he is in the same situation of all other defendants, that is, he will not be received into court except on the ordinary terms of giving bail. This is the acknowledged law as to the appearance to the action. Let us see what propriety there is in the defendant\u2019s appearing to the attachment. It can never be for the purpose of showing that no debt was due to the plaintiff j since the proper way of doing that is by an appearance to the action. Shall he, then, be permitted to show that the property attached did uot belong to him ? I contend not, and for this obvious, reason, because, if the property belongs to another, the defendant is not interested to protect it, being, as to that, a stranger, and will not be heard in court to make such a defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">The garnishee stands on different ground; his interest wholly lies in ^protecting the property attached, and, of consequence, must have an opportunity of appearing to the attachment, and controverting the title of the defendant to the subject attached in his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">I am confident in saying that these ideas of appearing to the action and attachment, are warranted by the usage on the <em>occasion; </em>for no instance until the present decision can be shown, either from our own records or from the proceedings of the <em>English </em>courts, in which the judges have ever permitted a defendant in the action to appear to the attachment, and plead or show that the property attached did not belong to him; yet this the general court has done in this case, <em>Robert Morris </em>being permitted to show that he had no legal estate in the property attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>There is a great, and, to my mind, an unanswerable, objection to a court examining into a title in this summary way, on the ground that not the court but the jury are the legal and only judges of a great variety of facts which might and must occur on this trial; for if the court is the proper tribunal to decide in the present case, it must be so in all others.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\">It can readily be seen that if the court undertakes to. examine into a title in this way, some of the 'most disputed points of fact will often come before them. For example ; if the property attached is held by a defendant as heir at law, the pedigree, descent, seisin in his ancestor, and his title, may have to be inquired into. The defendant may allege that the land attached is swallowed up in elder surveys ; to combat which allegation, all the intricacies of location must be examined. Or, to bring the example more immediately to the bar; suppose the defendant was to show title out o\u00ed himself, by setting up a mortgage, as is done here, which was stated by the plaintiff to be fraudulent or usurious, and, therefore, void; would the court, under such circumstances, without the assistance of the jury, go into the examination of the fraud, or of a fact so difficult to unravel as a usurious contract ? Yet these, and many otber instances of a similar nature, might happen in which the court would be obliged to act, if the principle was once admitted that the court, on these occasions, are to examine into the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Parol evidence was received in the present case, on behalf of the defendant, to show that <em>Morris, Nicholson </em>and <em>Greenleaf </em>had no one in the state to receive the conveyance. That the plaintiff had agreed to lay money out on the <em>New-Jersey </em>avenue, &amp;c. i cannot tell what effect this testimony had on the determination, but the only tendency it could have was to show a collusion between <em>Law </em>and the plaintiff. This might have been controverted, and it would open a vast fund of investiga,-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>tion, proper for the decision, not of the court, but of a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"AFn\">if I am correct in these observations, the court below have erred in undertaking to judge of these facts, and no inconvenience could have ensued to the true owner of the property by pursuing a different course. The return of the sheriff states the property to be the lands and tenements of <em>Robert Morris. </em>This afforded the court a sufficient ground to proceed to condemnation j and I do not think that the court ought to have gone further than the return of the sheriff to examine into title. That was not the proper stage to make such an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">After the condemnation it is well known that the property must be sold under a <em>fieri </em>facias, and from the proceeds the debt is to be paid. Under such a sale the vendee, if possession is withheld, must bring his ejectment, when the title derived under the attachment will fee examined into by the proper tribunal, a jury, in which, if the defendant had no title, the purchaser under the <em>fieri facias </em>can have none.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">If a sheriff sells a term for years under a <em>fierifacias^ </em>he cannot turn the defendant out of possession, but the vendee must bring his ejectment. 2 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>332. 2 <em>Show. 85.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">4th point. Admitting the propriety of <em>Robert Morris </em>coming in to show title out of himself, it will remain for me to prove that he has such a title in the property as may be taken by this process.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">I have not been able to discover, from the books, that on the return of an execution any defendant has been received to say that he had only an equity of redemption, and move to quash the execution on that ground. It is, at least, an ungracious defence for a man to make, to say that although he has the beneficial interest in property, (for such is the equity of redemption,) yet it ought not to be applied to the payment of his just debts,</p>\n<p id=\"b576-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Upon a general view of the subject, every reason drawn from convenience points out the evident propriety of making all the property a man has, liable to the p ayment of his honest debts. We all know that in reality the mortgagor has the interest in the land, and the mortgagee only a security on it for the amount of his debt; and although a mortgage estate of 10,000/T is legally forfeited for non-payment of five pound, yet the mortgagor' has an actual interest in it to the amount of 9,995/. Ought not this interest to be subject to the execution of his creditor i</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\">The extent of the principle, that nothing short of the complete legal estate is liable to execution or attachment, (for they are, as to this, the same,) will be found to be productive of more universal evil tendency than may at first be supposed. In the great number of conveyances of land in this state, we too often are sensible how many of them are defective, in which the grantees have no more than equitable interests. It is impossible to draw the line. If an equity of redemption is not liable to an execution or attachment, no other estate of an equitable nature can be so; and by this means all the real property in the state, the possessors\u2019 title to which is legally defective, whether from inartificial conveyances, or in any dtber way, is locked up from the execution of their creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">However, I do not think that this part of the case wholly rests on this point.' I consider that <em>Robert Morris </em>had a legal estate in the property attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The deed by which <em>Robert Morris </em>alleges he had only an equity of redemption, is the deed from Morris, <em>Nicholson </em>and <em>Greenlecif, </em>to <em>Law, </em>dated 4th September, 1795, which recites that a bond in the penalty of 100,000/. and dated 3d December, 1794, to have been given to convey 2,400,000 square feet of land in the territory of <em>Colum</em>bia, and that by another agreement of the 10th <em>March, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>1795, it was agreed that the grantees should mortgage certain squares in the city until they could give good titles to <em>Law </em>for such property as he might select, and the mortgage given to <em>Law </em>of the 4th September, 1795,. is to be defeasanced on payment of the 100,000/. or if the grantees should, in compliance with the bond of 1794, and the agreement of the 10th of March, 1795, convey 2,400,000 feet of land, &amp;c. and the grantor, <em>Law, </em>covenanted, granted and agreed, that the grantees and their assigns, should have, hold and enjoy the premises, unless they made a default in the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\">This is a mortgage to secure the conveyance of other property, in which the parties have covenanted, and granted, that the mortgagors shall hold and enjoy the premises, unless in case of failure. This covenant and grant gives the legal estate to the mortgagors until'such failure takes place, and is distinguishable from those cases wherein the mortgagee only covenants that he will not molest the mortgagor in the enjoyment.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">A mortgage was made with an agreement that the mortgagee should not intermeddle with the actual possession of the premises until default of payment, which was at the distance of some years. It was held that the mortgagor was tenant at <em>will; </em>distinction being taken between this agreement, and one that the mortgagor should enjoy it during those years, for the latter would have been a lease for years. <em>Pow. on Mart. </em>67. This case is taken by <em>Powell </em>from 2 <em>Cro. </em>659. where it seemed to be admitted that an agreement that the mortgagor should enjoy the premises until default of payment, would have been a lease for years, although the court did not decide the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">If a grant of this nature in a mortgage deed did not continue the legal estate in the mortgagor, the greatest inconvenience would ensue. Suppose, by way of example, a deed of mortgage was made redeemable on payment of a sum of money at the distance of fifty years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>and that the mortgagor should retain possession in the mean time, has he not a complete estate for fifty years <em>l </em>And shall not that estate be answerable for the payment of his debts, and the execution of his creditors ?</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\">But there is another ground on which I think this property attachable; I mean in consequence of the deed from <em>Law </em>to Morris, <em>Nicholson </em>and <em>Greenleaf. </em>dated the 5th of October, 1797, although subsequent to our attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The embarrassment arises from confounding the attachment with the commencement of \u00e1 suit. It is more like an execution. In an action, if-there is no cause at the commencement of it, the suit c.rnnot be supported; but the judgment may be served out of any property coming to hand even after judgment. So it is with an attachment. If the party has property after the levying the attachment it will do.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">If there was no other argument or authority, the terms of proceeding would alone determine it. The garnishee always pleads that he had no goods, &amp;c. at the time of the attachment, or ever after. On this the issue is joined, and if it be proved that he had goods at the time of the plea, it will be sufficient for the plaintiff. It will be found that in every instance where the garnishee had pleaded <em>nulla </em>bona, the plea has been in that way. How, then, can it be material whether the party had effects at the time of laying the attachment. It is well known that our attachment laws are taken from \u201c the foreign attachment\u201d in London, and that the construction of our laws has been much governed by the decision of the courts on the foreign attachment. Let us, then, see how the law stands in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">\u201c If <em>A. </em>attach the goods or money of <em>M. </em>in the hands of <em>R. </em>and if <em>R. </em>had no money or goods in his hands belonging to <em>M. </em>at the time when the attachment shall be made, and it shall happen that six months after <em>R. </em>shall be indebted to <em>M. </em>or have goods of him in his hands, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the plaintiff <em>A. </em>by virtue of the attachment made as aforesaid, shall recover the goods or money he shall prove to come to the hands of <em>JR. </em>after the attachment, the general issue being whether <em>B. </em>who is called the garnishee, at the time of the attachment, or ever after, had any money or goods in his hands.\u201d <em>Pow. Lond. 255. </em>261.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">This authority fully proves that it is not necessary that a garnishee should have any property in his hands at the time the attachment is laid. So, I argue in the present case, it is not necessary that <em>Robert Morris </em>should have any property, that is, any legal estate, in the subject attached, at the time of laying the process. Certain specified lands, &amp;c. are taken, attached and returned as such by the sheriff, and if at any time afterwards the defendant has such legal estate, it may be condemned.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">It may be contended that Morris, <em>Nicholson </em>and <em>Green\u2122 leaf </em>have conveyed their interest in the property in question to others, on the 26th day of fune, 1797, and given <em>Law </em>notice of such conveyance, and as they had no person in this state authorized to receive a deed, and they being non-residents, the deed was inoperative. It must be remembered that this deed of the 26th of <em>fune, </em>1797, was subsequent to our attachment; but taking all the evidence as properly received by the court, which I have endeavoured to show is not the case, yet it does not prove a refusal on the part of the grantees to abide by the deed, which is essentially necessary to prevent its operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">If a charter of feoffment was made to four, and seisin delivered to three in the name of all, and after the seisin was given, the fourth saw the deed, and by word disagreed to the deed, it was adjudged that this disagreement by word <em>in pais </em>should not devest the freehold out of him. 3 <em>Co. </em>26.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">If A. makes an obligation to <em>B. </em>and delivers the deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>to the use of <em>B., </em>it is the deed of <em>A. </em>presently, but <em>B. </em>may refuse the same <em>in pais. </em>Same law of goods and chattels; if <em>the deed be </em>delivered to the use of the donee, the goods and chattels are in the donee presently before notice or agreement, but he may refuse <em>in pais. </em>3 <em>Co. </em>26.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\">An estate created by feoffment, &amp;c. can be waived <em>in </em>pais, no more than such an estate created by limitation of use. 3 <em>Co. 27.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">I have taken the words of <em>Coke, </em>and shall make no observations on them, as they fully prove that land may be conveyed, and will pass to the grantee by a deed delivered to his use, although he has had no previous notice of it; he may surely refuse to stand to the deed, but he must do it in a proper manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">If the court should differ in opinion with the general court, it will then become necessary, on the reversal of their judgment, for this court to go on and give the judgment which the Gourt below ought to have given, that is, a judgment of condemnation, it being a well known principle, and the practice has been conformable to it, for the appellate court not only to reverse the judgment where there is an error in it, but to go further and give the legal judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\"><em>The Court of Appeals </em>reversed the judgment of the general court at <em>June </em>term, 1800, and gave a judgment of condemnation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
