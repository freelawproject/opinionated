The cause was removed from the county court of Frederick, by a writ of pone. See the defendant\u2019s avowry, and the general demurrer thereto, in 2 <em>Harris\u2019s </em>Entries, 493 \u2014 496.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-5\">Three points were made. 1st. Whether the sheriff could execute for his poundage fees, the process not being completed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-6\">2d. Whether, on an execution, the defendant is liable to the sheriff for his fees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-7\">3d. If the defendant is liable, does that liability extend to the executrix.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b152-8\"><em>Mason, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvS\">The sheriff cannot demand his poundage fees of the defendant on an execution. He should demand them of the plaintiff. 2 <em>Term Rep. </em>132. 157. 164. 1 <em>Doug. </em>139. 141. The statute of 29 <em>Eliz. </em>allows the sheriff poundage in <em>Great Britain. </em>There is no consideration between the sheriff and the defendant, so as to support an action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-10\">The act of 1779, c. 29. s. 5. gives poundage fees. This act is limited by the act of 1787, c. 36.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-11\">The sheriff can have no poundage fees on a <em>fi. fa. </em>till actually made. <em>Loft\u2019s Rep. </em>433.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-12\">Fees are given in consideration of the risk run by the sheriff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>Martin </em>(Attorney-General) and <em>B. </em>Johnson, were for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-2\">If the sheriff takes goods in execution, it is a discharge of the plaintiff. 2 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>355. <em>Salk. </em>323.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-3\">The sheriff has no power to distress when out of office. By the acts of 1763, c. 18. s. 34. and 1779, c. 29. the power given to the sheriff to distrain is for tobacco fees only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-4\">A statute giving a\" new remedy or jurisdiction should be construed strictly. The act of 1799, c. 29. does not enumerate executors, and does not, of course, extend to them.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The general court determined the demurrer to be good, and gave judgment against the <em>avowant. </em>In this case the 1st and 3d points only being material, the court were decidedly of opinion in the negative. As to the third point, though no judicial opinion was given, yet the court seemed to think that if the question should be brought before them, they would not hesitate to say that the defendant is not liable for the poundage fees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
