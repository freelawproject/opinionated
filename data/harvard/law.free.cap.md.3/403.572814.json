Whether <em>Achsah, </em>or her brother <em>Charles, </em>was heir to their brother ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-5\">The case is briefly this : Land is conveyed to <em>A. </em>for life, the remainder in fee to <em>B., </em>who dies leaving a sister of the whole blood, and afterwards a brother of the whole blood is born. Is the sister or the afterborn brother heir to <em>B. P</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-6\">The sister was heiress of <em>B. </em>until the birth of her brother,' and the remainder in fee descended on her till that event; but the instant her brother was born, the descent shifted from her to him. On the death of <em>Charles Ridgely </em>the younger, (say the first Charles,) the remainder in fee descended on, and became vested in, his sister Achsah, and there remained until the birth of her brother <em>Charles, </em>(the second Charles,) when by operation of law, her remainder in fee was devested, and shifted to, and descended on, her said brother. If he had died without issue and she had survived, the estate would again have descended on <em>her; </em>and on the birth of another brother, would again have been devested and shifted to him, <em>Powell on </em>Descents, 438. cites 5 <em>Edw. </em>IV. c. 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-7\">The first general rule concerning descents is, that the law prefers the worthiest of blood, and therefore in de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>scents, the male is preferred before the females, viz. the son before the daughter, the brother before the sister, and the uncle before the aunt. 2 <em>Bl.

It is otherwise if the estate vests in the daughter by purchase and not by descent, in which case, a brother bom afterwards would, not devest the estate. 14 <em>Vin. Abr. </em>tit.
