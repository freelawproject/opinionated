Plea, <em>non assumpsit.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-8\">At the trial of the case, at <em>May </em>term, 1789, the defendant\u2019s counsel offered to give in evidence, a tender of bills of credit under the act of 1777, c. 9. entitled \u201c An act to make the bills of credit issued by congress, and the bills of credit emitted by acts of assembly, and resolves of the late conventions, a legal tender in all cases.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-9\">Cooke, for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An8\">objected to the admissibility of such evidence, and contended that the construction of the clause in the act of 1777, c. 9. was confined to debt, and that the true distinction was where a statute makes a contract void, or only voidable, as the statutes of usury and gaming, which make a contract void <em>ab </em>initio, consequently there never could exist a contract or <em>assumpsit </em>under them; ergo, they may be given in evidence on <em>non assumpsit; </em>but where a statute makes a contract only voidable, it must be pleaded, and cannot be given in evidence. <em>Gilb. Evid. </em>62.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-10\">Matters which go not to the action, but in discharge or avoidance of it, must be pleaded as is the act of limitations. See <em>Buller\u2019s JV. P. </em>220. as to the statute of usury and the statute relating to sheriffs\u2019 bonds. On <em>nil debet </em>for rent, the act of limitations may be given in evidence j aliter, on <em>non assumpsit. Per </em>Holt, <em>Salk. </em>278. The offering of the tender law admits the assumpsit, and is in avoidance of it, and therefore comes directly within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>eases cited, and, consequently, ought to have been pleaded, and cannot be given in evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-4\">Martin,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyW\">(Attorney-General,) for the defendant. As to the construction of the act, the affirmative words per\u00bb mit it to be given in evidence on the plea of payment. The reason holds as to the assumpsit, there being no negative words in the act. 5 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>16.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\">As to the distinction of <em>void </em>and voidable, it existed at common law, and any thing showing the contract <em>void </em>could be given in evidence, as duress, coverture, infancy. So under the statute of usury and gaming. Afterwards, for the sake of remedy, any thing might be given in evidence in discharge or avoidance, and needed not to be pleaded, as a release, which would be an admission of the contract, and showing <em>ex post facto </em>matter to discharge the defendant; so of payment, and, from a parity of reasoning, this act, which discloses <em>ex post facto </em>matter to defeat the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover, may be given in evidence.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b323-6\">Harrison, Ch.
