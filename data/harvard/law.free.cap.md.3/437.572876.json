If the second course in the deed had called for a tree, no doubt the plaintiff ought to go to it, though it stood in a different direction, and much further than the course and distance expressed in the deed. If the plaintiff had nothing else to govern him, he should be bound by the course and distance; but if the jury can be satisfied that the parties had run to a different place for the termination of that line, there the jury are bound to carry them. The plaintiff can prove, by testimony, that the land has always been considered to lay as located by the plaintiff.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b442-7\">\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AOc\">were of opinion that the party must be confined to his courses and distances, and that he cannot explain by parol testimony what land was intended to be conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The plaintiff suffered a nonsuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
