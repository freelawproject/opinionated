Let us then advert to the record, and see whether any thing appears on the face of it to distinguish it from other disputed cases between \u00abntizea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>and citizen, which are brought into courts of justice for decision; whether there is any thing to authorize the-court to Pass the speedy judgment the court have passed in the present case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-4\">In examining this record, we must recollect that no other proof or evidence can be resorted to in deciding on the merits or demerits of this appeal, but what appears and is stated on the face of the record itself. 3 <em>BL </em>Com. 405. Writ of error only lies upon matters of law arising on the face of the proceedings; so that no evidence is required to substantiate or support it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-5\">We cannot travel out of the record, and seek for other proofs or vouchers to support the judgment rendered, if on inspection it appears defective. It must stand or fall by itself. Nothing can be read in evidence on the hearing of an appeal, which was not read or insisted on in the court below. 1 <em>Bro. Parl. Cas. 70.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afs\">Having therefore established the position, that the validity of the judgment must solely depend on the regularity and correctness of the proceedings apparent on the face of the record, as it came from the court below, let us examine this record for a moment, and trace out its various imperfections and defects.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-7\">It states, that \u201c on the 30th of May, 1795, in pursuance of the act of assembly of the state of Maryland, passed at <em>November </em>session, <em>1793, </em>entitled an act to repeal conditionally, an act,\u201d &amp;c. then sets forth the award, notice, affidavit, and the judgment of the court thereon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-8\">This record, then, refers to the title of an act of assembly, which act has not been set forth, or made a part of the proceedings, although the same is depended on as the foundation on which the present judgment is to be supported. Here a question will arise, which must prove fatal to the judgment rendered, and put an end to the present controversy in favour of the appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-9\">Is the act of assembly (the title of which only is referred to in the record) a public statute, of which the judges are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>bound, <em>ex </em>oficio, to take notice; or is it a private act only, in which the community at large are no wise interested\u2014 an act delegating <em>a </em>special authority to particular persons, and affecting the property of an individual only r</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-4\">Every statute which relates to all the subjects of the realm, is a public statute. ' 4 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>639. Wherever the intent of an act of parliament is particular, it shall be deemed a private act. 4 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>640.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-5\">From this definition, it will evidently appear that the act alluded to in the record is a private act, and, as such, subject to all the rules which the courts have adopted with respect to private statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-6\">No one is under an obligation to take notice of, or understand, a private statute. <em>Gilb. </em>L. <em>E. </em>12, 13. A public statute may be pleaded without reciting it; for the rule of law is, that the judges, <em>ex officio, </em>are bound to take notice of every public statute. 4 <em>Bac. Abr. 655.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-7\">If a private statute be pleaded, it must be set out specially ; for unless this is done, the judges cannot take notice of any thing contained in such statute. 4 Bac. <em>Abr. 655.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-9\">Courts ought to take notice of a general statute without pleading <em>it; </em>but they are not bound to take notice of particular or private statutes. 1 <em>Inst. 98. </em>b. The court cannot take notice of a private act -unless it be pleaded. <em>5 Co. </em>2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-10\">It is not necessary to recite a general statute. It is otherwise of a private statute 5 for the statute is the ground of the suit, and we ought always to recite the substance of the action. <em>Plowd. 65. </em>84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-11\">It will be easy to conclude, from what has been premised, 1st. That the act of assembly referred to in the record is a private act only; 2d. That the judges cannot take notice of any thing contained in a private act unless it be pleaded, and that specially.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-12\">This being established to the satisfaction of the court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>let us see whether this act of assembly is specially plead\u2122 ed, so that the court can take any notice of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aed\">The act of assembly is not made part of the record j not a single clause of it is stated or recited, either in the record or in the award; nothing but the title of the act is referred to, and that is no part of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-5\">In pleading a statute, the title of it need not be set forth, because it is no part of the statute, no more than the title of a book is part of a book. Ld. <em>Raym. 77. Salk. 609. </em>1 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>95. Heath, 113.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-6\">Here, then, I contend, that reciting or pleading the title of the act, (which is no part of the act,) is equally ineffectual and faulty as if it had not been recited at all. The record might as well have referred to a decree of the national convention of France, or a mandate of the empress of <em>Russia, </em>and the court would have been equally bound to take notice of it. The judges cannot take notice of this act of assembly, or give any decision on the provisions contained in it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-7\">What is the reason that the law has required a private act to be pleaded and set forth with the same formality and exactness as a bond or other contract ? It is in order that the judges may be enabled to decide, on view, whether the act done, or thing demanded, was according to the directions of the statute, they being precluded from receiving information from any other source than what is apparent on the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-8\">When a private act is pleaded, it is not good to say, <em>inter alia enacta est; </em>but if it concerns several distinct matters, it is necessary to recite all that concerns the <em>materia subjecta, </em>and to aver that it is all that concerns this matter. <em>Freem. 67. 75. </em>This was on a motion suggesting facts for a prohibition \u2014 a summary proceeding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-9\">There is another reason why a private statute, in all judicial proceedings, should be set forth at large; that the defendant may not be surprised, but have an opportunity of contesting the authenticity of the act by a plea. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>of <em>nul tiel </em>record, which he could not do if it was not set forth, and which the judges would not suffer to be done if they were bound, <em>ex officio^ </em>to take notice of them as public acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-3\">If a private statute be pleaded, the contents thereof may be put in issue on a plea of <em>nul tiel record. </em>4 <em>Bac. Abr. 655.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-5\">From the aforegoing remarks, I think it must clearly appear, that the judges cannot take any notice of the act of assembly, it being a private act, and not set forth; that the proceedings had in the court below, cannot be justified by common law principles, and are erroneous; consequently the judgment must be for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-6\">But this judgment is fraught with so many errors, that even if the act of assembly had been made part of the record and proceedings, and the court thereby enabled to take judicial notice of it; yet the court must reverse this judgment on other grounds apparent on the face of the proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-7\">1. There is no award produced, as the act requires, but only the copy of an award filed in court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-8\">The copy is no evidence. The act requires the award itself. But suppose the act had not required the original award to be produced, yet I contend the copy filed in this case is no evidence of itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-9\">, In actions of debt on bond, it is matter of substance to make a profert of the deed, because this is the contract on which the court ought to found their judgment, and therefore it ought to be exhibited to the court. <em>Gilb. L. E. 95. Bull. N. P. 253.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-11\">Where any thing is to be proved, the deed itself must be given in evidence, and not the copy of it. <em>Gilb. L. E. 95. 10 Co. </em>92. b. 93.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-13\">The law requires the best evidence that the nature of the thing is capable of. The deed is much better evidence than the copy of it. <em>Gilb. L. E. </em>96.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-14\">Where a person claims by a deed, he ought to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>a profer\u00ed of it to the court. The deed itself must be given in evidence. <em>Bull. N. P. </em>249. 254. <em>Esp. </em>769. <em>772.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-7\">2. If the original award, instead of a copy, had been produced to the court, this award is not made pursuant to the act of assembly; therefore it is null and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-8\">It has already been remarked, that \u25a0 we cannot travel out of this record to seek for proofs or testimony either to support the judgment given in the court below, or to reverse it. We are tied down to the proofs and proceedings apparent on the face of the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-9\">Taking up the subject, then, on an admission that the court can take notice of the act of assembly, and that it will constitute the rule by which the court is to decide-the present question, let us then see how far the copy of the award filed in this cause corresponds with that act; and if it is not made pursuant to the act, it is void, and the judgment entered thereon must be reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-10\">It may be proper, at this stage of the argument, to request the attention of the court to several authorities, where rules are laid down for the construction of statutes delegating special powers, and the regulation of proceedings had under them. For to construe the paper filed in this cause \u00e1ti award, pursuant to, and in conformity to the act of assembly, is to say, there is no certainty in numbers. Where authority is particular, the party must pursue it. If the act varies from.it, he departs from the authority, and what he does is void. 1 <em>Salk. </em>96. \u2018</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-11\">Where special authority is given to justices, the authority is to be exactly pursued. <em>Salk. </em>475. Special authority must be strictly pursued, and cannot be exceeded. 1 <em>Burr. </em>447.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-13\">Where by statute, a special authority is delegated to particular persons, affecting the property of individuals, it must be strictly pursued, and appear to be so on the face of the proceedings. <em>Cowp. </em>26. 29.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-14\">From these authorities it will readily occur, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>powers delegated under the act of assembly in question, are special with respect to the governor, who was to nom\u00ednate arbitrators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-5\">With respect to the arbitrators, when nominated, and with respect to the court who was to give judgment, a line of conduct was prescribed for each, and which, if not strictly pursued and followed, Would vitiate and make void the act done in consequence thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-6\">By the second section of the act of assembly, the governor was to nominate three persons to be arbitrators, for the purpose of settling and adjusting the compensation, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-7\">By the third section, the arbitrators, or a majority of them, so nominated, shall have power and authority, on giving fifteen days\u2019 notice in writing to the said parties, to meet and proceed <em>ex </em>parte, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-8\">By the fifth section, if the arbitrators, or either of them, die, refuse to act, are reiidered incapable of acting, or neglect to act for the space of thirty days after notice of their appointment, the governor, on being satisfied of such neglect or refusal, is to nominate another arbitrator or arbitrators in their place, and so from time to time, till three arbitrators can be found to act and finally settle and adjust the said compensation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-9\">By the sixth section, the arbitrators, or a majority of them, shall be authorized to ascertain, by their award, the amount, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-10\">By the seventh section, sufficient to produce the award and file a copy thereof, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-11\">By the powers entrusted to the governor, he was authorized to choose three arbitrators. If they neglected to act for thirty days, he was to choose one or more in their stead till three could be found to act. Then it was necessary that three should be nominated, and that three should act before any award could be made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-12\">It was the intention of the law, that the parties should have the benefit of three persons\u2019 deliberations, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>the opinion of two was sufficient in case of a difference jn Opinjon <em>\u2022 </em>als0, why say choose one in case of neglect, 1 . &amp;c. or why say the governor to repeat his appointments till three could be found to act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-6\">The act is to be construed so that every clause may be gratified if not repugnant. There is no repugnancy in any of the clauses. What construction have the courts put on such powers, and the exercise of them <em>\u25a0 </em>They have uniformly adjudged that they should be literally pursued, otherwise all acts done in virtue thereof are deemed void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-7\">What hath the governor done in this case ? He has only appointed two arbitrators, if we are to be guided by the record and proceedings in this cause, and no other in formation can we receive. The only evidence of the appointment of the two is contained in the copy of the award itself, which says that the governor appointed the subscribers as arbitrators <em>; </em>that <em>we two of the arbitrators </em>have taken upon ourselves the execution of the powers, &amp;c. The act says three were to be appointed, and that three must act. The award says that two took upon themselves the execution of the powers given by the act. The award then must be void on two grounds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-8\">1. Because the governor did not pursue the powers entrusted to him, but deviated therefrom by appointing only <em>two </em>persons instead of <em>three.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-9\"><em>2. </em>If he did appoint three, (of which we have no evidence,) yet two of the arbitrators only took upon themselves the execution of the powers. An assumption of power not warranted by the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-10\">The following authorities will satisfy the court that what is contended for is law. 1 <em>Burr. </em>447. 451. Four freeholders were directed by an act of parliament to be appointed <em>; </em>the number the legislature named could not be altered. <em>Burr. </em>448. The precise number is not an immaterial thing. <em>Burr. </em>445. This is an authority founded on a positive law, and therefore must be pursued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Powers given by a positive law, or even by deed, to a \u2022certain number of persons, can never be exceeded in the article of number j on the other hand, the number four could not be lessened.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-3\">On a commission to six, four or two, and executed by three, it was adjudged to be void and without warrant. And where a letter of attorney is made to three jointly and severally, two cannot execute it. Yelv. 26.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-5\">An authority to two to do an act relating to the public, may be executed by one only. It is otherwise in the case of a private authority. 1 <em>Stra. 117.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-6\">Where the power to do an act was originally granted by a statute, it must be shown, in pleading the statute, that the act was done according to the directions of such statute. 4 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 656. So here it is incumbent to show that the number of arbitrators required by the act were appointed, that three acted, and that all the other requisites were complied with. As that cannot be done, the award is void, and the judgment must be entered for the appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-7\">I now proceed to another objection apparent on the face of the copy of the award, which must make it null and void, admitting three arbitrators had been appointed and three had acted. It is this: the arbitrators were directed by the law to give the parties fifteen days\u2019 notice, in writing, before they could legally proceed. They have neglected this previous requisite, (at least there is no evidence of the fact,) therefore, all their proceedings are void, being <em>coram non </em>judice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-8\">To satisfy the court that the notice in writing is essential, I will call their attention to the following authorities. Co<em>wp. </em>30. If a particular form of notice be prescribed, it must be fully set out, and precisely pursued. An allegation that due notice was given, is not sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-10\">A defective notice is not cured by the appearance of the party. The case was where a jury was summoned to value land condemned for a road, under an act of parlia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ment. Notice in writing was directed to be given. The court condemned the land, and their judgment recited that due notice was given. The judgment was held to be void. <em>Cowp. 30.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-3\">He that is bound to give notice ought to show how he gave it, that the court may judge whether it was according to the condition. <em>Secundum formam et effectum </em>con<em>ditionis </em>will not do. <em>Freem. </em>247.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-4\">In a dispute between landlord and tenant, who held over after notice, the court determined that notice in writing being required by the act of parliament from the landlord to the tenant, it was essentially necessary to be proved. 3 <em>Burr. </em>1607. 1609. <em>5 Burr. </em>2698.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-5\">In debt on bond, conditioned-to perform an award so as said award be made in writing indented, dated, &amp;c. it was pleaded that the award was made and dated according to the <em>form </em>and <em>effect </em>of the condition. It was ruled to be naught; that referring to the <em>form </em>and <em>effect </em>does not aid it. Freem. 467. So here, a reference according to the act of assembly, or in pursuance of the act of assembly, is naught.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-6\">An order for the non-payment of tithes (a summary proceeding similar to the present) was quashed, because the proceedings recited only upon complaint generally, and the statute required the complaint to be in writing. 1 <em>Stra. </em>264.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-7\">There cannot be a settlement by constructive presumptive notice, where the statute required forty days\u2019 notice in writing to be given to a churchwarden or overseer of the poor, before a settlement was gained. 2 <em>Stra. 63. </em>There can be no constructive notice. <em>Salk. </em>476.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-8\">Upon the objection, then, of notice not being given in writing, as required by the act, this award is void, and all the consequent proceedings must be reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-9\">Having thus pointed out several particular objections to this record, any one of which I trust is sufficient to reverse this judgment, I will now call the attention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the court, while I show what are the requisites essential and absolutely necessary to make an award valid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-3\">Form and substance are both required. An award must be alleged to be made in form according to the submission. It must pursue the submission.in point of form \u2022as well as substance. <em>Stra. </em>116. This award has neither the requisite of form or substance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-4\">What limits do the law prescribe when a person prosecutes a claim under a statute <em>l</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-5\">If an action is founded on a statute, the plaintiff must aver every matter which is requisite to entitle him to an action. 1 <em>Com. Dig. 244. </em>And in all cases where any circumstances are required by the proviso of a statute to make it good, they ought to be averred. <em>5 Com. </em>Dig. <em>50. </em>The plaintiff ought to aver every thing necessary to inform the court that his case is within the statute. <em>5 Com. Dig. 49.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-6\">If these requisites are deemed essentially necessary in an action wherein the defendant has an opportunity to appear, plead, and make his defence, how much more necessary are they in summary proceedings, wherein judgment is had on motion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-7\">But, perhaps, it will be said that the act of assembly has provided for all the defects pointed out, by directing that it shall be sufficient to produce the award, and file a copy thereof, without any declaration, &amp;c. Has the act of assembly said that the judges shall, <em>ex officio, </em>take notice of this act without its being pleaded ? Has the act of assembly said that this act shall be considered as a public act in all courts of justice;. a provision frequently-made in private acts to avoid the prolixity of pleading ? Did the legislature intend that the court should give judgment on the production of the copy of an award, that was defective ? Without further inquiry, ought not the court to have been satisfied that the award was made pursuant to the submission, and that the act of assembly was complied with, both in form and substance <em>l </em>How <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>could the court be satisfied of these facts, barely from the copy of the award, and unless they could take notice act \u00b0f assembly in their judicial capacity ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-3\">Suppose this award had been made by one person only, and motion had been made for judgment on the copy or the original award, was the court to exercise no discretion in determining whether the award was such a one as the act of assembly prescribed ? How were they to exercise their judgment and give an opinion without the necessary papers ? Was it not necessary that the award itself should be produced ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-4\">What was intended by the legislature in providing that on producing the award, and filing a copy, it should be in lieu of a declaration ? It was to prevent delay and multiplicity of pleading; but it never was intended, and no legal construction will warrant the assertion, that dispensing with a declaration rendered it unnecessary to produce and file a private act of assembly, the only cause of action, the very groundwork of the whole, and o\u00a3 which the court could not otherwise take notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-5\">Will dispensing with the declaration make the governor\u2019s appointment of <em>two </em>arbitrators, instead of <em>three., </em>a compliance with the act of assembly, and a valid appointment? Will dispensing with the declaration make the act of <em>two </em>arbitrators valid, when <em>three </em>were required <em>to act </em>by the law ? Will dispensing with the declaration make the copy of an award as good evidence as the award itself, which the law required to be produced ? Will dispensing with the declaration cure the want of notice in writing ? Will it cure the defects apparent on the face of this record ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-6\">But, perhaps, it will be said that as the general court gave this judgment, we are to presume the act of assembly was their guide, and that they were satisfied by-proofs that the governor appointed three arbitrators;, that three arbitrators consented to act, and did not act, and that the notice given to the parties was in writing ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>that the original award was laid before them, otherwise they could not have given judgment. 2 <em>Burr. </em>901.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-3\">To this objection, I reply, that an award cannot be made good by implication. 1 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>612.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-4\">That an award is not to be construed as a will or deed, but as a judgment, the, re cord of which you cannot depart from to decide on its operation. <em>Yelv. </em>98. Wills and deeds are allowed a greater latitude of construction than judgments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-5\">But in this record every paper filed in this cause is expressly stated \u2014 the copy of the award, notice and affidavit ; so that if the appointment by the governor had been produced, it would have been filed, as would also have been the act of assembly. We are, then, to infer that the only pro'ofs exhibited in this cause were the copy of the award, the notice, and affidavit; and in deciding on the, appeal, no other papers can be taken into consideration than what were before the general court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-6\">I shall now submit the case to the court, trusting that I have fully pointed out such errors and defects in this record as make it a mere nullity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-7\">1. That the act of assembly, on which the judgment was founded being a private act, it ought to have been filed to enable the judges to take notice of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-8\">2. That from the record it appears only two arbitrators were appointed by the governor instead of three.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-9\">3. That two arbitrators took upon themselves the trust, when three were required to act by the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-10\"><em>4. </em>That no original award was produced, but a copy only of the award was filed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-11\">5. That no notice in writing was given to the defendant. For all, or any of which objections or defects, the judgment is erroneous, and must be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ALN\">Jenings, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alcs\">It appears that, by consent of the, parties, an act of the legislature was passed, authorizing an appointment of arbitrators; and to prevent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>any further delay, when the award should be returned,, and not complied with, judgment was to be entered. This has been done, and, notwithstanding the matter has been duly examined by the arbitrators, there is now an attempt made to set aside the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-3\">If the court have the least doubt, they will confirm the judgment, it being consonant with justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-4\">The act of assembly was made for laudable purposes. It was to put the parties in the same situation as if the award had been made in pursuance of a reference entered into in court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-5\">Awards heretofore have been construed in \u00e1 very strict manner, but of late years the courts have relaxed much in their construction of them; they have given them a liberal construction,</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-6\">Motion may be made to set aside an award for partiality of the <em>arbitrators; </em>therefore it cannot be given in evidence in an action on an award. 2 <em>Wils. </em>148, 149.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-7\">The presumption is in favour of the award, because the party might' have shown by pleading that it was not proper. 2 <em>Wils. 267. </em>It was the duty of <em>Dorsey </em>to show error upon the face pf the award, and not having done so, the court are to presume every thing to have been rightly done in the court below, because the party might there have shown error.*</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-8\">Was it ever set forth in the award that the party had notice <em>l </em>Pleading is good evidence of what the law is. There never was a good plea, if every thing must appear as contended for. <em>Yelv. </em>203. 1 <em>Vent. 50.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-9\">As the party did not make the motion in court to set aside the award, he has lost\u2019the opportunity, and cannot do it before this court. That cannot be assigned for error which might have been <em>pleaded; </em>the principle is, to prevent vexation and delay.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-10\">The court will intend an original. The <em>onus probandi </em>lies on the appellant, and the clearest proof is necessary to contradict what may be intended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>A private act of parliament need not be exemplified. Where the plea is not <em>nul tiel </em>record, the statute book may be given in evidence. Before a jury, a printed copy of an act is good evidence. 2 <em>Salk. 566.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-3\">This cannot be compared with a special authority, and <em>one </em>which is to be construed strictly. If it is, then every arbitration is a special authority, and every award returned under an order of court is open to the ^fame objection. There can be no difference because one'is under a general act, and the other under a special act. Unless this award is to be distinguished from all other awards, the judgment rendered on it must prevail. Judgments have been entered under a particular act of assembly by the <em>Potomac Company. </em>There have been no objections made to these judgments, although, no doubt, the ingenuity of counsel might have raised such as have been made in this case. These nice objections are almost a reproach to the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-4\">On a conviction for obstructing an excise officer in coming to weigh candles, it was objected that by the statute the officer has power to enter by day or night, and if by night, then in the presence of a constable, and it was not said whether it was by day or by night, for it might have been by night without a <em>constable; </em>but the court said, that should have been shown by the defendant ; it was enough the conviction did not appear to be wrong, and they presumed the entry to have been made in the day. 1 <em>Stra. </em>608. 2 <em>Stra. </em>1240.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-5\">Can it be conceived that judgments given out of court can be compared with the judgment in the present case? judgments given out of court must state every thing, because they are to be subject to the control of the court of <em>king's bench.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-6\">If a special authority is delegated, a writ of error will not lie at all. Special authorities are all removed by <em>certiorari. </em>1 <em>Vent. </em>33. 117. By supporting this to be a special authority, they show that a writ of error would not lie at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Inferior courts never give their reasons, nor do they state the evidence on the record. The appellant had the same opportunity to show against this motion what he might have pleaded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-3\">It has been said that the governor did not appoint three arbitrators. How does this appear ? The court will presume three were appointed, unless the contrary appear. Besides, sufficient does appear on the award to justify every one in saying that three arbitrators were appointed. The award says, \u201c two of the arbitrators aforesaid.\u201d If but two had been appointed, the award would have been, <em>we the </em>arbitrators, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-4\">Every construction in favour of the acts of lay gents have always been admitted. It is totally immaterial whether there were three arbitrators appointed or not, because it was incumbent on the appellant to show three, were not appointed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-5\">This court will presume the original award was produced. By the record it appears that the original award was produced, for the copy inserted in the record is officially attested by the clerk of the court; this could not have been done if the original had not been produced. No court could have been satisfied without the produce tion of the original. The law says the original must be produced, and a copy of it filed. This has been done, and this appears by the record. It was not necessary to state the fact, that the original award was produced. All that the appellee was bound to do, and all that was necessary for him.to do, was to produce the original.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-6\">There is a difference between travelling out of the record, and presuming what does not appear on the record. This judgment being entered on an award, is entitled to every indulgence of construction by the court, and the arbitrators are to be considered as acting in lieu of jurors, and their award is to be considered as if it had been the verdict of a jury given in the cause, and to be construed as such.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Authorities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3RT\">An award by rule of court is not within the excepSion to other awards. 12 <em>Mod. </em>234.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A43\">Every ground of relief is open on a motion to set aside the award. 3 <em>Burr. </em>1259.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-5\">Partiality of arbitrators cannot be given in evidence in an action on an award by stat. <em>Wm. </em>III. A motion may be made to set it aside. 2 <em>Wils. </em>149.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-6\">Awards are not considered strictly as formerly, and the court presumed a fact, because the contrary might have been shown if it were so. 2 <em>Wils. </em>268.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-7\">Where from the nature of the thing, the award may be ascertained by a reference to something else, it is sufficient. <em>Kyd, </em>138.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-8\">Submission to three, or any two, if the third arbitrator had notice of the meeting and might have attended, two may act. This was on motion to set aside an award. <em>Kyd, </em>67. <em>Barnes's Notes, </em>57. Do any awards from court, when made by two arbitrators, set forth that the other had notice; and are not judgments always entered up, if there is no motion to set aside the award ? They might as well allege that it does not appear the defendant had notice to attend. It is never done. If he had not, he should move to set aside the award.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-10\">On a plea of <em>no award, </em>the plaintiff replies <em>an award, it </em>is not necessary to add that the defendant had notice. The want of notice should come from his side. So is the form of pleading, where submission to three, or any two; it is sufficient to set forth an award by two, and if \u00bfhe other had no notice, it should have been replied, where the submission was by bond; but if by rule of court, it should have been on motion to set it aside.

Abr. </em>640. pl. 6, This act is a public one so far as it gives authority to the judges of the general court to enter up the judgment. With a view to the authority of the judges to enter up the judgment, it was a <em>public </em>law, being to exercise judgment in <em>term, </em>time, and the judges are bound to take notice of it.as- a <em>public </em>law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>\"Whether it is a public or a private law, it is not neces'\u2022sary, in the present case, to produce it. The production \u25a0of the act is only to show the right attaches to the party, None of the authorities go to show the necessity of putting it on the record. The act never meant that there should be any pleadings, and if there were no pleadings, how could the act be put on the record ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-4\">The necessity of a declaration being waived, every idea of pleading is precluded. The appellant could plead nothing in bar to the award; he could not plead <em>nul tiel records </em>if he could have pleaded <em>nul tiel record </em>of the law, and the appellee had replied <em>hubetur tale </em>recordum, in doing so he was not bound to set out the law, for there is no instance in pleading <em>habetur tale </em>recordum, that the record is set out, or if there is an appeal, of sending it to the superior court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-5\">The law was enacted upon the principle that there was to be no pleading. It was made in full confidence that the award would be fulfilled ; and if not fulfilled, it would be sufficient to produce the award and file a copy, upon which the court were to give judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-6\">In a suggestion, it is requisite to set forth every thing as particularly as in a declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-7\">In what manner did the la%v intend that <em>Dorsey </em>should defend himself? In no other way but by appearing in court and objecting to the award ; and not having availed himself of the motion, he is precluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-8\">This law was drawn with a view that this award should be subject to the same rules as all other awards. In cases of awards, it never appears on the record that the proof of notice was made. Suppose <em>Dorsey </em>had appeared and objected to the award, would the court send up all the depositions which might have been taken ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-10\">The act intended to place the parties in the same situation as if there had been a prior suit depending between them, and the cause had been referred agreeably to the common practice of the court. 1 he legislature did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>dream that such a number of frivolous objections would have been raised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-8\">Where a day is given for a party to appear in court, and he neglects to appear, he is precluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-9\">What averments could the party make so as to have them entered on th\u201c record ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-10\">A judgment upon an award aids and cures any defects which may be in a declaration: Indeed the judgment is good without any declaration at all. The act of October, 1778, c. 21. says, that judgments upon awards are to have the same effect as judgments upon verdicts. The judgment, therefore, on this award is to have the same effect as if it had been a judgment upon the verdict of a jury, and all defects are cured which a judgment upon a verdict would have cured.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-11\">It is not necessary for the original act to be produced, nor is it necessary that the <em>proof </em>and <em>authority </em>should be on the record, for this court never will presume that the general court have violated the powers delegated to them by the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-12\">This law is to be considered as the agreement of the parties, and the judgment assented to by the appellant. 4 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>648. pl. 39.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-13\">In order to form a right judgment of a statute, put yourself in the place of the law makers, and ask what an honest man would do. 4 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>649. pl. 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-14\">The reason why matters of fact should appear on the record out of term time is, because the court of <em>king's bench </em>has a superintending power and control. But this is not applicable to our general court in giving their judgment in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-15\"><em>Cowp. </em>26. This was an <em>extrajudicial </em>procedure. But the present case before the court was not a special authority given to the general court. Lord <em>Mansfield </em>takes a distinction where there is an authority to take away a man\u2019s property against his will and where he consents to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The particular act in the present case was not made against the will of <em>Edward Dorsey ; </em>he assented to every provision in the act, and it cannot be assimilated to the case in <em>Cowper. </em>That case was flying in the teeth of law, and not applicable to the present case; and <em>Dorsey </em>cannot be said to be in the situation of the case in Cowper, 26.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-8\">Awards are now considered with greater latitude than formerly; and 1 <em>Burr. </em>277. reprobates <em>strict objections </em>to them. Actions of debt on bond for awards contain the nicest cases in special pleading.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-9\">What is the case in an action of debt on an award ? 1 <em>Burr. </em>280, 281. In an action of debt on an award, you need not state in the declaration more than is necessary to show the case. Where there is an objection to the performance of an award, the defendant must show it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-10\">The court will intend that the return only went to what was in view.</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-11\">If the defendant is to impeach an award, it must come on the part of the defendant in pleading. The court will always presume the award right until the contrary is shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-12\"><em>Leon. </em>72. The distinction is here taken between debt on bond for an award, and debt on an award itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-13\">The original award was produced to the court. The copy attested by the clerk is sufficient evidence of the <em>original </em>having been <em>produced. </em>The clerk was to take a copy, and how could he take it without having the original.</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-14\">If the execution of the award had been contested, would the depositions taken upon the contest be inserted in the record ? This has never been the practice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-15\">They have connected the third clause of the act with the fifth clause, and say that all three of the arbitrators must act. This is not the intention of the act, nor does it say so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-16\">It is obvious that the court will intend every thing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>be done in this case which was requisite on the part of the plaintiff below. 1 <em>Burr. </em>247. And they will favour all they can the judgment which has been given. It is requisite the superior court should intend every thing to aid a judgment by justices. The award states that <em>two of the arbitrators </em>made the award. It means two out of the three arbitrators who were appointed by the governor, and the court must intend that three arbitrators were appointed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-3\">The counsel for the appellant would deduce and dwindle down the power of the general court in this particular case, as acting under a mere <em>letter of attorney. </em>Suppose the award had stated ten days\u2019 notice in writing, could not <em>Whetcroft </em>be permitted to prove that fifteen days\u2019 notice in writing had been given. It was a fact which might have been contested in the general court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-4\">It is a clear rule of law, that after verdict, every thing necessary to sustain the judgment shall be presumed; so in this case, the court will presume every thing to have been rightly done.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-5\">Martin, (Attorney-General,) for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaM2\">in reply. The appellee, if he has a good case, may make it before the court of law, notwithstanding this case is reversed. He may begin again; the decision here will not affect him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-6\">By the act there is no day given for <em>Dorsey </em>to come into court and make objections to this award; nor is there any thing in the law which says in case <em>Dorsey </em>does not appear, the judges are to enter the judgment; all that is given by the law to <em>Dorsey </em>is, that he may be at liberty to <em>prove payment.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-7\"><em>Dorsey </em>was willing to comply with the award if' it had been made agreeably to the law. The more he was in the power of <em>Whetcroft </em>by the act of assembly, so much the more necessary was it that the court should be satisfied of every previous requisite-</p>\n<p data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>This act authorizes the governor to appoint persons as arbitrators, instead of leaving it to the parties themselves to make the choice, in the same manner as the act which authorizes the court to decide on petitions for freedom.</p>\n<p data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-4\">Independent of the particular jurisdiction given by this act, action must have been brought upon the award, and the only difference is, that the examination of facts is thrown into a different tribunal, and the court required the same facts and proofs as if it had been tried before a Jury-</p>\n<p data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-6\">This act does not authorize <em>Dorsey </em>to come in and show misconduct of the arbitrators. It has none of the necessary provisions contained in the laws respecting awards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-7\">Upon the same principle that you cannot show any thing against a verdict after four days, so it is that you cannot show any thing against an award after a judgment upon the award.</p>\n<p data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-8\">It has been admitted, at least in part, that this is a private act of the legislature. It must be admitted that no person was interested in the law but <em>Whetcroft </em>and <em>Dor</em>sey. Why was it given to the judges to act in session, it has been asked? It was no more a power for the judges of the general court to do this act, than any other persons; for giving extra powers to persons having other powers, does not alter the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-9\">It can make no difference whether part of the law is public or <em>private; </em>there are the same clauses in the law both <em>public </em>and <em>private ; </em>the court could only take notice of the public parts of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-10\">The court could not, on an action, take any notice of this law unless brought forward; and this court can only have the same evidence before them which the court below had, and which appears upon the record before them. In cases on petitions for freedom where there Is an appeal, there is no new evidence taken on the as - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>peal; and it has been conceded that no other evidence than what appears on the face of the record can be taken into consideration by this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-3\">But on an issue of <em>nul tiel </em>record, the whole record must appear, or how can the appellate court know whether there was such record ? Suppose certain variances between the <em>record pleaded </em>and <em>the act; </em>it must constitute a part of the record, that the superior court may judge whether there is a variance or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-4\">If the defendant pleads a private act of the legislature, it must appear on the record. What is the party to do if he wants to obtain any thing on a motion to state the private act at large ? Parties must set forth, either on suggestion or otherwise, the private act of parliament under which they mean to rely. When an act is referred to a jury, a copy in the printed book will answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"181\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-5\">This judgment is totally erroneous on common law principles ; there is no verdict, no <em>reference; </em>there is nothing by which the general court could give a judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"182\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-6\">What evidence can they have but record ? They cannot take any notice of the act any more than they could take notice of a bond referred to in a declaration. Though the <em>original award </em>is now in court, yet not making any part of the record, this court cannot take notice of it; so also though the act of the legislature is now in court and printed in the volume of laws on your table, yet not being a public law, but being a private law, and not making a part of the record, it cannot be taken notice of.</p>\n<p data-order=\"183\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-7\">What must have been done if the award had been made without any particular act of assembly, but under circumstances similar to those stated in the law ? There can be no doubt but that the whole circumstances must have been stated ; every <em>antecedent </em>transaction, not <em>subsequent things.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"184\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-8\">The fidelity of the persons appointed under the law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>was discretionary with the governor; it is not the business of parties to prove a negative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"185\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD0\">Suppose a declaration and one single article omitted, a judgment on it would be erroneous. If a judgment was entered by default, yet the judgment would be erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"186\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-5\">A verdict only cures form, but it does not cure the want of <em>substance.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"187\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-6\">The case in 1 <em>Burr. 280. </em>shows that nothing antecedently done is to be presumed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"188\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-7\">If an action of debt is brought on an award, every necessary must be set forth to show that an award was made, and that every thing on the part of the. plaintiff has been performed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"189\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-8\">No more is necessary in the case of debt on an award, than to show what is necessary for the plaintiff. The defendant is to show what is still remaining in his favour. All previous things on actions of debt on an award must be shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"190\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-10\">Suppose this was an action of covenant that <em>Dorsey </em>would pay to <em>Whetcroft </em>whatever sum should be awarded by arbitrators, according to act of assembly, would it not be necessary to set forth the act, and the whole case ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"191\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-11\">Whoever comes into court to get a judgment on an award, must make good his case. The legislature never intended, nor did they mean, that <em>Whetcroft </em>should get a judgment in a summary way, on a worse award than if a suit had been brought, and the cause referred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"192\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-12\"><em>Dorsey's </em>not coming into court and contesting the award, does not amount to a confession, because there is no day given him by the law to appear in court. Suppose <em>Dorsey </em>had appeared and confessed judgment, this would not have altered the case ; it would not make the judgment good. A judgment by default on an award is not' better than a judgment in any other case ; nor is a judgment by confession. There is no more indulgence given to a case on an award than any other case; the cpurt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>would go further to support the award itself, but not the proceedings on it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"193\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZeQ\">If a court is to decide the law and facts, and an appeal .lies from its decision, all the facts necessary should appear on the record. If the facts do not appear, how can the superior court judge of the propriety of the judgr ment below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"194\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-8\">Convictions before magistrates must display the <em>law and facts. </em>By a law of the state, the court are authorized to decide in the case of slavery between master and servant; the whole evidence appears upon the record, that it may appear whether the conclusions from the facts are justified in law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"195\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-9\">When <em>Whetcroft </em>made these suggestions to the court, he might have proved all the other requisites, and there is no reason why his case for so large a sum of money should be in. a better situation than other cases of the like kind. Whatever the common law requires, is stronger than what is required by an act of assembly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"196\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-10\">It is not stated that the award was produced; and whatever was necessary to be produced should appear by the record to have been produced. It has.been said that the clerk of the general court has certified this is a true copy j it is no part of the law that the clerk should copy it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"197\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-11\">The law directs that three arbitrators should be appointed, and yet it does not appear that three were appointed ; more than the law requires might have been appointed. There .is no proof that three only were appointed. The act requires that three arbitrators should act. The true meaning of the law is, that no two arbitrators should act alone. Upon viewing the <em>third </em>and <em>fifth </em>sections of the act together, it clearly appears that the meaning is, that the three arbitrators should all act, but that any two of them might give an award; that no two of them could do any act without all three being present.</p>\n<p data-order=\"198\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>It is admitted by the counsel for the appellee, that it \u2022does not appear that there was <em>notice in writing </em>given, or the <em>time when. </em>They say we ought to have suggested on the motion that notice in writing had not been given, and that they might have proved then that the notice had been given. I doubt whether such proof would have been proper ? but neither the one or the other hath been done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"199\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-3\">It must be stated what the party had done, so that the superior court might decide whether it was according to law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"200\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-4\">There can be no presumption that the governor appointed three arbitrators, or that the arbitrators gave notice <em>in writing </em>of the time when and where they were to meet. The court acted under powers specially delegated to them, and nothing is to be presumed which does not appear so as to aid their judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"201\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-5\">It has been objected, that we cannot show for error any thing which we might have pleaded. The law does not allow us to plead any thing which we have suggested as error. How could we, then, take advantage of it, except in the manner we now do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"202\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-6\">Every defect which is good to arrest a judgment on motion, may be taken advantage of on writ of error? and what you cannot take advantage of, except by pleading, are matters <em>dehors </em>the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"203\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-7\">There is nothing in the act which says that this judg= m ent is binding if <em>Edward Dorsey </em>does appear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"204\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-8\">On a judgment by default, the defendant is not deprived of showing that the judgment is defective. If the plaintiff has not shown affirmatively every thing necessary on his part, it is not cured by <em>default </em>of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-9\">In every case where the court is constituted judge and, jury, the evidence must be produced and appear on record, to show that the court were right in their judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"206\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4Q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>This judgment cannot be supported by common law Pr'mcip^es\u2019 it must be supported by a particular act of the legislature, and as the act under which the proceedings were had is a <em>private </em>act, the authority delegated by it must be strictly pursued, and the appellee must show he did all those acts which were requisite to obtain the <em>judgment; </em>and having, as I trust, failed to do so, the judgment must be reversed. In reversing the judgment, there can be no injury -to Whetcroft, if he has a good case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"207\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Aaxl\">The court of appeals <em>reversed </em>the judgment of the general court. The reaso\u00f3 given was, that the act of the legislature, being a private law, ought to have constituted a part of the record.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
