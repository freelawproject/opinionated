The plaintiff, Dairylea Cooperative, Inc. (Dairylea) is a farming cooperative in the business of manufacturing and selling commodities commercially and to the Government. In response to announcement LD-Da-3 of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), \u201cPurchase of Dairy Products,\u201d plaintiff offered to sell to the CCC some 214,151 pounds of grade AA butter in freezer space at the Hygeia warehouse in Elmira, New York, on June 16, 1972. The offer stated that warehouse charges on the butter were paid through June 20, 1972. The contracting officer of the Minneapolis Commodity Office, by night letter dated June 19, 1972, accepted plaintiff\u2019s offer as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANC\">SUBJECT TERMS ANNOUNCEMENT LD-DA-3 CCC ACCEPTS YOUR BUTTER OFFER OF JUNE 16 1972 FOR 214,151 POUNDS AT 68.332 CENTS PER POUND. CONTRACT MP (FF) 51465.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-19\">On June 21, 1972, copies one and two of the Notice to Deliver, Form MP-269, along with Form MP-277, Notice to Deliver and Transmittal and Instructions, were mailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>to the plaintiff. Dairylea received this material at its offices in Syracuse, New York, two days later. Form MP \u2014 277 provided that for the transfer of title in-store, the vendor should \u201cadvise warehouseman of the total number of units and the applicable ex-lots for each grading certificate.\u201d The CCC also mailed on June 21, 1972, copies five, six, seven, and eight of Form MP-269A, Forwarding Notices, to the Hygeia warehouse in Elmira, New York. At the bottom of these copies of the form was a nonnegotiable warehouse or consignee receipt. The butter was contaminated by flood waters from Hurricane Agnes on June 23, 1972, before the warehouse ever received its copies of the Forwarding Notices. Hygeia did not receive this material until June 27 or 28, 1972. The butter was condemned by New York authorities and was destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The transfer of title to CCC was not executed, and on June 30,1972, a representative of CCC visited the warehouse and instructed the warehouseman not to execute the transfer of title. Thereafter, CCC terminated the contract for failure to deliver the butter in accordance with the provisions of announcement LD-Da-3. Plaintiff appealed CCC\u2019s failure to pay for the butter to the contracting officer on August 21, 1972. The contracting officer concluded in his decision that CCC was not liable for the contract price of the butter because it was never delivered to CCC under the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The plaintiff filed an appeal from the decision of the contracting officer with the Board of Contract Appeals of the Department of Agriculture (Board) by letter dated September 6,1972, pursuant to the disputes clause of the Uniform Contractual Provisions (ASCS-101 Article 25), which was a part of the contract. A hearing was held before the Board on October 23, 1973, in which both parties participated and were represented by counsel. The Board\u2019s decision of August 16, 1974, denied Dairylea\u2019s appeal and claim for the contract price on the ground that the risk of loss had not passed to the CCC prior to June 23, 1972, the date on which the butter was contaminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The plaintiff filed suit in this court on December 16, 1974, alleging that the Board had improperly construed the provisions of the contract, especially the provisions pertaining to delivery and shifting of risk of loss. The plaintiff alleges further that the decision of the Board involves only a question of law involving the interpretation of the contract, and, therefore, is not entitled to finality under Section 2 of the Wunderlich Act (41 U.S.C. \u00a7 322 (1970)). The plaintiff seeks recovery of the contract price of $146,333.67 solely under Section 2 of that Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">The case is before us on cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">The issue here presented is simply when did risk of loss pass, if at all. The contract provisions involved are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACq\">\n<em>Announcement LD-Da-3</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-11\">sk \u00a1k * sfs H! sk</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-12\">II.

Storage Charges For product delivered to CCC in a CCC-approved warehouse, (which in the case of butter must be in freezer space), Seller shall pay directly to the warehouseman all storage charges through the date of delivery to CCC, including in-and-out handling charges. Prepaid storage remaining on any lot at the time of delivery shall accrue to the benefit of CCC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-17\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-18\">As shown above, Section XII C. of Announcement LD-Da-3 provides that the date of delivery shall be on one of three dates \u2014 date of shipment by carrier; date of issuance of a warehouse receipt acceptable to CCC; or date of acknowledgment of receipt of the product by CCC, \u201cwhichever is applicable.\u201d The same section provides further that \u201ctitle to the product and risk of loss shall pass to CCC upon delivery.\u201d This provision of the contract between the parties is clear and unambiguous. Title was to be transferred in-store, so the issuance of the warehouse receipt was the applicable event for establishing the date of delivery. Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s contention, the issuance of the receipt was more than a mere \u201cministerial\u201d act. Obviously, the date of delivery could not be the date of shipment by carrier, for CCC was to take title in-store. Neither was the date of acknowledgment of the receipt of the product applicable, for no shipment was involved. Therefore, it must follow that the date of issuance of the warehouse receipt was to be the date of delivery. In very clear and precise terms, the parties agreed how the delivery date would be set and when risk of loss should pass to the buyer. We conclude that since the warehouse receipt was never issued, the risk of loss did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>not pass to CCC, but remained with Dairy-lea.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The contract was not ambiguous. The date of delivery was plainly fixed, as noted above. Delivery would occur only when Hygeia executed an acceptable warehouse receipt. Plaintiff claims that Sections II A.5.c. and XII A.2.b. of the contract equate delivery with the date through which storage charges were paid by Dairylea, namely June 20, 1972. These contract provisions have separate and distinct functions, other than date of delivery. Section XII A.2.b. was intended to give the CCC the option to decide, within seven days after acceptance of the plaintiff\u2019s offer, whether to take delivery in-store or to have the butter shipped elsewhere. The decision was to be made known to Dairylea and Hygeia by a Notice of Delivery sent to both of them by CCC. The section says nothing about how the date of delivery would be fixed, but only that the seller was required to pay storage charges through the delivery date, if delivery was to be taken in-store.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Section II A.5.c. was included for the purpose of enabling CCC to get the benefit of any prepaid storage charges paid by the seller. In the event that delivery took place before the date through which charges have been paid by the seller, CCC would receive a period of \u201cfree\u201d storage. The date the warehouse receipt was executed would mark the beginning of CCC\u2019s liability for storage charges, assuming that prepaid storage charges did not go beyond that date. For example, if there had been no flood in Elmira on June 23 and Hygeia had executed the warehouse receipt on that date, it would have expected CCC to pay storage charges beginning June 23. Since Dairylea had paid for storage only until June 20, Hygeia could have recovered three days storage charges from Dairylea. These arrangements indicating how storage charges were to be paid do not render section XII C. as to date of delivery ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Next, plaintiff contends that CCC had full control over the butter prior to the execution of the warehouse receipts, and that therefore section XII C. is rendered meaningless. We do not agree. In addition to the provisions of the contract and other facts, the testimony of Mr. Bullard, Manager of Dairylea, before the Board is significant. When asked if the butter was under Dairylea\u2019s control while it was in the warehouse, he answered unequivocally \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">The interpretation of the contract by the Board was correct. While we sympathize with Dairylea on having to bear the substantial loss of the butter due to an act of God (the storm), we see no legal way to shift the loss to the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">We hold that the butter was never delivered to the CCC by the execution of a warehouse receipt by Hygeia as required by the contract, and by reason thereof the risk of loss remained with Dairylea, the owner of the butter, and, consequently, Dairylea must bear the loss and is not entitled to recover the contract price of the butter from the Government in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied, defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment is granted, and plaintiff\u2019s petition is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
