He was sentenced to 25 years on October 30, 1967. Appellant states that under his plea bargain, the court dismissed a kidnapping count, based on his taking of a hostage. Appellant complains because the Parole Board has classified his offense as of \u201cgreatest\u201d severity. He contends this is error because he was convicted only of attempted armed robbery, rated \u201cvery high\u201d severity, and the kidnapping charge was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-16\">As the district court\u2019s order well demonstrates, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.20 (1975) authorizes the Board to modify an offense rating if there were mitigating or aggravating circumstances. Obviously there were aggravating circumstances in appellant\u2019s case. It seems clear that the Parole Board has followed its own guidelines and has not acted arbitrarily in appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-17\">In his <em>pro se </em>brief, appellant contends that he could not legally have received more than 20 years on the attempted bank robbery using a dangerous weapon. The judgment shows that a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(d) was charged, for which the maximum punishment is 25 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-18\">The other assertions in appellant\u2019s brief did not result in the Board\u2019s decision to postpone consideration of appellant for parole. Appellant\u2019s \u201chistory of violent conduct\u201d would remain whether or not the murder conviction was set aside on \u201cspeedy trial\u201d grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
