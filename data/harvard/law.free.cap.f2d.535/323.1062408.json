Wendling was questioned before the Grand Jury regarding a conversation he held with an informant equipped with a wireless transmitter in a New Orleans lounge. His perjury conviction was based on answers that were contrary to his statements made during the transmitted conversation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">We find no merit in Wendling\u2019s first three points of error regarding (i) denial of the motion to suppress the tape recorded conversation, (ii) admission of testimony by a witness regarding payments to Wendling, allegedly as bribes, and (iii) repetition by the District Judge of part of the jury instructions, on request by the jury during its deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">We also find no merit to Wendling\u2019s challenge to the <em>Miranda </em>warnings he was given before his grand jury appearance. He claims that (i) he had a right to be informed that if he could not afford an attorney one would be appointed \u201cfree of charge\u201d and (ii) that the very nature of grand jury questioning of a putative defendant violates due process even when full <em>Miranda </em>warnings are given.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">At the time of Wendling\u2019s grand jury appearance, January 7, 1975, Fifth Circuit law required that any virtual or putative defendant be given full <em>Miranda </em>warnings before his grand jury testimony. <em>United States v. Mandujano, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 496 F.2d 1050, 1055. This requirement was fully met.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Recently the Supreme Court has reversed this Court and held that a grand jury witness, even when he is a putative defendant, has a right only to claim his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. <em>United States v. Mandujano, </em>1976,- U.S. -, 96 S.Ct. 1768, 48 L.Ed.2d 212 [1976, 44 U.S.L.W. 4629, 4632].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, any claim regarding the sufficiency of <em>Miranda </em>warnings at a grand jury hearing must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"A3q\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-11\">.
