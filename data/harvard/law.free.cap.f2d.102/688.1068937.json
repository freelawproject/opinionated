It is not a final order and is therefore not appealable. Jurisdiction of the district court rests upon sections 23b and 60b of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 46(b) and 96(b). Prior to the 1938 amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, this court had held that such suits were not \u201ccontroversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings\u201d within the meaning of section 24a, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 47(a), relating to appellate jurisdiction. Lowenstein v. Reikes, 2 Cir., 54 F.2d 481, 482, certiorari denied 285 U.S. 539, 52 S.Ct. 311, 76 L.Ed. 932; accord, Exchange Nat. Bank v. Meikle, 9 Cir., 61 F. 2d 176. We find nothing in those amendments to make section 24a applicable to plenary suits, if it was not so before; indeed, the interlocutory orders mentioned in that section seem to be confined to those entered in \u201cproceedings in bankruptcy.\u201d Since our appellate jurisdiction in plenary suits in the district court is derived from section 128 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 225 (Lowenstein v. Reikes,-supra), it is limited to a review of final decisions, except as otherwise therein specified. The order now before us is not within the exceptions. Consequently the appellee\u2019s oral motion to dismiss the appeal must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-14\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
