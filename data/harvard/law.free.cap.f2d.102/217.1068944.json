An artificial pork sausage casing comprising relatively thin cellulose acetate walls of cylindrical shape, prepared from sheeting and having an overlapped fused joint.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\u201c3. A pork sausage package comprising a cellulose acetate casing prepared from sheet cellulose acetate having the edges fused with a solvent forming a substantially cylindrical package tied at the ends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Four patents were cited as references, viz.:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Faber, 1,659,399, February 14, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">British patent, 292,582, April 11, 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">German patent, No. 480,422, August 1, 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">Walsh, 1,950,954, March 13,1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">As appears from the claims appellant\u2019s casing is prepared from thin cellulose acetate sheeting formed into cylindrical shape with overlapped edges, the edges being fused with a solvent'. Claim 3 embraces also a feature of tied ends, but the brief for appellant concedes that this feature is shown by the German patent and states that \u201cIt is not urged that this feature is sufficient to confer patentability on the claim.\u201d \u25a0 It is urged, however, that the claim is patentable by reason of its other limitations, although in oral argument counsel for appellant went so far .as to concede that' if claim 2 be hot patentable then claim 3 is not. However, he in-' sisted that the converse of this is not true and that claim 3 might be found npn-pat-entable and claim 2 at the same time allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">The examiner referred to the British patent as the basic reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">This patent, which contains both product and method claims, has no drawing, but discloses a casing made of \u201ccellulose regenerated from its solutions; viscose, cupro-ammoniacal solution, denitrated nitro-cellu-lose, etc.\u201d The casing is declared to be .valuable because it permits moist substances such as sausages, jam, honey, etc., to be preserved; also it is said that the casing allows the \u201csmoking, curing, cooking, ster-1-izing etc.\u201d of its contents. It is taught that in the process of manufacture the cellulose sheet \u201cis wrapped round a mandrel of suitable diameter in such a manner that the two parallel edges of the sheet overlap slightly, the'Said two edges are then united together not by a mere gluing but by positive auto--genous welding, that is to say the two edges of the sheet are so dissolved by means of a suitable solvent as to pentrate one another and make a jointless union, this feature being the characteristic feature of the invention whereby the. casing obtained is suitable for containing moist substances without possibility of opening- along the joint.\u201d It is said further in the specification that any suitable solvent, may be used for-the auto-genous welding, concentrated chloride of zinc being given as an example.</p>\n<p id=\"AyK\">It appears that the' material used by ap- \u25a0 pell'ant (cellulose acetate) is different from the material (regenerated cellulose) used in the patent, but it was the view of the examiner that no invention was involved in appellant\u2019s substitution of material, \u201cpartic- - ularly in view of the secondary art,\u201d as shown in the patents to Faber and Walsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-18\">In the decision of the board the principal emphasis seems to be placed upon the Walsh and Faber patents-. It contains no specific expression of opinion upon the question of substitution of materials. Its decision says:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-19\">\u201c * * * Faber states that viscose may be used instead of a solution of acetyl cellulose in making seamless containers. Faber does not, however, state that cellulose is; equivalent for cellulose acetate as a con-' tainer material for moist articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-20\">\u201cWalsh is concerned with a cementing' agent for cellulose plastics particularly cellulose acetate and for this purpose Walsh uses a mixture of solvents for the plastic, the ingredients of the mixture having different boiling points. Walsh states that his solvent mixture may be used with viscose products. The teaching of the Faber patent is to make an air-tight cellulose acetate receptacle of- sections overlapped and united at the seam by cement. - Walsh 'teaches the use of specific solvent mixtures to be used\u2019 with cellulose acetate plastics.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-21\">\u25a0 \u201cIt is our opinion that the.method of preparing the package from sheeting is independent of the package itself, to which the claims are directed, and we believe that the Faber patent itself discloses the receptacle of claim 2 with an overlapped fused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>joint * * *. The word, \u2018fused\u2019, as used in the claims, is defined at the end of page 3 of applicant\u2019s specification as the same effect as that described by Walsh and we are of the opinion that claim 2 is devoid of invention over Faber in view of Walsh as it is obvious to use the solvent described by Walsh in cementing the overlapping edges described by Faber.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">\u201cAs to claim 3, we see no invention in tying the package at the ends and this feature is shown in the German patent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Before us the purport of the argument by counsel for appellant is that the British patent.makes no suggestion of the possibility of employing cellulose acetate in the manufacture of sausage casings which, the brief states, was a material well known pri- or to the date of that patent; that the Fa-ber patent makes no suggestion of a fused joint within the meaning of the term as used in appellant\u2019s \u00e1pplication; that it never occurred to Faber that the joints could be fused; that the patent to Walsh is not concerned with end products of a casing; that while cellulose acetate and regenerated cellulose produced \u2022 from viscose may be equivalents for the purposes of Faber or of Walsh it does not follow that they would be equivalents for the purposes of the British patent; that appellant discloses a sausage casing entirely unlike any sausage casing previously used in the art thereby making a specific and valuable contribution to an already crowded art and that the decision of the board rests \u201con broader grounds than is warranted by the breadth of the claims involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Respectful consideration has been given the quite interesting presentation made by counsel who, particularly in his oral argument, entered at some length into the philosophy of certain phases of the patent law, but, in view of the state of the art as depicted in the references, we are unable to accredit appellant with an invention. Fa-ber\u2019s patent impresses us as being quite broad. The drawings as described in the specification appear to be limited to cigar-protecting devices, with molds for making same, and a preferred form of container for \u201cgranular or pulverized articles,\u201d but the specification as a whole seems clearly broad enough to embrace articles precisely similar in material and design (except for the tied ends) to the casing of appellant. It may be conceded that Faber does not specifically teach the making of a fused joint or seam of the same type as that of appellant, but so far as the seam <em>or structure </em>is concerned it is shown .by the British patent, and the Walsh patent makes it clear that fusing by use of a solvent may be applied to the material used by appellant as well as to the material used in the British patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
