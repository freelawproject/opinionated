Some of the particles are small enough to pass through a No. 325 United States Bureau of Standards\u2019 sieve, and others are too large to pass through a No. 200 sieve.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-31\">It is stated in appellant\u2019s application that a household cleaner composed of particles of limestone or other soft mineral sufficiently small to pass through a No. 325 sieve, due to the fineness of the particles, is not effective in removing dirt and grease, and that, by the addition of particles of such soft minerals which are too large to pass through a No. 325 sieve, the abrasive characteristics of the cleaner are enhanced sufficiently to make it operate efficiently for its intended purpose without any appreciable abrasion or scratching of the articles on which it is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-32\">It appears from the record that appellant\u2019s mixture is free-flowing when dry, but is capable of becoming plastic when wet, and that it is the quality of plasticity which enables the larger particles in the mixture to serve as a mechanical scraper in the scouring operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-33\">The action of such cleaning preparation is purely physical and mechanical, and dirt and grease are removed by scour<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>ing. When used, the \u201ccleaner is moistened with water, for instance, by application of a wet cloth, and rubbed on the surface to <em>be </em>cleaned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"agb-dedup-0\">The limestone referred to in appellant\u2019s application is \u201cessentially of calcium carbonate\", whether in the form of calcite or in the form of aragonite.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"ady-dedup-0\">Appellant\u2019s preferred proportions of limestone particles are stated in his application to be \u201cless than one per cent large enough to be retained on the No. 100 sieve, about 10 per cent passing the No. 100 sieve and retained on the No. 200 sieve, and about 10 per cent passing t\u00edre No. 200 sieve and retamed on the No sieve, a e re <em>a.\\mng ^ </em>, par \u00edc es passing e o. 1\u00aeve&lt;</p>\n<p id=\"AL0\">^ Appellant further states m his application that</p>\n<p id=\"aoi-dedup-0\">\u201cAlthough the calcite of limestones has a hardness of about 3, aragonite has a hardness of about 3.5 to 4 and is found in small proportions in most sedimentary organic limestones, the proportion increasing in the younger rocks. Small proportions of volcanic dust, quartz and other mineral impurities occur in'.some lime-stones. Likewise different forms of lime-stones and stones from the same quarry and even parts of the same stone commonly have particles of different degrees of friability. I have found that under pressure of rubbing, as in the cleaning operation, a considerable number of the calcite particles meeting substantial resistance <em>will break up along cleavage planes and thus danger of scratching the ware is </em>fur-<em>then reduced. </em>With such a mixture, the soft and more friable particles are sufficient to deal with loose and soft dirt that yields to short rubbing, while the harder and less friable particles are brought into play to deal with the harder and more obstinate dirt. Where the hardness or softness of minerals or mineral particles is mentioned herein, either by a numerical designation or otherwise, I have reference to the hardness of such minerals as established in Mohs scale.</p>\n<p id=\"abs-dedup-0\">******</p>\n<p id=\"a2k-dedup-0\">\u201cI have found that <em>many other </em>miner<em>als, </em>which are <em>essentially calcium salts, and also other minerals softer than about 4.5 </em>and substantially insoluble in water have in varying degree characteristics, in common with the preferred limestone, and while I have hereinbefore described the insoluble mineral matter of my composition as being limestone, <em>it is feasible to substitute therefore other calcium salts softer than about 4.5 or other relatively soft suitable mineral substantially insoln-ble in water. </em>It is noted that limestone, fluorspar and all other materials mentioned herein are harder than 2.5.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"AXG_\">It is further stated in appellant\u2019s application that particles of soft minerals, such as limestone, too large to pass through a No. 325 sieve may be mixed with \u201cfinely ground harder material of a kind commonly used, such as pumice, volcanic dust, feldspar and quartz.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AziZ\">Qne group q\u00a3 ^ appealed daims is directed to the hereinbefore described cleaning preparations, the action of which js pUrejy physical and mechanical. Of that group, claims 6, 7, and 10 are sufficiently illustrative. They read:</p>\n<p id=\"A_L\"><em>, , </em>, * \u201eA . cleanlf .

Of those preparations, appellant\u2019s preferred composition is stated to' be \u201cabout eighty-nine per cent by weight of particles of sedimentary limestone of organic origin and meeting the specifications as to relative proportions of various sizes hereinbefore set forth as the preferred mixture of mineral particles, to which are added about two or three per cent by weight of small particles of soap, together with about nine per cent by weight of particles of sodium salts easily soluble m water and having appreciable detergent value, of wtach salts about one or two per cent by weight consists of metasilicate of sodium.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AKj\">The second group of the appealed claims is directed to those cleaning preparations, the action of which is chemical as well as physical and mechanical. Claims 22, 46, and 47 are sufficiently illustrative of that group. They read:</p>\n<p id=\"AcdO\">\u201c22. A cleaning preparation whose principal ingredient consists of particles of minerals substantially insoluble in water but readily soluble in cold dilute hydro<em>chloric </em>acid, softer than 4.5 and adapted to become plastic when wet, from five per cent to thrrty-five per cent by weight of said particles being too large to pass a No. 200 U.

A cleaning composition consisting of about eighty-nine per cent by weight of particles of sedimentary limestone of organic origin, about two or three per cent by weight of small particles of soap, and about nine per cent by weight of particles of sodium salts easily soluble in water and having appreciable detergent value, of which salts about one to two per cent by weight consists of metasilicate of sodium, less than one per cent of the limestone particles being large enough to be retained on a No. 100 sieve, about ten per cent passing the No. 100 sieve and retained on the No. 200 sieve, about ten per cent passing the No. 200 sieve and retained on the No. 325 sieve, and the remaining limestone particles passing the No. 325 sieve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A_0A\">The references cited are: Stone (Br.), 18;782) Nov. 16, 1889; Scales, 1,728,082, Sept 10 1929; Reinle, 1,770,429, July 15, 1930. Huyzer (Br.), 335,005, Sept. 18, 1930; Gangloff, 1,870,311, Aug. 9, 1932; Scott, 1,879,953, Sept. 27, 1932; Gray, 1,-881,506, Oct. 11, 1932.</p>\n<p id=\"AG6\">The British patent to Stone relates to improvements in the manufacture of soaps and cieansing compositions. \u2018 The compositions are made of slate, marble, marble drippings, \u201cor any rock, or other mineral substances\u201d in an \u201cimmature state, prior to their development into harder substances.\u201d It appears from the patent that the <em>minerals were ground to a fine powder </em>and mixed with tallow, soap, oils or other greasy substances, and the mixture formed into bars or tablets. It is stated in the patent that the minerals should be \u201cground to a fine powder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6AG\">The patent to Scales relates to a process 0f making a washing liquid (the liquid to be used in conjunction with washing soaps for the cleansing of fabrics). The patentee discloses the use of commercial sodium carbonate and <em>finely pulverized </em>limestone, <em>mixed with water. </em>The mixture is stirred thoroughly and heated to a boiling temperature. The solution is then cooled, and a weak solution of calcium chloride is added thereto. After the mixture thus formed is thoroughly stirred, the excess calcium carbonate is permitted to settle to the bottom of the container. The liquid is then drawn off and is ready for use.</p>\n<p id=\"Agu\">The patent t0 Reinie relates to a scour-jng- soap powder for use in cleaning metal ware or removing stains from the skin. The patentee discloses a mixture consisting of vegetable oil, sodium hydroxide, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>bicarbonate and carbonate of soda, a liquid alkaline solution, and a cementing mate\u25a0rial, such as volcanic ash. The mixture is first made into a solution, then dried, cut into bars, and ground into a fine powder,</p>\n<p id=\"ahh-dedup-1\">The British patent to Huyzer relates to cleansing and polishing compositions for scouring and polishing metal. The pat-entee states that prior to his invention, the base of metal polishes was composed of finely divided silica; that the silica was dangerous to the health of the user; and that the object of his invention was to overcome such danger by providing a polish with a new base. He discloses the use of natural magnesite, containing only small quantities of silica. He expressly states, however, that it is essential that the magnesite be <em>\u201cground uniformly </em>to a <em>sufficient degree of </em>fineness\u201d (italics ours); that it is essential that the mag-nesite be hard and crystaline in character; that it should be thoroughly ground into such a fine state that it would pass through a No. 250 sieve; that his powder might be used alone or with other cleaning powders; and that it could be applied by means of a damp cloth. The patentee also discloses a preparation in the form of a cream, which is composed of his powder and other ingredients.</p>\n<p id=\"avr-dedup-2\">The patent to Gangloff relates to a cleanser for aluminum. The patentee states that his cleanser \u201cconsists of a combination of substances that when moistened will produce ammonia in a nascent form and will have an abrasive action that will remove the foreign substances that are not dissolved by the ammonia, without scratching the metal. He discloses a mixture of sesqui-carbonate of soda, trisodium phosphate, and ammonium chloride,\u201d which, he states, \u201cproduces a desirable rate of evolution of nascent ammonia from a <em>paste </em>of colloidal damp mix.\u201d (Italics ours.) The patentee further states that a colloidal silica mixed with powdered pumice \u201cif worked out to a consistent uniformity, produces an abrasive that is effective and unobjectionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"amr-dedup-0\">The patent to Scott relates to a cleansing composition <em>in ^ the form of powder, </em>The composition is composed of^ trisodium phosphate, sodium metasilicate, \u201csoap, preferably a sodium soap,\u201d and \u201csoda ash\u201d in various proportions.</p>\n<p id=\"AWT\">The patent to Gray relates to a detergent. The patentee\u2019s detergent is composed of a mixture of a non-fatty emulsifying cleansing compound and an abrasive ingredient, such as soapstone and volcanic ash. The patentee states that when volcanic ash is the \u201conly abrasive ingredient of a non-fatty emulsifying detergent mixture, whose use necessitates the addition of a very large proportion of water, it set-ties very quickly to the bottom of the container in which the detergent is mixed with water and cakes there, and tends to cling to the surface of the article to be cleaned (marble, tile, terazzo, concrete) thus making it difficult to remove such volcanic ash from the container and from the article to be cleaned and also reducing the initial proportion of the abrasive to the chemical constituent\u201d; that finely ground soapstone added to the detergent mixture prevents, to a considerable extent, the close adhesion between the volcanic ash and the article being cleaned; that the soapstone reduces the severity of the abrasive action of the volcanic ash, and aids in emulsifying the grease on the articles being cleaned; and that the degree of fineness of the volcanic ash depends upon the use to which the detergent is to be put. He further states that the finer the volcanic ash, the \u201cless harsh its abrasive action,\u201d and the \u201cfiner the soapstone particles the more effective is their action in preventing compacting of the volcanic ash. I prefer to use both soapstone and ash of a degree of fineness which will permit passa\u00a3e through a 200 mesh screen,</p>\n<p id=\"a_x-dedup-0\">All of the appealed claims were rejected by the tribunals of the Patent Office <em>on the </em>references of record,</p>\n<p id=\"Ar7\">In his decision, the Primary Examiner s\u00a1-ated that the appealed claims were rejected as unpatentable over the patents to Huyzer, Gray, or Gangloff. We quote from his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"A_Ve\">\u201eTT , . , . , ,. ., , \u2018Huyzer shows the use of finely divided mineral particles (magnesite) of the \u00b0\"der of 2S\u00b0 mesb fof leaning purposes, Magnesite has a hardness of 3.5 to 4.5. The Powdef d material of the reference may be made PIaf,c wlth and may contain other well known cleaning agents such as soap. To substitute limestone for mineral matter shown by Huyzer or vary the size of the particles shown therein would not involve invention. The patents t0 Scales and Stone (British patent 18782 0f 1888) show the well known use of pulverized limestone or marble for cleaning purposes. Furthermore it would not involve invention to add sodium sili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>cate, tri-sodium phosphate or sodium carbonate to the composition of Huyzer in view of the well known use of such ingredients in detergent compositions as shown by Scott, Gangloff, Reinle or Gray cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u201cGray shows it is old to use a mixture of finely divided mineral matter, soda ash (sodium carbonate) and trisodium phosphate in a cleaning composition. Gang-loff shows a similar composition. The substitution of powdered limestone for the mineral matter in the compositions of the references would not involve invention in view of the well known use thereof in detergent compositions as shown by Scales or Stone cited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The examiner also rejected all of the appealed claims on the ground of undue multiplicity. Claims 30, 31, 34, 35, and 40 were rejected on the additional ground of new matter. Claim 45 was rejected on the ground of aggregation, the examiner holding that a \u201cmere mixture of limestone and another abrasive material of the groups specified would be aggregative in character,\u201d and that each \u201cingredient would perform its well known function in the composition.\u201d Claims 10, 11, 15 to 20, inclusive, 22, 24, 27 to 35, inclusive, and 38 to 42, inclusive, were also rejected on the ground of indefiniteness, and on the further ground that they were broader than appellant\u2019s disclosure. Relative to the latter ground of rejection, the examiner said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">\u201cApplicant has merely disclosed minerals of the group consisting of calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, calcium fluoride, calcium borate and magnesium carbonate as suitable substances. The broad terminology in the claims would include numerous substances not contemplated by applicant and which are beyond the scope of the alleged invention. For example, barite, glauberite, hessite, langite, talc, valentinite, wulfenite and zaratite. The decision in Metals Recovery Co. v. Anaconda Copper Mining Co., 9 Cir., 31 F.2d 100 is deemed applicable in the instant case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Claims 10, 16, 18, 24, 27, 28, 29, 38, and 42 were rejected by the examiner on the additional ground of new matter \u201cin the range of hardness specified. The original disclosure shows the mineral to be softer than 4.5 and does not set forth any lower limit. The range of hardness now specified is deemed a departure from the original disclosure.\u201d Claims 43 and 44 were rejected on the ground that they were vague and indefinite.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">The Board of Appeals confined its decision to the issue of the patentability of the appealed claims in view of the prior art, and did not discuss the other grounds of rejection applied by the Primary Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">In its decision, the board stated that, although the references did not disclose the particular \u201csize ranges of abrasive material\u201d disclosed by appellant, it was of opinion that the selection of such size ranges was a mere matter of judgment and did not involve invention; that the \u201creferences\u201d which disclose \u201cpowdered material must necessarily use this material in varying sizes, though the upper limit of the sizes used may possibly be lower than in appellant\u2019s case. However, we think it obvious, where a more active abrasive action is desired, to incorporate more of the larger-sized particles\u201d; that the materials employed by appellant were all old- in the art and had been used in somewhat similar compositions, and that, therefore, the appealed claims \u201cinvolve a mere aggregation of known ingredients without any new or unexpected result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">The Board of Appeals did not reverse the Primary Examiner\u2019s decision as to any of the grounds of rejection applied by him. Accordingly, the decision of the board is in legal effect an affirmance of the Primary Examiner on all of the grounds of rejection, and those grounds are before us for consideration. In re Wagenhorst, 64 F.2d 780, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 991; In re Ball, 81 F.2d 242, 23 C.C.P.A., Patents, 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">We will first consider the issue of undue multiplicity of claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">It is true, as stated by the examiner, that appellant\u2019s alleged invention is simple, and that certain of the claims are somewhat confusing. We are of opinion, however, that such confusion as exists in the case results not from the number of claims presented, but rather from the indefiniteness of many, of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">As hereinbefore noted, claims 10, 11, 15 to 20, inclusive, 22, 24, 27 to 35, inclusive, and 38 to 42, inclusive, were rejected by the Primary Examiner as being too indefinite, and on the further ground that they were broader than appellant\u2019s dis-' closure. Claim 10, which, for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>of the issue now under consideration, is sufficiently illustrative of claims 11, 15, 16, 18, 22, 24, 27, 28, 29, 32, 38, 39, and 42, covers any mineral harder than 2.5 and softer than 3.5 which is plastic when wet and substantially insoluble in water. Claims 17 and 19 cover any mineral matter substantially insoluble in water, the particles of which have different crystalline cleavage properties. Claims 20, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, and 40 cover any mineral matter substantially insoluble in water.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Counsel for appellant has cited and quoted from several decisions of the Supreme Court, wherein the question of indefiniteness of patent claims was considered. However, we find nothing either in the record or in the brief of counsel for appellant from which it may be determined that claims 10, 11, 15 to 20, inclusive, 22, 24, 27 to' 35, inclusive, and 38 to 42, inclusive, rejected as being broader than appellant\u2019s disclosure, do not cover many minerals, which, as stated by the Primary Examiner, are not disclosed in appellant\u2019s application. We are unable to hold, therefore, that the rejection of those claims on the ground that they were broader than appellant\u2019s disclosure is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Claim 41 was properly rejected on the ground of indefiniteness.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">That claim- merely provides for the mixing \u201cof fine particles of limestone of which a substantial proportion by weight are small enough to pass a No. 325\u201d sieve with other ingredients mentioned in the claim. It does not specify the various sizes of the limestone particles, nor does it, in fact, require that any of them shall be too large to pass through a No. 325 sieve.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Claim 43 was rejected by the Primary Examiner on the ground that it was vague and indefinite. It reads: \u201c43. A cleaning preparation comprising a mixture of small particles of mineral, said mixture comprising sufficient particles of colloidal and near-colloidal size to render the mixture plastic when wet, said mixture comprising sufficient particles too large to pass through a No. 200 U. S. Bureau of Standards sieve and sufficient in quantity to effectively abrade dirt, and sufficient particles of intermediate sizes to embed the particles too large to pass the No. 200 sieve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">It will be observed that that claim is not limited to any particular mineral or 'minerals. It merely requires that the mineral particles be of colloidal and near-colloidal size, some being too large to pass through a No. 200 sieve and sufficient in quantity to abrade dirt, and others of intermediate sizes sufficient in quantity to embed the <em>larger </em>particles.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Claim 44 is not limited to any particular mineral or minerals, and is substantially the same as claim 43, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">We think claims 43 and 44 are vague and indefinite and were properly rejected on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">Claim 45, which was rejected by the Primary Examiner on the ground of aggregation, reads: \u201c45. A cleaning composition comprising particles of various sizes of limestone and particles of a silicon compound of the group consisting of pumice, volcanic ash, feldspar and quartz, the finer particles of limestone constituting upwards of ten per cent by weight of the composition and the larger silicon-containing particles being loosely embedded in particles smaller than themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">There is nothing in the claim to indicate the size of particles of any of the ingredients mentioned therein. They may be of various sizes, but the finer particles of limestone should constitute approximately \u201cten per cent, by weight of the composition,\u201d the silicon-containing particles should be \u201cloosely embedded in particles smaller than themselves,\u201d and all of the other particles of which the preparation is composed may be nearly as fine as the finer particles of limestone. There is&gt; nothing in appellant\u2019s application to suggest that such a combination of mineral particles would produce any unexpected result, or that each ingredient would do more than perform its well-known function in the composition.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">We think that claim 45 was properly rejected on the ground of aggregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-15\">The only claims remaining for our consideration are Nos. 6, 7, 46, and 47, and the sole remaining issue with regard to those claims is whether they are unpatentable in view of the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-16\">Claims 6 and 7 are limited to limestone particles of definite proportions and sizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-17\">Claims 46 and 47 call for limestone particles of definite proportions and sizes in combination with other named ingredients, detergent in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-18\">It is true, as held by the tribunals of the Patent Office, that the prior art refer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>enees disclose the use of various minerals, including limestone, in cleaning preparations. However, we find nothing in any of the references either disclosing or suggesting the compositions defined in appealed claims 6, 7, 46, and 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The patentee Huyzer states that the magnesite used in his cleaning preparation must be ground to a <em>uniform degree of fineness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The patentee Gangloff discloses the use of colloidal silica mixed with powdered pumice, and teaches that the mixture must be \u201cworked out to a consistent uniformity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The patentee Gray states that the minerals used as abrasive ingredients in his detergent preparation should be ground to a \u201cdegree of fineness which will permit passage through a 200 mesh screen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">It is possible, of course, that in grinding the minerals disclosed in the patent to Gray to a degree of fineness that will permit them to pass through a 200 mesh screen the particles will vary some in size. The patentee, however, emphasizes the importance of using only fine particles of the minerals disclosed by him. He does not suggest that those particles should vary in size. Nor do we find any suggestion in any of the prior art references that the particles of minerals used as abrasives in cleaning preparations should vary in size. On the contrary, so far as there is any reference in the prior art to the size of mineral particles, uniformity is emphasized as being important if not essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Appellant\u2019s preparations are novel. They \u201coperate efficiently in removing dirt and grease without appreciable abrasion\u201d of the articles on which they are used, and are, therefore, useful.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">Appellant\u2019s invention lies not in the discovery of new minerals for use in cleaning preparations, nor in the discovery of new properties in the minerals disclosed by him, but rather in the discovery that a free-flowing preparation, composed of various sizes and proportions of mineral particles, such as limestone, would, alone or in combination with detergent ingredients, produce new and unexpected results.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">The Solicitor for the Patent Office has called our attention to our decision in the case of In re Charles Ness, 46 F.2d 375, 377, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 918, wherein we said: \u201cIt is true that the particular sizes \u2014 40 to 90 mesh granules \u2014 claimed by appellant are not specifically disclosed in the prior art, but the very fact that so wide a variance in size is allowed himself by claimant strongly indicates that size is not of the essence of the matter but is a factor likewise merely within the power of determination by those skilled in the art.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">Although it was held in that case that the particular sizes of granules there involved were \u201cnot of the essence of the matter,\u201d we are of opinion that, in the case at bar, the sizes and proportions of the limestone particles are not a mere matter of judgment, but are \u201cof the essence of the matter,\u201d and that appellant\u2019s preparations involve invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Board of Appeals is modified, being reversed as to claims 6, 7, 46, and 47, and in all other respects affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-15\">Modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b479-16\">BLAND, Associate Judge</author>\n<p id=\"a5h-dedup-0\">(dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-17\">I must respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s holding in reversing the decision of the Board of Appeals as to claims 6, 7, 46 and 47. I think the board\u2019s rejection on the ground that the selection of the particle sizes was a matter of judgment and not one of invention was correct. I think the allowed claims define nothing inventive. It is a matter of common knowledge that the size of abrasive particles to be used usually depends on the character of thing to be abraded.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-18\">The decision of the majority holds the rejection on the ground of multiplicity to be erroneous without, in my judgment, assigning sufficient reasons for such a conclusion. The opinion states that the invention is simple and the holdings of the tribunals below emphasize the fact that the subject matter of the application relates to a simple matter, and yet appellant submitted a vast array of claims in an attempt to define his alleged invention. There are 31 claims here on appeal. A complete record of the action of the Patent Office with reference -to the character of any other claims which might have been submitted, rejected and abandoned is not shown. The record does show various amendments made to the claims here on appeal, the last of which is numbered 47. It seems to me that it is fair to say that during the prosecution of the case there were at least 47 claims submitted and vari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>ous amendments made. If the examiner was to give any consideration to such a verbose application, it would be necessary to search through the maze of \u201cconfusing\u201d language of the claims to find' some expression of a lurking invention and to assign in each instance appropriate grounds for his rejection. The majority holds as follows: \u201cIt is true, as stated by the examiner, that appellant\u2019s alleged invention is simple, and that certain of the claims are somewhat confusing. We are of opinion, however, that such confusion as exists in the case results not from the number of claims presented, but rather from the indefiniteness of many of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"abq-dedup-0\">It seems obvious that no one can write approximately 47 claims in an attempt to define an alleged invention, which conced-edly relates to a \u201csimple\u201d matter, without resulting confusion. Jf there is any merit anywhere in a rejection on the ground of multiplicity, which is another way of saying that the applicant has not complied, with the statute in clearly stating his invention, it would seem to apply in the instant case, and if we do not apply it here, I do not know where it will be applied, An examination of the claims discloses that many of them are mere repetitions of others with no material difference except in language. Some of them, it seems to me, go far beyond .any disclosure made.</p>\n<p id=\"AXhB\">JACKSON, Associate Judge, concurs . in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
