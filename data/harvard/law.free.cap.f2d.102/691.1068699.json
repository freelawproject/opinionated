A petition for rehearing filed August 11, 1938, was denied on August 16, 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"AdIl\">In the petition for the writ, a copy of the indictment; judgment and commitment being attached as a part thereof, it was alleged that the judgment and commitment are _each void and a nullity in that he was denied the right of counsel; that the court had no jurisdiction to impose a judgment and issue a commitment, as said judgment and commitment were rendered without due process of law, the petitioner having waived none of his constitutional rights,</p>\n<p id=\"AucG\">In said record as of August 20, 1937, it is recited:</p>\n<p id=\"ASj\">\u201cThe above named defendant, Milton J.

And the court at this time asked you if you were pleading guilty to the indictment because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>you were guilty, and you advise that that was true; after you were sentenced for a period of fifteen years, and being dissatisfied with such sentence, you asked to be allowed to withdraw your plea of guilty, after such sentence was imposed, and enter a plea of not guilty, and be allowed to go to trial. Under the rules a plea of guilty cannot be withdrawn after sentence has been imposeij. You complained considerably about the severity of your punishment, and I find upon consulting your record that the day you committed the crime charged in the indictment and stole letters from apartment houses in Detroit, you had only a few days before been released from Leavenworth prison after serving a sentence of ten years for the same offense. You further admitted to the Postal Officers that you stole the letters from the apartment buildings as charged in the indictment, thereby admitting your guilt. I again find upon reviewing your criminal record, that you have served long periods of time in prisons, involving offenses of forgery, robbing mail boxes, using mail to procure fraud, and in 1931 you were sentenced to the Federal penitentiary at Leavenworth from St. Louis, Mo. for stealing mail, and' receiving a sentence of ten years, and your trouble in Detroit, in stealing mail from apartment houses, followed very shortly after your release from Leavenworth. This strongly indicated to the Court that you made your living by stealing letters from mail boxes and from apartment buildings, and you have not over a long period of years' exhibited the first disposition to reform. Therefore, under all the circumstances I am unable to grant you any relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The affidavit by Thomas P. Thornton, Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, admitted without objection, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">\u201c * * * that on the 9th day of August, A.

B. 51577, Leavenworth, Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">Appellant further alleged in said petition for rehearing that on August 9, 1937, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, between the hours of 10 A. M. and 12 M. on said date, he was arraigned before the said District Court and entered a plea of \u201cnot guilty,\u201d and that:</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">\u201cNotwithstanding, said plea of \u2018not guilty\u2019 was received in open court, the same was not incorporated and presented to this court, so as to make it appear that this petitioner had never appeared before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, for arraignment and plea on the morning of said August 9th, 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">\u201cPetitioner further alleges that he was deprived of his right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation and to the assistance of .counsel, and at no time since his arrest or during his incarceration and before sentence was the indictment read in his presence or was he shown a copy of said indictment so that he knew the true nature and cause of the accusation contained therein by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, or, by the Clerk of said District Court, or, the Attorney, or, Assistant United States Attorney, or, any Official of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">\u201cPetitioner further alleges that he was arrested on the 28th day of July, 1937, arraigned before the United States Commissioner July 29, 1937 \u2014 indicted July 30, 1937, \u2014 arraigned and entered a plea of \u2018not guilty\u2019 between the hours of 10 A. M. and 12 M. August 9th, 1937, \u2014 before the Honorable Edward J. Moinet, District Judge. And during all of said period the petitioner was unable to employ counsel, together with the court\u2019s failure to appoint counsel, or, ascertain petitioner\u2019s intent and desire concerning counsel after he entered his plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">\u201cPetitioner further alleges that upon the same day August 9, 1937, about 12 M. the Post Office Inspector, Mr. McLaughlin, informed petitioner that he was directed by the Assistant United States Attorney, to have petitioner change his plea of \u2018Not Guilty\u2019, to one of \u2018Guilty\u2019, with the promises and assurances of what the United States Attorney would do for petitioner. When petitioner refused the Post Office Inspector, Mr. McLaughlin, threatened, coerced and intimidated petitioner for two consecutive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>hours from about 12 M. to 2 P. M. depriving petitioner of his food and by taking advantage of petitioner\u2019s helplessness. The said Post Office Inspector proceeded to act for petitioner, without his consent, creating a situation that made the petitioner helpless and unable to competently or intelligently defend himself or cope with the situation without the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">\u201cPetitioner further alleges that upon the same day, the 9th day of August, 1937, between the hours of 2 P. M. and 3 P. M., petitioner was again brought before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, and the Assistant United States Attorney said to the Court: \u2018Your Honor, the defendant is now ready to plead guilty\u2019. Petitioner protested by saying, \u2018No, your Honor, may I say something?\u2019 and.the court replied, \u2018O, <em>your </em>the fellow trying to jockey the court!\u2019 admonishing him without cause or provocation, and without giving petitioner the right to be heard, and denying the petitioner the privilege to express himself, which then and there the court proceeded to a final judgment and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">\u201cPetitioner further alleges upon discovering the fraud practiced upon him by the Post Office Inspector, Mr. McLaughlin, in conjunction with the Assistant United States Attorney, the petitioner upon his return from court, after sentence requested to see the Post Office Inspector, and the Assistant United States Attorney, but said request was denied. Immediately upon petitioner\u2019s return to the United States Detention Farm at Milan, Michigan, the petitioner wrote the United States Attorney requesting that the plea of \u2018guilty\u2019, be withdrawn and held for naught, as it was not by intention or desire to plead \u2018guilty\u2019. The said Assistant United States Attorney presented the above motion that the plea of \u2018guilty\u2019 be withdrawn as petitioner requested. But said motion, was denied by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">\u201cWherefore, petitioner having fully set forth herein the facts and in order to further sustain the burden of proof, pray that subpoenas ad testificandum issue out of said United States District Court for the District of Kansas, First Division, for the said witnesses herein set forth, and on a date set by said District Court give their testimony as to said facts, and the Court having fully heard dispose of petitioner, as law and justice require, and your petitioner will ever pray.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Said petition for rehearing was signed and sworn to by appellant on August 6, 1937, and filed in the District Court for the District of Kansas on August 11, 1938, and on August 16, 1938, the judge of said court entered the following order:</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">\u201c* * * the above matter comes on for hearing before the court, the petitioner being represented by Henry Dangerfield, his attorney, and the respondent by Homer Davis, Assistant United States Attorney.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-10\">\u201cThe Court, having been fully advised in the premises and having heard the arguments of counsel herein, finds- that the motion for rehearing should be denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">The form of the order is approved by \u2022Henry Dangerfield, Attorney for petitioner, and by Homer Davis, Assistant United States Attorney, Attorney for respondent, and is marked filed August 16, 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">On that day, the petitioner in said cause gave notice of his appeal from said final order and judgment to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which appeal was allowed by the judge of said court, and has been duly prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-13\">A member of the bar of this court was appointed by the court to represent appellant. The Assistant United States Attorney appeared for the respondent. On the hearing it appears that the appellant was not present in -person at the hearing, it having been agreed by the attorneys that the Case might be heard without his being present, he being represented by an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">Under appellant\u2019s contention that he has not had due process of law in that he was neither represented nor adyised in the trial court in the Eastern District of Michigan by an attorney when he had sought an appointment of an attorney for such purpose by the court, and received a sentence of 15 years, the conclusion is reached that under the allegations in the record and contention about counsel, which is not expressly negatived, this case should be remanded for further hearing in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, where evidence under the contention as made by the appellant and respondent may be introduced by deposition or otherwise. Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">Reversed and cause remanded for further hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
