Mc-Haffie, deceased, and of the benefits thereto at the time of his death on September 22, 1919. The right at the time of his death as to the entire $10,000 was vested in him as a matured claim by reason of his permanent and total disability, and such matured claim at the time of the attempted reduction on July 17, 1919, such reduction to be effective August 5, 1919, the date to which premium had been paid on said $10,000, but so far as the amount was to be reduced after August 5, 1919, was ineffective. The declaration as to change of beneficiary of all rights under that policy to his sister, Beulah Gambill, ,not only was in effect on July 17, 1919, but also continued in such effect until his death on September 22, 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">By virtue of the application and declaration of July 17, 1919 (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 3) Lucielle Anna McHaffie Scott, in-tervehor herein, ceased to be a beneficiary under said war risk insurance policy after said date.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">As shown by Exhibit ,3, McHaffie was not permitted to take additional insurance in the sum of $5,000, on August 5, <em>1918 </em>having been granted the maximum limit of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">There is some contention that the effect was to make his sister, Beulah Gambill, beneficiary for only $5,000, leaving half of the $10,000 insurance without a designated beneficiary, and that the personal representative of the estate \u2014 his administrator or administratrix \u2014 should recover that sum. However, the record discloses that the deceased, McHaffie, intended and designated his sister as beneficiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>of all of said insurance and benefits to begin July 17, 1919, Lucidle Anna Mc-Haffie Scott then ceasing on such date to be such beneficiary. The conclusion is reached that Beulah Gambill was sole beneficiary and entitled to all of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Beulah Gambill was not only an heir but also beneficiary. There was no disagreement ever reached as to the $5,000 of the policy here under consideration until August 13, 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In United States v. Martin, 10 Cir., 80 F.2d 460, 462, the form (514 as prescribed by the Bureau) under which the affidavit was made is identical with that in the instant case<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>, the affidavit being practically the same in substance, reciting that the appellee believes himself to be the beneficiary of the insurance granted Carl Martin, who died on July 29, 1931, as a result of duodenal ulcer and pneumonia, and in support of his claim to such insurance he made certain statements as to the residences of the insured for five years prior to his death, and as to his surviving relatives, with no statement as to disability prior to his death. The Bureau did not ask for a more particular statement, simply denying the claim on the ground that the insurance, lapsing subsequent to his discharge, was not in force at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">In the opinion it is said:</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">\u201cThe phrase \u2018or which uses words showing an intention to claim insurance benefits\u2019 is in the disjunctive, is broad enough to embrace the claim made here, and we are cited to no authority narrowing the ordinary meaning of the words used. The argument that the Bureau, confronted with hundreds of claims that policies had matured by reason of total and permanent disability, did not suspect that such might be the basis for the claim here made, is not persuasive enough to warrant a strained construction of the broad language used in the 1930 amendment. The Bureau, if in doubt, can inquire as to any other facts it may need before denial or approval of the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">The purpose of requiring the filing of claim as prerequisite to suit is to give notice to the government such claim being \u201cthe physical writing which furnishes the desired information and not an assertion of a legal right\u201d (Coffey v. United States, 7 Cir., 97 F.2d 762, 764, 117 A. L.R. 940; United States v. Townsend, 4 Cir., 81 F.2d 1013; United States v. Powell, 4 Cir., 93 F.2d 788), under the policy that investigation may be made and any amount due claimant paid without being subjected to the trouble and expense of litigation. Any claim showing intention to claim insurance benefits answers the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-14\">Congress doubtless realized that many claims would be made by illiterate claimants without the advice and assistance of counsel and intended that a claim either calling attention to total and permanent disability or \u201cshowing an intention to claim insurance benefits\u201d should be sufficient. Coffey et al. v. United States, supra; Marsh v. United States, 4 Cir., 97 F.2d 327; United States v. Townsend, supra; Curtik v. United States, D.C.Mass., 19 F.Supp. 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-15\">The claim as presented in said affidavit was so comprehensive as to claim everything due under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-16\">No denial prior to August 13, 1934, was ever made as to claim under all of the $10,000 policy by Beulah Gambill as beneficiary, allotment for payment to her being made on half of same.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-17\">On December 29, 1919, she was notified that \u201cas the person named as beneficiary by Fred D. McHaffie, to whom insurance in the amount of $10,000.00 was issued * * * you are entitled to receive insurance in payments of $28.75 per month from the 23rd day of September, 1919 (the date after the death of her brother) to the 23rd day of September, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>1939,\u201d without denial as to the other $5,-000 of the original $10,000 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"A656\">Through the routine of bureaus and intermittent exchange of letters relative thereto with said claimant, such claim continued until final denial was made on August 13, 1934. Suit was then timely brought, no bar of the statute of limitations having fallen. United States v. Powell, supra; Marsh v. United States, supra; Robinson v. United States, D.C., 12 F. Supp. 160.</p>\n<p id=\"anz-dedup-0\">. The affidavit on form 514 made and filed on December 9, 1919, operated as a claim for afi insurance benefits, the government paying a part and not denying claim for the other part, the claim standing open for any additional amount or benefits. It was sufficient to move the government to make an award as to a part, . .. , , , . , . r\u2019 not entering an order of denial as to the . other part.</p>\n<p id=\"AfA\">In Marsh v. United States, supra, it is said <em>[97 </em>F.2d 328]:</p>\n<p id=\"AB8_\">\u2018The \u201ea\u00aeen\u00a3at?Trl \u00b0o <em>ln}7 </em>3\u2019 193\u00b0\u2019 46 Stat. 992, 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 445, contain-r pr\u00b0\u2122\u2019 th.^. extending to July 3, 1931, the time within which suit might be brought. It also provided for <em>suspension of the limitation cfor the period elapsing between the filing in the bureau of the claim sited upon and the denial of said claim by the director.\u2019\u201d </em>(Italics supp 16</p>\n<p id=\"a0a-dedup-0\">With years of searching records and correspondence back and forth between the Bureau and Beulah Gambill, after August 13, 1934, the Bureau requested that she submit another claim for the other part, stating that Lucidle Anna McHaffie Scott was liable to have a claim with litigation, obviously expecting for her to be brought in so all conflicting interests, if any, might be determined. See Marsh v. United States, supra, and cases cited; United States v. Tate, 4 Cir., 99 F.2d 307.</p>\n<p id=\"A0ql\">The fact that Beulah Gambill had been paid benefits on one-half of the policy in no way precluded her from pressing claim for the insurance benefits on the other part. After the claim was filed, stat-ute limitations was suspended until final denial. Section 518, Title 38 U.S. C.A.; United States v. Andrews, 10 Cir., 43 F.2d 80; United States v. Arzner, 9 Cir., 57 F.2d 488; Id., 287 U.S. 470, 471, 53 S.Ct. 238, 77 L.Ed. 436; Herrig v. United States, 9 Cir., 53 F.2d 327; United States v. Stamey, 9 Cir., 48 F.2d 150; Sprencel v. United States, 5 Cir., 47 F.2d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"aky-dedup-0\">Final disagreement between the claimant and the government as to the merits of the claim was necessary before su^ cou\u00a1d be instituted, the Bureau being the instrumentality through negotiations for the allowance of such a claim. Such , . , , \u00a31 , denial must be final, and administrative ... , , . relief exhausted before action can be in- . . , stituted, otherwise the statute of limitations is suspended. Harris v. United States, 4 Cir., 72 F.2d 663; Berntsen v. United States, 9 Cir., 41 F.2d 663; United States v. Golden 10 Cir., 34 F.2d 367 United States Rosie Bell Stand, 10. Cir., 102 F.2d 472.</p>\n<p id=\"aew-dedup-0\">In United States v. Bollman, 8 Cir., 73 F.2d 133, 135, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4t\">\u00abSo long as this order was under seri_ Qus discussion in the bureau and until it finally declined to reopen the matter the Qrder should not be deemed final for <em>nc&amp;\u00fcoa </em>of \u00a1imitations against suit. * * j as <em>^ h </em>treats or acts in a i \u2022 1 ,, t , . manner which would lead the claimant reasonably to believe that it ,s holding the matter \u00b0Pen\u2019 we f11* ? would be unjust to reEar(l ^ as closed by the first order, Tfie bureau can at any time definitely term\u00ednate such proceedings by stating that it declines to reopen and that its order is final.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU6\">The judgment of the lower court is re-versed and case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AB81\"> \u201cI, Mrs. Beulah Gambill, on oath depose and say that I was bora on the 24th day of September, 1887, and reside at Pensacola, Oklahoma; that I am the sister of Fred D.
