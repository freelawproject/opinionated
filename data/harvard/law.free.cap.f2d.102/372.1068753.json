Y., another creditor of the bankrupt. The appellee bank has moved to dismiss the appeal. The motion raises the question whether a general creditor has standing to prosecute an appeal from such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-27\">While the rule appears to be otherwise in the Fifth Circuit (In re Roche, 101 F. 956), the overwhelming weight of authority in the- other circuits is to the effect that a general creditor of a bankrupt has no right to contest another creditor\u2019s claim or to appeal from the refusal of the court to disallow it unless upon application the trustee has refused to do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>and the district court has authorized the creditor to proceed in the trustee\u2019s name. Chatfield v. O\u2019Dwyer, 8 Cir., 101 F. 797; Foreman v. Burleigh, 1 Cir., 109 F. 313; In re Lewensohn, 2 Cir., 121 F. 538; Ohio Valley Bank Co. v. Mack, 6 Cir., 163 F. 155, 24 L.R.A.,N.S., 184; In re Patterson-MacDonald Shipbuilding Co., 9 Cir., 288 F. 546; In re Chaleos, 7 Cir., 24 F.2d 482; Amick v. Mortgage Security Corporation, 8 Cir., 30 F.2d 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">While the question has not previously been decided in this circuit, we are convinced that the majority rule which we have stated is sound and should be followed here. As is pointed out in the cases supporting the rule the trustee represents all the creditors and may therefore be relied upon to press all proper objections to the claims of those whose standing is questionable. If he defaults in his duty the court may upon application direct him in his duty or, if he be recalcitrant, remove him for disobedience, or permit a creditor to act in his name. To allow any creditor, without such leave, to institute proceedings to reject the claims of other creditors, will not, as Judge Wallace pointed out in Re Lewensohn, supra, 121 F. 539, \u201csubserve any necessary purpose, and opens the door to grave abuse. It enables one creditor at his own pleasure to subject any one of the other creditors, or all the other creditors, to the inconvenience and expense of unnecessary litigation, and to unduly protract the settlement of the estate. It is not allowed, in terms, by any provision of the bankrupt act.\u201d \u201cFurthermore,\u201d as Judge Thayer said in Chatfield v. O\u2019Dwyer, supra, 101 F. page 799, \u201cif one creditor of a bankrupt may prosecute an appeal, under section 25 of the bankrupt law [11 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 48], from the allowance of a claim, then any other creditor may take a like appeal upon the same or different grounds, and this court may be required to entertain a number of appeals, all of which are brought to test the validity of the same demand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">In the present case the appellant creditor did not secure leave of court to prosecute this appeal in the name of the trustee. It made no application for such leave and indeed did not request the trustee to take the appeal on its behalf. It, therefore, has no standing to proceed with the'appeal, which must be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
