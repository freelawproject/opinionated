A process for treating lubricating oil which includes diluting the lubricating oil with a normally gaseous liquefied hydrocarbon diluent maintained at superatmospheric pressure sufficient to maintain the diluent liquid, contacting said diluted oil with clay at such pressure and separating the treated oil dissolved in said liquefied diluent at superatmospheric pressure from the clay, and separating said oil from said diluent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-34\">The nature of the invention is sufficiently disclosed by the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>The interference arises between an application of appellants filed June 12, 1934, stated to be a continuation of a copending application filed August 4, 1931, and an application of appellee filed May 25, 1934, stated to be a division of appellee\u2019s application Serial No. 679073, the filing date of which does not appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Originally four parties were involved in the interference \u2014 appellants, appellee, and two others, Stanton and Weir. The interference was terminated as to Stanton apparently because he alleged conception and reduction to practice of the invention subsequent to the filing date of appellants and Weir.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">The preliminary statement of appellee alleged conception and reduction to practice of the invention subsequent to the filing dates of appellants and Weir.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Thereupon the Examiner of Interferences issued an order to show cause within 45 days why judgment on the record should not be entered against appellee and Stanton. Within said time appellee moved to dissolve the interference upon two grounds, one of which was that appellants and Weir had no right to make the claim constituting the count. It is contended by appellants that the grounds here urged upon this point, were not specifically set out in said motion to dissolve and that the question hereinafter discussed may not properly be considered, for lack of compliance with the provisions of rule 122 of the Rules of Practice of the United States Patent Office. The Board of Appeals held that the motion to dissolve was sufficient under rule 122, and while we think the sufficiency of the motion to dissolve is very questionable, we prefer to consider the case upon its merits in view of the fact that the conclusion we have reached requires a reversal of the decision of the Board of Appeals, and the final result is the same as if we should decide that appel-lee\u2019s motion to dissolve was insufficient to raise the issue before us upon its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">With respect to said motion to dissolve the Primary Examiner dismissed the first ground of the <em>motion, </em>and&gt; this <em>action is </em>not here involved. He set the second ground of the motion for hearing on December 20, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Other motions were made before the decision of the Primary Examiner upon the motion to dissolve, none of which are material here.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">One of the grounds urged by appellee before the Primary Examiner in support of his contention that appellants\u2019 disclosure does not support the count was that appellants\u2019 application does not disclose the steps in the count reading \u201ccontacting said diluted oil with clay\u201d and \u201cseparating the treated oil * * * from the clay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">The Primary Examiner denied the motion to dissolve, holding that appellants\u2019 application does disclose both steps above set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">Thereafter, on April 1, 1936, the Examiner of Interferences rendered judgment that neither appellee nor Stanton is the first inventor of the subject matter in issue. As Stanton had made no response to the order to show cause, this judgment eliminated him from the interference. Under said judgment the only parties left in the interference were the appellants and Weir. Under date of March 6, 1937, Weir\u2019s assignee filed a disclaimer of the invention set forth in the count, which eliminated Weir from the interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">Tears, appellee here, appealed from said judgment to the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">It is stated in appellants\u2019 brief that appellants and Weir took testimony, but the record contains no testimony or reference thereto, from which we assume that any testimony taken had no relevancy to the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-14\">It appears from the record that, as between the parties hereto, the count originated in appellants\u2019 application; that it first originated in a motion of appellants in another interference, No. <em>67,974 </em>(in which appellee was not a party) to add a new count thereto, which was identical with the count here involved. This motion was granted on April 6, 1935, and the count was inserted as a claim in appellants\u2019 application Serial No. 555,018, of which their application here involved is a continuation. Thereafter the count before us was inserted in appellants\u2019 instant application and on April 27, 1935, was found allowable by the Primary Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-15\">On April 23, 1934, the Primary Examiner suggested to appellee, for purpose of interference, said claim of appellants\u2019 application corresponding to the count before us, and on May 15, 1935, appellee copied said claim, reserving \u201cthe right to raise any proper question concerning the same by motion or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>The Primary Examiner in his decision upon appellee\u2019s motion to dissolve stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">\u201cThe party Tears urges that Bray and Swift have no right to make the claim because they do not disclose the \u2018contacting\u2019 step. In the Bray and Swift disclosure a mixture of liquid propane and oil, and some residual sludge from a prior acid treating step passes by pipe 71 into the ^clay tower\u2019 72 and percolates through a bed of clay therein, the purified oil and propane leaving through pipe 73. It is the contention of the party'Tears that the filtration step carried out in tower 72 of Bray and Swift does not satisfy the language of the count because \u2018the term \u201ccontacting\u201d has a very definite meaning in the oil refining art and is used to distinguish the contact method from the percolation method of decolorizing.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">\u201cThe examiner recognizes the distinction between \u2018contact\u2019 and \u2018percolation\u2019 filtration. However, it must be pointed out that the count defines the act of bringing together the diluted oil and the clay in very broad terms, and it is not believed that the count can be restricted, as Tears would have it restricted, to a particular manner of bringing together the diluted oil and the clay. In an interference proceeding the claims of the issue must be given the broad interpretation which their terms- reasonably warrant when read in the light of the application in which they originated. Campbell v. Gilpin, 1926 C.D. 151. The present count originated in a motion of the party Bray in interference 67,974, and was at that time inserted in the Bray and Swift patent case Serial No. 555,018, of which the Bray and Swift case here involved is a division. The language of the count is broad, and when read in the light of the Bray and Swift disclosure it is believed to be supported by such disclosure and not to be inconsistent therewith. If any of the parties involved considers that there is patentable novelty in the particular method disclosed by him of bringing together the clay and the diluted oil, no difficulty should he encountered in choosing language to define that novelty in such a way as to distinguish from mere \u2018contacting said diluted oil with clay\u201d as broadly defined by the count.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Thereafter the Examiner of Interferences entered judgment upon the record, awarding priority of invention to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">The board reversed the decisions of the Examiner of Interferences and awarded priority of invention to appellee. In its decision the board stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">\u201cThe question involved goes back to a decision of the Primary Examiner holding that the party Bray and Swift can make the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">\u201cIt appears that in the Bray and Swift disclosure the oil is caused to percolate through, and contact with, a bed of clay. When the oil passes from this bed, it is, of course, separated from the clay. We believe, therefore, that in the ordinary usage of the terms, the count clearly reads upon the Bray and Swift procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">\u201cIn the application of the party Tears, however, no percolation through clay is carried on but the clay is mixed with the oil and then afterward the oil is separated from the clay. The party Tears argues that in this art the term \u2018contacting\u2019 has acquired a distinct meaning which does not indicate percolation. In his decision the Primary Examiner states :</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">\u201c \u2018The examiner recognizes the distinc- \u25a0 tion between \u201ccontact\u201d and \u201cpercolation\u201d filtration.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">\u201cIt appears, therefore, that the examiner recognized that the term \u2018contact\u2019 had a different meaning from \u2018percolation\u2019 because we consider that \u2018contact\u2019 cannot be regarded as modifying filtration, although it may be true that, after a contact procedure has been carried out, the oil will be separated from the clay by passing the same through a filter. We believe, however, that a contact treatment is usually not a percolating operation. We think, however, that in percolating oil through clay under certain conditions, a contact operation may occur simultaneously. PIow-ever, in the Bray and Swift disclosure there is no description of any such conditions, we believe, as will cause both operations. We therefore are of the opinion that there is no disclosure of a process such as the term \u2018contact\u2019 generally indicates in this art. We do not believe that any one skilled in this art, with only the Bray and Swift disclosure, would draw a claim of this nature. We consider that this is one instance in which a term of a claim should be given a limited interpretation in view of the meaning which it has acquired in a particular art.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">From the judgment so entered, appellants have appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>The principal question before us is the meaning that should be given to the words \u201ccontacting said diluted oil with clay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">It seems to be conceded by the parties that there are two general methods of decolorizing lubricating oil. These methods are stated in appellants\u2019 brief as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AVm\">\u201cA brief statement of the two salient methods of contacting lubricating oil with clay are:</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">\u201c(a) The percolation method</p>\n<p id=\"AOYU\">\u201c(b) The contact filtration process</p>\n<p id=\"Ax0G\">\u201cIn the <em>percolation </em>method, the oil is permitted to flow either upwardly or downwardly through a bed of clay, the individual particles of which are of sufficient size so that passage of the oil between' the clay particles is possible either- through the downward effect of gravity or the upward effect of a moderate excess pressure. Naturally, the bed of clay is confined in a suitable column or tower. In passing around and between the individual particles of clay throughout the bed, the oil is brought in contact with the clay and subjected to the desired treatment. -One of the results of such treatment is the removal of undesired color bodies so that the oil is to a certain extent- decolorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">\u201cIn the <em>contact filtration </em>process, the oil and finely divided clay are brought in contact so as to form a suspension or slurry. If a certain amount of agitation is imparted to the slurry, the particles of clay tend to remain in a more or less homogeneous suspension. The clay is ultimately separated from the oil by moving the slurry toward a filter,- on the filtering surface of which the clay is deposited while the oil passes through the filtering surface. Thus the clay is separated from the oil. Similarly, in- the percolation process, the oil is separated from the clay when the oil has passed through the bed of clay either by discharge over the -top of the bed or by withdrawal from the bottom of the bed depending upon the direction of passage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"acp-dedup-1\">Appellee is apparently in agreement with the foregoing description of the two methods, but denies that the percolation method involves contacting the oil with the clay, within the meaning of the term \u201ccontacting\u201d as understood in the art. In ap-pellee\u2019s brief it is stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">\u201cBray and Swift themselves are on record before this Court as recognizing the distinctions between percolation and con-fecting method's. On page -12, of their brief, they describe the percolation method as one in which the oil is permitted to flow through a \u2018confined\u2019 bed of clay made up of particles \u2018of sufficient size\u2019 and contact filtration as one in which the oil \u2018and finely divided clay\u2019 are brought in contact (they would not say \u2018contacted\u2019) \u2018to form a suspension or slurry\u2019 \u2014 the suspension being more homogeneous with agitation \u2014 and the clay being \u2018ultimately separated from the oil by moving the slurry\u2019 \u2014 with the clay travelling along with the oil \u2014 to a filter. \u2018Thus the clay is separated from the oil\u2019 (foot of p. 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">\u201cWe agree that it is \u2018thus\u2019 the clay is separated from the oil, within the intent of the count. It seems a futile gesture after such recognition of facts for them then to argue as they do at the top of page 13 (brief) that \u2018in both methods the clay and oil are brought into <em>contact </em>within the ordinary Dictionary meaning of the word\u2019 for in the first place, the count does not say simply bringing into contact and in the second place, we are dealing with terms which have established themselves as having special meaning in a highly technical art and with experts who know what such terms mean, apart from any ordinary Dictionary meaning. If Bray and Swift insist on this Dictionary meaning, they in effect attack the validity of the count, for any one\u2019 knows that simply bringing ordinary clay and oil into contact with each other will not accomplish any new and patentable result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">It is elementary that counts in an interference, if not ambiguous, should be given the broadest interpretation which they will reasonably support, and, if ambiguous, resort for their interpretation should be |iad to the application in which they originated.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">' It was held by the board that, within the common meaning of the term \u201ccontacting\u201d the count clearly reads upon appellants\u2019 disclosure. This is not challenged by appellee, but he contends, and the board held, that the term \u201ccontacting\u201d as used in the involved art has a restricted meaning, and that under such restricted meaning appellants\u2019 application does not support the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">The hoard observed that in the process disclosed by appellee there is no percolation through clay, but the clay is mixed with oil and then afterwards the oil is' separated from the clay. The count was cop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>ied by appellee from appellants\u2019 application, where it was an allowed claim, and if there be any ambiguity in the count its meaning is to be determined from an examination of that application, and not from the application of appellee. Brogden v. Slater, 40 F.2d 988, 17 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">Appellee makes some contention that the count did not originate in appellants\u2019 application, but the record clearly shows that it did so originate. The fact that it was first suggested by appellants in another interference is wholly immaterial, so far as the issues in this case are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">It is appellee\u2019s contention that the word \u201ccontacting\u201d should not be given its common meaning in constraing the count for the reason, as he contends, \u201cthat said word as used in the oil refining art has a restricted meaning,\u201d and that, construing the count with such restricted meaning, it is not supported by appellants\u2019 disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">We find nothing in the record establishing any restricted meaning of the word \u201ccontacting,\u201d as used in the particular art, and only by taking judicial notice of what is within the special knowledge of those engaged in the oil industry could any restricted meaning of the word \u201ccontacting\u201d as used in the count be found. We have grave doubt that judicial notice may be taken of facts within the special knowledge of those engaged in a particular art, not presumably a matter of common knowledge to all, but we do not find it necessary to decide that question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">It will be observed that the board does not hold that the word \u201ccontacting\u201d has a uniform and definite restricted meaning in the art involved. It holds that \u201ca contact treatment is <em>usually </em>not a percolating operation\u201d (italics ours), and that \u201cthere is no disclosure of a process such as the term \u2018contact\u2019 <em>generally </em>indicates in this art\u201d. (Italics ours.) The clear implication from the foregoing is that the word \u201ccontact\u201d is sometimes used in the art according to its common meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary defines the verb \u201ccontact,\u201d so far as its definition is here pertinent, as follows: \u201ccontact. * * * to be in contact; touch</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">In the notes following the definition of the word \u201ccontact\u201d as a noun we find the following: \u201ccontact-bed, 1. a form of sewerage-filter. * * * contact-process, any of several methods of utilizing contact action, as in chemistry and physics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">From the foregoing it would seem that the word \u201ccontact\u201d is used in the arts broadly, and we specially call attention to the definition of \u201ccontact-bed,\u201d which indicates a process closely allied to the process of percolation disclosed by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-14\">However this may be, we are of the opinion that, while it is ordinarily true that the meaning of a term in a claim or count is to be determined by its meaning in the particular art involved, where a term in a count has a common meaning and also a more limited meaning, and is not always used in the art according to its limited meaning, the term is sufficiently ambiguous to warrant resort to the application where it originated to ascertain its meaning as used in a count. See Hausman v. Hochman, 83 F.2d 703, 23 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-15\">Therefore, considering the word \u201ccontacting\u201d in the light of appellants\u2019 application where the count originated, it is clear that the word was used in appellants\u2019 claim corresponding to the count according to its common meaning, and in the circumstances that common meaning must be given by us to the count, and, as held by both Patent Office tribunals, under such common meaning of the word \u201ccontacting,\u201d appellants\u2019 disclosure supports the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-16\">Appellee further contends that appellants\u2019 application does not disclose the element of the count reading: \u201cseparating the treated oil dissolved in said liquefied diluent at superatmospheric pressure from the clay.\u201d Upon this point the Primary Examiner, in his decision upon the motion to dissolve, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b945-18\">\u201cTears urges that in their process Bray and Swift do not have and do not need \u2018a separate step of separating the oil from the clay\u2019. The basis for this contention is that after passing the oil through the clay, Bray and Swift \u2018have accomplished separation and have no need for and actually have no separate step of then separating the oil from the clay\u2019. As already stated, the examiner is of the opinion that the bringing together of the diluted oil and clay in tower 72 satisfies the \u2018contacting\u2019 step of the count. When the diluted oil overflows through pipe 73 it passes out of the zone of contact with the clay, and is according<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>ly literally separated therefrom, and that b all that the broad language of the count re quires.\" -</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">We are in accord with this statemen of the examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">For the reasons stated, construing th terms of the countas broadly as they wil reasonably permit, we must hold that ap pellants' disclosure in their application sup ports the involved count, and that th Boai*l of Appeals erred in awarding prior ity of invention to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-15\">Therefore the decision appealed from i~ reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-17\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
