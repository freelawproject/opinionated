After a second argument a majority of the court, as now constituted, Judge AUGUSTUS N. HAND dissenting, holds that Stranahan disclosed an authentic invention in his specifications for the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion upon the original hearing. Whether claim three may properly be limited to that invention, depends upon how we are to understand its last element: \u201cmeans * * * for releasing said rod when the wheels are turned from their position\u201d straight ahead. This obviously referred to the fact that, as the rod tilts, it leaves the \u201cbrake lining 13\u201d, and the steering is thereafter wholly free; but the words are general and unless limited by the disclosure cover a good deal more. In Wattles the braking member did indeed \u201crelease\u201d the rod when the wheels turned, but it always kept contact with it, i. e., with the \u201ccam-arms, 13, 13.\u201d Law did not \u201crelease\u201d the rod at all, for although it left the end of the bracket member, 8, the tension and braking increased, the more the wheels turned. Lowe also had no means of release. In Ross the axle did not carry the element \u201cextending into the vicinity of said tie rod\u201d, and that alone distinguishes the reference. In Mac-donald the rod was to some extent \u201creleased\u201d from friction, but not altogether, and, as in Wattles, the braking device always remained in contact with the rod. The same was true of Stoffer and Shoemaker. It would therefore be a perverse interpretation, which should refuse to limit the word \u201creleasing\u201d in claim three to the unique feature of Stranahan\u2019s disclosure: the canon, ut res magis valeat quam pereat, applies with particular force to patent claims.
