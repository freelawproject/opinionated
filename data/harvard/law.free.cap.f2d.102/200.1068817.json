Upon appeal to the Board of Appeals, the decision of the examiner rejecting said claims was affirmed. Appellant has appealed \u25a0 here from the decision of the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-17\">Claims 11, 20, 26, and 27 are regarded as illustrative and follow:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-18\">\u201c11. A refrigeration system including: an evaporator and condenser having connections with one another, the whole arranged to constitute a cyclic passage and maintained under relatively high vacuum; and a reaction-type power-drivable -axial-blade-screw compressor in said cyclic passage and in compressive relation from said evaporator to said condenser,</p>\n<p id=\"b264-19\">\u201c20. A refrigeration system including: an evaporator and condenser having connections with one another, the whole arranged to constitute a cyclic passage and maintained under relatively high vacuum; a reaction-type multi-stage power-drivable axial-blade-screw compressor in said cyclic passage and in compressive relation from said evaporator to said condenser; and a fluid refrigerant in said cyclic passage and the boiling point of which at atmospheric pressure is above 70\u00b0 F.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-20\">\u201c26. In a refrigeration system utilizing water as a refrigerant, a compressor, a condenser and an evaporator all connected in the order named in a closed circuit, said compressor being of the multistage reaction turbo-type, whereby the relatively large volume of gaseous refrigerant leaving the evaporator of the system is compressed to the proper condensing pressure in a relatively small practical and efficient machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-21\">\u201c27. The process of refrigeration comprising the evaporation of a refrigerant of such characteristics that its volume is relatively large when in a gaseous state, sucking in one direction the vapor from the surface of liquid refrigerant, increasing the pressure of said vapor, again sucking said vapor in the same direction at a higher pressure and again increasing the pressure of said vapor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-22\">The references relied upon by the Patent Office tribunals are as follows: Wor-then, 1,463,110, July 24, 1923; Leblanc-Vickers (Ger.), 489,194, Feb. 3, 1926; Carrier, 1,575,818, March 9, 1926; Weaver, 1,761,551, June 3, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-23\">Applicant\u2019s invention, as defined by some of the rejected claims, relates to a refrigerating system of the compressor-condenser-evaporator type utilizing a refrigerant having a relatively large volume when in the gaseous state and a compressor of the multi-stage reaction turbo-type. The refrigerant; which applicant states he uses, is water.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-24\">The examiner, in rejecting the claims, used the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-25\">\u201cThe appealed claims are each rejected as drawn to an old combination shown in the Carrier patent. The substitution of applicant\u2019s compressor for Carrier\u2019s in Carrier\u2019s combination is not believed to make a new combination. See In re McNeill, 1902 C.D. 563, 100 O.G. 2178, 20 App.D.C. 294. Nor is the substitution of water for Carrier\u2019s CCL believed to ef-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>feet such a combination. Carrier clearly discloses the general combination of a compressor, condenser and evaporator in which the refrigerant circulated <em>(CCh) </em>is of such a nature that it occupies a relatively large volume when in a gaseous state. Furthermore, Carrier\u2019s multi-stage rotary compressor is designed to take care of large volumes of evaporated refrigerant. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\">* * * * * \u2666 *</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u201cThe appealed claims are each rejected as presenting no invention over Carrier in view of Leblanc-Vickers taken with Worthen. These claims differ from Carrier, <em>who clearly discloses the general combination to be old, </em>in that they recite the utilization of a somewhat different form of <em>compressor </em>and <em>refrigerant </em>from that specified by the patentee. Applicant\u2019s compressor, however, is nicely depicted and described in the drawings and specification, respectively, of the Worthen patent. Applicant, furthermore, is not first in making use of water as' a refrigerant which fact is apparent from the disclosure in the Leblanc-Vickers patent (or the Weaver patent). Carrier, by his adoption of CCI4, as his refrigerant, had before him the problem of removing from his evaporator and compressing large volumes of refrigerant vapor. To this end he selected a multiple stage rotary compressor for utilization in his system. The substitution for CCI4 of an old refrigerant (water), the vapor of which has even a larger \u201ccubic feet per pound\u201d ratio than CCI4 and the utilization of a multi-stage reaction turbo-type compressor in place of Carrier\u2019s multi-stage rotary compressor, in order that the correspondingly larger volume of water vapor might he handled, in Carrier\u2019s combination, in view of the Leblanc-Vickers patent taken with the Worthen patent, is not deemed to involve invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u201cConclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u201cI. The appealed claims are each finally rejected as drawn to an old combination shown in Carrier\u2019s patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u201cII. The appealed claims are each finally rejected as presenting no invention over Carrier\u2019s teachings in view of the Leblanc-Vickers and the Worthen disclosures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The board recited the grounds of rejection of the examiner without disapproving of his reasoning or conclusion. We find the following in the decision of the board:</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">\"* * * With regard to the refrigerant, the patentee [Carrier] states that the refrigerant should have relatively large vapor volumes, that the carbon tetrachloride refrigerant is non-explosive, non-inflammable and is safe to be used in a refrigerating system because all of the parts, including the evaporator, exhauster and condenser, are under a vacuum and that the liquid itself can be handled almost like water under atmospheric pressures and is entirely harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">\u201cIn view of these suggestions as to the capacity and analogy of the refrigerant used in the Carrier patent to water, and to the conditions in the compressor being similar to the conditions in a steam turbine, it is believed that the rejections of the examiner are proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">More definitely stated, it seems to be the view of the examiner and the board that it did not require invention on the part of applicant to use water as a refrigerant in Carrier\u2019s multi-stage rotary compressor in view of the fact that it was old in the art to use multi-stage reaction turbo-type compressors in the art and in further view of the fact that Carrier taught the use, under vacuum, of a refrigerant, carbon tetrachloride, which was non-explosive, non-inflammable and had a relatively large vapor volume. As a matter of good measure, the examiner cited the patents to Leblanc-Vickers and to Weaver which show the use of water as a refrigerant. The board, however, did not specifically apply the two last-referred-to references but stated: \u201cthe conditions in the compressor being similar to the conditions in a steam turbine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-16\">In claims 11, 17, and 21 there is no suggestion of the use of water as a refrigerant. In claim 20 the refrigerant is defined as being one with a boiling point at atmospheric pressure of above 70\u00b0 F. The same limitation is found in claim 23. Water as a refrigerant is specifically provided for in claim 26, while claim 27, as well as claims 25 and 28, call for a refrigerant having a relatively large volume in its gaseous state. Claims 25 to 28, inclusive, were added for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AnGe\">Unquestionably the prior art specifically taught the use of a refrigerant which had a volume relatively large when in a gaseous state and this element would add noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ing . inventive' to the claims. It is also clear that it was old in the art to use water as a refrigerant. The question therefore is presented, Did it require invention in view of the teachings of Carrier, who used a refrigerant of relatively large volume in a gaseous state, such as carbon tetrachloride, to use water which produced a .greater volume of vapor than any other refrigerant known to the art in a compressor of the multi-stage reaction turbo-type, such a compressor being disclosed in the Worthen patent?</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">It seems to us that Carrier by the use of his device found out that he was able to use a refrigerant, the volume of which was relatively large in a gaseous state, and that one skilled in the- art who wished to use water as a refrigerant to accomplish the purpose which Carrier' accomplished would have no difficulty, after he had examined the prior art references, in doing what appellant has done without the exercise of the inventive faculty.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Appellant argues that this court\u2019s decision in Re Wessblad, 58 F.2d 418, 19 C.C. P.A., Patents, 1175, should have been regarded as controlling by the Patent Office and should be regarded as - controlling of o\u00fcr decision. In that case the applicant\u2019s combination claims which related to an air-cooled absorption refrigerating apparatus were rejected upon four references. .The character of the refrigerant used was not relied upon to impart invention. The court stated the issue .as. [page 419]: * * The soie question, therefore, is whether invention was involved in modifying the von Platen disclosure, in view of the other references, by ' substituting for its cooling system the cooling apparatus disclosed in the patent to Darlington.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The court held, after commenting on certain features of the references, that: \u201c* * * considering the references in connection with appellant\u2019s combination, its admitted novelty, usefulness, and the distinct advancement it made in the absorption refrigerating art, we are out of .accord with the conclusion reached by the Patent Office tribunals. We think the .claims are patentable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">It will be noticed that it was.upon a consideration of the showing or lack of showing of the referenc\u00e9s together with the other admitted elements which brought the court to the conclusion that the claims there involved defined invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">In re Barsky, 62 F.2d 192, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 779, which involved an alleged invention relating to a refrigerating system of the absorption type, the same argument with reference to' the controlling influence of the case of In re Wessblad, supra, was made as is made here, and in answer to that argument the court said [page 194] : \u201cIt is contended by counsel for appellant that the decision of the Board of Appeals, in the case at bar, should be reversed on the authority of the decision of this court in the case of In re Wessblad, 58 F.2d 418, 19 C.C.P.A. [Patents] 1175, because, it is argued, the court there held that the substitution of air cooling for water cooling in refrigerating systems of the absorption type, \u2018where novelty, usefulness, and a distinct advancement in the art is admitted,\u2019 involved invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">\u201cThat is not a correct statement of the holding of the court in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">\u201cThe court there held that, considering the novelty and usefulness of the apparatus involved and the distinct advancement it made in the art, <em>in connection with the references of record, the claims were </em>patentable.\u201d [Italics quoted.]</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">The references in the case of In re Wessblad, supra, are not the same refer7 enees \u00e1s are relied upon by the Patent Office tribunals in the instant case and their application to the invention there, involved is quite <em>different </em>from their application to the claims at bar. \u25a0 We find nothing in the case of In re Wessblad, supra, which requires a reversal of the decision of the Board of Appeals in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">Appellant's chief contention is that his great problem was in devising a system which could utilize water as a refrigerant which was known to have the quality of producing a greater volume when vaporized than any other \u2022 material used as a refrigerant. Were it not for the teaching of Carrier of the beneficial use of a refrigerant which had, a relatively large volume when in a gaseous state there might be more merit to appellant\u2019s contention that it required invention to make the substitution of elements shown in the prior art in his combined apparatus and method.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">Appellant has assigned error in the action of the Board of Appeals \u201cin failing to recognize that Claims 27 and 28 are process \u2019 claims and should not have been included in the general rejection of claims on the structural references.\u201d Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>argues that the process as defined by claims 27 and 28 cannot be said to be an old combination since the steps included therein are clearly not disclosed in any one of the references. It is further contended that the process claims being based upon the structure are not met by the showing -of the structure of the cited patents since they do not meet the process steps recited in the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">While there has been no rejection on the part of the Patent Office tribunals on the ground that the process claims are not allowable for the reason that they define merely the operation of appellant\u2019s apparatus (and there has been no requirement for division), it seems clear that the alleged inventions are so closely related that if there is no invention in producing the apparatus there can be no possible invention, for the same reasons, in the method claims which are based on the steps of performance of the apparatus. As to this assignment of error we think appellant\u2019s contentions are wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">It is our view that the tribunals of the Patent Office arrived at the correct conclusion, and the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
