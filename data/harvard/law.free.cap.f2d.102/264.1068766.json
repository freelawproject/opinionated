But the reason for the rule fails where a municipal court is asked to notice an ordinance of the same municipality,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because such ordinances come within the particular and original jurisdiction of such courts,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and an exception to the general rule is recognized in most jurisdictions accordingly.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Such courts stand in the same relationship to municipal laws as do courts of general jurisdiction to public laws and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>consequently, as to them, the local ordinances are the peculiar law of the forum.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is nothing to the contrary in District of Columbia v. Petty, 37 App.D.C. 156, relied upon by appellant. Section 22, Title 9, D.GCode, 1929, upon which he also relies, provides a method of proving municipal ordinances and regulations under conditions and in courts in which such proof must be made. It does not require such proof under the circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"AqY\">.... . The reason of the rule winch requires a municipal court to take judicial notice of a regulation of the same municipality applies with equal force to a court invested with fuH jurisdiction to enforce such regulations even though it may have jurisdiction to enforce other laws as well.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The lower court was invested by Congress with original jurisdiction \u201cof all offenses against municipal ordinances and regulations in force in the District of Columbia.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The fact that it was also given original jurisdiction of other offenses does not alter the fact that it functioned in the present case as a municipal court specially charged with original jurisdiction of offenses arising under the regulation in question; hence that it .had judicial knowledge thereof.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A1_\">Appellant\u2019s contention that because it \u25a0was created by Congress the Police Court of the District of Columbia is a United States court and not a municipal court is without merit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is neither exclusively a United States court nor exclusively a municipal court hut a hybrid exercising the functions of both. It has original jurisdiction, subject to a few exceptions, concurrently with the District Court, of all crimes and offenses committed in the District of Columbia \u201cnot capital or otherwise infamous and not punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary ** * * .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In this respect it is a court of the United States, although not a constitutional one.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On the other hand, when it acts in the exer- <em>^ </em>Qf itg jurisdiction \u00abof an offenses \u00a1nst munid al ordinances and regulatfons \u00a1n force in the District of Columbia\u201e <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> it ses all the attributes and essential <em>c\u00bfracter\u00edst\u00edcs </em>of a municipal court of justice of the -court which it wag \u00bftended tQ \u00bfsede-<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"arp-dedup-0\">Appellant\u2019s next contention is that he was improperly convicted, under the facts 0f the case, because he came within the exception of the regulation which permits \u201cthe customary and necessary use of such [public] space by the occupants of abutting property in handling goods in trans\u00a1t * * * during business hours only * * * <em>\u00bb </em>-p^g evidence is uncontradicted that the\u2019use which appellant made of the public space was during business hours only. There seems to be no dispute also that the use consisted of a continuous process of unloading paper from trucks onto a pile which occupied the public space, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>a similarly continuous process of moving the paper from the pile into appellant\u2019s building. Consequently, although from moment to moment the pile consisted of different paper, nevertheless the space was continuously occupied by a pile of paper. As one of appellant\u2019s witnesses described the situation: \u201c * * * the pile was continuously being added to and taken away from in the process of his business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AmG\">The question is whether this constituted \u201can occupation of public space for storage purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In our view it did. The definition of the word storage, for which appellant contends, is a type of <em>dead </em>storage in which goods come to rest for safe keeping. The cases upon which he relies refer to that type of storage.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But <em>live </em>storage is equally well known to this modern age; examples of which are to be found in the storage of automobiles in daily use.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The <em>customary </em>and <em>necessary </em>use of public space by business people, their clients, customers and friends may be a considerable one, just as may be a similar use of the public street, in front of a place of business, for \u201chandling goods in transit.\u201d Perhaps even a greater use of the public space may be-justified, than of the public street, for such purposes. To this extent the right and privileges of other members of the public may be appropriately cut down. But somewhere, short of the point of sole occupation and exclusive use, the rights and privileges of the rest of the public must be recognized. Appellant\u2019s occupation of the public space during business hours, being a continuous one, appropriated it to his sole use. So far as the other members of the public were concerned, the space was as effectually deprived of its public character during business hours as if it had been used for dead storage. That, in our view, is what the regulation is designed to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">We have carefully considered all of appellant\u2019s assignments and contentions and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-18\"> \u201cThat occupation of public space beyond the extent permitted by existing law or regulation, or as those laws or regulations may be amended from time to time, is hereby forbidden: Provided, however, That the customary and necessary use of such space by the occupants of abutting property in handling goods in transit is permitted during business hours only, but this permissible use shall not he construed to authorize an occupation of public space for storage purposes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-25\"> District of Columbia v.

The regulation reads as follows: \u201cSec. 19. That occupation of public space beyond the extent permitted by existing law or regulation, or as those laws or regulations may be amended from time to time, is hereby forbidden; Provided, however, That the customary and necessary use of such space by the occupants of abutting property in handling goods in transit is permitted during business hours only, but this permissible use shall not be construed to authorize an occupation of public space for storage purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">I quote all the evidence in the record. Sergeant Walrodt, of the Metropolitan Police, testified that \u201con the 4th day of November, 1937, he observed <em>a pile of paper about 4 feet wide and 8 feet long </em>against the building at New Jersey Avenue and N Streets, S.E., where the defendant conducts a junk shop; that he never had the place under observation <em>for any great length </em>of, <em>time </em>but that when he did observe the premises there was a pile of paper on public space adjoining the building; that he did not know whether the pile of paper that he saw from one time to another was composed of the same identical paper and <em>that he did not know how long such identical paper </em>may have remained in that location. However, a pile of paper occupied this space everytime he observed it.\u201d. [Italics supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">The record states that \u201cOfficer J. M. Sine testified substantially as Sergeant Walrodt had testified\u201d and, in addition thereto, the following: \u201cThis witness when asked whether or not he knew if the merchandise or paper, which he observed, was ever stored in the space it occupied, he answered that he did not know; but that he believed that <em>the pile </em>which he observed, <em>was not continuously the same identical paper, </em>because he also observed employees putting the paper into the building, as well as additional paper being dumped on the pile.\u201d [Italics supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b331-17\">For the appellant, Walter Koons testified \u201cthat between the hours of about 10:00 a. m. and 2:00 p. m. trucks were continuously unloading their merchandise in front of the premises in question and in public space adjoining the defendant\u2019s building; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>that after the merchandise was unloaded into the pile, it was weighted and taken into the building; that sometimes there were as many as four or five trucks unloading at the same time and that <em>any particular merchandise </em>that was unloaded from the trucks <em>never remained in the pile </em>in front of the building <em>for a period longer than 5 or 10 minutes, </em>since the pile was continuously being added to and taken away from in the process of his'business; that after this paper was unloaded onto the pile, it was taken from the pile and put into a bailer; that the bailer is working continuously from opening time in the morning until closing time in the evening; and no merchandise was ever left out side of the building after the close of business for the day.\u201d [Italics supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">It was agreed that two other witnesses would testify substantially as the witness Koons.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">I do not think that the evidence either warranted, or can now sustain, a conviction. The language of the regulation is plain. The testimony is clear, and without contradiction. Under the express language of the regulation \u201cthe customary and necessary use of such space by the occupants of abutting property in handling goods in transit during business hours only\u201d is permitted. True, this right of use is followed by limiting language that \u201cthis permissible use shall not be construed to authorize an occupation of public space for storage purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The majority opinion admits that the appellant made use of a public space during \u201cbusiness hours only\u201d. Seemingly, it admits that the appellant was engaged \u201cin handling goods in transit\u201d. In any event, I consider it so to be. However, the majority opinion holds that this method of handling goods in transit \u201cconstituted \u2018an occupation of public space for storage purposes.\u2019 \u201d Distinguishing between <em>\"dead </em>storage\u201d and <em>\u201clive </em>storage\u201d, it admits that it is not <em>\u201cdead </em>storage\u201d, but defines it to be <em>\"live </em>storage\u201d. I do not think that it is storage at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The majority opinion shows a very proper concern for the rights of other members of the public in the use of the public space. Although the record does not disclose the manner in which they might desire or could legally use it, it is not essential as the question here involved is whether the appellant violated the law in his use of it. It should be understood that the particular public space does not involve the obstruction of the sidewalk for pedestrian use; it is the land situate between the building occupied by the appellant and the edge of the sidewalk nearest to the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">The majority opinion states that \u201cappellant\u2019s occupation of the public space during business hours, being a continuous one, appropriated it to his sole use.\u201d The record, in my opinion, does not warrant such conclusion, unless the business hours of this junk dealer were from 10:00 a. m to 2:00 p. m. However, if the appellant, during business hours, did make use of the-public space in the manner shown by the record, in my opinion, he did not violate the law. I see no lang\u00e1uge that would prohibit continuous use by the occupants of the abutting property in handling goods in transit during business hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">The courts are not the instrumentality of government to amend the regulation and further limit the right of abutting property owners to the use of such public space.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">The proviso was inserted in the regulation to preserve and protect the occupants of property abutting public space in the right of ingress and egress. Deprivation of such rights not only could seriously affect the established business of an occupant, but would materially affect the value of the property itself. The regulation recognized such practical consideration and, in my opinion, intended the use of the public space as the appellant used it. I feel the judgment of the lower court should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
