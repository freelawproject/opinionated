McCracken, Philadelphia sales manager for the appellant company, \u201cin very much the experimental stage. We speak of it as Centralloy and we want it t0 be known as Centralloy. Eventually we would expect our customers to put \u2018Central-l\u00b0y\u2019 on their orders without any particular specification, with the understanding, of course, that we would know their requirements.\u201d It further appears from the record that the word \u201cCentral\u201d has been a part of appellant\u2019s corporate name for many years; that appellant has used several trade-marks for its steel products, each \u00b0f which has included the word \u201cCentral,\u201d such as&gt; \u201cCentral Knobby Floor Plates,\u201d \u201cCentral Knobbyette,\u201d \u201cCentral All Way Gri \u201e \u00abCentral Highway Guards,\u201d' and \u00abCentral Lawn Ed ; \u00bb. tilat appelIanfs ducts are a] sold as \u00abCcntral\u201d products; and that, according to appellant's witness Irvi M. Smith as the Uant desired tQ \u00ab tuate the Word &lt;Central, and t0 derive a name which would identif a product as that of Central Iron and Steel Company\u201d the word \u00abCentralloy\u201d was chosen by its president after a conference of company officials.</p>\n<p id=\"AvZn\">It appears from the evidence introduced by appellee that on August 26, 1926, the name of the United Alloy Steel Corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>was changed to Central Alloy Steel Corporation; that, thereafter, by a merger agreement which became effective on April 8, 1930, the Central Alloy Steel Corporation became a part of the Republic Steel Corporation, the appellee; that, since the merger, alloy steel products produced in the plants of the former Central Alloy Steel Corporation have been advertised as the products of the Central Alloy Division of the Republic Steel Corporation; that ap-pellee has expended large sums of money in advertising its alloy steel produced by its Central Alloy Division; that some of its advertisements, of which appellee\u2019s Exhibit No. 2 is illustrative, were signed \u201cCentral Alloy Division, Republic Steel Corporation, Massillon, Ohio,\u201d and others, of which ap-pellee\u2019s Exhibit No. 3 is illustrative, were signed \u201cRepublic Steel Corporation, General Offices, Youngstown, Ohio, Central Alloy Division, Massillon, Ohio,\u201d and, in addition, each of those advertisements bore one or more of appellee\u2019s trade-marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">It appears from the record that the Canton-Massillon District of the Republic Steel Corporation is known as the \u201cCentral Alloy District\u201d; that prior to the merger (April 8, 1930) the Central Alloy Steel Corporation\u2019s products were stamped (ap-pellee\u2019s Exhibit No. <em>7) </em>to indicate \u201cthe type and grade of stainless steel or alloy\u201d; that the stamp also bore the notation \u201cCentral Alloy Steel Corporation, Massil-lon, Ohio, U. S. A.\u201d; that since the merger appellee\u2019s alloy sheet steel produced by its Central Alloy Division has been stamped as follows: All unpolished sheets shipped from the Massillon District bore oval-shaped stamps (appellee\u2019s Exhibit No. 8) on which appeared the notation \u201cRepublic Steel Corporation, Enduro, Stainless Steel, Heat, Type 18-8-41, Central Alloy District, Massillon, Ohio\u201d (in the event stamps were objectionable for any reason, small stickers bearing the same notation \u2014 appellee\u2019s Exhibit No. 11 \u2014 were used) ; all sheets polished on one or. both sides, shipped from the Canton Works, were shipped in crates and a shipping tag (appellee\u2019s Exhibit No. 9), indicating that the steel was from the Republic Steel Corporation, Central Alloy District, Canton Works, Canton, Ohio, was attached to each crate. In addition to the shipping tag, a tag (appellee\u2019s Exhibit No. 10) bearing the trade-mark \u201cEnduro\u201d and the notation \u201cRepublic Steel Corporation, perfected stainless steels, Central Alloy District, Massillon, Ohio\u201d was also attached to each crate. Metal tags bearing the notation \u201cfrom Republic Steel Corporation, Central Alloy Dist. Massillon, Ohio\u201d (appellee\u2019s Exhibit No. 12) were used on \u201cround stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Appellee sells its alloy steel to manufacturers and jobbers. The jobbers, in turn, sell to manufacturers and building contractors in comparatively small quantities. Utensils and other articles manufactured by others from appellee\u2019s stainless alloy steel are sold to hardware stores and other retail stores. Although those articles oftimes bear appellee\u2019s mark \u201cEnduro,\u201d they do not bear the notation \u201cRepublic Steel Corporation, Central Alloy District.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">The Examiner of Interferences dismissed the notice of opposition holding that appellee\u2019s use of the notations \u201cCentral Alloy Division\u201d and \u201cCentral Alloy District\u201d was not a trade-mark use; that ap-pellee, therefore, was not the owner of those notations, and, for that reason, was not entitled to oppose the registration of appellant\u2019s mark. The examiner also held that the term \u201cCentral Alloy District\u201d was not used for the purpose of indicating origin in appellee, but merely to indicate that the alloy steel on which -it was used was manufactured in certain of appellee\u2019s mills.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">In reversing the decision of the Examiner of Interferences and sustaining the notice of opposition, the Commissioner of Patents stated that it was not necessary that appellee be the owner of the term \u201cCentral Alloy\u201d in order to oppose registration of appellant\u2019s mark, and that \u201cIn the instant case it sufficiently appears that the expressions \u2018Central Alloy Division\u2019 and \u2018Central Alloy District\u2019 have come to identify as that of opposer the merchandise to which they are applied in advertising and on the tags or labels attached to the goods. While I agree with the examiner of interferences that such use by opposer of the words \u2018Central Alloy\u2019 has been in no sense a trade-mark use, I cannot escape the conviction that registration to a competitor of these words or their equivalent would result in confusion, and that opposer would probably suffer damage. Upon the record before me, the likelihood seems apparent that a large proportion of prospective purchasers, seeing the trade-mark \u2018Centralloy\u2019 applied to alloy steel products, would assume that such products originated with opposer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>The right to oppose the registration of a trade-mark does not depend upon the exclusive ownership by an opposer of a similar mark. Virginia Dare Extract Co. Inc. v. Adah Mae Dare, 70 F.2d 118, 21 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1086. It is sufficient if an opposer establishes \u201cPriority of use analogous to a trade-mark use of a\u201d trade-name and the \u201clikelihood of damage to him by the registration of such mark to another.\u201d John Wood Manufacturing Co. v. Servel, Inc., 77 F.2d 946, 949, 22 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1370, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">It appears from the record that ap-pellee has spent large sums of money advertising its \u201cCentral Alloy Division\u201d; that it applies the notation \u201cCentral Alloy District\u201d to the goods produced by its \u201cCentral Alloy Division\u201d; that its \u201cCentral Alloy District\u201d comprises the cities of Canton and Massillon, Ohio; and that appellee\u2019s \u201cCentral Alloy Division\u201d or \u201cCentral Alloy District\u201d is \u201cinvariably\u201d referred to in Canton and Massillon as \u201cCentral Alloy\u201d rather than as \u201cRepublic\u201d or \u201cRepublic Steel Corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">In view of the fact that appellee\u2019s name \u201cRepublic Steel Corporation\u201d appears in each of the advertisements and on each of the stamps and shipping tags applied to its alloy steel, it is apparent that appellee did not rely entirely on either its trade-marks or the notations \u201cCentral Alloy Division\u201d and \u201cCentral Alloy District\u201d to indicate origin of its alloy steel. It is equally apparent, however, that, so far as origin is concerned, it relied as much on the notations \u201cCentral Alloy Division\u201d and \u201cCentral Alloy District\u201d as it did on its trademarks, and that both the notations and the trade-marks served to identify appellee\u2019s alloy steel in the mind of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">It is argued by counsel for appellant that the only purpose served by the notations \u201cCentral Alloy District\u201d and \u201cCentral Alloy Division\u201d was to indicate to the purchasing public the place where the Republic Steel Corporation\u2019s alloy steel was produced. We think, however, that appellee\u2019s use of the term \u201cCentral Alloy\u201d in its notations \u201cCentral Alloy Division\u201d and \u201cCentral Alloy District\u201d is entitled to greater significance than that given it by counsel for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Taking into consideration the fact that the term \u201cCentral Alloy\u201d has been extensively advertised to indicate a division or part of the appellee corporation, and the fact that that term together with the word \u201cDistrict\u201d has been applied to the alloy steel manufactured and sold by appellee\u2019s Central Alloy Division, we are of opinion that the term \u201cCentral Alloy\u201d indicated to the purchasing public not only the place where appellee\u2019s alloy steel was produced, but also that the alloy steel produced by the Central Alloy Division in the Central Alloy District was appellee\u2019s product.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Although the terms \u201cCentral Alloy Division\u201d and \u201cCentral Alloy District\u201d were not used by appellee as technical trade-marks, they served to indicate origin in appellee. The words \u201cCentral Alloy\u201d are the dominating feature of those terms. The use of such terms was, therefore, analogous to that of a trade-mark. Accordingly, appellee having established priority of use, the only remaining question to be determined is whether it is likely to be damaged by the registration of appellant\u2019s mark \u201cCentralloy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">Appellant\u2019s mark \u201cCentralloy\u201d is a combination of the words \u201ccentral\u201d and \u201calloy\u201d with the letters \u201ca\u201d and \u201c1\u201d deleted. When written, it closely resembles the term \u201cCentral Alloy.\u201d When spoken, it sounds like \u201cCentral Alloy.\u201d Tt was intended by appellant to mean \u201cCentral Alloy,\u201d and to identify alloy steel produced by the Central Iron &amp; Steel Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">We are of opinion that the terms \u201cCentralloy\u201d and \u201cCentral Alloy\u201d are confusingly similar; that appellee is entitled to use the terms \u201cCentral Alloy District\u201d and \u201cCentral Alloy Division\u201d in connection with the marketing of its alloy steel; and that appellee would be damaged by the registration of the mark \u201cCentralloy\u201d to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
