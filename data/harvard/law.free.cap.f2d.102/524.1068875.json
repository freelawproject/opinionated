Section 24a, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 47(a), requires leave only in case the order \u201cinvolves less than $500\u201d, and if it governs this appeal, no leave was therefore necessary, for the appellant asked more than $500. However, appeals from allowances are directly governed by \u00a7 250, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 650, which provides that \u201cappeals may be taken in matters of law or fact\u201d from such orders, \u201cand may, in the manner and within the time provided for appeals by this Act [title], be taken to and allowed by the circuit court of appeals\u201d. This language necessarily incorporates the provisions of \u00a7 24a as to the \u201cmanner\u201d of taking an appeal, which need not be \u201callowed\u201d by us, but lies as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">This would be enough if the reorganization proceeding itself had been started after September 22, 1938, when the amendments took effect. In fact it had then been pending more than three months. Section 276(c) (2), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 676(c) (2), makes the provisions of Chapter 10 (including \u00a7 250 applicable to such reorganization proceedings) \u201cto the extent that the judge shall deem their application practicable\u201d; and \u201cjudge\u201d means only a \u201cjudge of a court of bankruptcy\u201d, \u00a7 1(20), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1(20). Two alternatives are open: the judge may \u201cdeem\u201d application of the provisions of Chapter 10 \u201cpracticable\u201d or \u201cimpracticable\u201d as a whole; or he may deal with them singly, the application of this one being \u201cpracticable\u201d, and of that, not. Plainly the second is the right interpretation, since the \u201cpracticability\u201d of applying a provision depends upon what it requires: it would generally be impossible to say that all were, or all were not, \u201cpractically\u201d applicable. If the judge is to act upon the provisions singly, it would be quite impermissible for him to declare when it was practicable to apply \u00a7 250, which relates to appeals to this court: \u00a7 276(c) (2) cannot cover appeals. We therefore turn to \u00a7 6(b) of the Chandler Act itself, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1 note, which declares to what proceedings the amendments as a whole are applicable. That indeed is in substantially the same terms as \u00a7 276(c) (2), except that the determination is now ours, not the bankruptcy court\u2019s. Obviously, it is entirely \u201cpracticable\u201d that \u00a7 24a shall determine the \u201cmanner\u201d of taking appeals. Hence we hold that no leave was necessary, the appeal being of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">Leave denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
