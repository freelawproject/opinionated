In underground pipe _ and valve equipment of the kind comprising a buried valve and narrow access tube, the latter having a cover at the ground surface and leading therefrom to said valve and being wholly independent of and unattached to said valve and of such dimensions as to preclude personal entry, the spindle of said valve having a head of angular cross section, disposed at the lower end of said access tube in a position to receive a valve key guided thereto by said tube, the combination of a gland-tightening nut for said spindle concentrically mounted on the valve and wholly disposed within and at the lower end of said access tube, one or more radial lugs on the nut extending horizontally outward therefrom beyond the limits of the spindle head and within the projected cross-area of the narrowest part of said tube and in line with the annular space between .-said tube and spindle head, so that a flange-[gland-] tightening tool inserted through said space, will be guided by the tube and the spindle head into engagement therewith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJT\">The references relied upon are: Van Kannel; 97,835, Dec. 14, 1869; Finch (Br.), n,241, Apr. 30, 1898; O\u2019Brien, 694,298, Feb. 25, 1902; Hine, 1,120,144, Dec. 8, 1914; Le-Due, 1,890,618, Dec. 13, 1932.</p>\n<p id=\"AWtf\">Appellant\u2019s application discloses an underground valve and a valve spindle head having a squared or angular cross-section over which a valve key may be fitted for the purpose of opening or closing the valve, and a gland or stuffing box having a gland-tightening nut \u201cwider than the spindle head, or if not wider, is formed with radial !^s+ % 1 % Tf\" \u00b0f tke, hfad valve spindle head (admittedly old) and the gland- .. , . . ) <em>J , </em>tightening nut are so arranged that a gland-tightening tool may be passed over the Spin(]ie head and into engagement with th&lt; giand.tightening nut for the purpose, of loosening or tightening the gland. Appellant\u2019s device is provided with an access tube which leads from the surface of the ground to the valve. The access tube and the spindle head serve to , guide the gland-lightening tool into its operative position The Yalve kf7 and\u25a0the gland-tightening tool are manipulated from the surface of the flr0un&lt;1-</p>\n<p id=\"A36\">Appellant claims that prior to his invention the sole function of an access tube was to permit the use of a so-called \u201cshut- \u00b0\u00ae ^ol\u201d 5 that, if a leak occurred because of shrinkage of the packing, it could be remedied onl \u00abb digging down t0 the valye\u201e and that such an 5eration was ex_ \u25a0 ^</p>\n<p id=\"A8C\">Although it was old m the art as dis-cl\u00b0sed <em>\u2122 </em>tbe Patents to O\u2019Brien, Van Kannel\u2019 and ^ Br1ltlsh Patent t0 t0 lntr\u00b0duce tools through access tubes from the surface of the ground for the purpose of opening and closing underground valves, tkere 18 nothmg 111 those Patenis to indicate tkat tke. Pintees had in mind an arrangement whereby the Packing gland could be tiglxteMd from the surface of the ground,</p>\n<p id=\"auz-dedup-1\">The patent to LeDuc discloses an underground valve of the same general type as that disclosed by appellant. The patentee also discloses an access tube through which a valve key <em>could </em>be inserted for the purpose of opening and closing the valve from the surface of the ground, although the patent contains no reference to suth a fea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>ture, nor is mention \u2022 made therein of a valve-packing gland or a packing-gland-tightening nut, the patentee being concerned only with an improved housing for the upper end of a \u201cstop valve box.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">With reference to the LeDuc patent, the Primary Examiner stated that \u201cA hexagonal packing gland nut surrounds the valve stem.\u201d The correctness of that statement is challenged by counsel for appellant, who argue that there is nothing in the patent to indicate that the \u201chexagon-shaped part is a gland nut,\u201d and it is urged by counsel that such hexagon-shaped part was probably intended to indicate a cover for the valve body.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The patent to Hine discloses an underground valve with a packing device adjacent the valve body. The patentee states that the packing device' is composed of two parts, \u201cone of which serves as a stuffing box and the other as a gland arranged to enter the stuffing box, the space within the stuffing box being arranged to receive any suitable kind of packing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">The patentee discloses a superstructure built above an underground valve. It 'includes an \u201cadjusting gland\u201d at or near the surface of the ground, which \u201cbears upon the outer end of the stuffing box stem.\u201d The structure is so arranged that the packing gland can either be adjusted from above the ground, or drawn up to the surface of the ground through\u2019 an access tube.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">The Primary Examiner described the Hine patent as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">\u201cThe patent to Hine shows in Fig. 1 a hydrant comprising an underground valve 1 having \u00e1 stem 4 which is actuated by a socket number IS and rod 16 which extends above the ground level. The stem 4 is provided with a compressible packing which is adapted to be adjusted or replaced from above the ground level and without digging up the valve. Such adjustment is accomplished by a tightening or loosening of bolts 13 (see Fig. 3) which causes tubular member 9 and packing gland 8 to increase or decrease the compression of the packing.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">\u201cIn Fig. S'of this patent to Hine is shown a modification in which the value casing terminates substantially flush with the ground surface as in appellant\u2019s device. The valve is actuated by means of a wrench applied to rod 16. However, it should be noted that the rod 16 and socket piece IS together constitute a long-shanked key or wrench which engages -the polygonal upper end of the valve stem 4. <em>In </em>this form of the device the compression of the packing is adjusted from above the ground level and without disturbing the valve in the same manner as in the form above described.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">The patentee Hine undoubtedly recognized the problem confronting the art. However, his structure is so complicated that it would seem to have but little, if any, practical value. But however that may be, it certainly does not suggest the simple and efficient device defined by the appealed claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">In its decision, the Board of Appeals assumed the hexagon-shaped part in the LeDuc patent to be a gland-tightening nut, and stated that, although the patentee\u2019s access tube was not large enough to permit tightening the gland nut from the surface of the ground, it would be obvious to enlarge the access tube so that the hexagon-shaped part would be accessible from the surface of the ground, and to provide the necessary gland-tightening tool. The board made no reference to the Hine patent, other than to say, in substance, that it was old in the art, as shown by that reference, \u201cto provide for the adjustment of a packing gland without excavating the valve.\u201d In concluding its decision, the board said: \u201cAppellant\u2019s proposal is doubtless of considerable practical value to the art and is apparently not anticipated, but we feel that it does not rise to the dignity of invention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">The hexagon-shaped part surrounding the valve stem in the LeDuc patent is neither described nor referred to in the pat-entee\u2019s written specification, nor does it have any reference character in the drawings. The patentee was undoubtedly skilled in the art of underground valves, and familiar with the problems confronting that art. If, as assumed by the tribunals of the Patent Office, the patentee had in mind that the hexagon-shaped part was a packing-gland-tightening nut, it seems strange indeed that he did not recognize that a problem long confronting the art (that of providing a simple and inexpensive device so constructed that the packing gland could be tightened from' the surface of the ground) would be solved by merely enlarging his access tube to accommodate a proper wrench or key.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">\u25a0 \u2019 We are of opinion that the board\u2019s assumption that the patentee had in mind that the hexagon-shaped part was a packing-gland-tightening nut is not warranted by the facts and circumstances appearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>of record, and is, in effect, the building up of the reference structure in the light of appellant\u2019s disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">In our opinion appellant\u2019s device is not suggested by the references of record, is admittedly new and of considerable practical value to the art, and involves invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Accordingly, the decision of the Board of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
