GRADY JOLLY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1247-31\">Walter G. Sills and his wife, Joyce K. Sills, debtors in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, appeal the district court\u2019s affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment in favor of the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) in an adversary proceeding challenging the validity of a tax hen attached to the Sills\u2019 house. The Sills purchased the house with workers\u2019 compensation proceeds from an injury sustained by Walter Sills. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">In 1990, Walter Sills received $180,000 in workers\u2019 compensation proceeds as a result of injuries suffered from a fall while working on an oil platform. The Sills used the proceeds to make several purchases, including a house in Dallas County, Texas. On September 9, 1991, the IRS filed a notice of federal tax lien (\u201cNFTL\u201d) on the Sills\u2019 house in the office of land records of Dallas County, fist-ing the following federal tax and penalty liabilities against Walter Sills:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-6\">Kind of Tax Tax Period Ended Date of Assessment Unpaid Balance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APx\">6672 12/31/83 09/02/85 $ 2,001.06</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVFo\">1040 1040 12/31/80 12/31/81 10/13/86 02/23/87 15,204.31 14,863.23</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqE\">1040 12/31/86 10/13/86 10,312.59</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1248-23\">On September 12, 1991, the Sills filed a petition in bankruptcy for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In January 1992, the case was converted to a proceeding under Chapter 13. The IRS filed an amended proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding asserting a secured claim for the unpaid taxes and the penalty specified in the NFTL, and additional penalties and interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Sills objected to the IRS\u2019 proof of claim and commenced an adversary proceeding challenging the IRS\u2019s lien. The parties filed a stipulation of facts in which the Sills agreed \u201cwith the Income taxes, interest and penalties for 1980,1981,1983.\u201d The Sills contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) the portion of the lien for Walter Sills\u2019 1983 tax year liability was invalid because it erroneously indicated that the liability was for the 1986 tax year and (2) the tax lien was invalid or unenforceable because property pm-chased with workers\u2019 compensation benefits is exempt from levy under I.R.C. \u00a7 6334(a)(7). They also claimed that the IRS was required to release the lien pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6325(a)(1), or discharge the property from the lien pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6325(b)(2)(B), because the lien was invalid or unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-24\">The bankruptcy court ultimately ruled that the Sills were barred from challenging the validity of the portion of the lien for 1983 taxes because of their stipulation concerning income tax liability for 1983. It also ruled that Walter Sills\u2019 interest in the house the Sills purchased with his workers\u2019 compensation proceeds was not exempt from levy under I.R.C. \u00a7 6334(a)(7).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-29\">On appeal, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s holding that the house was not exempt from levy. In a separate opinion issued in response to the Sills\u2019 motion for reconsideration, the district court noted that it had omitted discussion of the Sills\u2019 claim regarding the validity of the tax lien for the 1983 tax liability. The district court ruled that the bankruptcy court committed error when it viewed the Sills\u2019 stipulation on Walter Sills\u2019 1983 tax liability as a stipulation on the validity of that poi-tion of the tax lien. The district court held, however, that the error in the NFTL was a \u201cminor defect in the notice\u201d and thus did not render the tax lien for that year void. The Sills filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-30\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-31\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-32\">We initially address whether that portion of the NFTL covering Walter Sills\u2019 liability for the 1983 tax year constitutes a \u201cproperly filed\u201d notice of a tax lien under section 522(c)(2)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>The district court\u2019s holding that the NFTL constituted a proper filing under \u00a7 522(c) is reviewable <em>de novo. Matter of Walden, </em>12 F.3d 445, 448 (5th Cir.1994). The Sills argue that the NFTL did not constitute a \u201cproperly filed\u201d notice of the Walter Sills\u2019 tax liability stemming from the 1983 tax year because the NFTL incorrectly identified 1986 as the tax year giving rise to the liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">Section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code states that a lien shall not be valid \u201cas against any purchaser, holder of a security interest, mechanic\u2019s lienor, or judgment lien creditor until notice thereof which meets the requirements of subsection (f) has been filed by the Secretary.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6323(a) (1994). Subsection (f) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[t]he form and content of the notice ... shall be prescribed by the Secretary.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6323(f) (1994). The applicable IRS regulation requires that the lien specify: (1) the taxpayer, (2) the tax liability giving rise to the lien, and (3) the date that the assessment arose. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6323(f)-l(d)(2) (1995). Although the NFTL at issue in this case incorrectly identified 1986, instead of 1983, as the tax year of the liability giving rise to the lien, the NFTL was filed in the proper place and correctly identified the taxpayer, the property and its location, the amount owed, and the date of the assessment. We agree with the district court that such a minor defect in the notice is insufficient to render it void. <em>See Richter\u2019s Loan Co. v. United States, </em>235 F.2d 753, 755 (5th Cir.1956); <em>In re Cennamo, </em>147 B.R. 540, 543 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.1992) (\u201cThe purpose of the NFTL is to give constructive notice, and where there is such notice, a minor defect in filing will be overlooked\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">We now consider the validity of the tax lien on the house in the light of the fact that the Internal Revenue Code exempts from levy \u201cany amount payable to an individual as workmen\u2019s compensation.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6334(a)(7) (1994). The Sills\u2019 underlying theory of the case is that, because of the \u00a7 6334(a)(7) exemption from levy, the house has no value to the IRS and, thus, the house meets the criteria for discharge from the lien under I.R.C. \u00a7 6325(b)(2)(B),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or, alternatively, that the underlying tax liability is unenforceable and, thus, the lien meets the criteria for release under I.R.C. \u00a7 6325(a)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Sills argue that the district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment that the exemption from levy under \u00a7 6334(a)(7) does not extend to property purchased for maintenance and support with workers\u2019 compensation proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-11\">We need not determine the reach of the exemption provided by \u00a7 6334(a)(7). <em>See Sojourner T. v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir.1992) (court may affirm judgment on any basis supported by the record), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 972, 113 S.Ct. 1414, 122 L.Ed.2d 785 (1993). As the courts have held in <em>United States v. Barbier, </em>896 F.2d 377 (9th Cir.1990), and <em>Matter of Voelker, </em>42 F.3d 1050 (7th Cir.1994), whether property is exempt from levy is not determinative of the validity or enforceability of a tax lien on property. The court in <em>Barbier </em>explained that a lien \u201cis merely a security interest and does not involve immediate seizure\u201d whereas a levy \u201coperates as a seizure by the IRS.\u201d 896 F.2d at 379. The court further explained, \u201cA Ken enables the taxpayer to maintain possession of protected property while allowing the government to preserve its claim should the status of the property later change.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded, \u201cReading sections 6334 and 6321 together leads to the conclusion that the former section is a limitation on the government\u2019s ability forcibly to seize the taxpayer\u2019s property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>but not a bar to the government\u2019s ability to assert a security interest in such property.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">Even if the Sills\u2019 house were exempt from levy, the tax lien still may be valid and enforceable. For example, the IRS may enforce the hen by foreclosure action under I.R.C. \u00a7 7403; it may seek to have its hen satisfied in proceedings, instituted by third parties, in which the IRS is brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410; or it may exercise redemption rights provided by I.R.C. \u00a7 7425(d) if another party forecloses on the property. The Sills\u2019 arguments that the hen has no value, necessitating discharge of the property under \u00a7 6325(b)(2)(B), or that the underlying tax liability is unenforceable, necessitating release of the hen under \u00a7 6325(a)(1), are thus meritless.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1248-25\">.
