Erom such inspection it appears, and it is undisputed, that the plaintiff was employed to do the work in question by the duly-authorized committee of the defendant city; that the city at that time had an appropriation available for the purpose of $100, and that the plaintiff performed the services, which, under the terms of the employment, were of the value of $75.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The fact, which appears from the state of the case, that other claims amounting to $208.10 had been \u201cfiled with the oily\u201d by other parties for like services, \u201cwhich other claims have not as yet been paid,\u201d fails to show that in fact the city had exceeded ihe appropriation, and constitutes no reason for a reversal of the present judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The judgment under review will bo affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
