The sending of this notice is the alleged libel upon which the present suit is rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>It appeared upon the trial of the cause that the names contained in the list were furnished to the defendant Marsh, who was the president of the board of protectors, by persons in whose truthfulness the board had confidence, and who were acquainted with the habits of the men in that locality, and who represented the men whose names were on the list as being either habitual drunkards or persons who were likely to become drunkards. The board of protectors made no independent investigation of the habits of the plaintiff with relation to the use of intoxicating liquors, but accepted as accurate the statement above referred to which was made to the president.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">It is settled in this state that the members of a public board, acting in the performance of a public duty, and under a public statute, are not personally liable in a civil action for damages arising out of their acts, providing what they do is done in good faith. <em>Valentine </em>v. <em>Englewood, </em>47 <em>Vroom </em>509. The board of protectors of Franklin township is a public board. The duties imposed upon it by the act of April 20th, 1909, are public duties. The action which is made the subject of the present suit was done in the performance of that duty. Consequently, they are not liable to the plaintiff for any injury resulting to him from the notice sent by the board to the saloonkeeper, notwithstanding the fact that he (the plaintiff) was not addicted to the excessive use of intoxicating liquor\u2014 as appeared from the proofs in the cause\u2014unless it appeared that in sending the notice the board did not act in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The statute referred to under which the board was appointed provides no method by which such boards shall pursue their investigations with relation to the cases of drunkenness in the municipalities for which they are respectively appointed. No power is given to,them to subpoena -witnesses, to swear them, or to examine them. This being so it is evident that the board must rely very largely in conducting its investigations upon unsworn statements made to them by third persons. The fact that they rely upon the statement of a single person in whose truthfulness they have confidence, and who appar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>ently speaks of what he knows, without attempting to verify the statement by further inquiry of other parties, affords no ground for concluding that such action is not taken in good faith. This was the view taken by the trial court, and its logical result was the direction of a nonsuit. We think that direction was entirely proper, and, therefore, affirm the judgment under review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
