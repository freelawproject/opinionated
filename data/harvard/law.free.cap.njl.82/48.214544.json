The record of conviction in a proceeding before a police justice in the town of Morristown for the violation of an ordinance must set out sufficient evidence to show that the offence charged in the complaint was committed, in order to constitute a legal conviction.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b86-7\">2. Testimony that \u201cdefendants were in their hacks at places not designated as public hack stands\u201d does not justify a conviction of the defendants of the offence of \u201cstanding with their hacks at a place which had not been designated as a public stand for hacks.\u201d</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-8\">On. <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b86-9\">Before Justices Garrison, Trenchard and Kalisoh.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b86-10\">Bor the prosecutors, <em>Willard W.

Millville, </em>34 <em>Id. </em>123; <em>Elizabeth </em>v. <em>Central Railroad Co., 31 Id. </em>568.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The only evidence set out is that of a witness who testified \u201cthat defendants were in their hacks at places not designated as public hack stands.\u201d That does not tend to show that they were standing with their hacks at a place which had not been designated as a public stand for hacks. If to be \u201cin their hacks at places not designated as public hack stands\u201d justified their conviction, they could never lawfully move from such designated stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The judgment of the mayor and board of aldermen affirming such conviction will be reversed, and the conviction set aside,, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
