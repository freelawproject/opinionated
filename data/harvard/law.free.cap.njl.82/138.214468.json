A byroad is recognized by the Road act. <em>Gen. Stat., p. 2827, </em>\u00a7 113, and also by <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>2836, \u00a7 154. If obstructed, it may be opened by the freeholders, and its course and location altered and changed. It has no statutory origin. It is an obscure road, but is so far a public road that the public have of right free access to it at all times. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Hurd, </em>5 <em>Vroom 87. </em>See, also, <em>Perrine </em>v. <em>Farr, 2 Zab. </em>356; <em>Stearn </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>5 <em>Dutcher </em>68, 509; <em>Yeomans </em>v. <em>Ridgewood, 17 Vroom </em>508.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">The demurrer admits that the road was an \u201cancient byway.\u201d' The term <em>by-way </em>must be taken to be the equivalent of by-road, which is a public way that the plaintiff had a right to use. This seems inferentially to have been the view of this court when the case \"was here on a former occasion <em>(Tarlucki </em>v. <em>West Jersey and. Seashore Railroad. Co., </em>51 <em>Vroom </em>688), for the learned justice who wrote the opinion says: \u201cIf the accident happened while the plaintiff was in the act of crossing the tracks from one side of the transverse by-road or public way to the other, * * * an element of legal duty might thereby be presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>There is added force to be given to the expression by the qualifying adjective ancient, for from it, in connection with the admission arising from the demurrer, there is a presumption that the way originated in a dedication, and so has existed for more than twenty years, sufficient to establish the public right. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Hurd,, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Being, therefore, a public way, no invitation by the railroad company to use it was necessary to be proved, for the public were entitled to make use of it, as of right, and the railroad company was under a duty not to subject the traveling public so using the public way to latent. dangers. <em>Van Winkle </em>v. <em>American Steam Boiler Co., 23 Vroom </em>240; <em>Weller </em>v. <em>McCormick, Id. </em>470; <em>Schutte </em>v. <em>United Electric Co., </em>39 <em>Id. </em>438; <em>Guinn </em>v. <em>Delaware and Atlantic Telephone Co., </em>43 <em>Id. </em>277; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Benton, </em>45 <em>Id. </em>533.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The demurrer will be overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
