The plaintiff now presents an amended declaration, drawn' as we conceive to overcome the deficiencies which made the former declaration legally objectionable. Our perusal cff the declaration leads us to conclude that he has succeeded in so doing. He has alleged the execution of a valid contract between the parties; performance by the plaintiff and the constituted agent of the parties of all the necessary conditions to be per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>formed upon their part, and the refusal of the defendants to carry out their part of the contract or to attempt to perform it.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">This <em>status, </em>under the well-recognized rules of pleading, presents a legal cause of action, and calls for a plea upon the merits by the defendants. Practice act, section 126. <em>Sibbald v</em>. <em>Bethlehem Iron Co., </em>83 <em>N. Y. </em>378.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Tidd succinctly states the legal principle applicable to this case: \u201c'Wherever a man by doing a previous act would acquire a right to any debt or duty, by a tender to do the previous act, if the other party refuse to permit him to do it, he acquires the right as completely as if it had been actually done; and if the tender be defective owing to the conduct of the other party, such incomplete tender will be sufficient, because it is a general principle that he who prevents a thing from being done shall not avail himself of the non-performance which he has occasioned.\u201d 2 <em>Tidd </em>429.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The declaration before us presents that legal <em>status, </em>and the plaintiff therefore is entitled to judgment on the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
