The views of the Supreme Court are expressed in the following memorandum:</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b772-7\">\u201cPee Cubiam.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b772-8\">\u201cWhile engaged at his work in defendant\u2019s employment, the plaintiff was injured by the breaking of a shackle attached to the end of a boom on a derrick which was then being used for raising heavy iron girders. The shackle broke while lifting a fourteen-ton girder, and injured plaintiff, and the insistence of the plaintiff is that the shackle was too light for the work, in that it was a one and one-quarter inch shackle instead of a one and one-half inch shackle, which prudence and the exercise of reasonable care would require defendant to use.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b772-9\">\u201cThere was evidence sufficient to support this claim, and the resulting corollary that it was inadequate for the use to which defendant put it, and this situation furnished a jury question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b772-10\">\u201cThe verdict was for the plaintiff, and a rule to show cause was allowed, reserving only the exception taken to the refusal of the trial court to direct a verdict for defendant, which is the only question which this court can consider on error. <em>Haden </em>v. <em>Bamford Silk Co., </em>44 <em>Vroom </em>308; <em>affirmed, </em>45 <em>Id. </em>847.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b772-11\">\u201cSince the evidence presented by the plaintiff created an issue of fact for the jury to determine, the refusal of the trial court to direct a verdict was entirely proper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b772-12\">\u201cThe judgment will be affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>For the plaintiff in error, <em>John A.
