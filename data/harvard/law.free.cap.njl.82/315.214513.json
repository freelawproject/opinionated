But two matters are urged for reversal, one of which is directed against the admission of certain testimony, and the other rests upon an objection to the charge of the trial court. The case made by the state against the defendant shows that two boys, Edward M. Knight and William Mahon, admitted stealing from the Lehigh Yalley Railroad Company some copper wire, and that they sold it to the defendant. On the trial a police officer by the name of Miller testified that he and another officer named Autobato took the boy Knight to the residence of the defendant, and he was then asked, <em>\u201cQ. </em>State what the boy said and what the defendant said. <em>A. </em>Autobato asked the boy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>in English, \u2018Is this the man you sold the wire to?\u2019 and he said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 <em>Q. </em>Was this in the presence of the defendant? <em>A. </em>Yes. <em>Q. </em>What did D\u2019Adame say, if anything, at that time? <em>A. </em>A\u2019Dame said it wasn\u2019t him; the boy said, \u2018Yes, I have been here before.\u2019 \u201d Counsel for the defendant then moved to strike out the answer, \u201con the ground that it is hearsay, and secondly, on the ground that it is an impeachment of the state\u2019s witness.\u201d The court denied the motion to strike out to which defendant\u2019s counsel excepted and the exception was sealed. No objection was made when the question was asked and it was not error to refuse to strike out the answer on the grounds assigned after the defendant had waited until he heard what it was. It is a clear case of speculating upon the reply a witness may make to a question. This is the only exception taken to the admission or refusal to admit testimony which was argued, and there is no error in this.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The only other matter argued is that the court committed an error in charging the jury as follows: \u201cGuilty knowledge may be found by the jury where the defendant receives the goods under such circumstances as would satisfy a man of ordinary intelligence and caution that they were stolen.\u201d This excerpt from the charge is the precise language used by the court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>36 <em>Vroom </em>394, and the correctness of the principle does not appear to be seriously questioned by the plaintiff in error in this ease, but the argument in support of this exception is based upon the statement that the case \u201cwas almost entirely barren of proof of any circumstances from which guilty knowledge may.be inferred,\u201d and however effective it might be upon a rule to show cause or other proceeding assailing the verdict, it cannot be considered in dealing with a writ of error, there being some evidence from which the jury might infer that the defendant received the goods under such circumstances as should have satisfied a man of ordinary intelligence and caution that they were stolen. In most cases of receiving stolen goods direct proof of guilty knowledge is difficult to produce, and therefore the offence must be, in nearly every case, established by circumstances, \u201cand the rule is that in order to be effective as proof of guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>knowledge the circumstances must be at least such as would satisfy a man of ordinary intelligence and caution that the goods were stolen.\u201d <em>State v. Simon, </em>41 <em>Id. </em>407.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">We find no error in the record in the matters relied upon and presented at the argument, and therefore the judgment below should he affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
