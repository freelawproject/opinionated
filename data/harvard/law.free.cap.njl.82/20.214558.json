L. </em>1898, <em>p. </em>959) means what the prosecutor contends that it does, the irregularity was an error that affected the specific jurisdiction of the police justice (see <em>Attorney-General </em>v. <em>Sooy Oyster </em>Co., 49 <em>Vroom </em>394), and hence the point should have been taken in the proceedings below. It was not, although the prosecutor was present during the trial. As it is, for all that appears, the adjournments were granted to the piosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number><em>Second. </em>The order that the prosecutor pay \u201cthe sum of $10 for costs and expenses of the confinement,\u201d is justified by the statute in which \u201ccosts\u201d means not the costs of the action but the costs of sustenance during confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\"><em>Third. </em>The death of the overseer of the poor by whom the action was commenced did not canse it to abate; it was brought not in a personal but in an official capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\"><em>Fourth. </em>Assuming that the orders originally returned were defective in that they did not set forth the evidence on which the conviction rested, the defect was cured by the further return made by the police justice in response to a rule upon him obtained in accordance with the practice sanctioned by this court in <em>Rahway </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>45 <em>Vroom </em>116, and <em>Eckerson </em>v. <em>Mitchell, Id. </em>347.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The proceedings' of the police justice are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
