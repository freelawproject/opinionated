The suit resulted in a judgment against the defendant. Railing to pay the damages and coats awarded against him execution was issued and returned <em>non esl inventus. </em>The present suit was thereupon brought against Pankuch, who was surety in the recognizance, and resulted in a judgment against him. To review that judgment he has sued out the present writ of error.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b788-11\">\u201cThe only assignment argued before us rests upon the refusal to nonsuit. The ground upon which the nonsuit was asked -was that the recognizance in suit is void because it does not comply in all respects with the provision of the sixty-ninth section of our Practice act. That section declares that \u201cthe recognizance shall be to the effect following,\u201d and then sets out the form of the instrument. That form concludes with the condition that if the defendant shall be condemned at the suit of the plaintiff he shall pay the costs and the condemnation of the court or render himself into the custody of the sheriff, or if he fails to do so that the surety will pay the costs and condemnation for him or render him into the custody of the sheriff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b788-12\">\u201cThe recognizance now in suit varies from the form prescribed by the statute in this respect, viz.: Instead of provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>ing that the surety shall render his principal into the custody of the sheriff it provides that he will render himself into such custody. The theory of the plaintiff is and the specific ground upon which the motion to nonsuit was rested was, that the injection into the instrument of a condition not specified in the statute operates to avoid the recognizance. We do not think it has this effect. Conditions in a recognizance not prescribed by the statute should be treated as surplusage. 34 <em>Cyc. </em>544.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b789-5\">\u201cThe recognizance fails to meet the requirement of the statute in another respect\u2014that is, it has no provision that the surety will surrender his principal in case of the latter\u2019s default and in case the surety fails to pay the costs and condemnation for his principal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b789-6\">\u201cBut this was not specified as a ground for the motion to nonsuit, and a reversal, therefore, cannot be had for this reason. <em>n</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b789-7\">\u201cThe judgment under review will be affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b789-8\">For the plaintiff in error, <em>William B.
