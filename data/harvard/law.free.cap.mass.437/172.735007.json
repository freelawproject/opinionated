L. c. 29, \u00a7 9C, to reduce allotments for certain expenditures appropriated in the fiscal year 2002 budget for smoking prevention and for cancer and multiple sclerosis detection and treatment initiatives. See St. 2001, c. 177, \u00a7 2, line items 4590-0300, 4590-0250, 4513-1115, 4513-1112, 4000-0875. The plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment stating that the reductions were an improper exercise of the Governor\u2019s authority under G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 9C, or, in the alternative, that G.

The State subsequently experienced a decline in revenues, well beyond expectations, and, on February 5, 2002, the acting Commissioner of Administration (commissioner) informed the Governor that available revenues for fiscal year 2002 would be insufficient to meet authorized expenditures. The projected shortfall was $289 million. Relying on information and recommendatians of the fiscal affairs division,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the commissioner proposed specific cuts in allotments for specified line-item accounts in the budget, to be made pursuant to the Governor\u2019s authority under G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 9C, amounting to a total expenditure reduction of $155 million.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-17\">General Laws c. 29, \u00a7 9C, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-18\">\u201cWhenever, in the opinion of the commissioner of administration, available revenues as determined by him from time to time during any fiscal year under the provisions of (\u00a7 5B<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] will be insufficient to meet all of the expenditures authorized to be made from any fund, whether by appropriation or distribution, he shall immediately notify the governor and the house and senate committees on ways and means of the amount of such probable deficiency of revenue and the governor, within fifteen days of such notification, shall reduce allotments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>under [\u00a7 9B<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] or he shall submit to the general court specific proposals to raise additional revenues by a total amount equal to such deficiency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">\u201cAs an alternative to the submission of such proposals to raise additional revenues and to the extent funds are available, the governor may recommend an appropriation equal to such deficiency from the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund in the manner provided in [\u00a7 2H<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The Governor responded to the projected budget deficit by directing the commissioner to implement the recommended al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>lotment reductions. These reductions affected, among other expenditures, monies that had been appropriated by the Legislature for local health programs dedicated to smoking prevention and cessation, multiple sclerosis services, prostate cancer prevention, and cervical and breast cancer treatment. See St. 2001, c. 177, \u00a7 2. The plaintiffs challenge, specifically, allotment reductions made by the Governor for expenditures for the following line items: (1) line item 4590-0300: smoking prevention and cessation ($50,342,217 appropriated, $5,962,870 reduction); (2) line item 4590-0250: smoking prevention expansion ($37,867,379 appropriated, $10,642,410 reduction); (3) line item 4513-1115: multiple sclerosis programs ($438,700 appropriated, $340,000 reduction); (4) line item 4513-1112: prostate cancer prevention ($3,500,000 appropriated, $2,603,444 reduction); and (5) line item 4000-0875: cervical and breast cancer expansion ($2,824,522 appropriated, $2,824,552 reduction).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">1. We consider first the defendants\u2019 claim that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring this action. Eight of the plaintiffs are organizations that sponsor, support, or administer tobacco control programs and other cancer-related health initiatives. Several had extended contracts with the Department of Public Health to receive funding for these programs in fiscal year 2002. The record indicates that, as a direct result of the \u00a7 9C allotment reductions, they have not received promised funding and have been forced to scale back, or eliminate, their programs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Two plaintiffs, the New England Division of the American Cancer Society and the Massachusetts Association of Health Boards, have member organizations that have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>similarly affected. See <em>Animal Legal Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fisheries &amp; Wildlife Bd., </em>416 Mass. 635, 638 n.4 (1993) (recognizing associational standing when members would have standing in own right).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Each of the plaintiff organizations has been \u201cdirectly and specially\u201d affected by the Governor\u2019s action. <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>The Governor, </em>407 Mass. 377, 384 n.10 (1990). Moreover, because the underlying contracts are (presumably) still in existence, we can infer that, should the monies represented by the \u00a7 9C allotment reductions at issue be forthcoming, the promised funding to the plaintiff organizations would be restored.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiffs thus have established not only harm that is fairly traceable to the challenged allotment reductions, but a likely benefit should the contested point be resolved in their favor. That is enough to confer standing in these circumstances. See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin., </em>413 Mass. 330, 333 n.7 (1992) (organizations that stand to benefit from increased expenditures have standing to challenge improper transfer from Highway Fund); <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin., </em>411 Mass. 822, 824-825 (1992) (allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>organizations committed to assisting homeless to challenge refusal to release funds appropriated by the Legislature). Cf. <em>Alliance, AFSCME/SEIU, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>The </em>Governor, 427 Mass. 546, 549-550 (1998) (plaintiff unions lacked standing to bring action for mandamus, where no showing that members would be hired, should challenged veto be declared invalid).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">2. The plaintiffs maintain that the Governor\u2019s allotment reductions were improper uses of her statutory authority under G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 9C. Their claim is premised on the language of the statute, which directs the commissioner to notify the Governor when \u201cavailable revenues . . . will be insufficient to meet all of the expenditures authorized to be made from any fund.\u201d The plaintiffs argue that \u201cany fund\u201d means \u201cany [one] fund,\u201d and the Governor\u2019s authority under \u00a7 9C thus extends only to \u201creducing] allotments\u201d which are derived from that particular fund. Because the challenged allotment reductions were derived from three funds \u2014 the Health Protection Fund, see G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 2GG, the Tobacco Settlement Fund, see G. L. c. 29, 2XX, and the General Fund, see G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 2 \u2014 that were neither in deficit at the time of the reductions, nor projected to be in deficit by the end of the fiscal year, the plaintiffs assert that the Governor\u2019s authority under \u00a7 9C to reduce those allotments was not triggered. Accordingly, the plaintiffs urge this court to restore funding for the various health-related initiatives and programs represented by the line items in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The defendants respond that the Governor\u2019s authority under \u00a7 9C is triggered not whenever a deficit is projected for any particular fund, but solely when an over-all budget shortfall is projected for the fiscal year.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Once triggered, however, the statute permits selective reductions of allocations for expenditures from all funds made available to State agencies, to the extent of the projected over-all budget deficit. In support of their position, the defendants argue that common usage dictates that the words \u201cany fund\u201d be read to mean \u201cevery fund.\u201d According to the defendants, this interpretation allows \u00a7 9C to work in harmony with related statutes and to reflect the practical reality of how State finances operate. Thus, in the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>view, the Governor was authorized, under \u00a7 9C, to make \u201cdifficult spending reductions\u201d in the fiscal year 2002 budget, including those for the challenged line items, to compensate for the projected budget shortfall of $289 million. We are persuaded that this position is the better reasoned of the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Aside from the ambiguous reference to \u201cany fund,\u201d the language of the statute is specific and direct: the commissioner \u201cshall immediately notify the governor and the house and senate committees on ways and means\u201d of a probable deficiency and, within fifteen days of such notification, the Governor must take one of three actions. She may either (1) \u201creduce allotments under [\u00a7 9B]\u201d; (2) \u201csubmit to the general court specific proposals to raise additional revenues\u201d; or (3) \u201crecommend an appropriation . . . from the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The above mandates are set in motion whenever \u201cavailable revenues as determined by [the commissioner] . . . under the provisions of [\u00a7 5B]\u201d are projected to be insufficient to meet \u201call of the expenditures to be made from any fund.\u201d Section 5B, in turn, speaks of \u201ctotal available revenues.\u201d The statute does not require the commissioner to determine available revenue on a fund-by-fund basis.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See note 8, <em>supra. </em>Further, the number of available sources for revenue is far smaller than the over one hundred funds in existence. Although revised estimates of total available revenues under \u00a7 5B would indicate whether sufficient revenues were forthcoming to meet the authorized expenditures to be made from all funds, they simply would not generate a workable comparison with authorized expenditures to be made from any one fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Reporting requirements found elsewhere in the statutory scheme also appear to speak unambiguously of a single deficiency to be reported under \u00a7 9C. See G. L. c. 29, \u00a7\u00a7 9D &amp; 9E. Wh\u00e9n \u201cany officer\u201d anticipates that Federal, or other, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>funding will be less than previously estimated, \u00a7 9D directs the commissioner to \u201cinclude such decrease in the deficiency, if any, reported under [\u00a7 9C].\u201d Similarly, when it appears to \u201cany officer having charge of any office, department or undertaking that any appropriation therefor will be insufficient to meet all of the expenditures required in the current fiscal year by any provision of law, rule, regulation or order not subject to his control,\u201d \u00a7 9E directs that such amount be added, by the commissioner, to \u201cany deficiency reported under [\u00a7 9C].\u201d The Legislature could only have intended that these statutes, enacted together in 1976 (St. 1976, c. 283, \u00a7 3F), work together as a \u201charmonious whole,\u201d consistent with the settled axiom that \u201cwhere two or more statutes relate to the same subject matter, they should be construed together so as to constitute a harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513-514 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Our conclusion is also supported by general principles under which our State finance system operates. The Commonwealth accounts for its finances through a system of \u201cfunds.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In addition to three major funds (the General Fund, the Local Aid Fund, and the Highway Fund), there are over one hundred minor funds that have been established by statutes, which generally specify a particular revenue source that is to be credited to the fund and particular objectives for which the credited revenues may be used.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At the end of each fiscal year, the comptroller certifies how all types of funds were used and provides a report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>that, for accounting purposes, associates monies appropriated and expenditures made from each fund. See G. L. c. 7A, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">As a matter of cash management and flow, however, the Commonwealth maintains its cash resources in pooled accounts entirely disassociated with any particular fund. See G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 23. This system assumes that sufficient funds will exist in the State treasury to cover each allotment made by the Governor pursuant to \u00a7 9B. From an accounting standpoint, some funds are routinely in a deficit condition; other funds may vary from having positive to negative balances throughout the year.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Still other funds may begin the fiscal year with a negative balance, but the Legislature continues to designate line items in the budget to be further funded from them. So long as the total revenues are adequate to meet expenditures expected to be charged to every fund, a deficiency in any particular fund does not present a fiscal shortfall or crisis situation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As stated by the commissioner in her affidavit, \u201c[t]he [S]tate\u2019s overall fiscal health is judged on the net balance of all its funds, not on the balance of any one fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">If the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 9C is correct, a projected deficit in any fund, even the most minor, could require the Governor\u2019s immediate response, in the form of acting to reduce allotments under \u00a7 9B; submitting to the Legislature proposals to raise taxes; or recommending to the Legislature an appropriation from the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund equal to the deficiency. The Legislature could not have intended the occurrence of what is, apparently, an ordinary event from an account<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ing standpoint, to be a catalyst for such drastic action.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (The plaintiffs even seem to concede that \u00a7 9C, as interpreted by them, would be of little practical utility in the absence of an over-all budget deficit.) Historically, \u00a7 9C has been implemented only when severe reductions in State revenues have threatened the fiscal stability of the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We conclude that the Governor\u2019s authority under G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 9C, applies only in circumstances when the total available revenues during a fiscal year will be insufficient to meet all of the State\u2019s authorized expenditures. See <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>The Governor, supra </em>at 380.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Because \u00a7 9C allows the Governor, on notification of such a projected deficiency, to \u201creduce allotments under [\u00a7 9B],\u201d and contains no restriction as to which allotments,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the specific reductions challenged by the plaintiffs were permissible under \u00a7 9C.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">3. We turn now to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the above construc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>tian of G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 9C, renders the statute unconstitutional. The plaintiffs assert that the appropriation process is the primary vehicle through which \u201cthe Legislature exercises its lawmaking power to accomplish social purposes.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>375 Mass. 827, 832 (1978). They argue, in essence, that our conclusions stated above impermissibly vest in the Governor plenary power to effectively \u201creallocate over [sixty per cent]<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> of the budget as she sees fit,\u201d and \u201cto eliminate entirely programs and services for which the Legislature made explicit provision through the appropriation process.\u201d The plaintiffs assert that \u00a7 9C thus constitutes an unlawful delegation of the Legislature\u2019s authority to appropriate funds in violation of art. 30. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AFs\">We have defined the power of appropriation as the authority \u201cto set apart from the public revenue a certain sum of money for a specified object, in such manner that the executive officers of the government are authorized to use that money, and no more, for that object and for no other.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>323 Mass. 764, 766 (1948), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>50 Neb. 88, 96 (1896). It is beyond question that \u201c[t]he power to appropriate money of the Commonwealth is a legislative power. Under the Constitution it can be exercised only by the General Court and in the particular manner prescribed.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>302 Mass. 605, 612 (1939). See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>375 Mass, at 832. It is equally clear, however, that \u201cthe activity of spending money is essentially an executive task.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 835. Thus, we speak in abstract terms of separation of powers; in reality, some overlap is inevitable, and may well be desirable. See <em>Chief Admin. Justice of the Trial Court </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>404 Mass. 53, 56 (1989), citing <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>365 Mass. 639, 641 (1974); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>375 Mass, at 835; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>302 Mass, at 615. Two key concepts are determinative of our analysis: (1) a statute may not constitutionally allow the Governor to exercise the appropriation power; but (2) a statute may grant the Governor discretion to determine how to spend appropriated funds, or, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>limited circumstances, to withhold their expenditure. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>375 Mass, at 835-836; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>369 Mass. 990, 993 (1976); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>302 Mass, at 614-615. Thus, \u201c[a] distinction must be made between the power of the Legislature to control the expenditure of funds in the sense that it determines the purposes for which expenditures may be made, and the power to control the extent of expenditures committed to a particular purpose.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>375 Mass, at 835-836 n.4. We conclude that \u00a7 9C is an example of the latter power and constitutes not the legislative power of appropriation, but rather the executive power of expenditure.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Section 9C confers on the Governor neither the authority to set aside money from the treasury to be spent for a particular purpose, nor the authority to direct that any money so appropriated be spent in a manner different from what the Legislature intended. See <em>id. </em>at 834-835 n.2 (\u201cthe Governor . . . cannot use funds appropriated for one purpose to augment funds earmarked for a second purpose\u201d). Instead, \u00a7 9C permits the Governor to use her executive judgment to reduce public expenditures in a time of true financial emergency. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>369 Mass, at 993. This obligation conforms to the constitutional requirement for a balanced budget. See art. 63, \u00a7 2, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, as amended by art. 107 of the Amendments. It reflects a legislative determination that the Commonwealth\u2019s need to remain solvent overrides particular statements of social policy contained in those appropriation items subject to allotment under \u00a7 9B. It is an expression of the Legislature\u2019s recognition that the executive branch has the \u201cdetailed and contemporaneous knowledge regarding spending decisions\u201d to enable necessary reductions to be made on an expedited basis, and the Legislature\u2019s confidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>that they will be made in a manner that will not compromise the achievement of underlying legislative purposes and goals. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>375 Mass, at 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The probability the Governor might abuse her authority under \u00a7 9C to reduce, or eliminate altogether, funding for certain programs based on her own ordering of social priorities, is minimal. \u201cTo the contrary, the Governor is bound to apply [her] full energy and resources, in the exercise of [her] best judgment and ability, to ensure that the intended goals of legislation are effectuated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 834. As has been discussed above, allotment reductions under \u00a7 9C are applicable only to appropriations to certain State agencies, as provided in \u00a7 9B. In addition, \u00a7 9C limits the total amount of allotment reductions to an \u201camount equal to such [revenue] deficiency.\u201d Finally, the Governor can reduce only the allotment; the underlying appropriation remains fully in force to establish an upper limit on what may be spent for that line item, should sufficient revenue be forthcoming. It should not be overlooked either that \u00a7 9C requires that the Legislature be put on notice when a projected budget deficit triggers the statute\u2019s operation. To the extent that the Legislature chooses, it retains full authority to restore funding to programs affected by \u00a7 9C allotment reductions, by enacting legislation to transfer funds from the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund or to raise additional revenues to make up for any budget deficiency. Further, the Legislature may pass \u201cconditions\u201d to items in an appropriation bill, exempting the funds in question from allotment reductions under \u00a7 9C. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>375 Mass, at 834 n.2. The over-all plan effects a balance between the authority of the executive, who is in charge of the day-to-day operations of a considerable sector of State government, and the authority of the Legislature, which generally has the final word in matters of the purse, and which receives notice of the Governor\u2019s actions and has the ultimate right to undo anything done by her under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">4. We remand the case to the county court for the entry of a judgment declaring that the Governor\u2019s reduction of allotments pursuant to G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 9C, was proper and constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b195-10\">The plaintiffs properly did not name the Acting Governor as a defendant.

Section 9B reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u201cAny monies made available by appropriation or otherwise, to state agencies under the control of the governor or a secretary, but not including the courts, the office of the governor, or the office of the lieutenant governor, shall be expended only in such amounts as may be allotted as provided in this section. The governor shall from time to time divide each fiscal year into allotment periods of not less than one month nor more than four months. The governor or the commissioner when designated in writing by the governor shall allot to each such state agency the amount which it may expend for such period out of the sums made available to it by appropriation or otherwise. The amount so allotted initially by the governor or the commissioner shall be equal to an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: the annual sum available for expenditure divided by twelve multiplied by the number of months in the allotment period, unless the full legislative objective of an appropriation would be accomplished, without amendment, by a lesser allocation than that required by the formula.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Section 2H establishes the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund, as a reserve to be used:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">\u201c(1) to make up any difference between actual state revenues and allowable state revenues in any fiscal year in which actual revenues fall below the allowable amount and (2) to replace the state and local loss of federal funds or (3) for any event which threatens the health, safety or welfare of the people or the fiscal stability of the commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions.

As a result of the \u00a7 9C allotment reductions, the MS Pass program was eliminated. Consequently, one plaintiff lost her job, and two have failed to receive promised reimbursement for expenses relating to their condition. Because we conclude that the organizational plaintiffs have standing in these circumstances, we need not consider whether the same holds true for the individual plaintiffs. See <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 209, 214 (1981); <em>Save the Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub.

See G. L. c. 29, \u00a7\u00a7 2H &amp; 5C. The fund\u2019s purpose is \u201cto create and maintain a reserve\u201d available in the event of fiscal emergencies. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>430 Mass. 1201, 1202 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\">The record shows, however, that, in his past two \u00a7 5B reports, the commissioner has included a breakdown of at least three major funds (the General Fund, the Highway Fund, and the Local Aid Fund).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b202-6\">A \u201c[f]und\u201d is defined as \u201can accounting entity established by general or special law to record all the financial resources or revenues together with all related expenditures or liabilities that are segregated for a particular purpose.\u201d G.L. c. 29, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b202-7\">For example, G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 7C, provides that revenues collected on cigarettes are to be credited to the Health Protection Fund, G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 2GG, and expended, subject to appropriation, primarily on education, advertising, and various programs devoted to smoking prevention and cessation. In a likewise manner, G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 2XX, provides that certain revenues are to be credited to the Tobacco Settlement Fund and expended, subject to appropriation, for the propose of funding health-related services and programs. Although the plaintiffs characterize the challenged reductions as \u201cespecially egregious ... in the case of the Health Protection Fund and the Tobacco Settlement Fund,\u201d they state in their brief that \u201cthe meaning of [\u00a7 ] 9C does not vary by the particular \u2018fund\u2019 involved.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The Legislature does have the option of requiring that certain funds may not run deficits. See, e.g., G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 2BBB (Supp. 2001) (providing that the One-Time Capital Projects Improvement Fund \u201cshall at no time during the fiscal year have a negative fund balance\u201d); St. 2001, c. 177, \u00a7 2B (providing that \u201cno expenditures shall be made from [the Intragovernmental Service Fund, G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 2Q] which would cause said fund to be in deficit at the close of fiscal year 2002\u201d). Or, the Legislature may create trust funds for a dedicated purpose and not subject to appropriation. See G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\">This is not to say that a deficit in a fund has no legal significance. The comptroller is responsible for ensuring that budgetary control is maintained on an individual appropriation account basis. See G. L. c. 7A, \u00a7 12; G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 5C. To resolve deficits reported in budgeted funds, he may recommend that the Legislature authorize the transfer of monies from other budgeted funds with surplus balances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b204-6\">We have searched for legislative history and discovered none that is of any value to this problem of interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The record indicates that, in <em>1990, </em>the then Governor authorized \u00a7 9C allotment reductions across a wide variety of agencies and programs, in response to a major fiscal crisis. The parties agree that G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 9C, has been invoked very sparingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\">In <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>The Governor, </em>407 Mass. 377 (1990), this court upheld a challenge to the Governor\u2019s authority under G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 9C, to withhold funds for local school aid, commonly called Chapter 70 aid, appropriated in the fiscal year 1990 budget. Because we held in that case that the funds at issue were not \u201cmade available ... to [Sjtate agencies under the control of the governor or a secretary,\u201d and so were not subject to allotment reductions under \u00a7\u00a7 9B and 9C, see <em>id. </em>at 381, we did not reach issues, raised by the plaintiffs and amici, regarding in what circumstances \u00a7 9C allotment reductions properly may be made. See <em>id. </em>at 381-382 n.5; <em>id. </em>at 386 (Liacos, C.J., concurring). We note, however, that, in the <em>Brookline </em>opinion, we generally described \u00a7 9C as a statute that \u201callows the Governor to reduce allotments under \u00a7 9B, in certain circumstances, when available revenues during a fiscal year will be insufficient to meet authorized expenditures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380. This description fully comports with our interpretation of the statute today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b204-9\">We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 summary argument that we should limit the Governor\u2019s authority under G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 9C, to make only \u201cpro rata reductions across all line Item appropriations to be paid out of a particular fund,\u201d or, alternatively, across all expenditures subject to allotment under \u00a7 9B. A requirement that a budget shortfall must be addressed with uniform allotment reductions is noticeably absent from the statute and, in our opinion, could produce arbitrary results. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>375 Mass. 827, 836 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\">No one can disagree with the fact that the plaintiff organizations provide valuable and much needed public health services to communities of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Commonwealth. We are concerned here with the question of the Governor\u2019s statutory authority to allocate funds and not with the relative merits of programs affected by her decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b205-33\">That portion of the budget subject to allocation under G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 9B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The parties cite to decisions of appellate courts from other States. Some, considering statutory schemes that operate in essentially the same fashion as ours do, have, not surprisingly, reached similar results. See, e.g., <em>University of Conn. Chapter, AAUP </em>v. <em>The Governor, </em>200 Conn. 386 (1986). There are some, considering other schemes, that have reached different results. See, e.g., <em>Chiles </em>v. <em>Children </em>A, <em>B, C, D, E, &amp; F, </em>589 So. 2d 260 (Fla. 1991). We do not consider out-of-State authority particularly helpful in construing our statutes or in dealing with the Massachusetts Constitution. See <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin., </em>411 Mass. 822, 829 n.8 (1992), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
