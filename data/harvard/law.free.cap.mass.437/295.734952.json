G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 <em>(b). </em>Because we conclude that there was no stoppage of work, we affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">1. <em>Procedural history. </em>The employees filed claims for unemployment benefits with the division of employment and training. Its deputy director determined that no stoppage of work had occurred, and that the claimants were entitled to unemployment benefits. Hertz appealed to the board of review (board) of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development (department). After hearings, the board affirmed the decision of the deputy director. Hertz sought judicial review in the District Court, which also affirmed. Hertz then filed an appeal in the Appeals Court, which vacated the judgment of the District Court and ordered entry of judgment in favor of Hertz, concluding that a stoppage of work occurred as a result of the labor strike, and that the employees are not entitled to unemployment benefits. See <em>Hertz Corp. </em>v. <em>Acting Director of the Div. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 461, 470 (2001). We granted the union\u2019s application and the department\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">2. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the board\u2019s findings of fact, which are not disputed. Hertz is primarily in the business of renting automobiles and other vehicles to the general public. The employees \u2014 including clerks, mechanics, courtesy bus drivers, and counter sales representatives \u2014 were on strike from June 10 until July 22, 1996, when the dispute was settled and the employees returned to work. The employees filed claims for unemployment benefits for the period of the strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">During the strike, Hertz relocated members of management and nonstriking workers to perform the functions of the striking employees. As a result, there was no decrease in rentals or revenue. The regular duties of the managers and nonstriking employees went undone, however. For example, the \u201cfleet manager\u201d normally analyzes market conditions to project how many vehicles Hertz will need, but during the strike was able to perform this job only \u201con a minimal basis\u201d while also washing vehicles and assisting the security staff. Hertz \u201ccontracted out\u201d its twenty-four hour road service for customers whose rental vehicles break down, and regular maintenance on the rental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>fleet and courtesy buses was limited to conditions that would raise safety concerns. Managers pitched in with the \u201cback office\u201d paperwork, including obtaining titles, registrations, and registration plates for new vehicles, tracking additions and deletions to the fleet, and preparing business and accident reports. While the \u201cmore critical\u201d of these tasks were performed, \u201cmuch of the paperwork did not get filed at that time and multiple sets of car keys were lost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Additionally, two planned construction projects were delayed, the used car sales at the McLellan Highway location ceased, and Hertz sent the \u201cwrong mix of cars\u201d to its Nantucket location, an error that could not be corrected during that tourist season due to local regulations and which \u201caffected Hertz\u2019s business on the island further, because the number of vehicle permits issued by local authorities that year was used as a basis for issuing permits the following year.\u201d The board determined, however, that the construction project delays caused no financial losses at all, and financial losses suffered by the McLellen Highway and Nantucket locations were minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">3. <em>\u201cStoppage of work.\u201d </em>Unemployment benefits are not available<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> if the \u201cunemployment is due to a stoppage of work which exists because of a labor dispute.\u201d G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(b). </em>For there to be a \u201cstoppage of work,\u201d operations must be \u201csubstantially curtailed.\u201d <em>Reed Nat\u2019l Corp. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>388 Mass. 336, 338 (1983), <em>S.C., </em>393 Mass. 721 (1985). How much disruption is required to constitute a substantial curtailment is a fact-specific inquiry; there is no percentage threshold or numerical formula. See <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>378 Mass. 51, 55-56 (1979); <em>Reed Nat\u2019l Corp. </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 721, 724 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Hertz asserts that the board\u2019s determination of no stoppage is based on an error of law, unsupported by substantial evidence, and arbitrary and capricious. Because we conclude that each of these assertions fails, we defer to the decision of the board. See G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42; G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). See also <em>Boguszewski </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Employment &amp; Training, </em>410 Mass. 337, 345-346 (1991), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The board applied the correct legal standard, stating that \u201c[t]he proper inquiry for the [b]card in determining the existence of a stoppage of work is whether the employer\u2019s operations were substantially curtailed as a result of a labor dispute.\u201d Hertz argues that the board did not apply the standard properly, however, claiming that the board focused only on Hertz\u2019s steady rate of rentals and revenue, rather than on its operations as a whole. This is an inaccurate recitation of the record. The board\u2019s decision explicitly states that it also considered the diminished performance of managerial and other functions during this time, the delay in the construction projects, and the difficulties faced by the McLeflen Highway and Nantucket locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Hertz next argues that there is no substantial evidence on the record adequate to support the board\u2019s decision. We disagree. \u201cSince the main business of the employer . . . continued uncurtailed, we cannot say that the board was in error in finding that there was no \u2018stoppage of work.\u2019 \u201d <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Hertz first points to three conclusions that it argues are not supported by the board\u2019s findings of fact: (1) managers \u201cperformed the functions of the striking bargaining unit employees as well as some of the normal functions of management\u201d; (2) there was \u201cno reliable evidence of an increase in customer complaints due to the strike\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe minor reduction in so-called back office operations did not constitute a substantial work stoppage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The first of these plainly is supported by the record. The board found that approximately 133 to 165 nonstriking workers and management performed the duties of the striking employees, and while Hertz complains that not <em>all </em>of the employees\u2019 functions were performed, the word \u201call\u201d does not appear in the contested sentence. In addition, the record is replete with examples of managers performing \u201csome\u201d of their normal functions: the fleet manager performed his duties, albeit \u201con a minimal basis\u201d; the pricing and yield manager performed his duties approximately two horns a day; managers staffed the Logan Airport Hertz counters with managers, albeit on a \u201cseat of the pants\u201d or \u201cplug the holes\u201d basis; the station manager collected and made the usually daily deposits once or twice a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>week, and performed her duty of ordering supplies and road maps \u201cat some point during the strike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The second and third of these criticisms also fail. In challenging the conclusion that there was \u201cno reliable evidence of an increase in customer complaints due to the strike,\u201d Hertz points to findings of customer complaints. Nowhere, however, is there any evidence of the rate of customer complaints before the strike, and hence no evidence of an increase thereafter. Last, Hertz complains that the reduction in back office operations cannot be characterized as \u201cminor,\u201d but the board found that \u201cmanagers performed some of the more critical of these functions\u201d during the strike, and we presume that Hertz does not intend to argue that it rented vehicles without registration plates or registrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Hertz next points to <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec. (No. </em>2), 349 Mass. 358, 364-365 (1965), where we reversed the board\u2019s determination of no stoppage. The facts here are quite different. In the <em>General Electric </em>case, the company\u2019s welders went on strike, and it decided to lay off sheet metal workers and others whose work was interdependent with the welding work. The company simply \u201cfarmed out\u201d the entire welding operation in order to fulfil its obligations to its customers. See <em>id. </em>at 359. We explained that, although production levels did not decrease, see <em>id. </em>at 362, there was a stoppage of work where the labor dispute \u201cprevented the company from having a substantial amount of work performed in its own plant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364. In contrast, the only work Hertz contracted out was its road service \u2014 a supplemental support function of its main business of renting vehicles, not comparable to the contracting out of \u201can important segment of the production process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The board was within its discretion to conclude that the combined impacts of the strike detailed in its findings of fact did not cause a substantial stoppage of Hertz\u2019s operations as a whole. See <em>Reed Nat\u2019l Corp. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>388 Mass. 336, 340 (1983). Although certain functions went unperformed while managers and nonstriking workers filled in for the striking employees, a \u201cstoppage of work\u201d requires more than the holes in coverage that inevitably result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>when staff is temporarily diverted from one place to another. If these sorts of disruptions sufficed to constitute a \u201cstoppage of work,\u201d then virtually every strike would result in benefits disqualification, an outcome explicitly rejected by the Legislature when it revised the unemployment compensation statute in 1937. Compare St. 1937, c. 421, \u00a7 1, with St. 1935, c. 479, \u00a7 5 (amending statute from disqualifying any claimants whose unemployment is due to \u201cstrike, lockout or other trade dispute\u201d to disqualifying only those whose unemployment is due to \u201cstoppage of work\u201d). See <em>Boguszewski </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Employment &amp; Training, </em>410 Mass. 337, 341 (1991); <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>378 Mass. 51, 53-54 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Finally, Hertz argues that the board\u2019s decision was arbitrary, claiming that it contradicts the board\u2019s prior decisions in the <em>Boguszewski </em>case, <em>supra, </em>and Matter of Norrgard &amp; New England Tel. M-33872-A (Aug. 26, 1993). We disagree. In cases where output and revenues are unaffected, high levels of disruption in support operations such as \u201cmaintenance, inspection, testing, installation, replacement, clerical, and administrative functions\u201d will constitute a \u201csubstantial curtailment\u201d of the employer\u2019s operations, <em>Boguszewski </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Dep\u2019t of Employment &amp; Training, supra </em>at 346, while lesser disruptions in those functions will not, see <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 55-56. The board\u2019s decisions have been consistent: it simply found that the disruptions in the <em>Boguszewski </em>and Norrgard cases were of greater magnitude than those here. Given the fact-specific nature of the inquiry, it is not surprising that different cases merit different results, even though the employers suffered disruptions in similar categories of operational functions. Hertz has failed to carry its burden on appeal to demonstrate any inconsistency in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u201cThe board\u2019s decision was well-reasoned and contained detailed findings, and determined a question which is \u2018primarily a question of fact for the board.\u2019 ... It was neither arbitrary, based on an error of law, nor unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Boguszewski </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Employment &amp; Training, supra </em>at 346, quoting <em>Reed Nat\u2019l Corp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>388 Mass. 336, 339 (1983), <em>S.C., </em>393 Mass. 721 (1985). Judgment is to be entered in the District Court affirming the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Subject to exceptions not relevant here.
