L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, by a single justice of this court. We dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">In his petition, Cepulonis essentially sought an order requiring prison officials to \u201cdismiss\u201d a second disciplinary charge while his appeal from a first disciplinary charge was pending. Such relief is now academic. The Superior Court\u2019s judgment with respect to the first charge \u2014 in favor of the superintendent \u2014 has been affirmed on appeal. <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Shirley, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 1106 (2001). Cepulonis\u2019s application for further appellate review was denied. 435 Mass. 1103 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">Because the appeal is moot, we need not discuss the various bases on which the single justice\u2019s judgment denying Cepulonis\u2019s G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition would have been affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
