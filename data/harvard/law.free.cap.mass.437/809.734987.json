G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. Facing deportation back to his native Haiti more than one and one-half years after his admission to sufficient facts on multiple charges, the defendant moved to withdraw those admissions and for a new trial on the ground that the judge failed to provide him with the required alien warnings during the oral colloquy, notwithstanding that he had signed three copies of a form containing the required warnings at the time he proffered his admissions. A divided panel of the Appeals Court reversed the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilaire, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 818 (2001), and we granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. We agree with the Appeals Court and hold that the statute requires the judge to deliver the alien warnings orally as part of the colloquy, and, where the warnings given during that colloquy fail to meet the statutory requirements, the defendant\u2019s signature on the court\u2019s standard form containing the warnings does not suffice to avoid the consequences mandated by the statute. We therefore reverse the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">1. <em>Facts and procedural history. </em>In July, 1996, the defendant was charged with multiple crimes stemming from his alleged participation in three separate incidents involving the stealing of one motor vehicle, damaging the windows of several others, and larceny of property from yet another. On July 26, 1996, the defendant tendered admissions to sufficient facts on three charges conditioned on specific dispositional terms. See Dist. Mun. Ct. R. Crim. P. 4 (c). The prosecutor disagreed with those terms and submitted an alternative disposition. The judge rejected the defendant\u2019s proposal, indicating the disposition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>he would find acceptable. See <em>id.; </em>Mass. R. Crim. P. 12 (c) (6), as appearing in 399 Mass. 1215 (1987). The defendant decided to accept the judge\u2019s proposed disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">As provided by rule 4 (c), the tender of each of the defendant\u2019s admissions was set forth on the standard preprinted form to be used in connection with such tenders. On the front of each of the forms, the defendant signified his acceptance of the judge\u2019s proposed disposition by checking the box next to the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-5\">\u201cDefendant ACCEPTS terms set forth by the Court, a Plea or Admission will be accepted by the court and said dispositional terms imposed, subject to submission of defendant\u2019s written WAIVER (see Section IV on reverse of this form), completion of the required oral COLLOQUY, a determination that there is a FACTUAL BASIS for the Plea or Admission, and notice of ALIEN RIGHTS.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The \u201cSection IV\u201d waiver referenced in that acceptance appeared at the top of the reverse side, captioned \u201cDEFENDANT\u2019S WAIVER OF RIGHTS (G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 6) &amp; ALIEN RIGHTS NOTICE (G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D).\u201d In five separate paragraphs, the printed waiver first acknowledged the defendant\u2019s voluntary waiver of his right to be tried by a jury or judge, his understanding of his constitutional rights, his awareness of the nature and elements of the charge, the voluntariness of his decision to plead guilty or admit to sufficient facts, and the absence of any impairment affecting his ability to understand his rights. Then, in the sixth paragraph, the form read: \u201cI understand that if I am not a citizen of the United States, conviction of this offense may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization, pursuant to the laws of the United States.\u201d Immediately below that paragraph was the line for the defendant\u2019s signature. The defendant signed each of the three forms on that signature fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Immediately below the defendant\u2019s signature, the form contained a section for counsel\u2019s certification. The preprinted statement provided that counsel had \u201cexplained to the defendant the above-stated provisions of law regarding the defendant\u2019s waiver of jury trial and other rights so as to enable the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>to tender his or her plea of guilty or admission knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel signed each form underneath that certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The judge conducted a plea colloquy, first explaining the proposed disposition and then confirming the defendant\u2019s awareness of his rights, the voluntariness of his decision to admit to sufficient facts, and the absence of any impairment. The judge next asked the defendant, \u201cIf you\u2019re not a full United States citizen, a finding of guilty in these cases could affect your status; do you understand that?\u201d The defendant made some response, but the transcript reflects that it was \u201cinaudible.\u201d The judge continued, \u201cDo you know what that means?\u201d Before the defendant replied, the judge continued: \u201cFor the record, further I must be satisfied that you are making these admissions because you feel you would be found guilty at trial and that there is no other reason; is that so?\u201d The defendant\u2019s response was recorded as \u201cinaudible.\u201d The judge proceeded to explain that with respect to two of the complaints (one for operating after suspension and the other for larceny of a motor vehicle), \u201ca finding of guilty will not only affect your status if you\u2019re not a citizen, but would also affect your license or right to operate [a] motor vehicle; do you understand that?\u201d The transcript again recorded the defendant\u2019s response as \u201cinaudible.\u201d The prosecutor then recited the facts underlying the complaints; the judge asked defense counsel whether she had \u201c[a]ny questions regarding these matters\u201d; and counsel replied that there were \u201c[n]o questions on the facts . . . .\u201d The defendant was then found guilty and sentenced. At no point during the colloquy did the judge make any reference to the rule 4 (c) forms or to the defendant\u2019s acknowledgment of the immigration warnings on those forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">After concluding the colloquy, the judge signed each of the rule 4 (c) forms in the designated preprinted section, certifying that he had \u201caddressed the defendant directly in open court\u201d and had \u201cmade appropriate inquiry\u201d verifying that the defendant\u2019s admission was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily, and that there was a factual basis for the defendant\u2019s admission. The preprinted statement further certified \u201cthat the defendant was informed and advised that if he or she is not a citizen of the United States, a conviction of the offense with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>which he or she was charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization, pursuant to the laws of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">On or about September 12, 1997, the defendant was taken into custody by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) pending deportation proceedings. An order of deportation, premised solely on the convictions at issue here, was issued sometime in February, 1998. On March 11, 1998, prior to the expiration of the time in which to appeal that deportation order, the defendant filed a motion to vacate his admission to sufficient facts and for a new trial, on the ground, inter alla, that he had not received the alien warnings required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. The judge denied the motion, concluding that his advising the defendant that the admission might affect his \u201cstatus\u201d was sufficient warning under the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 29D, provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he court shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere from any defendant in any criminal proceeding unless <em>the court advises such defendant </em>of the following: \u2018If you are not a citizen of the United States, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization, pursuant to the laws of the United States\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added). If the court fails to provide this warning, and the defendant later shows that he \u201cmay\u201d suffer one of the enumerated immigration consequences, then \u201cthe court, on the defendant\u2019s motion, shall vacate the judgment, and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea of guilty or nolo contendere, and enter a plea of not guilty.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">With the commencement of deportation proceedings against him, there is no dispute that the defendant \u201cmay\u201d suffer one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>the enumerated immigration consequences and that, if warnings were not given in accordance with the statute, he would be entitled to withdraw his admissions. We therefore need only determine whether the court \u201cfail[ed] so to advise the defendant.\u201d G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The oral warning given during the colloquy did not satisfy the statute\u2019s requirements, as the judge merely told the defendant that \u201ca finding of guilty in these cases could affect [his] status.\u201d In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soto, </em>431 Mass. 340, 342 (2000), we held that \u201c[i]t is incumbent on the judge to notify a defendant that there are three specific consequences to a plea: (1) deportation; (2) exclusion of admission to the United States; and (3) denial of naturalization. A defendant must be advised of all three consequences of his plea.\u201d In that case, the defendant, who had pleaded guilty to a narcotics charge in 1990, moved to vacate his plea seven years later after the INS initiated proceedings to exclude him from the United States as an \u201carriving alien.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341. Although the judge who took the defendant\u2019s plea had warned him that his plea \u201ccould result in [his] being denied citizenship, or for that matter, being deported,\u201d the court had failed to advise the defendant that a guilty plea might result in his being excluded from admission \u2014 the precise consequence the defendant later faced. <em>Id. </em>at 341, 342. We held that a defendant must be told \u201cexactly what immigration consequences his or her guilty plea may have\u201d by explicit reference to \u201call three consequences\u201d specified in the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Here, the judge\u2019s advice that the defendant\u2019s admission may affect his \u201cstatus,\u201d without mentioning any of the specific immigration consequences identified in the statute, fell far short of the statutory requirement. Nor did the colloquy identify the immigration consequence that the defendant is now suffering, i.e., deportation. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamrini, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 662, 666-667 (1989) (where INS later sought to deport defendant following guilty plea, colloquy warning of \u201cpossibility of being deported\u201d was \u201cbarely adequate,\u201d noting that \u201cbet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>ter practice would have been for the judge to read directly from the statute the advisement contained therein\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">The Commonwealth contends that this defect in the verbal warning was cured by the preprinted warning on the rule 4 (c) form, which the defendant signed three times. Essentially, the Commonwealth is arguing that the written warning, augmented by the judge\u2019s references to the defendant\u2019s immigration \u201cstatus,\u201d satisfies the statutory requirement that \u201cthe court\u201d provide the warnings. We reject the contention that solely providing a form containing written alien warnings, given to defense counsel by a court official (e.g., assistant clerk or probation officer), satisfies the statutory requirement that \u201cthe court advise[] such defendant\u201d of those immigration consequences. The use of such forms serves other purposes, as it provides a written record of the change of plea (including a record of the administration of alien warnings), and the written material serves to reinforce the various rights, warnings, and other information that is provided orally during the course of the colloquy. The form, however, is not a substitute for the alien warnings that must be given by \u201cthe court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">As used throughout G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, the term \u201ccourt\u201d refers to a judge, not to the \u201ccourt\u201d as an institution. The section begins, <em>\u201cThe court </em>shall not accept a plea of guilty ...\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. Only a judge \u201caccepts] \u201d a guilty plea. It cannot be \u201caccepted]\u201d by any other official of the court acting on behalf of the court as an institution. Similarly, the statute provides that \u201c[t]he defendant shall not be required at the time of the plea to disclose <em>to the court </em>his legal status in the United States\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>Given that a change of plea occurs before a judge, that reference to \u201cthe court\u201d is also a reference to the judge taking the plea, not to \u201cthe court\u201d as an institution. The statute further specifies that if a defendant suffers one of the adverse immigration consequences after not having received the requisite warnings, <em>\u201cthe court, </em>on the defendant\u2019s motion, shall vacate the judgment, and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>Only a judge can allow such a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>and permit the withdrawal of a plea, and the word \u201ccourt\u201d is obviously being used as synonymous with \u201cjudge.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">When the Legislature uses the same term in the same section, or even in different statutory sections, the term should be given a consistent meaning throughout. See <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Reading, </em>349 Mass. 17, 19 (1965); <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Boston </em>v. <em>Fedorchuk, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 543, 549 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 531, 535 (1978). Thus, when the same term (\u201cthe court\u201d) is used throughout \u00a7 29D, in contexts that clearly refer to a judge, the use of that same term to identify the person responsible for advising the defendant of the potential immigration consequences must also refer to a judge, specifically, the judge who is conducting the plea colloquy and deciding whether to \u201caccept\u201d the change of plea. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. It does not refer to the court as an institution, and does not thereby refer to court personnel who might, by providing the defendant with the standard rule 4 (c) form, be \u201cadvis[ing]\u201d the defendant of the immigration consequences referenced on that form.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Although this issue has not been specifically raised before, our case law is replete with references to the requirement that the \u201cjudge\u201d give the defendant the warnings prescribed by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soto, </em>431 Mass. 340, 342 (2000) (\u00a7 29D \u201crequires the judge to advise a person pleading to criminal charges\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rzepphiewski, </em>431 Mass. 48, 49 (2000) (\u00a7 29 entitles defendant to withdraw plea \u201cif, at the time the plea was entered, the judge failed to give the required deportation advisement\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 459, 462 (2001) (\u201cdefendant is entitled to have his conviction vacated if, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>time of his guilty plea, the judge fails to warn him of the three immigration consequences\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Desorbo, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 910, 911 (2000) (\u00a7 29D \u201crequires judges to give [warnings] to a defendant tendering a plea of guilty,\u201d and \u201cthe Legislature has set out and placed in quotation marks the exact text of what judges should say on such occasions\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamrini, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 662, 666, 667 (1989) (\u201ca judge must inform the defendant\u201d of immigration consequences specified in \u00a7 29D, and \u201cwhen a defendant has not been so advised by the judge,\u201d \u00a7 29D provides for withdrawal of plea; notes that \u201cbetter practice [is] for the judge to read directly from the statute the advisement contained therein\u201d); Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Crim. P. 12 (c) (3), Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 117 (Lexis 1997) (\u00a7 29D warnings \u201cexpressly required by the statute to be imparted by the judge, rather than by counsel as permitted by this subdivision with respect to other consequences\u201d of guilty plea). This comports with the commonsense interpretation that, in context, the term \u201ccourt\u201d in \u00a7 29D refers to the judge taking the plea, not to any other court official or to the court as an institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Indeed, the wording of the rule 4 (c) form itself contemplates that the \u00a7 29D warnings will be administered as part of the colloquy and belies any claim that the defendant\u2019s signature on the waiver section of the form is all that is required. The defendant\u2019s written acceptance of the judge\u2019s proposed disposition is given \u201csubject to\u201d the defendant\u2019s signed waiver (which contains the written \u00a7 29D warnings), \u201ccompletion of the required oral COLLOQUY, determination that there is a FACTUAL BASIS for the Plea or Admission, and notice of ALIEN RIGHTS.\u201d If signature on the waiver were a sufficient advisement of those alien rights, the \u201cnotice of ALIEN RIGHTS\u201d would not be a separate condition of the defendant\u2019s acceptance. Instead, the form lists \u201cnotice of ALIEN RIGHTS\u201d along with other items that constitute the standard plea colloquy. Similarly, the certification that the judge \u201caddressed the defendant directly in open court\u201d contains the specific certification \u201cthat the defendant was informed and advised that if he or she is not a citizen of the United States, a conviction of the offense with which he or she was charged may have the consequences of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization, pursuant to the laws of the United States.\u201d If immigration warnings only needed to be in written form, the defendant\u2019s signature underneath the written warnings would suffice, and there would be nothing on that subject for the judge to \u201ccertify.\u201d Rather, in context, the inclusion of the \u00a7 29D warnings as part of the judge\u2019s certification allows the judge to certify that those warnings, along with the other components of a standard colloquy, were in fact delivered as part of that colloquy \u201caddressed [to] the defendant in open court.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">We recognize that the defendant acknowledged by his signature on three separate forms that he understood the immigration consequences that might result from his admissions, and he does not raise any claim that he did not have time to read the forms or that he could not understand them. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilaire, supra </em>at 834-836 (Grasso, J., dissenting). We must nevertheless conclude that the preprinted form does not, by itself, fulfil the statutory command of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. The language of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, makes clear that it was the duty of the judge to advise the defendant of the three immigration consequences that might result from his admission. The transcript demonstrates that the judge failed to do so, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>the Legislature has prescribed the remedy for such failure: the defendant must be permitted to withdraw his admissions and enter a plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">We also recognize the time pressures judges face each day in busy criminal sessions. As the Appeals Court noted, \u201c[t]he requirements imposed by the courts on a judge who accepts a guilty plea are many, but those imposed by the Legislature are few.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilaire, supra </em>at 819. Among those \u201cfew\u201d requirements is G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, and \u201c[w]e are not free to ignore or tamper with that clear expression of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>417 Mass. 661, 664 (1994). To comply with the statute, the judge must give the alien warning, preferably by reading the single quoted sentence directly from the statute. Nothing in the statute requires that the judge confirm the defendant\u2019s understanding of the potential immigration consequences, or that the judge explain the complexities of immigration law, or that the judge spell out the specific application of that complex law to the defendant\u2019s particular situation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statute requires only that the defendant be told of certain consequences that \u201cmay\u201d occur, and that statutory mandate is readily satisfied by the judge reading out loud the single sentence that the Legislature has provided in quotation marks.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The order of the District Court denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his admission to sufficient facts and for a new trial is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-6\">because we resolve this issue in the defendant\u2019s favor, we need not reach the defendant\u2019s additional argument that he was not adequately informed of the nature and elements of the offenses before he admitted to sufficient facts.

See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pryce, </em>429 Mass. 556, 557-558 (1999) (notation on docket that guilty plea accepted \u201cafter hearing,\u201d combined with evidence that \u201cstandard colloquy\u201d included alien warnings, constituted sufficient \u201crecord\u201d that warnings given). Nothing in today\u2019s opinion disturbs our jurisprudence concerning the requisites for an adequate \u201crecord\u201d for purposes of the statutory presumption, and we encourage the continued use of such forms to preserve such a \u201crecord.\u201d Here, however, a transcript of the colloquy is available; we thus have no need to resort to secondary sources, such as the preprinted form, to determine the contents of the alien warnings that were given during the colloquy. While such secondary sources suffice in the absence of an official transcript, they do not cure specific defects in the warnings that are revealed by the contents of an available transcript. As such, the Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pryce, supra, </em>is misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b841-9\">Indeed, the statute prohibits the judge from even making inquiry as to the defendant\u2019s immigration status: \u201cThe defendant shall not be required at the time of the plea to disclose to the court his legal status in the United States.\u201d G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b841-10\">Although not required by the statute, where the defendant is admitting to sufficient facts for purposes of obtaining a continuance without a finding and ultimate dismissal of the charges, G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, the better practice is to supplement the alien warning by informing the defendant that even a continuance without a finding followed by dismissal may be treated as a \u201cconviction\u201d for immigration purposes.
