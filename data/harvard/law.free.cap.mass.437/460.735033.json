The jury rejected this contention and found him guilty of ail charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appeals, claiming error in (1) the admission in evidence of his prior record; (2) the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument; (3) the jury instruction on voluntary drug use; and (4) the denial of his motion for a new trial, which was based on a seated juror\u2019s undisclosed continuance without a finding in a drug case. The defendant also requests that we order a new trial or direct the entry of a lesser degree of guilt on the murder conviction under the authority of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We affirm the convictions and the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, and decline to exercise our extraordinary power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, reserving certain details for discussion in connection with the issues raised. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>434 Mass. 805, 807 (2001). Theresa Visneau and Patricia Henry were sisters who lived together in Springfield. The defendant was Henry\u2019s daughter\u2019s boy friend. Henry had lived with the defendant and her daughter for a couple of years prior to making her home with Visneau. The defendant had spent holidays at the sisters\u2019 home before, and had good relationships with them both.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">On March 16, 1996, the defendant and his brother rented a U-Haul truck and moved a bureau and a desk to the sisters\u2019 home for them. They left between 6:30 and 7 p.m. to the sisters\u2019 hugs, kisses, and thanks. Just before 1 a.m. on March 17, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>defendant returned, parking the U-Haul truck a few houses away. He crawled in through a front porch window and attacked Visneau. She struggled free of his grasp and screamed. Henry came into the room and said, \u201cJohnny, what are you doing?\u201d While the defendant\u2019s attention was distracted, Visneau ran to the telephone and dialed 911. The defendant grabbed her away from the telephone and stabbed her in the neck while she pleaded with him. He pushed her to the floor, and Henry set upon him. He threw her to the floor on top of her sister, then picked her up and took her into the bedroom. Henry cried out, \u201cDaddy, please help me,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u201cJohnny, don\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The police arrived and Visneau opened the door, screaming, \u201cHe\u2019s raping my sister.\u201d The police found Henry in her bedroom, unclothed and bloody. A knife was lodged in her neck, and she died from multiple stab wounds. Death occurred within minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The defendant had heard the police arrive and, in his haste to leave, had left his coat on the bed in Henry\u2019s room. In it were his wallet and keys to the U-Haul. The police followed a trail of blood through the house and out a living room window. They used the coat to set a tracking dog on the defendant\u2019s scent. The dog led the officers to the defendant, who was hiding underneath a nearby car.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">After waiving his Miranda rights, the defendant told police<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that he had drunk \u201ca few beers,\u201d \u201csniffed a little cocaine,\u201d and watched a televised boxing match and bits of \u201cadult movies\u201d before breaking into the sisters\u2019 house to steal money he believed they kept under a mattress. He said that he knew he would have to kill the sisters because they could identify him.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Dr. David Gansler, a neuropsychologist who evaluated the defendant, testified that he suffered from a dysfunction in the frontal portion of the left hemisphere of his brain. The defendant\u2019s language abilities were at the mental retardation level, but were offset by strengths in \u201cpaying attention\u201d and visual perception. His \u201cfull scale\u201d I.Q. was eighty-three. Because of Ms lack of language skills, the defendant was at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>\u201cserious disadvantage\u201d in social functioning, emotional functioning, self-restraint, and self-awareness. Dr. Gansler testified that individuals who lack language skills solve problems \u201cphysically, and aggressively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Dr. Jacob Holzer, a psychiatrist, testified that the defendant suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder, and that when he ingested drugs and alcohol, these substances combined with his disorder, causing him to have obsessive, recurrent fantasies about sex and violence. According to Dr. Holzer, on the night in question, these thoughts became so vivid that the defendant lost the understanding that they were fantasies and entered a psychotic state. Dr. Holzer testified that the defendant was substantially unable to conform his behavior to the requirements of law (and therefore was not criminally responsible, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. 506, 507-508 [2000]), because of the combination of obsessive-compulsive disorder and intoxication, which triggered a psychotic state at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">2. <em>The defendant\u2019s criminal history. </em>On cross-examination, the prosecutor elicited from Dr. Gansler a description of antisocial personality disorder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On redirect, the following exchange took place between defense counsel and Dr. Gansler:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201c[Y]ou didn\u2019t make a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, did you?\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\"><em>A.: </em>\u201cI noted antisocial tendencies. Yes, I did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cYou don\u2019t know whether any of those [indications of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>antisocial personality disorder] are in fact things [the defendant] did on other occasions?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\"><em>A.: </em>\u201cNot all of them, no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cBut some because of this case, right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">A.: \u201cI did ask, I did get his criminal history, yes. I did know of something.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">On recross-examination, the prosecutor said, \u201cTell us what you learned about his criminal history.\u201d Over the def\u00e9ndant\u2019s objection, the judge permitted Dr. Gansler to confirm that the defendant had acknowledged \u201ca long history of trouble with the law\u201d and a five-year sentence for armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The Commonwealth asserts that the defendant \u201copened the door\u201d to this information by asking whether Dr. Gansler\u2019s notation of the defendant\u2019s antisocial tendencies was based on the defendant\u2019s actions in this case. We agree. Once trial counsel had \u201copened up\u201d the subject, the prosecutor was entitled to explore it in more detail. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Key, </em>381 Mass. 19, 28-29 (1980). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>407 Mass. 340, 352 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 411, 418 (2001). The judge instructed the jurors \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d immediately following the introduction of the prior convictions evidence that they , were not to infer from it that the defendant was guilty of these crimes, and we presume that jurors follow the judge\u2019s instructions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>435 Mass. 722, 732 (2002). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">3. <em>Closing argument. </em>The defendant next claims that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument contained improper appeals to emotion and a statement of the prosecutor\u2019s personal opinion of the defendant\u2019s guilt. The relevant portions consist of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">\u201cThey had a right to sleep in their bed without this man coming in there. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">\u201cYou have the conscience of the community. She had rights, she had the right to go to bed at night. She had the right to live. He took those rights. She called out, \u2018Daddy help me.\u2019 But her father was dead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">\u201cYou could answer the call for justice and hold [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>defendant] accountable for what he did. He\u2019s guilty as charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">As to the reference to the \u201cconscience of the community,\u201d there was no impropriety. Where a charge of murder in the first degree is based on the theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty, as it was in this case, the jurors serve as the conscience of the community in determining whether the killing merits that description. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 391 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzmeyer, </em>414 Mass. 540, 547 (1993). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 564, 573 (1991) (jurors, in rape case, \u201cbear no such burden; their role in a trial is limited to finding the facts on the basis of the evidence, dispassionately and impartially\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The remainder of the statements at issue, however, were improper. The remarks concerning the victims\u2019 rights were improper appeals to sympathy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lodge, </em>431 Mass. 461, 470-471 (2000), and cases cited. The next few sentences (\u201cShe called out, \u2018Daddy help me.\u2019 But her father was dead. You could answer the call for justice and hold [the defendant] accountable for what he did\u201d) managed to combine an improper exhortation that the jurors vindicate the victim with an improper appeal to sympathy through the suggestion that, although the victim\u2019s father could not help her, the jurors could. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>421 Mass. 90, 103 (1995), and cases cited. Finally, the statement, \u201cHe\u2019s guilty as charged,\u201d was an improper statement of personal belief. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>366 Mass. 705, 713-714 (1975). The Commonwealth\u2019s concessions that the remarks regarding the victims\u2019 rights were improper and that the comment regarding the call for justice \u201cwould have been better left unsaid,\u201d understate the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Improper statements by the prosecutor are reviewed for prejudicial error. In determining prejudice, we consider (1) whether the defendant seasonably objected; (2) the judge\u2019s instructions; (3) the centrality of the error; (4) the jury\u2019s ability to recognize hyperbole; and (5) the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>430 Mass. 505, 515 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>427 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Mass. 336, 351 (1998). \u201cThe cumulative effect of all the errors in the context of the entire arguments and the case as a whole is considered in making this determination.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 500 (1997), <em>S.C., 427 </em>Mass. 298, and 428 Mass. 39, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1003 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Of these errors, only the references to the victims\u2019 rights were objected to at trial. The judge provided no curative instructions in particular, but forcefirlly instructed the jurors both that \u201c[e] motion or sympathy for one side or the other have no place in these deliberations,\u201d and that they were the sole judges of the facts and should disregard any personal opinions expressed by counsel in closing argument. The central issue at trial was the defendant\u2019s sanity, and the errors in closing did not bear on that point. To a certain degree, jurors are expected to \u201cdiscount hyperbole and other improper statements,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 495, and the Commonwealth had a strong case for the defendant\u2019s appreciation of the wrongfulness of his actions and his ability to conform his behavior to the requirements of law, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. 506, 508 (2000): the defendant crawled in through a window in the middle of the night, grabbed the telephone away from Visneau when she dialed 911, and left Henry when he heard the police arrive, escaping through another window and hiding under a car to evade detection. He told police that he had hoped to steal money, and realized that he would have to kill the sisters because they could identify him. The defendant\u2019s own expert agreed that an attempt to prevent Visneau from dialing 911 would demonstrate both an \u00e1ppreciation for the wrongfulness of his actions and an ability to conform his conduct at that moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">On balance, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing did not prejudice the defendant. \u201c[W]e are not to be taken as condoning the prosecutor\u2019s statement,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>366 Mass. 705, 714 (1975), \u201c[b]ut even grossly improper statements by a prosecutor will not require a new trial when the evidence of guilt is overwhelming,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCravy, </em>430 Mass. 758, 765 (2000), citing <em>Darden </em>v. <em>Wainwright, 477 </em>U.S. 168, 182 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">4. <em>Jury instruction on voluntary drug use. </em>The defendant next complains that the judge erred in instructing the jury on the ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>feet of voluntary drug use on a claim of lack of criminal responsibility, with what is commonly referred to as a <em>Herd </em>instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Herd, </em>413 Mass. 834, 839-840 (1992). The defendant did not object at trial (in fact, he requested that a <em>Herd </em>instruction be given<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>), so we review the claim for a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 681 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">\u201c[Ijntoxication with either alcohol or drugs or both or drug addiction resulting from the voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs or both is not by itself a mental disease or defect that would support a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. . . . However, you may consider whether or not the defendant had a mental disease or defect separate and distinct from his drug or alcohol consumption and whether such m\u00e9ntal disease or defect existed at the time of the crimes independent of any temporary intoxication or high that the drugs or alcohol may have caused. In addition you may consider whether the defendant\u2019s voluntary consumption of drugs or alcohol or both activated a mental disease or defect apart from any addiction. If as a result of the activation of that mental disease or defect the defendant lost the substantial capacity to understand the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law, then he would lack criminal responsibility. However, if the Commonwealth proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant either knew or had reason to know that consumption of alcohol or drugs would activate a mental disease or defect, then the Commonwealth has met its burden of proving the defendant criminally responsible. It is not necessary that the Commonwealth prove that the defendant knew or had reason to know that he had a mental disease or defect as such so long as the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew or had reason to know that his intoxication from consumption of drugs and/or alcohol would trigger inappropriate conduct by him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The defendant argues that this instruction caused a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice because there was no evidence to suggest that the defendant knew or should have known that his alcohol and drug use would cause him to lose awareness that his violent and sexual fantasies were only fantasies. This is incorrect. Dr. Holzer, on direct examination, stated that the defendant had reported that, \u201cunlike most other occasions\u201d of his drug and alcohol use, on the night of the killing, he lost the realization that his obsessions were fantasies, and the boundary between fantasy and reality broke down for him. The jury properly could have inferred from the doctor\u2019s use of the word \u201cmost\u201d that this transformation had happened before, and that therefore the defendant either knew or should have known of that possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The defendant next claims error in the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that their determination of what the defendant \u201cshould have known\u201d is a subjective question that takes into account the possibility that the defendant\u2019s mental condition \u201cmight have interfered with his ability to understand what a normal person in the same situation would have reasonably understood.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruddock, </em>428 Mass. 288, 291 (1998). The defendant correctly claims that the judge should have made the subjective nature of the inquiry clear, see <em>id., </em>but there is no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice as a result of the oversight. As we explained in part 3, <em>supra, </em>the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence of the defendant\u2019s sanity was overwhelming. We are substantially confident that the jury\u2019s verdicts would have been the same had this error not occurred. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruddock, supra </em>at 291 n.2.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">5. <em>Motion for a new trial. </em>The defendant moved for a new trial when he discovered that a juror who had checked \u201cnone\u201d in response to the question on her juror questionnaire asking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>about any involvement as a party in a criminal case had been on a probationary continuance without a finding for a drug offense at the time of the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">After an evidentiary hearing at which counsel had the opportunity to present questions to the juror through the judge, the judge determined that the juror did not intentionally lie on the form but simply made a mistake, and also determined that she was credible when she testified that the matter never even occurred to her during the course of the trial. He found that if she had been asked about the matter before trial, she would have truthfully responded that it would not affect her ability to be a fair and impartial juror, and pointed out that if anything, her status as a criminal defendant in a drug case would have concerned the Commonwealth more than the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the judge concluded, \u201cI am confident, based upon my interview with [the juror], that she took her duties seriously and gave the defendant a fair trial.\u201d This determination is a question of fact that rests with the trial judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duran, </em>435 Mass. 97, 108 (2001). \u201cIn the absence of clear abuse of discretion or a showing that the judge\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous, the judge\u2019s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>399 Mass. 617, 626 (1987). Our review of the hearing reveals that the judge conducted a meaningful inquiry, and that he reasonably could have found the juror credible. The defendant has not carried his burden of showing an abuse of discretion or clear error here, and we will not set aside the judge\u2019s decision. See <em>id. </em>at 626-627.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">6. <em>G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>After reviewing the record in its entirety, we find that the verdict of murder in the first degree was supported by the evidence, and conclude there has been no miscarriage of justice. Therefore, we decline to grant relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-10\">The defendant was found guilty of murder in the first degree on theories of deliberate premeditation, extreme atrocity or cruelty, and felony-murder, with armed robbery as the underlying felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The sisters\u2019 father had died eight years earlier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b484-9\">The defendant does not contest the voluntariness of his statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Antisocial personality disorder is characterized primarily by a pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others, as indicated by repeatedly engaging in criminal acts, lying, aggressive behavior, and lack of remorse.
