In applying the role of mutually dependent covenants to the facts present in this case, we conclude that a landlord\u2019s failure to keep the roof of his building in good repair deprived the tenant of a substantial benefit significant to the purpose for which the lease was entered. Consequently, the tenant had the right to terminate the lease and recover reasonable relocation costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>The plaintiff landlord, John T. Wesson, trustee of Wesson Realty Trust, owned a multi-tenanted commercial building located in Danvers (Wesson building), in which the defendant tenant, Leone Enterprises, Inc., a financial printing company, rented space. The lease ran for five years, commencing on March 31, 1988.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The tenant first complained to the landlord about \u201csignificant leaks in the roof\u201d in April, 1991.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties met soon afterward and the tenant pointed out \u201cmore than one,\u201d but less than five, leaks in the premises. The landlord agreed to fix the roof and called on his son, Wayne Wesson, who periodically managed the building, to oversee the repairs. Wayne patched the roof himself. The leaks reappeared later that spring, and the landlord hired a professional roofing contractor to make further repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">In early August, 1991, the roof began leaking in some of the same places previously repaired. The tenant complained several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>times to the landlord and Wayne about the leaks, and claimed that he and his subtenant<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> were \u201cforced to take necessary precautions to protect [their] businesses from more water damage.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After these leaks were repaired by the landlord, the tenant notified him of another leak \u201cin a different location\u201d on September 6, 1991. This particular leak, however, was caused by a defective electrical conduit connected to the roof-top air conditioning unit, the maintenance of which was the tenant\u2019s responsibility under the lease.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The landlord had the roof inspected the next day by a professional roofer, who sealed the leak. There was no evidence at trial of any additional leaks or complaints of leaks after September 7, 1991.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">On November 4, 1991, the tenant notified the landlord that he would be \u201cvacating the premises on or before December 31, 1991,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> for reasons \u201cwell known to you. The constant lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>minimal heat as well as the serious leakage problem.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The tenant also paid rent in full through the end of 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">The landlord filed a complaint in the District Court alleging breach of contract and damage to the demised premises.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The case was transferred to the Superior Court on January 22, 1992. The tenant filed counterclaims for constructive eviction and deceptive business practices under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. The landlord then amended his complaint to add a claim against the tenant for interference with advantageous relations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">A jury-waived trial on the claims for breach of contract, interference with advantageous relations, and constructive eviction was held on November 24 and 25, 1997. After hearing testimony from the landlord, Wayne Wesson, the tenant, and the architect who designed the Wesson Building, the judge found the tenant\u2019s testimony \u201cregarding the frequency of his complaints about the leaky roof, the danger it posed upon his equipment and inventory and that he was forced to move out to be credible.\u201d In contrast, the judge found the testimony of Wayne Wesson and the landlord \u201cregarding their reasonable responses to whatever complaints they received about the leaking roof not credible.\u201d The judge further found that \u201cthe roof was in a state of disrepair and needed more than spot repairs\u201d; that \u201cwhether Wayne or a professional roofer attempted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>repairs, the methods used were shoddy and unsuccessful\u201d; and that, \u201cfrom April 1991 through November of 1991 [but see note 8, <em>supra], </em>[the tenant] complained to both [the landlord] and [Wayne] by telephone and by letter that the roof leaked and put his business at risk.\u201d Based on these findings, the judge concluded that the tenant had been constructively evicted from the premises by the landlord\u2019s failure to adequately repair the roof and was therefore relieved of its obligation to pay rent. Alternatively, she held that, even if the tenant had not been constructively evicted, the tenant could have lawfully withheld the rent under the dependent covenants rule, where the landlord had failed to provide a \u201cdry space,\u201d a service \u201cessential\u201d to the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Judgment entered in favor of the defendant tenant on the plaintiff landlord\u2019s breach of contract claim and on the tenant\u2019s counterclaim of constructive eviction. Relocation damages in the amount of $1,063 were awarded to the tenant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The landlord appealed, claiming the trial judge erred in (1) concluding that there was sufficient evidence to support the constructive eviction claim; and (2) applying the \u201cdependent covenants\u201d rule to the parties\u2019 commercial lease. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">We affirm the judgment for the defendant tenant, but for reasons different from those of the Superior Court judge. The judge\u2019s finding of constructive eviction was in error, but because we adopt the rule of mutually dependent covenants for commercial leases and conclude that the plaintiff landlord breached his covenant to maintain the roof, the tenant was entitled to terminate the lease and recover relocation costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>In a jury-waived trial, the judge\u2019s findings of fact are accepted unless they are clearly erroneous. See <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Selvaggio, </em>413 Mass. 619, 620 (1992), and cases cited. \u201cOn the other hand, to ensure that the ultimate findings and conclusions are consistent with the law, we scrutinize without deference the legal standard which the judge applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>the facts. . . . Thus, the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard of appellate review does not protect findings of fact or conclusions based on incorrect legal standards.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">3. <em>Constructive eviction. </em>The landlord bases his claim that the judge erred in finding a constructive eviction on two alternative grounds: first, that the lease required the tenant, not the landlord, to maintain the roof and therefore the tenant cannot claim constructive eviction due to the landlord\u2019s failure to make repairs, see <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>300 Mass. 450, 454-455 (1938)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>; and second, that even if the lease required the landlord to maintain the roof, his actions or failures did not rise to the level of constructive eviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The landlord\u2019s contention that the terms of the lease make the tenant responsible for maintaining the roof is an argument made first on appeal and is therefore waived. In any event, the judge\u2019s implicit finding that it was the landlord\u2019s obligation under the lease to keep the roof in good repair is fully supported by the evidence, including the landlord\u2019s testimony at trial that \u201cit was [his] obligation under this lease to maintain the roof ... in perfect working order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">We next consider whether the landlord\u2019s actions regarding the leaky roof constituted a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment amounting to the constructive eviction of the tenant. Where there is a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, the tenant may raise constructive eviction as a defense to an action to recover rent. See <em>Shindler </em>v. <em>Milden, </em>282 Mass. 32, 33-34 (1933). A constructive eviction is any \u201cact of a permanent character, done by the landlord, or by his procurement, with the intention and effect of depriving the tenant of the enjoyment of the premises demised, or of a part thereof, to which he yields and abandons possession,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 33, and cases cited, \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra </em>at 455 It is the tenant\u2019s burden to prove that he was constructively evicted. <em>Rome </em>v. <em>Johnson, 274 </em>Mass. 444, 450 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>In ascertaining whether there has been a constructive eviction, it is \u201cthe landlord\u2019s conduct,\u201d and not his subjective intention, that \u201cis controlling.\u201d <em>Blackett </em>v. <em>Olanoff, </em>371 Mass. 714, 716 (1977). Therefore, a constructive eviction may be found even where a landlord did not intend to violate a tenant\u2019s rights, as the law assumes that the landlord intends \u201cthe natural and probable consequence of what [he] did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, not every act or failure to act on the part of the landlord that causes disruption to a tenant rises to the level of a constructive eviction. To constitute a constructive eviction, the act must have \u201csome degree of substance and permanence of character.\u201d <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Long, </em>295 Mass. 201, 204 (1936). Thus, a landlord\u2019s failure to provide a service that is essential to the use and enjoyment of the demised premises may qualify as a constructive eviction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Yet, conduct that does \u201cnot make the premises untenantable for the purposes for which they were used\u201d will not constitute constructive eviction. <em>A.W. Banister Co. </em>v. <em>P.J.W. Moodie Lumber Corp., </em>286 Mass. 424, 426 (1934) (landlord\u2019s breach of express covenant to supply steam to dry lumber \u201csimply made the use [of the leased premises] less convenient and more expensive\u201d and \u201c[djamages for breach of covenant ... afforded an adequate remedy\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">In this case, the judge found that the landlord failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>adequately maintain the roof, and that, as a consequence, there were periodic leaks during the course of the tenancy. While this finding was supported by the evidence, it is not dispositive of the constructive eviction claim. The tenant was also required to prove that the leaks made \u201cthe premises untenantable for the purposes for which they were used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On this point, the tenant\u2019s evidence was inadequate as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The evidence of untenantability at trial consisted of testimony that (1) there were leaks \u201cright on top\u201d of one of the \u201chigh-tech,\u201d expensive cameras and that after \u201cthe camera got wet\u201d it was covered with plastic sheeting so it would not get wet again; (2) a customer\u2019s preprinted paper stock was protected with plastic sheeting after a leak had \u201cdampened the top portion\u201d of his \u201cskids of paper\u201d; and (3) at times \u201cthe ceiling tiles got so wet that they . . . crumbled and fell out.\u201d There was no evidence that the leaks caused work stoppages, resulted in missed or delayed customer deliveries, or otherwise prevented the tenant from carrying on business.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The tenant continued to conduct business from the time it first complained of the leaks in April, 1991, through the time the tenant moved out sometime after November 4, 1991. While the landlord\u2019s breach of his covenant to repair may have made the tenant\u2019s operation less convenient and more expensive, based on the evidence adduced at trial, it did not rise to the level of a constructive eviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">4. <em>Application of the dependent covenants rule. </em>At common law, covenants in leases were considered \u201cindependent, in the absence of clear indications to the contrary, and the lessee [was] relieved from performance of his covenants only by actual or constructive eviction.\u201d <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Frankini, </em>287 Mass. 196, 201 (1934). See Restatement (Second) of Property (Landlord and Tenant) Introductory Note to c. 7 (1977) (\u201cAt old common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>the promises made by a landlord in a lease were independent obligations, so that the failure of the landlord to perform them did not give the tenant any right to disregard his obligations under the lease\u201d). The independent covenants rule applied to both residential and commercial leases and was based on the assumption that \u201ca lease is primarily a conveyance of an interest in real estate,\u201d <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Hemingway, </em>363 Mass. 184, 194 (1973), and \u201creflected the parties\u2019 expectations in a rural agrarian society where the right to possession of the land constituted the chief element of the exchange.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189. \u201cThe theory of a lease as a conveyance . . . fitted in well with the ancient farm lease. The lease was essentially of land; the house was incidental. Tenant got no services from landlord and expected none. Tenant was there, landlord absent. Tenant had tools that he was well versed in using. He could make such repairs as might be necessary.\u201d 1 M.R. Friedman, Leases \u00a7 1.1 at 5-6 (4th ed. 1997). As a result, \u201c[e]yen if the landlord made express maintenance promises in the lease, courts often held that the landlord\u2019s breach of these \u2018secondary\u2019 obligations did not affect the tenant\u2019s obligation to pay rent.\u201d <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Hemingway, supra. </em>This apparent unfairness was balanced under the same doctrine by the inability of the landlord to recover possession of his property from a tenant even if the tenant breached its covenant to pay rent. Both lessor and lessee were limited in their remedies to seeking damages for breach of the lease covenants. See Note, Modernizing Commercial Lease Law: The Case for an Implied Warranty of Fitness, 19 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 929, 934 (1985). Any equilibrium that may have existed in this application of the rule was lost with the enactment of statutory dispossession actions, permitting landlords to regain possession of the premises if the tenant failed to pay rent even though the landlord may have breached express covenants within the lease. See, e.g., G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 11 (landlord entitled to recover possession on neglect or refusal to pay rent due under written lease).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Exceptions to the independent covenants rule first emerged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>the context of residential leases at the end of the Nineteenth Century. In 1892, this court held that the rule did not apply to the lease of \u201ca furnished room or a furnished house for a few days or a few weeks or months.\u201d <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>156 Mass. 348, 350 (1892). The rationale for this exception \u201crested on the broader premise that we would not apply the independent covenants rule in those cases where the essential purpose of the lease was not the transfer of an interest in land but the use of the demised premises for immediate occupation.\u201d <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Hemingway, supra </em>at 191. As it applied to residential leases, the independent covenants rule was completely supplanted in 1973, when we recognized that a residential \u201clease is essentially a contract between the landlord and the tenant wherein the landlord promises to deliver and maintain the demised premises in habitable condition and the tenant promises to pay rent for such habitable premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198. \u201cThese promises constitute interdependent and mutual considerations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">That decision was consistent with the national trend in residential leases away from interpretations based on classic property law doctrine that treated leases as \u201cconveyances,\u201d and toward modem notions of leases as contracts for the possession of property, and modern notions of consumer protection. In these respects, it was based on the landmark case of <em>Javins </em>v. <em>First Nat\u2019l Realty Corp., </em>428 F.2d 1071, 1078-1079 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925 (1970), which noted a number of reasons for departing from the common-law rule in residential leases, including (1) the tenant\u2019s shift in interest from the land itself to the buildings on the land; (2) the tenant\u2019s inability to make repairs himself, unlike \u201cthe \u2018j ack-of-all-trades \u2019 farmer who was the common law\u2019s model of the lessee\u201d; (3) the lack of incentive for the tenant to make repairs, given the relatively short duration of the lease; (4) the difficulty in repairing complex buildings and the need to access areas under the landlord\u2019s control; and (5) the tenant\u2019s inability to obtain financing for major repairs because \u201cthey have no long-term interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>property.\u201d This trend culminated in the almost universally recognized warranty of habitability implied in residential leases. See Vlatas, An Economic Analysis of Implied Warranties of Fitness in Commercial Leases, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 658, 658-659 (1994); Bopp, The Unwarranted Implication of a Warranty of Fitness in Commercial Leases \u2014 An Alternative Approach, 41 Vand. L. Rev. 1057, 1057 (1988); Note, Modernizing Commercial Lease Law: The Case for an Implied Warranty of Fitness, <em>supra </em>at 930-931.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">The development of the law of commercial leases has followed divergent paths. See Bopp, <em>supra </em>at 1069-1080; Note, Modernizing Commercial Lease Law: The Case for an Implied Warranty of Fitness, <em>supra </em>at 945-949. Some courts interpret commercial leases as they would any other commercial contract<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>; while others have taken a step in that direction by abolishing the independent covenants rule in favor of a rule of mutually dependent covenants.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Still other courts have acted at the extremes, either by continuing strictly to apply the independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>covenants rule,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> or by moving to the other end of the spectrum and recognizing an implied warranty of suitability in commercial leases.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> While we conclude that there is a need to move away from the rule of independent covenants, we continue to recognize that there are significant differences between commercial and residential tenancies and the policy considerations appropriate to each.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The landlord claims that the judge erred by applying the dependent covenants rule to the parties\u2019 lease and concluding that the landlord\u2019s failure \u201cto provide an essential service, a dry space\u201d would have permitted the tenant \u201clawfully [to withhold] rent had he not vacated the Wesson building.\u201d He contends that this court has not supplanted the independent covenants rule in Massachusetts, and therefore a commercial landlord\u2019s breach of the covenant to repair does not relieve the tenant of his covenant to pay rent. See <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>300 Mass. 450, 454 (1938); <em>In re J.A.G., Inc., 1 </em>B.R. 624, 627 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1980).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>noted previously, the premise underlying the continued viability of the independent covenants rule is that a commercial lease is a conveyance of property where the right to possession of the land constitutes the chief element of the exchange. This premise no longer comports with the reality of the typical modem commercial lease, which is intended to secure the right to occupy improvements to the land rather than the land itself, and which usually contemplates a continuing flow of necessary services from landlord to tenant, services that are normally under the landlord\u2019s control. See 1 M.R. Friedman, Leases \u00a7 1.1 (4th ed. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">We conclude that the better rule is the rule of mutually dependent covenants set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Property (Landlord and Tenant) \u00a7 7.1 (1977), the principles of which we adopt to the extent necessary to resolve the issues in this case. Specifically, we adopt so much of the Restatement that provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">\u201cExcept to the extent the parties to a lease validly agree otherwise, if the landlord fails to perform a valid promise contained in the lease to do, or to refrain from doing, something . . . and as a consequence thereof, the tenant is deprived of a significant inducement to the making of the lease, and if the landlord does not perform his promise within a reasonable period of time after being requested to do so, the tenant may (1) terminate the lease . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">\u201cThe mle of this section ... is based on a logical extension of the position taken by a significant number of judicial decisions which have applied the [dependence of obligations] doctrine in connection with the failure of the landlord to fulfill his obligations in regard to the condition of the leased property.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Property (Landlord and Tenant), <em>supra </em>at \u00a77.1 Reporter\u2019s Note at 252. It also reflects our view of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>better reasoned path to follow in modernizing the law of commercial leases.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Having adopted a rule of mutually dependent covenants, we now consider whether the tenant was entitled to vacate the premises prior to the lease termination date in light of our earlier conclusion that no constructive eviction occurred.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The requirements of the rule we have adopted today are different from the requirements necessary to demonstrate a constructive eviction. For example, the rule does not require that the premises be \u201cuntenantable for the purposes for which they were used,\u201d in order for the tenant to terminate the lease and vacate the premises. It is sufficient for the tenant to demonstrate the landlord\u2019s failure, after notice, to perform a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>promise that was a significant inducement to the tenant\u2019s entering the lease in the first instance. We interpret this language to include promises that constitute a substantial benefit understood at the time the lease was entered to be significant to the propose thereof. <em>Richard Barton Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Tsern, </em>923 P.2d 368, 378 (Utah 1996) (covenant to pay rent dependent on lessor\u2019s performance of covenants that were significant inducement to enter lease or significant to \u201cthe purpose for which the lessee entered into the lease\u201d). Here that substantial benefit was a dry space necessary to safely conduct the high technology printing business for which the landlord knew the premises were to be used. In other cases, it might include promises having little to do with the condition of the premises, such as an agreement not to lease space in the same building to competing businesses. See <em>Teodori </em>v. <em>Werner, </em>490 Pa. 58, 65 (1980) (landlord\u2019s non-competition promise critical to commercial lease agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Based on the judge\u2019s findings of fact, all of the requirements of the rule have been met in this case: the landlord breached his covenant to maintain the roof by failing to adequately repair its chronic leaking; the breach directly interfered with the tenant\u2019s business by depriving it of a substantial benefit significant to the purpose of the lease; and, after adequate notice, the landlord\u2019s efforts to correct the problem were both \u201cshoddy and unsuccessful.\u201d The tenant was entitled to terminate the lease and recover relocation costs in the amount determined by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">5. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment and award of damages to the tenant defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b731-9\">The initial rent for the 12,000 square foot space was $8,186 per month ($6,250 per month in base rent plus thirty-four per cent of the operating fees and expenses of the Wesson building).

These are not the circumstances of the mie we adopt in this case. The abandonment of the rule of independent covenants in commercial leases has been foreshadowed at least since our 1973 decision in <em>Boston Hous.

In the interim, the Restatement (Second) of Property (Landlord and Tenant) (1977) adopted the mle of dependent covenants, and the lack of continued vitality in Massachusetts of the role of independent covenants has been foreshadowed in cases decided by the Appeals Court, <em>Holmes Realty Trust </em>v. <em>Granite City Storage Co., supra, </em>and by the Federal court, <em>Reed </em>v. <em>United States Postal Serv., supra. </em>In these circumstances, commercial landlords and tenants have had ample warning and opportunity to anticipate such a change and to incorporate appropriate provisions in their lease agreements. The concern for reliance on unquestioned precedent is simply not present here. Consequently, we apply the mie to the lease in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
