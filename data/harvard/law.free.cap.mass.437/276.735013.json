L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32, and distribution of the substance within 1,000 feet of a school, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J. On the day scheduled for trial, a judge in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Boston Municipal Court: (a) excluded the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence concerning school zone measurements and drug analysis of the substances seized; and (b) conducted a brief jury-waived proceeding over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, after which the judge entered a required finding of not guilty on the complaint. The Commonwealth appropriately sought relief from these determinations pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowder, </em>432 Mass. 92, 93-94 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Super, </em>431 Mass. 492, 495 n.5 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>410 Mass. 498, 499 (1991). A single justice of this court denied relief from the exclusion order, and then reserved and reported the case on three issues relating to the proceeding that resulted in the required finding of not guilty, including whether the defendant was placed in jeopardy. The Commonwealth appealed from the denial of the portion of its petition under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking relief from the exclusion order. We vacate the exclusion order and the required finding of not guilty. A judgment will enter in the county court on the Commonwealth\u2019s petition which embodies this relief and places the complaint before the Boston Municipal Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">The background of the case is as follows. A pretrial conference was held on the complaint on May 1, 2000, and, as far as matters here, it was agreed, in a pretrial conference report, that the Commonwealth would provide the defendant\u2019s trial counsel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with \u201cdrug analysis\u201d and \u201cmeasurements; [identification] materials; [and] drug certificates].\u201d The compliance date on the pretrial conference report was listed as \u201c5/22/00,\u201d after which was written \u201cunagreed.\u201d Because the defendant was on probation at the time of his arrest, a probation surrender hearing was scheduled for June 8, 2000, with a trial on the merits of the complaint to proceed thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Before the probation surrender hearing commenced, counsel for both the Commonwealth and the defendant reported \u201cready for trial.\u201d During the probation surrender hearing, the Commonwealth offered police testimony concerning the events forming the basis for the defendant\u2019s arrest and drug certificates analyzing the substances seized at the scene of the alleged drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>transaction. The judge found no probation violation, noting \u201cthree different stories coming from three different [police] officers;\u201d one officer\u2019s distance from the defendant at the time of the alleged drug transaction; and a lack of testimony \u201cthat would connect [the drugs seized] to [the defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Thereafter, the judge spoke with counsel. Defense counsel informed the judge that the defendant would waive his right to a jury trial. The Commonwealth informed the judge that a different prosecutor would be trying the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">That afternoon, the parties arrived for trial. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude all evidence concerning the school zone measurements and drug analysis because this evidence had not been disclosed by the prosecution on or before May 22, 2000. The defendant claimed he would be prejudiced by the evidence because it deprived him of the opportunity to conduct an \u201cindependent investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The prosecutor pointed out that the compliance date of May 22, 2000, had not been agreed on, but acknowledged that the Commonwealth was obligated to provide defense counsel with the requested evidence. The prosecutor stated that the requested evidence was available and offered to turn it over to defense counsel immediately. The judge allowed the motion in limine, rejecting the prosecutor\u2019s offer as not \u201cgood enough,\u201d and explained: \u201cYou can\u2019t have a situation on the day of trial, [where] discovery hasn\u2019t been turned over, especially this crucial, crucial type of discovery which goes to the heart of the school zone charge which is enhancing of a significant nature [if] this defendant\u2019s found guilty of the underlying charge . . . .\u201d The judge added: \u201cI\u2019ve told your office, not you specifically, but your office time and time again and over and over until I\u2019m talking like I\u2019m hoarse that discovery in these matters is crucial. Discovery in every criminal case is crucial and [is] to be turned over in a timely manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">The judge then asked the prosecutor if she was ready for trial. The prosecutor stated that, in light of the excluded evidence, the Commonwealth was not ready for trial. The judge stated that the case was going forward. He asked defense counsel whether the trial would be a jury trial. Defense counsel stated the trial would be jury waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The prosecutor moved to recuse the judge on the ground that he had \u201calready preestablished [at the probation surrender hearing] a finding as to the credibility of the officers\u201d involved in the case. The judge denied the motion, stating that he had not \u201cfound anything concerning the credibility of the officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">The judge next proceeded to establish that the defendant had voluntarily waived his right to a jury trial. After that, he directed the prosecutor to call her first witness. The prosecutor stated she could not move for trial based on the allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion in limine. Defense counsel moved for a required finding of not guilty. The prosecutor objected to the procedure: \u201cIf your Honor wishes to dismiss the case for noncomplian[ce] with discovery I would suggest that would certainly be an appropriate action at this time. Having not moved for trial, I don\u2019t know how we can have a directed verdict.\u201d The judge then suggested that defense counsel call a witness, to avoid a dismissal without prejudice. The judge explained that, to rule on the motion for a required finding, and for jeopardy to attach, \u201cthere has to be a witness called and a witness sworn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, defense counsel called the defendant\u2019s daughter to testify. The daughter was sworn, stated her name and testified that the defendant is her father. Defense counsel then indicated that she had no further questions, and moved for a required finding of not guilty. The judge allowed the motion over the prosecutor\u2019s objection. The Commonwealth\u2019s petition under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">1. The order excluding the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence pertaining to the school zone measurements and drug analysis was erroneous. The order is, in essence, an inappropriate sanction for the Commonwealth\u2019s alleged failure to provide discovery to the defendant in keeping with the pretrial conference report. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (c), 378 Mass. 874 (1979). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Pope, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 627, 630 n.3 (1985) (\u201cAgreements in written pretrial conference reports may be the equivalent of discovery orders,\u201d and, thus, subject to rule 14 [c]). No clear date for compliance, however, was specified in the report, as manifested by the \u201cunagreed\u201d endorsement entered next to the requested compliance date. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>the defendant repeated that, notwithstanding lack of discovery, he was ready for trial on the day scheduled for trial. He was aware of the analysis contained in the drug certificates and of the school zone measurements. The defendant\u2019s counsel never sought a continuance to make an \u201cindependent investigation.\u201d There is also no demonstration by the defendant of even a hint of prejudice to his case. Specifically, there is no showing that the drug analysis was wrong or that the measurements were inaccurate. Nor is there anything to indicate that the Commonwealth acted intentionally or in bad faith. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>395 Mass. 20, 24 (1985), and cases cited. Certainly, less severe and more appropriate remedies were available, and should have been invoked. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (c) (1). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dranka, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 38, 42 (1998), quoting <em>Chappee </em>v. <em>Vose, </em>843 F.2d 25, 31 (1st Cir. 1988) (acknowledging that sanction of excluding evidence \u201cshould be reserved for \u2018hard core transgressions\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The error was exacerbated by the judge\u2019s lightning rush to sanction the Commonwealth, and then immediately to call the case to trial, in an effort unjustly to deprive the Commonwealth of its right to pursue an interlocutory appeal pursuant to Mass.R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (2) and (b) (1), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996) (providing aggrieved party ten days from \u201cthe issuance of notice of the order being appealed\u201d to file application for leave to appeal \u201can order determining a motion to suppress evidence prior to trial\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>401 Mass. 133, 135 (1987) (applying rule to motion in limine and stating \u201cif a motion to <em>exclude </em>all or most of the Commonwealth\u2019s incriminating evidence is allowed, and if, as a practical matter, that ruling [if permitted to stand] would terminate the prosecution, the Commonwealth may seek leave to appeal pursuant to [rule 15 (a) (2)]\u201d). This action appears, deliberate, as the judge undoubtedly was aware of Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (c), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996) (\u201cAny motion the determination of which may be appealed pursuant to this rule shall be decided by the judge before the defendant is placed in jeopardy under established rules of law\u201d), and Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (e), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996) (\u201cIf the trial court issues an order which is subject to the interlocu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>tory procedures herein, the trial of the case shall be stayed and the defendant shall not be placed in jeopardy until interlocutory review has been waived or the period specified in [the rule] for instituting interlocutory procedures has expired\u201d). Judicial action to circumvent a rule is inappropriate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">2. The defendant was not placed in jeopardy at the proceeding. The general principles governing jeopardy are straightforward. Under the double jeopardy doctrine, a defendant cannot be prosecuted a second time for the same offense after having been acquitted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 278, 283 (1993). In a bench trial, \u201cjeopardy attaches when the court begins to hear evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ludwig, </em>370 Mass. 31, 33 (1976), quoting <em>Serfass </em>v. <em>United States, </em>420 U.S. 377, 388 (1975). \u201c[T]he purposes of, and the policies which animate, the Double Jeopardy Clause... are clear. \u2018The constitutional prohibition against \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d was designed to protect an individual from being subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for an alleged offense. . . . The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Serfass </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 387-388, quoting <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 187-188 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Not every \u201cacquittal\u201d constitutes an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Babb, </em>389 Mass. 275, 281 (1983). A true acquittal requires a verdict on \u201cthe facts and merits.\u201d G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 7. This requirement was explained in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 571 (1977): \u201c[Wjhat constitutes an \u2018acquittal\u2019 is not to be controlled by the form of the judge\u2019s action. . . . Rather, we must determine whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u201d See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 96 (1978), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 478 n.7 (1971) (opinion of Harlan, J.) (observing that \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s characterization of his own action cannot control the classification of the action\u201d); <em>Serfass </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 391-392 (\u201cWithout risk of a determination of guilt, jeopardy does not attach, and neither an appeal nor further prosecution constitutes double jeopardy\u201d). Thus, before according protection from double jeopardy based on an \u201cacquittal,\u201d or its functional equivalent, we are obligated to look beyond the judge\u2019s characterization of his action to determine the legal substance of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">'In this case, the judge announced that the proceeding constituted a trial \u201cbecause I\u2019m saying it is.\u201d However, the judge\u2019s actions effectively ensured that there was no \u201ctrial\u201d on \u201cthe facts and merits.\u201d He first, as previously explained, erroneously excluded the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and deprived the prosecutor of the right to an appeal provided by Mass. R. Crim. P. 15, as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1995). The judge then urged defense counsel (who obliged) to call a witness so that the judge could terminate the prosecution with an assurance that jeopardy had attached. The witness\u2019s testimony, identifying the defendant as her father, had no bearing on the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. The defendant was never in danger of conviction. Because there was no trial on the merits, and no risk of the defendant\u2019s conviction, jeopardy did not attach. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Friend, </em>393 Mass. 310, 314 (1984). The proceeding constituted an artifice designed to punish the Commonwealth, and it did not, in any realistic way, comport with the policy underlying the rule of double jeopardy. We would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>exalt form over substance if we impressed a constitutional imperative on a proceeding which \u201cscarcely [demonstrates] a picture of an all-powerful [S]tote relentlessly pursuing a defendant who had either been found not guilty or who had at least insisted on having the issue of guilt submitted to the first trier of fact.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, supra </em>at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">While the judge was understandably frustrated with the prosecutor for failing to comply with discovery requirements prior to trial, his rulings deprived the public of its interest \u201cin just disposition of the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hosmer, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 188, 191 (2000). See <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>471 U.S. 773, 796 (1985) (O\u2019Connor, J\u201e concurring) (\u201cDecisions by this Court have consistently recognized that the finality guaranteed by the Double Jeopardy Clause is not absolute, but instead must accommodate the societal interest in prosecuting and convicting those who violate the law\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, supra </em>at 100, quoting <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 509 (1978) (public has \u201cvalued right to \u2018one complete opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws\u2019 \u201d). Also, the judge\u2019s deliberately timed actions improperly sought to cut off any appellate review, thus circumscribing the public\u2019s interest in judicial accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Double jeopardy principles will often foreclose any remedy for, or shield from review, a trial judge\u2019s errors or misconduct. See, e.g., <em>Sanabria </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S. 54, 58-59, 68-69 (1978) (despite judge\u2019s erroneous exclusion of key portion of prosecutor\u2019s case against defendant, judge\u2019s directed verdict of acquittal barred reprosecution of offense); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Super, </em>431 Mass. 492, 496-497 (2000) (despite judge\u2019s abuse of discretion in failing to grant Commonwealth\u2019s motion for continuance, jeopardy attached when jurors were empanelled and sworn, thus requiring defendant\u2019s acquittal); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemmons, </em>370 Mass. 288, 293-295 (1976) (reversing defendant\u2019s conviction on double jeopardy grounds despite judge\u2019s error). Nevertheless, the shield is not impenetrable. In appropriate circumstances, an appellate court will scrutinize a trial judge\u2019s label of \u201cacquittal,\u201d and conclude that the action was not an \u201cacquittal\u201d for double jeopardy purposes. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>617 F.2d 1358, 1362 (9th Cir.), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>denied sub nom. <em>Patel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>449 U.S. 899 (1980) (judge\u2019s \u201cacquittal\u201d based on unavailability of material witness was appealable order of dismissal); <em>People </em>v. <em>Deems, </em>81 Ill. 2d 384, 390-391 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 925 (1981) (concluding that \u201cacquittal\u201d after trial, at which defendant was only witness sworn but did not testify, was not \u201cacquittal\u201d for double jeopardy purposes); <em>Pastrana </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>55 N.Y.2d 315, 319 (1982) (concluding \u201cacquittal\u201d was not \u201cacquittal\u201d for double jeopardy purposes because proceedings did not constitute adjudication of facts). We agree with these decisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> One commentator has aptly summed up the situation in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u201cThe appellate courts should examine the trial procedures that disadvantaged the prosecution, to determine whether the defendant was indeed at risk of conviction. If the trial court structured a procedure that had a superficial appearance of placing the defendant in jeopardy but did not offer the prosecution a realistic opportunity to present its case, the court should treat the case as one in which jeopardy never attached. The appellate courts should allow the prosecution to pursue review of the trial court\u2019s rulings or further prosecution of the defendant. While trial judges should be permitted to protect defendants through rulings that are subject to appellate review, such as dismissal of the charges, they should not be permitted to manipulate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>trial procedure to defeat the public interests in an opportunity to pursue a conviction and in judicial accountability. A sham proceeding . . . does not put the defendant to trial before the fact finder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Poulin, Double Jeopardy and Judicial Accountability: When is an Acquittal Not an Acquittal?, 27 Ariz. St. L.J. 953, 969 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Finally, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowder, </em>432 Mass. 92 (2000), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Super, </em>431 Mass. 492 (2000), are controlling. These cases are distinguishable. In both the <em>Lowder </em>and <em>Super </em>cases, a jury had been empanelled and sworn, thus invoking the defendants\u2019 double jeopardy \u201cinterest[s] in retaining a chosen jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>426 Mass. 617, 624 (1998). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowder, supra </em>at 93, 105; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Super, supra </em>at 494-495. In <em>Lowder, </em>the prosecutor had delivered his opening statement, and was fully ready to present his case to the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowder, supra </em>at 93. In <em>Super, </em>although the prosecutor had originally indicated that his witnesses were unavailable for trial on such short notice, he later informed the judge that one of his witnesses, \u201calthough displeased . . . would come when requested to do so,\u201d and did not inform the judge that he was unable to secure a different police officer to testify (the judge had suggested that he call another police officer to testify because the officer the prosecutor wanted to testify was not a percipient witness). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Super, supra </em>at 493-494. Neither of these cases involved a sham trial such as we have here.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">3. A judgment is to enter in the county court vacating the order denying the Commonwealth relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, on the exclusion order of the Boston Municipal Court, and then vacating the exclusion order. The judgment shall also set aside the entry of a required finding of not guilty on complaint no. 2000-CR-953, and direct that the case stand on the existing complaint for further proceedings in the Boston Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The defendant is represented by new counsel in the present proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The single justice denied the Commonwealth\u2019s G.

We agree that that remedy <em>should </em>have been available to the Commonwealth, but where the judge\u2019s actions erroneously deprived the Commonwealth of its opportunity to pursue that remedy, relief may be pursued under G.
