The question is one of first impression in the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">A. <em>Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">On November 8, 1995, sixteen year old Merav Sharon was injured while participating in a cheerleading practice at Newton North High School. Merav fell from a teammate\u2019s shoulders while rehearsing a pyramid formation cheer and sustained a serious compound fracture to her left arm that required surgery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of her injury, Merav had had four seasons of cheer-leading experience at the high school level.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">On November 5, 1998, having reached the age of majority, Merav filed suit against the city of Newton (city), alleging negligence (Count I) and the negligent hiring and retention of the cheerleading coach (Count II).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The city filed its answer on December 24, 1998. In late October, 1999, during the course of discovery, the city came across a document entitled \u201cParental Consent, Release from Liability and Indemnity Agreement\u201d signed by Merav and her father in August, 1995, approximately three months prior to the injury. The relevant part of the release reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-12\">\u201c[I] the undersigned [father] ... of Merav Sharon, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>minor, do hereby consent to [her] participation in voluntary athletic programs and do forever RELEASE, acquit, discharge, and covenant to hold harmless the City of Newton . . . from any and all actions, causes of action, [and] claims ... on account of, or in any way growing out of, directly or indirectly, all known and unknown personal injuries or property damage which [I] may now or hereafter have as the parent ... of said minor, and also all claims or right of action for damages which said minor has or hereafter may acquire, either before or after [she] has reached [her] majority resulting . . . from [her] participation in the Newton Public Schools Physical Education Department\u2019s athletic programs . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The city filed a motion for summary judgment raising the signed release as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Merav filed an opposition to the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment in which she argued that, because the release had not been raised as an affirmative defense in the city\u2019s answer, it should be deemed waived. Shortly thereafter, the city filed a motion to amend its answer in order to add the release as an affirmative defense. One judge in the Superior Court allowed the city\u2019s motion to amend on June 30, 2000, and a second judge subsequently allowed the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on the validity of the release.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In her ruling, the judge concluded that \u201c[a] contrary ruling would detrimentally chill a school\u2019s ability to offer voluntary athletic and other extracurricular programs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aeo\">Merav filed a timely appeal claiming that (1) the motion judge abused her discretion by allowing the city to amend its answer late; (2) the grant of summary judgment was inappropriate because genuine issues of material fact remained in dispute; and (3) the release signed by Merav and her father was invalid because (a) she disavowed it on attaining her majority<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; (b) the release violates public policy; (c) the release is contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2; and (d) the release is invalid for lack of consideration. We transferred the case here on our own motion and now affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of the city.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">B. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">1. <em>Amendment of the city\u2019s answer. </em>Merav claims that the allowance of the city\u2019s untimely motion to amend its answer was prejudicial error and that, because the city failed to raise the release as an affirmative defense in its original answer, the defense should be deemed waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">It is well established that the defense of a release must be raised as an affirmative defense and that the omission of an affirmative defense from an answer generally constitutes a waiver of that defense. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 8 (c), 365 Mass. 749 (1974); <em>Leahy </em>v. <em>Local 1526, Am. Fed\u2019n of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, </em>399 Mass. 341, 351-352 (1987), citing J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 8.6, at 797-798 (1974 &amp; Supp. 1986); <em>Coastal Oil New England, Inc. </em>v. <em>Citizens Fuels Corp., </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 26, 29 n.3 (1995). It is equally well settled that a party may amend its pleading by leave of court and that such leave \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 (a), 365 Mass. 761 (1974). See <em>Foman </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962) (interpreting identical language in Federal rule and stating mandate that leave to amend \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires\u201d is to be heeded).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Merav contends that the combination of undue delay and prejudice to her case should have led the judge to deny the city\u2019s motion to amend. While we have often upheld a judge\u2019s discretion to deny leave to amend based in part on undue delay, such denials have generally been coupled with consideration of other factors such as imminence of trial and futility of the claim sought to be added. See, e.g., <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Brimfield, </em>423 Mass. 152, 157 (1996); <em>Mathis </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co., </em>409 Mass. 256, 264 (1991); <em>Castellucci </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>372 Mass. 288, 292 (1977). Given that the amendment in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>case did not raise a new issue on the eve of trial and could not be considered futile or irrelevant to the city\u2019s defense, the judge did not abuse her discretion in granting the motion to amend the city\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">2. <em>Summary Judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">By proffering the release signed by Merav and her father releasing the city from any claims that Merav might acquire from her participation in the city\u2019s athletic program, the city has met its initial burden of demonstrating that Merav\u2019s negligence claim is likely to be precluded at trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In response, Merav contends both that there are issues of material fact in dispute regarding the validity of the release, and that it is unenforceable as a matter of law and public policy. We conclude that the facts Merav contends are in dispute are not material, enforcement of the release is consistent with our law and public policy, and Newton is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">a. <em>Merav\u2019s factual contentions. </em>Merav first argues that there are disputed issues of material fact regarding her understanding of the release and its voluntariness. She contends that neither she nor her father realized that by signing the release they were waiving their future claims against the school, and that their understanding of what they signed is a matter of fact to be decided by a jury. As the motion judge properly noted, \u201c[i]t is a rule in this Commonwealth that the failure to read or to understand the contents of a release, in the absence of fraud or duress, does not avoid its effects.\u201d <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Allied Sports Assocs., Inc., </em>349 Mass. 544, 550-551 (1965). The undisputed evidence supports the conclusion that both Merav and her father had ample opportunity to read and understand the release before signing it, and they are therefore deemed to have understood it. <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Central Mass. Chapter of the Nat\u2019l Safety Council, </em>416 Mass. 286, 289 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The release is a clearly labeled, two-sided document, which Merav brought home from school for her parents to review. Merav and her father both signed the front of the release, which they indicated was for the sport of \u201ccheerleading.\u201d In addition,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>they filled out the back of the release that called for Information regarding Merav\u2019s address, date of birth, health insurance provider, and emergency contacts, and that provided for the purchase of optional student accident insurance through the school (an option that they explicitly declined on the form). Her father also signed the back of the release giving parental consent to a physical examination of Merav prior to her participation in the cheerleading program. In these respects, the circumstances differ substantially from the so-called \u201cbaggage check\u201d or \u201cticket\u201d cases relied on by Merav in which a customer merely purchases a ticket or receives a receipt that contains release language. See <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Allied Sports Assocs., Inc., supra; O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Freeman, 299 </em>Mass. 20 (1937); <em>Kushner </em>v. <em>McGinnis, </em>289 Mass. 326 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">In these \u201cbaggage check\u201d and \u201cticket\u201d cases, we have ruled that the \u201ctype of document which the patron receives and the circumstances under which he receives it are not such that a person of ordinary intelligence would assume that the ticket limits the proprietor\u2019s liability unless the patron becomes actually aware of that limitation.\u201d <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Allied Sports Assocs., Inc., supra </em>at 549-550. Therefore, we have held in those cases that actual notice of the limitation of liability may be a question of fact properly submitted to the jury. This is not such a case. The release at issue here was clearly labeled as such and was filled out and signed by Merav and her father for the purpose of ensuring that she would be pennitted to participate in an ongoing extracurricular activity. These are not circumstances likely to mislead a person of ordinary intelligence as to whether a limitation of liability might be included in the type of document being executed. There is no dispute that Merav and her father had ample opportunity to review and understand the release. Their failure to do so does not avoid its effects as a matter of law. <em>Id. Cormier </em>v. <em>Central Mass. Chapter of the Nat\u2019l Safety Council, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Merav further argues that a jury should consider whether the release was signed under duress because, had she refused to sign it, she would not have been allowed to participate in cheerleading. This argument was not made to the motion judge, and is waived. But see <em>Minassian </em>v. <em>Ogden Suffolk Downs, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>400 Mass. 490, 492 (1987) (\u201ctake it or leave it\u201d release as condition of voluntary participation enforceable).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">b. <em>Public policy. </em>Merav next contends that enforcement of the release against her claims would constitute a gross violation of public policy. This argument encompasses at least three separate public policy contentions: first, that it is contrary to public policy to permit schools to require students to sign exculpatory agreements as a prerequisite to participation in extracurricular school sports; second, that public policy prohibits a parent from contracting away a minor child\u2019s right to sue for a future harm; and third, that the enforcement of this release would undermine the duty of care that public schools owe their students.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">In weighing and analyzing Merav\u2019s public policy arguments, we must also consider other important public policies of the Commonwealth implicated in the resolution of this issue, including policies favoring the enforcement of releases, and the encouragement of extracurricular athletic programs for school-aged children.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">(1) <em>Releases. </em>Massachusetts law favors the enforcement of releases. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Allied Sports Assocs., Inc., </em>349 Mass. 544, 550 (1965), citing <em>MacFarlane\u2019s Case, </em>330 Mass. 573, 576 (1953). <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>267 Mass. 44, 47 (1929). A party may, by agreement, allocate risk and exempt itself from liability that it might subsequently incur as a result of its own negligence. See, e.g., <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Allied Sports Assocs., Inc., supra </em>at 550; <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Conragan, </em>302 Mass. 33 (1938); <em>Ortolano </em>v. <em>U-Dryvit Auto Rental Co., </em>296 Mass. 439 (1937). See also J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 8.18 (1974). \u201cThere can be no doubt . . . that under the law of Massachusetts . . . in the absence of fraud a person may make a valid contract exempting himself from any liability to another which he may in the future incur as a result of his negligence or that of his agents or employees acting on his behalf.\u201d <em>Schell </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>270 F.2d 384, 386 (1st Cir. 1959). Whether such contracts be called releases, covenants not to sue, or indemnification agreements, they represent \u201ca practice our courts have long found acceptable.\u201d <em>Minassian </em>v. <em>Ogden Suffolk Downs, Inc., supra </em>at 493. See <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Bay State Gas Co., </em>383 Mass. 218, 223-224 (1981); <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Ames, supra </em>at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The context in which such agreements have been upheld range beyond the purely commercial. In <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Allied Sports Assocs., Inc., supra, </em>we upheld a release signed as a prerequisite to a spectator entering the pit area of an automobile race, and in <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Central Mass. Chapter of the Nat\u2019l Safety Council, </em>416 Mass. 286 (1993), we similarly upheld a release signed by a beginner rider as a condition of her enrollment in a motorcycle safety class. In both cases, the plaintiffs were subsequently injured by the allegedly negligent acts of the other party to the release. In the <em>Lee </em>case, <em>supra, </em>we concluded that the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was error on the basis of the validity of the release. In the <em>Cormier </em>case, <em>supra, </em>we upheld the granting of summary judgment on the same basis, holding that \u201cplacing the risk of negligently caused injury on a person as a condition of that person\u2019s voluntary choice to engage in a potentially dangerous activity ordinarily contravenes no public policy of the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289. There is little that distinguishes the activity in the present case from those in the <em>Lee </em>and the <em>Cormier </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Although Merav has suggested that, if the release at issue here is valid, there is nothing to prevent cities or towns from requiring releases for \u201csimply allowing a child to attend school,\u201d such a conclusion does not necessarily follow. We have not had occasion to rule on the validity of releases required in the context of a compelled activity or as a condition for the receipt of essential services (e.g.,- public education, medical attention, housing, public utilities), and the enforceability of mandatory releases in such circumstances might well offend public policy. See <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Central Mass. Chapter of the Nat\u2019l Safety Council, supra </em>at 289 n.1, citing <em>Gonsalves </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 608 (1989) (exacting release of liability for negligence from public employee who was under compulsion to enroll in training course might offend public policy). See also Recent Case, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 729, 734 (1989) (importance of service to public should be paramount factor in deciding whether to invalidate exculpatory release on public policy grounds). In this case, Merav\u2019s participation in the city\u2019s extracurricular activity of cheerleading was neither compelled nor essential, and we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the public policy of the Commonwealth is not offended by requiring a release as a prerequisite to that participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">(2) <em>Parent\u2019s waiver of a minor\u2019s claim. </em>Merav contends that a parent cannot waive, compromise, or release a minor child\u2019s cause of action, and that enforcement of such a release against the child would violate public policy. She relies on a series of decisions from other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The city on the other hand relies on a series of cases holding to the contrary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While these cases are instructive and emblematic of the difficulty in balancing the important interests and policies at stake, we first look to our own law.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Under our common law, \u201cany contract, except one for necessaries, entered into by an unemancipated minor could be disaffirmed by him before he reached the age of [eighteen] or within a reasonable time thereafter.\u201d <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 688, 692 (1975). This long-standing principle has been applied to releases executed by a minor as far back as 1292. See 5 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 9.2, at 5 (4th ed. 1993), citing Y.B. 20 and 21 Edw. at 318 (1292) (release by minor \u201cwould not bar him from suing when he came of age\u201d). While the common-law rule has been narrowed somewhat by statute,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it remains our law that the contract of a minor is generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>voidable when she reaches the age of majority. Merav unequivocally repudiated the release (to the extent it might be deemed a contract executed by her) by filing suit against the city. See <em>G.E.B. </em>v. <em>S.R.W., </em>422 Mass. 158, 164 (1996) (minor\u2019s filing of suit is direct repudiation of contract not to sue signed by minor). The city concedes that Merav effectively disaffirmed the release, but contends that insofar as the release is signed by the parent and purports to release the school from any claim that might accrue to the minor, it remains valid because the parent can do what the minor cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The purpose of the policy permitting minors to void their contracts is \u201cto afford protection to minors from their own improvidence and want of sound judgment.\u201d <em>Frye </em>v. <em>Yasi, </em>327 Mass. 724, 728 (1951). This purpose comports with common sense and experience and is not defeated by permitting parents to exercise their own providence and sound judgment on behalf of their minor children. <em>Parham </em>v. <em>J.R., </em>442 U.S. 584, 602 (1979) (\u201cThe law\u2019s concept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making life\u2019s difficult decisions\u201d). See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 452 (9th ed. 1783) (minor\u2019s consent to marriage void unless accompanied by parental consent; one of many means by which parents can protect children \u201cfrom the snares of artful and designing persons\u201d). Moreover, our law presumes that fit parents act in furtherance, of the welfare and best interests of their children, <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 587-589 (1981); <em>Sayre </em>v. <em>Aisner, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 794, 799 n.8 (2001), and with respect to matters relating to their care, custody, and upbringing have a fundamental right to make those decisions for them. See <em>Parham </em>v. <em>J.R., supra </em>at 603 (parents can and must make judgments and decisions regarding risks to their children).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In the instant case, Merav\u2019s father signed the release in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>capacity as parent because he wanted his child to benefit from participating in cheerleading, as she had done for four previous seasons. He made an important family decision cognizant of the risk of physical injury to his child and the financial risk to the family as a whole. In the circumstance of a voluntary, nonessential activity, we will not disturb this parental judgment. This comports with the fundamental liberty interest of parents in the rearing of their children, and is not inconsistent with the purpose behind our public policy permitting minors to void their contracts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">c. <em>The encouragement of athletic activities for minors. </em>Our views with respect to the permissibility of requiring releases as a condition of voluntary participation in extracurricular sports activities, and the enforceability of releases signed by parents on behalf of their children for those purposes, are also consistent with and further the public policy of encouraging athletic programs for the Commonwealth\u2019s youth. This policy is most clearly embodied in statutes that exempt from liability for negligence nonprofit organizations and volunteer managers and coaches who offer and run sports programs for children under eighteen years of age (G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85V), and owners of land (including municipalities) who permit the public to use their land for recreational purposes without imposing a fee (G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C). See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>406 Mass. 632 (1990) (city not liable for injuries to softball player resulting from negligently caused defect in city-owned baseball field).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">To hold that releases of the type in question here are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>unenforceable would expose public schools, who offer many of the extracurricular sports opportunities available to children, to financial costs and risks that will inevitably lead to the reduction of those programs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It would also create the anomaly of a minor who participates in a program sponsored and managed by a nonprofit organization not having a cause of action for negligence that she would have had had she participated in the same program sponsored as an extracurricular activity by the local public school. This distinction seems unwarranted, inevitably destructive to school-sponsored programs, and contrary to public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Merav contends that to enforce the release would convey the message that public school programs can be run negligently, in contravention of the well-established responsibility of schools to protect their students. We disagree. There are many reasons aside from potential tort liability why public schools will continue to take steps to ensure well-run and safe extracurricular programs \u2014 not the least of which is their ownership by, and accountability to, the citizens of the cities and towns they serve. Moreover, the Legislature has already made the judgment that the elimination of liability for negligence in nonprofit sports programs is necessary to the encouragement and survival of such programs. It can hardly be contended that the enactment of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85V, was an endorsement by the Legislature of the negligent operation of nonprofit programs or an act likely to encourage the proliferation of negligence. School extracurricular programs are similarly situated.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The enforcement of the release is consistent with the Commonwealth\u2019s policy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>encouraging athletic programs for youth and does not contravene the responsibility that schools have to protect their students.</p>\n<p id=\"AvR\">d. <em>Massachusetts Tort Claims Act. </em>Merav\u2019s reliance on G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2, to support her claim that cities and towns should not be permitted to require or enforce releases regarding their negligent conduct, is misplaced. While the purpose of the Act may be to provide a remedy for persons injured as a result of the negligence of government entities, see <em>Vasys </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>387 Mass. 51, 55 (1982), it does so by abrogating sovereign immunity only within a narrow statutory framework. The Act does \u201cnot create any new theory of liability for a municipality,\u201d <em>Dinsky </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>386 Mass. 801, 804 (1982), but rather, specifically provides that they are liable \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\u201d G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2. Outside of the procedural limitations and exceptions contained within the Act, cities and towns are afforded the same defenses as private parties in tort claims. See <em>Dinsky </em>v. <em>Framingham, supra. </em>Because releases of liability for ordinary negligence involving private parties are valid as a general proposition in the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>monwealth, it is not contrary to the purposes of the Act to allow municipalities to use releases as a precondition for the participatian in voluntary, nonessential activities they may sponsor.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">e. <em>Consideration. </em>Merav last argues that the release she signed is void because it was not supported by proper consideration. The motion judge properly concluded that the benefit bargained for, in this case Merav\u2019s participation in the cheerleading program, was adequate consideration for the release. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 496B (1965) (not essential that agreements to assume risk of negligence be for consideration; consent by participation in activity may be sufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">C. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that Merav\u2019s father had the authority to bind his minor child to an exculpatory release that was a proper condition of her voluntary participation in extracurricular sports activities offered by the city.

The team used members of the squad as spotters while performing difficult stunts or cheers.

L. c. 167E, \u00a7 10 (student under eighteen years of age admitted to institution of higher learning has fuE legal capacity to act on her own behalf in contracts and other transactions regarding financing of education); G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 128 (certain contracts for life or endowment insurance may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>not be voided by minor over fifteen years of age); G.

L. c. 112, \u00a7 12F (minor may consent to medical or dental treatment if she meets .criteria outlined in statute).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Our conclusion that parents may execute an enforceable preinjury release on behalf of their minor children is not inconsistent with our policy regarding discretionary court approval of settlement releases signed by minors. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 140C \u00bd (allowing judge to approve settlement for damages stemming from personal injury to minor where parties have petitioned for such approval). This statute applies only to postinjury releases, and the policy considerations underlying it are distinct from those at issue in the preinjury context. A parent asked to sign a preinjury release has no financial motivation to comply and is not subject to the types of conflicts and financial pressures that may arise in the postinjury settlement context, when simultaneously coping with an injured child. Such pressure can create the potential for parental action contrary to the child\u2019s ultimate best interests. In short, in the preinjury context, there is little risk that a parent will mismanage or misappropriate his child\u2019s property. See <em>Zivich </em>v. <em>Mentor Soccer Club, Inc., </em>82 Ohio St. 3d 367, 373 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The fact that G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2, may limit the financial exposure of municipalities to $100,000 per claim (plus defense costs) does not insulate them from the deleterious impact of inherently unknowable financial risk. Public schools are not required by State law to offer voluntary extracurricular sports programs. Compare G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 3 (\u201c[pjhysical education <em>shall be </em>taught as a required subject in all grades for all students in the public schools . . .\u201d [emphasis added]), with G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 47 (cities and towns \u201cmay appropriate\u201d money for employment of coaches and for support of extracurricular activities). Consequently, in times of fiscal constraint, those programs are often the targets of budget reductions. A decision exposing school systems to further financial costs and risk for undertaking such programs cannot help but accelerate their curtailment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Our holding is not intended to abrogate or qualify the special relationship that exists between a school and its students recognized in prior decisions, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>not involving the validity of an exculpatory release required for participation in an extracurricular activity. See, e.g., <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>373 Mass. 208 (1977) (sight-impaired student injured by defective door during school hours); <em>Alter </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 142 (1993) (student hit in eye by lacrosse ball while waiting in school yard for parent).</p>\n<p id=\"AtW\">It is also limited to the claims before us \u2014 and those claims concern ordinary negligence. The city specifically disavows any contention that the release here would relieve it from liability for gross negligence or reckless or intentional conduct. See <em>Zavras </em>v. <em>Capeway Rovers Motorcycle Club, Inc., </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 17, 18-19 (1997), citing <em>Gillespie </em>v. <em>Papale, </em>541 F. Supp. 1042, 1046 (D. Mass. 1982) (releases effective against liability for ordinary negligence but substantial outside authority holds same not true for gross negligence). Commentators have readily distinguished the public policy implications of exculpatory releases whose only effect is relief from ordinary negligence from those intended to relieve a party from gross negligence, or reckless or intentional conduct. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 195(1) (1981) (\u201cA term exempting a party from tort liability for harm caused intentionally or recklessly is unenforceable on grounds of public policy\u201d); 6A A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1472, at 596-597 (1962) (\u201csuch an exemption [from liability] is always invalid if it applies to harm wilfully inflicted or caused by gross or wanton negligence\u201d); W.L. Prosser &amp; W.P. Keeton, Torts \u00a7 68, at 484 (5th ed. 1984) (\u201csuch agreements generally are not construed to cover the more extreme forms of negligence, described as willful, wanton, reckless or gross\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
