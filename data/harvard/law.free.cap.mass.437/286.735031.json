L. c. 123A, to commit the defendant to a secure facility as a sexually dangerous person. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for direct appellate review. The sole issue on appeal is whether the provisions of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12, apply to persons convicted of sexual offenses who have completed and been released from those sentences but who are later serving sentences for crimes that are not statutorily enumerated \u201csexual offenses.\u201d Because we conclude that the provisions of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12, are not applicable in such circumstances, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-15\">1. <em>Background. </em>In July, 1988, the defendant was convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>rape and indecent assault and battery of a child, for which he received suspended sentences. In March, 1992, the defendant was convicted of aggravated rape and kidnapping for which he was sentenced to concurrent terms of from seven to ten years and from five to ten years, respectively, in a State prison. During his incarceration, the defendant was informed of and refused to attend a sex offender treatment program. The defendant completed these sentences and was released from incarceration prior to enactment of the 1999 amendments to G. L. c. 123A. See St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7\u00a7 3-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In early 2000, the defendant was convicted of assault, assault and battery, threatening to commit a crime, and possession of a class E substance. None of these offenses is among those enumerated in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1, as \u201c[s]exual [o]ffenses.\u201d The defendant was sentenced to a one-year term of probation, but it was revoked in May, 2001, and he was sentenced to concurrent terms of three months in a house of correction. On June 13, 2001, the Commonwealth filed a petition for the defendant\u2019s civil commitment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as a sexually dangerous person<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a motion for temporary commitment, pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following a hearing, probable cause was found to believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>that the defendant was a sexually dangerous person; he was temporarily committed to a treatment center for examination and diagnosis pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a). </em>Two qualified examiners both concluded that the defendant was a sexually dangerous person.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In August, 2001, the Commonwealth petitioned for a trial, pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(a), </em>and the defendant was ordered temporarily committed to a treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>center, pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (e),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> pending disposition of the Commonwealth\u2019s commitment petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the Commonwealth\u2019s petition on the ground that G. L. c. 123 A only applied to persons who were incarcerated for an enumerated sexual offense at the time the petition was filed. The Commonwealth filed a motion requesting that, in the event of dismissal, the defendant\u2019s release be stayed pending the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal. Following a hearing in the Superior Court, the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the commitment petition was allowed. The judge opined that the language of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12, did not plainly and unambiguously provide that the Commonwealth could petition for the commitment of <em>any </em>incarcerated person with a past sexual offense conviction. Rather, examination of the statutory scheme suggested a legislative intent that petitions be brought only against incarcerated persons who were scheduled for release from sentences for enumerated sexual offenses, so as to treat those individuals who were <em>currently </em>sexually dangerous. Notwithstanding the dismissal of the commitment petition, the judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to stay release pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The Commonwealth contends that the judge misinterpreted the plain language of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12, when she concluded that this statutory provision does not apply to previously convicted sex offenders who, at the time of the filing of a commitment petition, are serving sentences for crimes other than sexual offenses. The Commonwealth argues that the language of \u00a7 12 is unambiguous and indicates that the statute applies to <em>any </em>incarcerated person who has <em>ever </em>been convicted of a sexual offense, regardless of the offense for which he is presently incarcerated. The absence of any language requiring that a defendant be in custody <em>by reason of </em>a conviction for a sexual offense demonstrates that the Legislature did not intend to include such a requirement. Therefore, the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>asserts, the provisions of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12, apply to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">On September 10, 1999, the Legislature enacted emergency legislation, St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7\u00a7 3-8, amending G. L. c. 123A by providing for the one day to life commitment of a person adjudged a \u201csexually dangerous person.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(d). </em>Prior to these amendments, for a period of almost ten years, no new \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d classifications and no new commitments were permitted. See St. 1990, c. 150, \u00a7 304 (repealing G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 3-6, and 7). The 1999 amendments established a new definition of a sexually dangerous person, see G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1, and five new sections pertaining to the procedures for adjudicating persons as sexually dangerous, see G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 12-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">When interpreting these 1999 amendments, we are guided by fundamental principles of statutory construction. \u201c[Statutory language should be given effect consistent with its plain meaning and in light of the aim of the Legislature unless to do so would achieve an illogical result.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001). WTiere the language of a statute is inconclusive, courts must look to extrinsic sources for assistance in determining the correct interpretation of the statute, including legislative history, analogous statutory material, and relevant case law. See <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 854 (1983). Courts presume that the Legislature is aware of existing statutes when it amends a statute or enacts a new one. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ R., </em>433 Mass. 515, 520 (2001); <em>Charland </em>v. <em>Muzi Motors, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 580, 582-583 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Pursuant to the commitment procedures set forth in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(a), </em>any \u201c[ajgency with jurisdiction\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> over a person convicted of a sexual offense as enumerated in G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>c. 123A, \u00a7 1, must \u201cnotify in writing the district attorney of the county where the offense occurred and the attorney general six months prior to the release of such person.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 495 (2000). \u201cIf the district attorney or Attorney General then \u2018determines that the prisoner ... is likely to be a sexually dangerous person as defined in [\u00a7 ] 1 [of c. 123A],\u2019 either \u2018may file a petition alleging that the prisoner ... is a sexually dangerous person and stating sufficient facts to support such allegation in the superior court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b). </em>The thrust of the statutory scheme is that commitment petitions should be brought against persons currently incarcerated for sexual offenses who are about to be released into the community but who, because they are sexually dangerous, are likely to commit another sexual offense, and, therefore, should not be released. We are mindful that the stated purpose of G. L. c. 123A is \u201cto protect forthwith the vulnerable members of our communities from sexual offenders.\u201d St. 1999, c. 74, emergency preamble.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 491-492, this court considered, among other things, the retroactivity and constitutionality of the provisions of G. L. c. 123A, and we concluded that civil commitment proceedings were properly initiated against the defendants, notwithstanding the fact that their convictions of sexual offenses predated the effective date of the 1999 statutory amendments. Significantly, each of the defendants in that case, unlike the defendant herein, was serving his respective sentence on the sexual offense of which he had been convicted. We opined that \u201cthe conduct triggering the statute\u2019s application is not the prior conviction of a sexual offense, but the current mental condition of a defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498. \u201cThat a person, in addition to possessing the requisite current mental condition, must have been convicted of a sexual offense, only identifies and limits the class of persons subject to potential commitment under c. 123A.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the requisite sexual offense conviction is not the <em>basis </em>for commitment (rather it is mental condition), it does determine the persons eligible, in the first instance, for potential civil commitment. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>In the present case, the defendant was not serving a sentence for a sexual offense as defined in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. Because there is no underlying sexual offense conviction that would trigger the procedures set forth in c. 123A, the defendant is not eligible for potential civil commitment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That the defendant was convicted of sexual offenses ten years ago does not change our analysis; he completed his sentences for those crimes prior to enactment of the 1999 revisions of G. L. c. 123A, and his present crimes are not enumerated sexual offenses. Were we to conclude otherwise, any defendant serving a sentence for any crime who had ever in the past committed an enumerated sexual offense, no matter how temporally distant, would be eligible for civil commitment, contingent on that defendant\u2019s current mental condition. General Laws c. 123A does not evidence such a broad legislative intent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">We pointed out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 502, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Travis, </em>372 Mass. 238, 250 (1977), that \u201c[w]hile commitment proceedings under c. 123A are civil proceedings, the potential deprivation of liberty to those persons subjected to these proceedings \u2018mandates that due process protections apply.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Sheridan, petitioner, </em>422 Mass. 776, 777-778 (1996), and cases cited. Where a fundamental right is involved, here freedom from physical restraint, we \u201cmust examine carefully the importance of the governmental interests advanced and the extent to which they are served by the challenged [statute].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 503, quot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>ing <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>414 Mass. 667, 673 (1993). \u201cThe loss of liberty that one faces even when temporarily committed is \u2018tantamount to the infringement of being arrested.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 507, quoting <em>Glass </em>v. <em>Mayas, </em>984 F.2d 55, 58 (2d Cir. 1993). The level of scrutiny with which this court will examine a statutory infringement on a fundamental right is much stricter and more exacting than the judicial review given to a statute that does not infringe on a fundamental right. See <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry\u2019s Drywall Co., </em>366 Mass. 539, 542 (1974). A State \u201cmay impose a regulatory restraint on [an] individual in narrowly-circumscribed situations.\u201d <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 677-678. The Commonwealth\u2019s suggested construction of G. L. c. 123A does not narrowly limit the circumstances when civil commitment may be pursued.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">The Commonwealth analogizes the present case to <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Department of Correction, </em>429 Mass. 736 (1999), and this court\u2019s interpretation of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) database statute, G. L. c. 22E. Section 8 of St. 1997, c. 106, which was not codified in G. L. c. 22E, provides that any person who has been convicted of a crime listed in G. L. c. 22E, \u00a7 3, \u201cwho is incarcerated ... on the effective date of this act, <em>notwithstanding the date of such conviction, </em>shall submit a DNA sample to the department [of State police] within 90 days of the effective date of this act or prior to release from custody, whichever occurs first\u201d (emphasis added). We concluded that the language of \u00a7 8 was clear and that it required any person ever convicted of a listed offense, who was incarcerated on or after the effective date of the statute, to provide a DNA sample for inclusion in the State database. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Department of Correction, supra </em>at 738. No distinction was made based on the offense for which such person was currently incarcerated; the statutory mandate was applicable irrespective of the reason for the current incarceration. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s argument, the present case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>is distinguishable from <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Department of Correction, supra. </em>Unlike the clear and explicit language of St. 1997, c. 106, \u00a7 8, the language of G. L. c. 123A does not plainly and unambiguously provide that the Commonwealth can petition for the commitment of <em>any </em>incarcerated person with a past sexual offense conviction, notwithstanding the date of such conviction and the reason for the current incarceration. We will not add words to a statute that the Legislature did not put there, either by inadvertent omission or by design. See <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 803 (1999). See also <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), </em>427 Mass. 1, 8 (1998). Adoption of the Commonwealth\u2019s position would mean an enlargement of the scope of G. L. c. 123A such that the Commonwealth would be allowed to seek the civil commitment of persons completing any term of incarceration as long as, at some point in the past, they had been convicted of an enumerated sexual offense. The language of G. L. c. 123A does not support such an interpretation, and any broadening of the statute would be the province of the Legislature, not this court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The defendant was scheduled for release sometime between June 17 and June 22, 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Pursuant to G.

Consequently, one of the examiners noted that no mental status evaluation was done because of the defendant\u2019s refusal to be interviewed.
