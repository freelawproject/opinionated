(2000) (Act), preempts G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 23, with respect to any tax imposed on premiums for crop insurance policies that are reinsured by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>ACE\u2019s complaint for declaratory relief against the Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) was filed in the county court, where a single justice reserved and reported the case to the full court on a statement of agreed facts. We conclude that the tax imposed by G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 23, on premiums for policies reinsured by the FCIC is preempted by the Act, and therefore remand the case to the county court for entry of a judgment in favor of ACE.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>ACE is a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business in Philadelphia. As a foreign insurance company, ACE is subject to the tax imposed by G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 23, on premiums for policies insuring property or interests located in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ACE\u2019s customers include various cranberry growers located in Massachusetts, to whom ACE has issued multiple peril crop insurance policies. Those crop insurance policies are reinsured by the FCIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Believing that premiums on FCIC-reinsured policies are exempt from State taxation under the Act, see 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1511, ACE did not include those premiums on its premium excise return for 1995. The commissioner audited ACE\u2019s 1995 excise return and issued an assessment based on the crop insurance premiums that ACE had excluded from its return. ACE filed an application for abatement and, after the commissioner denied such application, ACE appealed to the Appellate Tax Board (board). While that appeal was pending, ACE commenced the present action for declaratory relief in the county court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">2. <em>Exhaustion of administrative remedies. </em>Although the commissioner has not raised the issue (see note 2, <em>supra), </em>we first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>address whether this action for declaratory relief may be pursued prior to resolution of the pending appeal before the board. Ordinarily, parties must first exhaust all administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief. See <em>New England Legal Found, </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>423 Mass. 602, 607 (1996); <em>Space Bldg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>413 Mass. 445, 448 (1992), and cases cited. \u201cNevertheless, \u2018[w]e have held repeatedly, in the tax field, that a declaratory action is not ousted merely by the fact that the taxpayer has an administrative path to relief. Rather we have taken the view that the judge in such a case may still exercise a discretion as to whether the action should be entertained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Sydney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>371 Mass. 289, 293 (1976). While there is no \u201ccomprehensive formula. . . governing the exercise of discretion,\u201d <em>Sydney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, supra </em>at 294, \u201cexceptions to the [exhaustion] rule occur most often when important, novel, or recurrent issues are at stake, when the decision has public significance, or when the case reduces to a question of law.\u201d <em>Space Bldg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra. </em>See <em>S.J. Groves &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>372 Mass. 140, 142-143 (1977) (because declaratory action \u201creduces to an issue of law without dispute as to the facts,\u201d and \u201craises an issue of first impression which may well affect the interests of others than the taxpayer here,\u201d there was no abuse of discretion in entertaining action).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Here, the commissioner agrees that the preemption question raised by this case affects other taxpayers, who are asserting the identical preemption argument in applications for abatement and appeals to the board. Absent a judicial determination that the tax is preempted, the commissioner intends to enforce the tax against all insurers whose crop insurance policies are reinsured by the FCIC. The facts are not in dispute, and the issue is purely a matter of law. As such, we conclude that this case comes within that \u201cnarrow set of circumstances\u201d that makes a declaratory judgment action appropriate despite the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, <em>New England Legal Found, </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 607 n.5, and we exercise our discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>entertain this action and resolve the underlying legal issue on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">3. <em>Statutory and regulatory background. </em>The Act, which dates back to 1938, seeks \u201cto promote the national welfare by improving the economic stability of agriculture through a sound system of crop insurance and providing the means for the research and experience helpful in devising and establishing such insurance.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1502(a). The FCIC, a Federal corporation comprising an agency within the Department of Agriculture, is charged with implementing the Federal crop insurance program. See 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503. The FCIC provides some crop insurance directly, entering into insurance contracts with agricultural producers. See 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1508(a). More commonly, however, it provides reinsurance for crop insurance policies issued to producers by private insurance companies. See 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1508(k)(l) (FCIC \u201cshall, to the maximum extent practicable, provide reinsurance to insurers approved by the [FCIC] that insure producers of any agricultural commodity\u201d). Pursuant to its reinsurance agreements, the FCIC reimburses the private insurance companies for operating and administrative costs incurred in connection with the reinsured policies. See 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1508(h)(5)(A)(ii) and (k)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">From the inception of the crop insurance program, Congress exempted the FCIC from all taxation \u201cimposed by the United States or by any Territory, dependency, or possession thereof, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1511, as appearing in c. 30, Title V, \u00a7 511, 52 Stat. 75 (1938). The Act also contains a general preemption provision, expressly conferring on the FCIC the power to preempt State law: \u201cState and local laws or rules shall not apply to contracts, agreements, or regulations of the [FCIC] or the parties thereto <em>to the extent that such contracts, agreements, or regulations provide that such laws or rules shall not apply, </em>or to the extent that such laws or rules are inconsistent with such contracts, agreements, or regulations\u201d (emphasis added). 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1506(Z). The FCIC is also authorized to issue regulations \u201cas are necessary to carry out [the Act].\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1506(p).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Despite the express tax preemption in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1511, the FCIC found that, as of 1990, \u201cmany States have been asserting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the right to tax premiums on the reinsured policies under varipus State taxing statutes.\u201d 55 Fed. Reg. 23,066 (1990). The FCIC noted that, through its reimbursement of private insurance companies\u2019 expenses, it had effectively paid over $15 million in State premium taxes in the previous year alone. <em>Id. </em>Because the FCIC was exempt from taxation under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1511, the agency concluded that those State taxes \u201cshould not have been assessed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To remedy what it perceived to be inappropriate taxation on the policies that it reinsured (along with other provisions of State law that had impeded the crop insurance program in other respects), the FCIC promulgated regulations specifying the preemption of a variety of State laws, including tax laws. See 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 400.351 - 400.352 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"AH9I\">The regulations, issued in 1990, first set forth a broad statement of preemption: \u201cNo State or local governmental body or non-governmental body shall have the authority to promulgate rules or regulations, pass laws, or issue policies or decisions that directly or indirectly affect or govern agreements, contracts, or actions authorized by this part unless such authority is specifically authorized by this part or by the [FCIC].\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 400.352(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Next, the regulations provide \u201ca non-inclusive fist\u201d of State actinns that are expressly prohibited. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 400.352(b). One of the things a State may not do is \u201c[t]ax premiums associated with policies issued [under the Act].\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 400.352(b)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ajnr\">Shortly after the 1990 regulations became effective, the State of Kansas challenged their validity, claiming that the FCIC had exceeded its statutory authority. See <em>State ex rel. Todd </em>v. <em>United States, </em>791 F. Supp. 1491, 1496 (D. Kan. 1992), aff'd, 995 F.2d 1505 (10th Cir. 1993). Kansas conceded that it could not tax policies issued directly by the FCIC, but argued that the FCIC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>could not validly preempt taxation of premiums on private policies that were only reinsured by the FCIC. See <em>id. </em>at 1497 n.7. Summary judgment was granted in favor of the defendants, holding that the FCIC had the authority to promulgate the preemption regulations, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed that judgment. See <em>State ex rel. Todd </em>v. <em>United States, </em>995 F.2d 1505, 1509 (10th Cir. 1993) <em>(Todd). </em>The <em>Todd </em>court found \u201cno rational explanation, based on the statutory scheme, for a distinction between FCIC reinsured policies and FCIC direct insurance policies permitting the state taxing and regulation of one while preempting the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1510. The court concluded that the FCIC was authorized to preempt State law with respect to reinsured contracts under former \u00a7 1506(k) (current \u00a7 1506[Z]),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or, assuming in the alternative that Congress had not expressly authorized such preemption, that the FCIC\u2019s preemption regulations were \u201ceminently reasonable\u201d in light of the terms and purpose of the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 1510-1511.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The following year, Congress amended the Act, adding the following clause to the general taxation preemption provisions of \u00a7 1511: \u201cA contract of insurance of the [FCIC], and a contract of insurance reinsured by the [FCIC], shall be exempt from taxation imposed by any State, municipality, or local taxing authority.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1511, as amended, Pub. L. 103-354, Tide I, \u00a7 108, 108 Stat. 3197 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">4. <em>Preemption analysis. </em>Under its plenary power to regulate interstate commerce, Congress can preempt State taxes that interfere with interstate commerce. <em>National Private Truck Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>426 Mass. 324, 330 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1137 (1998). \u201cThe critical question in any preemption analysis is always whether Congress intended that federal [law] supersede state law.\u201d <em>Archambault </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>407 Mass. 559, 565 (1990), quoting <em>Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>476 U.S. 355, 369 (1986). \u201cTo discern Congress\u2019 intent we examine the explicit statutory language and the structure and purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>College Pro Painters (U.S.) Ltd., </em>418 Mass. 726, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>728 (1994), quoting <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>498 U.S. 133, 138 (1990). See <em>Todd, supra </em>at 1509-1510 (\u201cPreemptian occurs when Congress expresses a clear intent to preempt in a federal statute ... or when state law is an obstacle to the objectives and purpose of Congress\u201d). When the field being preempted involves a State\u2019s traditional and sovereign interests, \u201cwe start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519, 525 (1977), quoting <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947). See <em>Apkin </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>401 Mass. 427, 431 (1988).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ajg\">The explicit language of \u00a7 1511, as amended, clearly evinces Congress\u2019s intent to preempt State taxation of policies reinsured by the FCIC. As the statute now reads, \u201c[a] contract of insuranee of the [FCIC], <em>and a contract of insurance reinsured by the [FCIC], </em>shall be exempt from taxation imposed by any State, municipality, or local taxing authority\u201d (emphasis added). 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1511. Coming on the heels of the <em>Todd </em>decision, it is apparent that Congress intended this amendment of \u00a7 1511 to solidify the court\u2019s holding and foreclose further challenges to the FCIC\u2019s preemption regulations as they applied to the taxatian of contracts reinsured under the crop insurance program. That the private contracts are exempt from taxation once they are reinsured by the FCIC is now expressly stated in the Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AK_\">Meanwhile, of course, the FCIC regulations remain in effect, and still operate to preclude State taxation of any premiums <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u201cassociated with policies\u201d issued under the Act. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 400.352(b)(2). The preemption regulation is applicable to \u201call policies of insurance, insured <em>or reinsured, </em>by the [FCIC]\u201d (emphasis added). 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 400.351. The FCIC\u2019s authority to issue such a regulation is expressly provided in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1506(7); the application of that preemption authority to the reinsurance component of the Federal crop insurance program was correctly analyzed and upheld in <em>Todd;</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and that authority is now bolstered further by the amendments to \u00a7 1511. There is no sound basis on which to dispute the FCIC\u2019s authority to promulgate the preemption provisions set forth in 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 400.352. \u201cAn agency\u2019s preemption regulations have no less preemptive effect than statutes.\u201d <em>Todd, supra </em>at 1509, citing <em>Fidelity Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>de la Cuesta, </em>458 U.S. 141, 153 (1982). Thus, the tax at issue here today is preempted if it is preempted by <em>either </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1511, or 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 400.352(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The commissioner argues that the preemption in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1511 extends only to the FCIC itself, not to private entities, and that the 1994 amendment to \u00a7 1511 merely \u201ccodifies the constitutional bar against certain forms of direct taxation of the FCIC and its property and obligations.\u201d This argument is contrary to the wording of \u00a7 1511, and ignores the history of the 1994 amendment to that section. The statute exempts from taxation not only the contracts of the FCIC, but also any \u201ccontract of insurance reinsured by the [FCIC].\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1511. Any underlying \u201ccontract of insurance\u201d that the FCIC reinsures is, by definition, an insurance policy issued by an entity other than the FCIC. The States may tax those private entities, but they may not tax the insurance policies issued by those entities that the FCIC has reinsured. The commissioner\u2019s interpretation would also make the amendments to \u00a7 1511 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>superfluous, as the FCIC\u2019s own immunity from taxation was already stated unambiguously in the first sentence of \u00a7 1511, which dates back to the establishment of the FCIC in 1938. There would be ri\u00f3 reason to amend \u00a7 1511 in 1994 merely to restate an immunity that was already provided. Rather, in context, it is clear that the 1994 amendment to \u00a7 1511 was an affirmation of the <em>Todd </em>decision, intended to specify that the immunity from State taxation extended to contracts reinsured by the FCIC, and not just to the contracts issued by the FCIC itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The commissioner also argues that the premium excise tax imposed by G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 23, is not a tax \u201con\u201d any contract re-insured by the FCIC that would be prohibited by 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1511, or a tax \u201con\u201d any premium for such an insurance contract that would be prohibited by 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 400.352(b)(2), but rather an excise tax for the privilege of doing business in Massachusetts that is merely \u201cmeasured by\u201d reference to the premiums for such contracts. The actual wording of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 23, does not support the commissioner\u2019s theory, as it requires foreign insurance companies to \u201cpay an excise upon the gross premiums for all policies written or renewed.\u201d More importantly, the preemption of State taxation set forth in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1511 is not parsed in the technical manner proposed by the commissioner. That section provides that the entire \u201ccontract\u201d (including any insurance contract reinsured by the FCIC) \u201cshall be exempt from taxation imposed by any State, municipality, or local taxing authority.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1511. By exempting FCICreinsured contracts \u201cfrom taxation,\u201d Congress intended to prohibit <em>any </em>form of taxation of such contracts. Nor does the FCIC\u2019s preemption regulation hinge on the technical distinction suggested by the commissioner. Rather, it provides that States may not \u201c[t]ax premiums associated with policies issued\u201d under the Act, 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 400.352(b)(2), and preempts State laws (including tax laws) \u201cthat directly or indirectly affect\u201d policies reinsured by the FCIC, 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 400.352(a). The \u201ccontracts\u201d and \u201cpremiums\u201d are thus \u201cexempt\u201d from any form of taxation (or any State law that even \u201cindirectly affect[s]\u201d them), whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the tax is one \u201con\u201d such premiums or contracts or an excise tax derived from or measured by such premiums or contracts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The commissioner\u2019s suggested distinction, if adopted, would eviscerate the preemption provisions and render them useless. The pragmatic purpose behind preventing taxation on the reinsured contracts was to avoid having the FCIC effectively pay State and local taxes that were being passed through to it as an expense under its reinsurance program. \u201cCongress did not intend for the federal crop insurance program to be subject to state premium taxes that reduce the savings anticipated by Congress, that siphon away federal funds from their intended use, and that create an operating cost which would have not existed if the FCIC had issued the policy.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Todd v. United States, </em>791 F. Supp. 1491, 1497 (D. Kan. 1992). The preemption provisions were not aimed at preventing only some particular type of tax, but were intended to preclude all forms of taxation affecting the reinsured contracts, as all such taxes, however denominated, would effectively be paid by the FCIC. The commissioner\u2019s argument that the tax imposed by G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 23, is somehow not the kind of tax that is preempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>by these provisions is contrary to the very purpose of those broadly worded preemption provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The case is remanded to the single justice for entry of a judgment declaring that the Act preempts any tax imposed by G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 23, on premiums from crop insurance policies that are reinsured by the FCIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\">General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 23, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">\u201cEvery foreign insurance company . . . shall annually pay an excise upon the gross premiums for all policies written or renewed, all additional premiums charged, and all assessments made during the preceding calendar year for insurance of property or interests in this commonwealth ... at the rate of two per cent but not less in amount than would be imposed by the laws of the state or country under which such company is organized upon a like insurance company incorporated in this commonwealth . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-10\">The commissioner agreed that a declaratory judgment action was an appropriate way to resolve the underlying preemption issue.

Martin, NAIC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>General Counsel, to Members of the Crop Insurance Working Group (Mar. 9, 1995), 1995 Proceedings of the NAIC, First Quarter, at 667.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Although we are not bound by decisions of Federal courts (other than the United States Supreme Court) on matters of Federal law, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>388 Mass. 603, 604 (1983), \u201cwe give respectful consideration to such lower Federal court decisions as seem persuasive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>377 Mass. 59, 61 (1979), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Masskow, </em>362 Mass. 662, 667 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The commissioner relies on <em>American Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Dallas County, </em>463 U.S. 855, 858 (1983) <em>(American Bank), </em>quoting <em>Society for Sav. </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>349 U.S. 143, 148 (1955), in support of his proposed distinction between a tax \u201con\u201d premiums paid under FCIC-reinsured policies and an excise tax \u201cmeasured by\u201d such premiums, claiming that that distinction is \u201cfirmly embedded in the law.\u201d In <em>American Bank, supra </em>at 859-861, 873, the United States Supreme Court held that former 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 742 (currently codified at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124[a] [1994]), preempted a Texas bank shares tax that was measured, in part, by the value of tax-exempt Federal obligations held by the banks. The Court acknowledged that its prior precedent had distinguished between taxes imposed \u201con\u201d Federal obligations and taxes on discrete property interests, such as corporate shares or business franchises, that were \u201cmeasured by\u201d the underlying assets. <em>Id. </em>at 858, 862. However, the Court noted that Congress\u2019s 1959 amendment to \u00a7 742 had done away with this \u201cformal but economically meaningless\u201d distinction. <em>Id. </em>at 858. \u201cThe 1959 amendment rejected and set aside this Court\u2019s rather formalistic pre-1959 approach to [\u00a7 742].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 862. Thus, while the distinction that the commissioner now proposes was \u201cfirmly imbedded in the law\u201d over forty years ago, <em>id. </em>at 858, quoting <em>Society for Sav. </em>v. <em>Bowers, supra, </em>it is a distinction that was rejected by Congress in 1959 and demeaned by the Court as \u201cformalistic\u201d and \u201cmeaningless\u201d in 1983. <em>Id. </em>at 858, 862. There is no reason to believe that, in amending 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1511, in 1994, Congress intended to resurrect that defunct distinction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
