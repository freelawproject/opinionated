Rule 1:03, as appearing in 382 Mass. 700 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-13\">\u201c(1) Is the operative date for commencement of an action for purposes of the Massachusetts statutes of repose the date of filing of a motion and supporting memorandum for leave to amend a complaint to add a party (assuming timely service), or is the operative date the date the amended complaint is filed after leave of court is granted, when leave of court is required by the Rules of Civil Procedure to file an amended complaint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>\u201c(2) If the answer to Question No. 1 is that the operative date is the date of filing of the motion for leave to amend, do the policies underlying the statutes of repose require that such filings be in compliance with the local rules of court applicable to the filing of such motions, or do those policies permit the court in its discretion to excuse non-compliance with the local rules?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><em>Nett </em>v. <em>Bellucci, </em>269 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 2001). We answer the certified questions as follows: (1) The operative date for commencement of an action for purposes of a statute of repose is the date of filing of a motion for leave to amend a complaint to add a party; and (2) the policies underlying the statute of repose do not require that the motion for leave to amend comply with the local rules, as long as the motion itself is accepted for filing within the period provided by the statute of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts as set forth in the opinion accompanying the certification order, augmented by details provided in the record of the underlying proceedings. See <em>Nett </em>v. <em>Bellucci, </em>269 F.3d 1, 2-5 (1st Cir. 2001). Aaron Nett was bom at Milford-Whitinsville Hospital on April 2, 1992, weighing more than eleven pounds. The delivery was complicated because of Aaron\u2019s large size, and the infant suffered a nerve injury as a result of those complications. On March 26, 1992, one week prior to Aaron\u2019s birth, Dr. Peter Gross had performed and interpreted an ultrasound, estimating the fetal weight at only eight pounds. Dr. Mitchell Bellucci, the obstetrician attending Aaron\u2019s delivery, had relied on that ultrasound reading and had therefore not anticipated the complications that ensued during the delivery of a much larger baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">On April 30, 1996, the plaintiffs filed a complaint against Dr. Bellucci in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that he had been negligent in the prenatal care and delivery of Aaron. As part of his defense, Dr. Bellucci took the position that he had reasonably relied on the estimated fetal weight provided by the radiologist\u2019s ultrasound reading, and that his failure to anticipate delivery of a baby weighing eleven pounds was therefore not negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">On June 30, 1998, the plaintiffs served a subpoena duces tecum on the hospital seeking production of the ultrasound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>films. The hospital told the plaintiffs that the films had been destroyed. At his August 4, 1998, deposition, Dr. Gross testified that his efforts to obtain the ultrasound films had also been unsuccessful, as the hospital had similarly informed him that the films were no longer available. The hospital, responding to a second subpoena duces tecum, finally recovered and produced the ultrasound films on February 4, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">On March 10, 1999, after obtaining an expert\u2019s review of the films and an opinion concerning their proper reading, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint to add Dr. Gross as a defendant pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The motion and accompanying ten-page memorandum set forth the facts of the case and explained that the plaintiffs had been unable to assert a claim against Dr. Gross at any earlier point due to the hospital\u2019s claimed loss of the ultrasound films. Although the plaintiffs did not attach a proposed draft of their amended complaint, the memorandum accompanying the motion outlined the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that Dr. Gross had been negligent in his reading of the ultrasound, identified their expert and his opinion that \u201cDr. Gross fell below the standard of care in his evaluation of the ultrasound film,\u201d and stated that \u201cDr. Gross is a necessary party due to his negligence by and through his position as [the] radiologist involved in the care of Aaron Nett at the Milford-Whitinsville Hospital.\u201d The memorandum also provided the details of the complications that had ensued during Aaron\u2019s delivery and the nature of the resulting injuries. In order to explain the delay in adding Dr. Gross as a defendant, the memorandum also chronicled the difficulties encountered in obtaining the actual films.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">When they filed their motion, the plaintiffs failed to comply with Massachusetts District Court Local Rule 15.1 (b), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>requires service of \u201cthe motion to amend upon the proposed new party at least ten (10) days in advance of filing the motion, together with a separate document stating the date on which the motion will be filed.\u201d Local rule 15.1 (b) further provides that \u201c[a] motion to amend a pleading to add a new party shall be accompanied by a certificate stating that it has been served in advance on the new party as required by this rule.\u201d Although no such certificate accompanied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to amend, the clerk of the court apparently accepted the filing on March 10, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">After the plaintiffs themselves realized their error, they served Dr. Gross with the motion for leave to amend on March 19, 1999, and refiled their motion with the court on March 29, 1999, in compliance with local rule 15.1 (b). Over the opposition of Dr. Gross, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to amend on April 8, 1999, and the amended complaint was filed on April 26, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Dr. Gross filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, arguing that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against him were barred by the statutes of repose.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60D; G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4. Because he had performed and inteipreted the ultrasound on March 26, 1992, Dr. Gross contended that any amended complaint adding him as a defendant would have had to be filed by March 26, 1999, the expiration of the seven-year repose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>period provided by the applicable statutes. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60D; G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4. The second motion for leave to amend the complaint, filed on March 29, 1999, and the actual amended complaint, filed on April 26, 1999, both fell beyond that expiration date. The plaintiffs opposed the motion to dismiss, arguing that the repose provisions allowed them until April 2, 1999, Aaron\u2019s seventh birthday, to file a complaint against Dr. Gross and that their motion to amend, filed in compliance with local rule 15.1 (b) on March 29, 1999, had \u201ccommenced\u201d the action within the repose period.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The Federal District Court initially denied the motion to dismiss. The court determined that the repose period expired on March 26, 1999, rather than April 2, 1999, but excused the violation of local rule 15.1 (b) as harmless error, deemed the motion for leave to amend to have been properly filed on March 10, 1999, and tolled the time that had elapsed between the filing of the first motion for leave to amend and the filing of the amended complaint. On a motion for reconsideration, however, the court reversed itself, concluding that a statute of repose could not be tolled in light of <em>Protective Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>425 Mass. 615, 631 n.19 (1997), and cases cited. Because the plaintiffs had not filed their amended complaint prior to March 26, 1999, the claims against Dr. Gross were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, the plaintiffs were unsuccessful in pressing their theory that the statutes of repose ran from the child\u2019s birth date. See <em>Nett </em>v. <em>Bellucci, </em>269 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001). The March 26, 1999, seven-year anniversary of the ultrasound reading was held to be the applicable date for purposes of the statutes of repose, and both the March 29, 1999, motion for leave to amend, and the later April 26, 1999, filing of the complaint, fell outside that repose period. The question, then, was whether the March 10, 1999, filing of a motion for leave to amend qualified as the \u201ccommencement\u201d of the action against Dr. Gross for purposes of the statutes of repose. Because the case was a diversity action, State law determined when the action was \u201ccommenced\u201d for purposes of statutes of limitations or statutes of repose. <em>Id. </em>at 7, citing <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Armco Steel Corp., </em>446 U.S. 740, 751 (1980). Finding \u201cno controlling precedent on the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>what constitutes the commencement of an action for the purpose of the Massachusetts statutes of repose,\u201d the court certified the two questions now before us. <em>Nett </em>v. <em>Bellucci, supra </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">2. <em>Commencement of an action. </em>The first certified question asks us to determine, for purposes of our statutes of repose, what step in the proceedings constitutes the commencement of an action against a party who is added by way of amendment to the complaint. Both the statute governing medical malpractice tort claims involving minors, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60D, and the statute governing medical malpractice tort claims generally, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4, provide that \u201cin no event shall any such action be <em>commenced </em>more than seven years after occurrence of the act or omission which is the alleged cause of the injury upon which such action is based\u201d (emphasis added). Like all statutes of repose, \u201c[t]he effect [of these statutes] is to place an absolute time limit on the liability of those within [their] protection and to abolish a plaintiff\u2019s cause of action thereafter, even if the plaintiff\u2019s injury does not occur, or is not discovered, until after the statute\u2019s time limit has expired.\u201d <em>McGuinness </em>v. <em>Cotter, </em>412 Mass. 617, 622 (1992), citing <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>386 Mass. 701, 702 (1982). Unlike statutes of limitation, statutes of repose may not be \u201ctolled\u201d for any reason, as \u201ctolling\u201d would deprive the defendant of the certainty of the repose deadline and thereby defeat the purpose of a statute of repose. See <em>Protective Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra </em>at 631 n.19, citing <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Iantosca, </em>409 Mass. 796, 798 (1991). The only way to satisfy the \u201cabsolute time limit\u201d of a statute of repose is to \u201ccommence\u201d the action prior to the expiration of that time limit. <em>McGuinness </em>v. <em>Cotter, supra. </em>See <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>ADD Inc., ante </em>213, 221 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The medical malpractice statutes of repose do not define when an action \u201ccommences.\u201d Ordinarily, we would look to our rules of civil procedure to determine the date on which an action is \u201ccommenced,\u201d and, under the straightforward provisions of those rules, we would find that amended pleadings adding or substituting a party, where the claims asserted against the new party arise out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth in the original pleading, \u201crelate[ ] back\u201d to the date of the original pleading. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 (c), 365 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Mass. 761 (1974). Thus, under the rules, an action against such a party added by amendment is \u201ccommenced\u201d on the date that the original complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"AU8\">However, we have already determined that that literal application of the rules would be contrary to the purposes underlying a statute of repose, and have thus, for statute of repose purposes only, rejected the date of commencement that the rules normally prescribe for related claims and parties added by amendment. <em>Tindol </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>396 Mass. 515, 519 (1986). In that case, we held that a plaintiff could not amend a complaint to add an architect and an engineer as defendants after the expiration of the repose period imposed by G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B \u2014 a statute of repose governing torts related to construction projects \u2014 even though the original complaint was timely filed. See <em>id. </em>We fashioned an exception to rule 15 (c), explaining that to allow amended pleadings for claims subject to a statute of repose to relate back to the original pleading \u201cwould have the effect of reactivating a cause of action that the Legislature obviously intended to eliminate.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>James Ferrera &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Samuels, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 170, 173 (1985). Thus, where the literal application of one of our rules of civil procedure would yield a result contrary to the purposes underlying statutes of repose, we refused to recognize the date of commencement provided by the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Because rule 15 (c) cannot operate in these circumstances to establish the date of commencement as the date of filing of the original complaint, the defendant contends that we should instead apply the literal wording of Mass. R. Civ. R 3, as amended, 385 Mass. 1215 (1982), which provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a] civil action is commenced by (1) mailing to the clerk of the proper court by certified or registered mail a complaint and an entry fee prescribed by law, or (2) filing such complaint and an entry fee with such clerk.\u201d Under the defendant\u2019s reading of the rule, the plaintiffs did not \u201ccommence[]\u201d their action until they filed their amended complaint on April 26, 1999, one month after the expiration of the repose period.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument applies rule 3 to a context it was not meant to govern. Because rule 15 (c) provides its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>definition of when an amended complaint \u201ccommence^]\u201d an action, the rule 3 definition of when an action \u201ccommence[s]\u201d is not meant to refer to the date of \u201cmailing\u201d or \u201cfiling\u201d an amended complaint. Rule 15 (c) was intended to govern actions brought by way of amendment, and rule 3, by its literal wording (with its references to the \u201centry fee\u201d) plainly does not. Thus, rather than apply the literal wording of rule 3 to a situation for which it was not intended or designed, we must determine which step in the process of amending a complaint most resembles the filing of an original complaint, and whether treating that step as the commencement of the action would be consistent with the purposes underlying the statutes of repose. For the following reasons, we conclude that it is the filing of the motion for leave to amend, not the later filing of the amended complaint after that motion is allowed, that best satisfies those criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">The original filing of a complaint that \u201ccommence[s]\u201d an action under rule 3 is the first document that a plaintiff files in court, comprising the first official step in bringing an action against a defendant. No prior permission of the court is required, and no prior step involving the court need be taken. As such, the plaintiff has unilateral control over when the original complaint is filed, and the plaintiff is responsible for seeing to it that that step \u201ccommenc[ing]\u201d the action occurs within all applicable statutes of limitation and statutes of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">What step in the process of amending a complaint most resembles that first step in the filing of an original action? Beyond the brief period during which a complaint may be amended as of right (see rule 15 [a]), a plaintiff amending a complaint may not do so unilaterally. Court permission is required. Therefore, the first step taken is to request permission from the court by filing a motion. While the plaintiff has unilateral control over when that motion is filed, the plaintiff has no way of controlling or even predicting the time at which any permission to amend will be granted, and thus no ability to control the date on which the amended complaint itself may be filed. It may take only a matter of days before the motion is allowed and the complaint can be filed, but it may be a matter of weeks, or even months, depending on a host of factors, all of which are outside the plaintiff\u2019s control. If the statute of repose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>cannot be satisfied until the later filing of the amended complaint after the motion to amend has been allowed, the repose period will effectively be shortened by some unpredictable amount of time, as a plaintiff would have to file the motion to amend some considerable period in advance of the expiration of the repose period and simply hope that the court\u2019s ruling would be sufficiently prompt. It is only that first step, the filing of the motion, that the plaintiff can control. Thus, the filing of the motion is comparable to the original filing of the complaint, both in the sense that each is the first step that a plaintiff takes and the first document that a plaintiff files with the court concerning the action, and in the sense that both the filing of the original complaint and the filing of the motion to amend are steps that remain unilaterally in the plaintiff\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">It is true that a plaintiff retains the ability to satisfy the statute of repose by filing a separate action against the new defendant, perhaps followed by a motion to consolidate that new action with the previously filed action. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 3; Mass. R. Civ. P. 42 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, that approach would waste scarce judicial resources and impose pointless litigation costs. Where a defendant would appropriately be added to an action already filed, it creates needless confusion and duplication to force the plaintiff to bring the claim as a separate action, followed by a motion for consolidation, merely to avoid the bar of a statute of repose. Indeed, a plaintiff might well file a motion to amend, wait to see whether the motion would be allowed in time to get the amended complaint filed before the repose period ran out, and, if there were still no ruling from the court as the expiration date drew near, file the separate action and the accompanying motion to consolidate. We fail to see how such duplication of effort and procedural clutter would advance the purposes underlying any statute of repose. See <em>Mamey </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>316 N.C. 67, 71, 72 (1986) (filing of motion to amend \u201cis sufficient to start the action,\u201d noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>that that interpretation \u201cpromote[s] judicial economy by avoiding the necessity for separate trials or for plaintiff to file first a separate complaint and then a motion to join the two actions\u201d). Where a more efficient procedural mechanism is already available to bring an additional defendant into an existing action, we should recognize that preferred mechanism as the commencement of the action against the new defendant rather than force the parties and the court to utilize a more cumbersome workaround.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">We conclude that treating the filing of the motion as the commencement of the action against the added defendant would satisfy the purposes underlying statutes of repose. The purpose of a statute of repose is to give particular types of defendants the benefit of a date certain on which their liability for past conduct will definitively come to an end. \u201cThere comes a time when [a defendant] ought to be secure in his reasonable expectation that the slate has been wiped clean of ancient obligations, and he ought not be called on to resist a claim \u2018when evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.\u2019 \u201d <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>386 Mass. 701, 709 (1982), quoting <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>North Bergen, </em>61 N.J. 190, 201 (1972). The Legislature has decided that the uncertainties inherent in statutes of limitation, which run from the unpredictable and theoretically never-ending date on which a cause of action can \u201caccrue,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> are contrary to the needs of certain professions, including the medical profession. See <em>Harlfinger </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>435 Mass. 38, 41-42, 44 (2001). To serve this purpose, there must be a clear, bright-line method for determining the statute\u2019s operation, as only certainty in the measurements provides the certainty that such defendants are to be accorded. The filing of the motion to amend is a step that is as clearly recorded, and clearly documented by court records, as the filing of the amended complaint itself. There is no vagary or flexibility in the measurement that would defeat the purposes of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Nor would there be any difference in terms of notice to the defendant. Statutes of repose require only that an action be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>\u201ccommenced,\u201d and rely on other provisions in the rules to provide a defendant with timely notice of the action. Rule 3 states that an action is \u201ccommenced\u201d by mere filing, without setting its own requirement of service or other notification to the defendant, but Mass. R. Civ. P. 4 (j), as appearing in 402 Mass. 1401 (1988), provides the deadline for service (ninety days after filing of complaint), while providing extensions of that deadline only on a showing of \u201cgood cause why such service was not made within that period.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, as of ninety days after the end of the repose period, a defendant can proceed \u201csecure in his reasonable expectation that the slate has been wiped clean\u201d and that the earlier conduct can no longer give rise to any liability. <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, supra </em>at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Treating the filing of the motion to amend as the \u201ccommencement\u201d of the action will give a defendant at least equally prompt notice, and will therefore not result in upsetting any \u201creasonable expectation\u201d that liability has terminated. <em>Id. </em>Here, the defendant was served with the motion to amend, and was informed that it had been filed with the court, prior to the expiration of the statute of repose. Local rule 15.1 (b) requires that the motion to amend be served on the proposed defendant <em>prior </em>to the filing of the motion, a rule that guarantees service on the defendant prior to the expiration of the statute of repose, without even the slight flexibility for service provided by rule 4 (j). See note 8, <em>supra. </em>In other words, whereas timely commencement of an action by the filing of the complaint does not necessarily translate into notification to the defendant until sometime <em>after </em>the expiration of the repose period, the requirement of prior service under the local rule ensures notification prior to the expiration of the repose period. With that notice and filing, such a defendant is made aware, within the repose period, of the fact that the plaintiff is bringing suit for the alleged prior conduct. As of the time of that notice and filing of the motion, a defendant has not yet become entitled to any \u201creasonable expectation that the slate has been wiped clean.\u201d <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, supra </em>at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Here, despite the plaintiffs\u2019 initial failure to comply with local rule 15.1 (b), this defendant was served with the motion to amend and notified of the fact that the motion had been filed, all prior to the expiration of the seven-year repose period. Thus, within the time provided by the statute of repose (and well within the time for notice of the filing of a complaint that would be allowed by the ordinary ninety-day service period), this defendant had actual knowledge that the plaintiffs had taken the first step in court to pursue a malpractice claim against him for his alleged misreading of the prenatal ultrasound. Thus, concerns about notice to the defendant do not require us to treat the later filing of the amended complaint as the \u201ccommencement\u201d of the action for purposes of the statute of repose, as both the filing of the motion and notice to the defendant occurred prior to the expiration of the repose period.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">We find considerable supporting authority in other jurisdictions, which (in the absence of any \u201crelation back\u201d provisions) take the position that the filing of the motion to amend, not the court\u2019s later ruling on that motion or the even later filing of the complaint following allowance of that motion, is the date on which the new action is commenced.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Mayes </em>v. <em>AT &amp; T Info.

Better reasoned decisions recognize that it is incorrect to characterize a motion to amend as an event that \u201ctolls\u201d a statute. See <em>Totura &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 680 (noting cases that \u201cloosely utilized\u201d language referring to \u201ctolling\u201d of statute, but holding that \u201cunder proper analysis, the motion to amend was sufficient to stand in place of an amended complaint and the action was, therefore, deemed commenced\u201d); <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>East Tenn.

Thus, the defendant argues, if the proposed amended complaint is annexed or otherwise accompanies the motion to amend, a document captioned as a \u201ccomplaint\u201d is physically filed on the date the motion is filed, thus satisfying the rule 3 definition of commencement of an action. Here, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend was not accompanied by any draft amended complaint. Thus, the defendant argues, these plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend is distinguishable from the motions to amend in cases treating the motion filing as the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In many, but not all, of the cases cited above, the motion to amend was accompanied by a draft of a proposed amended complaint, as that is the customary practice in filing such motions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, the filing of a draft amended complaint with the motion should not be determinative whether the motion filing satisfies a statute of repose. A motion to amend must adequately describe the contemplated amendment in order for a court to determine the merits of the motion. That requirement may be and commonly is met by submitting a copy of the proposed amended complaint along with the motion, but nothing precludes a plaintiff from describing the proposed amendment in the body of the motion, or in the memorandum submitted in support of the motion. Indeed, the motion to amend, which must articulate the relation between the new claim and the claims already made in the original complaint, and explain why that new claim was not raised in that original complaint, will likely contain more detail about the proposed claim than a draft version of the proposed amended complaint, which need only satisfy the minimal requirements of notice pleading. The motion to amend at issue here was allowed based on the description of the proposed action set forth in the text of the motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>without requiring the plaintiffs to submit any draft complaint.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It would elevate form over substance to hold that a motion and memorandum describing a proposed claim would not \u201ccommence[]\u201d an action against a new defendant but that the attachment of an exhibit bearing a caption and the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d would \u201ccommence[]\u201d the action.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Whether or not the proposed complaint is attached to the motion, filing the motion is still the first step required of a plaintiff, and service of the motion upon the new defendant alerts that defendant to the fact that the plaintiff has taken that first step in bringing whatever action is described in the motion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is that fact \u2014 not the caption or title placed on any exhibit to the motion to amend \u2014 that serves the purposes of the statute of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">We emphasize that our interpretation in no way derogates from our strict approach to statutes of repose. Notwithstanding compelling equitable considerations, statutes of repose are not tolled. <em>Protective Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>425 Mass. 615, 631 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>n.19 (1997), citing <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Iantosca, </em>409 Mass. 796, 798 (1991). Nor are they subject to the \u201crelation back\u201d provisions for amended complaints. <em>Tindol </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>396 Mass. 515, 519 (1986). All we do today is define a certain, definitive act that will, for purposes of a statute of repose, \u201ccommence[]\u201d an action sought to be brought by way of an amended complaint. We recognize that statutes of repose are harsh, but we will not adopt a needlessly artificial definition of \u201ccommencement\u201d of actions brought by way of amended complaints that would make a harsh rule even harsher.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">3. <em>Noncompliance with local rules. </em>Having concluded that the filing of a motion to amend commences an action for purposes of a statute of repose, the next certified question asks whether the policies underlying the statutes of repose demand strict enforcement of local rules of court applicable to filing a motion for leave to amend, or whether those policies permit the court in its discretion to excuse noncompliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">As discussed above, a statute of repose is satisfied as long as a motion for leave to amend a complaint, either describing the action being brought or attaching a proposed amended complaint, has been filed within the period provided by the statute of repose. In this case, the clerk apparently accepted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for fifing on March 10, 1999, notwithstanding the lack of a certificate of service in accordance with local rule 15.1 (b). While the failure to comply with that local rule would presumably constitute grounds for the clerk to reject the fifing, or for the judge to strike the motion, the decision to excuse the noncompfiance with local rules applicable to the fifing of motions to amend does not implicate the policies underlying the statutes of repose. By way of analogy, if the fifing of an original complaint failed in some manner to comport with a local rule but, notwithstanding that failure, was filed with the clerk on a particular day, the action would be \u201ccommenced\u201d on that day under rule 3. A party who fails to comply with a local rule concerning the fifing of a complaint or a motion always runs the risk that that fifing may be rejected by the clerk, or struck at some later date, or that the violation may result in some other, adverse consequence, but if the fifing is accepted and not struck, the filing date remains as the operative date for purposes of compliance with a statute of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>4. <em>Conclusion. </em>As to the first certified question, we respond that the operative date for commencement of an action for purposes of our statutes of repose is the date of filing of a motion for leave to amend a complaint to add a party. As to the second certified question, we respond that the policies underlying our statutes of repose permit the court in its discretion to excuse noncompliance with the local rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The Reporter of Decisions is to furnish attested copies of this opinion to the clerk of this court. The clerk in turn will transmit one copy, under the seal of this court, to the clerk of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, as the answers to the questions certified, and will also transmit a copy to each party.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Rule 15 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a] party may amend the party\u2019s pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is permitted and the action has not been placed upon the trial calendar, the party may so amend it at any time within 20 days after it is served. Otherwise a party may amend the party\u2019s pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Rule 15 (a) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, 365 Mass. 761 (1974), is essentially identical to the Federal Rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Aaron\u2019s cause of action is governed by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60D, which provides in pertinent part that \u201cany claim by a minor against a health care provider stemming from professional services or health care rendered, whether in contract or tort, based on an alleged act, omission or neglect shall be commenced within three years from the date the cause of action accrues, except that a minor under the full age of six years shall have until his ninth birthday in which the action may be commenced, <em>but in no event shall any such action be commenced more than seven years after occurrence of the act or admission which is the alleged cause of the injury upon which such action is based </em>except where the action is based upon the leaving of a foreign object in the body\u201d (emphasis added). Similarly, the parents\u2019 loss of consortium claim is governed by G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4, which provides in pertinent part that \u201c[ajctions of contract or tort for malpractice, error or mistake against physicians . . . shall be commenced only within three years after the cause of action accrues, <em>but in no event shall any such action be commenced more than seven years after occurrence of the act or omission which is the alleged cause of the injury upon which such action is based </em>except where the action is based upon the leaving of a foreign object in the body\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b660-5\">A similar course of action is available in Federal court. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 3; Fed. R. Civ. P. 42 (a). In fact, with their motion to amend still pending, and operating under the mistaken assumption that the repose period ran from the date of Aaron\u2019s birth, the plaintiffs took that precise action on April 2, 1999. The court properly dismissed that complaint as time barred, and denied the motion to consolidate as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b661-6\">See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Garabedian, </em>433 Mass. 360, 362-363 (2001) (under discovery rule, claims arising out of childhood sexual abuse still viable thirty years later, notwithstanding three-year statute of limitations).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b662-6\">This standard is a stringent one, requiring a showing that counsel made diligent efforts within the allotted time period for effecting service. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Corrigan, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 309, 311-312 (1998), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Both the facts of this case and the phrasing of the certified question ask us to address this issue \u201cassuming timely service\u201d on the defendant. Timeliness of service is not itself a requirement imposed by the statutes of repose, which require only that the action be \u201ccommenced.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60D. G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4. Other provisions in the rules ensure that, once \u201ccommenced,\u201d a defendant receives prompt notification of the action. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 4 (j), as appearing in 402 Mass. 1401 (1988). Because of the provisions of local rule 15.1 (b), and because of the actual notice provided to this defendant before the statute ran, we need not address whether, in the absence of such a rule or such actual notice, treating the filing of a motion to amend as the \u201ccommencement\u201d of the action would be contrary to the purposes of a statute of repose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\">We recognize that this authority from other jurisdictions consists of cases involving statutes of limitation, whereas the question before us involves statutes of repose. However, once a cause of action governed by a statute of limitations has accrued, and in the absence of any form of tolling or relation back, compliance with a statute of limitations requires the exact same procedural step as compliance with a statute of repose, i.e., the action must be \u201ccommenced\u201d by the requisite deadline set by the applicable statute. Analysis of what step \u201ccommences\u201d an action that is brought by way of an amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>complaint is not affected by whether the deadline for \u201ccommencing\u201d the action has been set by a statute of repose or a statute of limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The defendant points to <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Sulcus Computer Corp., </em>103 F.R.D. 548, 549-550 (N.D. Ga. 1984), in support of the proposition that an action against a newly added defendant is not commenced until the amended complaint itself is filed with the court. That case, however, did not involve a motion to amend. Rather, the plaintiff attempted to amend the complaint as a matter of right before a responsive pleading had been served, only to discover that the original defendant had served a responsive pleading by mail on the same day that the plaintiff served the amended complaint. <em>Id. </em>In opining that the amended complaint was not \u201ceffective\u201d until it was filed with the court two days later, the court was doing so for purposes of determining whether the defendant\u2019s simultaneous service of a responsive pleading had cut off the plaintiff\u2019s ability to amend the complaint as of right. See <em>id. </em>Cf. <em>Palmquist </em>v. <em>Conseco Med. Ins. Co., </em>128 F. Supp. 2d 618, 622 (D.S.D. 2000) (amended complaint served simultaneously with defendant\u2019s responsive pleading was still amendment as of right). The procedural issue in <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Sulcus Computer Corp., supra, </em>bears no relation to the issue we decide today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b665-6\">See, e.g., <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>999 F.2d 1125, 1131 (7th Cir. 1993) (because \u201cparty has no control over when a court renders its decision\u201d on motion to amend, filing of motion with proposed amended complaint \u201ctolls the statute of limitation, even though technically the amended complaint will not be filed until the court rules on the motion\u201d); <em>Eaton Corp. </em>v. <em>Appliance Valves Co., </em>634 F.

Indus., Inc., </em>173 W. Va. 253, 256 (1984), which refers to the motion to amend as \u201csufficient to toll a statute of limitations,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>but which simultaneously refers to the commencement of an original action as only \u201ctolling the statute of limitations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b666-7\">While the filing of the motion \u201ccommences\u201d the action for purposes of satisfying a statute of repose, that filing does not trigger the new defendant\u2019s obligation to serve a responsive pleading. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (a), 365 Mass. 754 (1974); Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 (a). That obligation does not arise until the new defendant is served with the amended complaint, which will not occur unless and until the motion to amend is allowed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In some courts, it is required by rule or is imposed as a requirement by the judge handling the motion. See 6 C.A. Wright, A.R. Miller, &amp; M.K. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1485, at 602-603 (2d ed. 1990). It is therefore unremarkable that most cases considering this issue contain as part of the procedural scenario a motion to amend that is accompanied by a draft of the proposed amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b668-5\">As one might expect, the text of the motion actually contained more details of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim than would be found in the ordinary complaint (e.g., the identity of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert, the details of the baby\u2019s delivery, and the precise nature of his injuries).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Indeed, the seminal case on this issue, <em>Rademaker </em>v. <em>E.D. Flynn Export Co., </em>17 F.2d 15, 16 (5th Cir. 1927), involved a plaintiff whose \u201capplication\u201d for amendment only described the relationship between the new defendant and the original claims, without submitting any revised version of the complaint. Other cases since have treated the motion filing as the commencement of the action, even though the motion provided only a description of the new action, and not an articulation in the form of a complaint. See <em>Totura &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>754 So. 2d 671, 680 (Fla. 2000) (\u201cmotion to amend sufficiently identified the new party, [an insurance company], and set forth that relief would be demanded for uninsured motorist benefits\u201d; action was therefore \u201cdeemed commenced\u201d against insurer). See also <em>Longo </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Elec. Co., </em>618 F. Supp. 87, 89 (W.D. Pa. 1985), affd, 856 F.2d 183, 184 (3d Cir. 1988) (filing of motion to amend commenced action; opinion does not specify whether motion attached a proposed complaint).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the amended complaint in this case went beyond the simple negligence claim announced in the motion to amend raises an issue beyond the scope of the certified questions. We have not been asked to decide whether a motion to strike or dismiss any of the additional counts contained in the amended complaint should be granted. The sole question before us is whether the filing of the motion to amend is sufficient to satisfy the statutes of repose, and the answer to that question does not require us to resolve any alleged discrepancies between the proposed amended complaint described in the motion to amend and the actual complaint later filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
