Knight claims the trial judge erred in (1) allowing the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to amend the indictment to change the date of the victim\u2019s death; (2) precluding the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s principal witness about the effect of the verdict in the criminal trial of Louise Woodward on the witness\u2019s decision to testify against Knight; and (3) admitting testimony of that same witness on direct examination to the effect that she had made prior consistent statements. Knight also claims that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the conviction and decline to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the verdict or order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, reserving certain details for discussion in conjunction with the issues raised. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>431 Mass. 30, 31 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Pasquale Candelino was a sixty-one year old man who resided in the North End section of Boston. In the afternoon of Saturday, June 22, 1996, his body was found by his landlord in the bedroom of his apartment. The apartment had been \u201cransacked, drawers were open, doors, cabinet doors were open,\u201d and there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>was blood on the floor and the walls of the bedroom and bloody fingerprints inside an open drawer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The medical examiner conducted an autopsy and determined that the victim died of multiple stab wounds to the neck.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state of the body\u2019s decomposition was consistent with the injuries having been inflicted, and death having occurred, as early as the previous Wednesday, June 19, 1996.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Knight and his girl friend, Betsy Kelley, were drug addicts who supported their habits principally by shoplifting. They had sold stolen goods to the victim in the past, and had also purchased pills from him. On Wednesday evening, June 19, 1996, sometime after 9 p.m., they were in the North End looking for money to buy drugs. Their normal hunting grounds, the malls, were closed. They saw the victim on the street, and Knight suggested they rob him. Kelley agreed. She approached the victim and asked if she could use the bathroom in his apartment. While Kelley was in the victim\u2019s apartment (and the victim was in his bedroom), Knight rang the door bell and Kelley let him in.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Knight hid behind the refrigerator in the kitchen. When the victim came out of the bedroom Knight attacked him, pushing him back into the bedroom where a struggle ensued. Kelley remained in the kitchen searching for drugs and money. Kelley heard the victim saying, \u201cEddie, what \u2014 what are you doing? What are you doing?,\u201d and \u201cEddie, no.\u201d She also heard Knight tell the victim \u201cto shut the fuck up.\u201d After the struggle ended, \u201cIt was just quiet,\u201d and Kelley heard \u201cdrawers opening.\u201d When Knight came out of the bedroom, he had blood on his sneakers. Kelley and Knight put drugs and \u201cstuff\u201d from the victim\u2019s apartment into a black bag, then wiped the door knobs with their shirts as they were leaving. They went to a friend\u2019s apartment, where Knight told Kelley he had killed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Late in the evening of the next day, Thursday, June 20, 1996, Knight, Kelley, and two friends left for Florida on a bus that ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>rived in Orlando on Saturday morning, June 22, 1996. Knight and Kelley returned separately to the Boston area the following week. After their return, they went to the Boston Public Library and looked for newspaper accounts of the murder. The articles they found reported that the police believed the murder to have occurred on Saturday, June 22, 1996, the day on which Knight and Kelley arrived in Florida. Knight told Kelley not to worry, because \u201cthey have the dates wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">In September, 1996, three detectives came looking for Kelley at her father\u2019s home where she was staying. Her father was not at home, and she did not answer the door. After the detectives left, Kelley telephoned her father and told him that she was in trouble and had been present when Knight had killed someone. Her father began arranging for a lawyer to represent her. Kelley\u2019s father drove her to a Mend\u2019s house, and she told the Mend what had happened in the victim\u2019s apartment on the night of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Knight was arrested on December 16, 1996, and was indicted on December 31, 1996, for murder in the first degree and armed robbery. The indictment stated that the victim died \u201con or about June 21, 1996.\u201d Kelley was also indicted and, as arranged by her lawyer, surrendered to the police on January 2, 1997. After being held in jail pending trial for more than one year, Kelley agreed to be interviewed by detectives and, in January, 1998, negotiated a plea agreement with the Commonwealth. The agreement required that she testify at Knight\u2019s Mal and plead guilty to manslaughter. The Commonwealth agreed to recommend an eighteen-month sentence, guaranteeing Kelley\u2019s release from prison shortly after Knight\u2019s Mai.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">When Kelley was interviewed, she told the detectives that the victim had been robbed and killed on June 19, 1996, before she and Knight went to Florida. Thereafter, the Commonwealth moved to amend the indictment to change the date of the murder to \u201con or about June 19, 1996.\u201d After a hearing, the motion judge allowed the amendment over Knight\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">At trial, the Commonwealth relied primarily on Kelley\u2019s testimony to establish Knight\u2019s guilt. The Commonwealth also introduced evidence of a knife that police seized from Knight when he was arrested on unrelated charges on June 27, 1996, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>five days after the victim\u2019s body was found. The medical examiner\u2019s testimony indicated that the knife was not inconsistent with the victim\u2019s wounds. The defense relied primarily on the testimony of six witnesses from the victim\u2019s neighborhood who testified that they had seen the victim at various locations on Thursday, June 20, and Friday, June 21, when the undisputed evidence demonstrated that Kelley and Knight were on a bus bound for Florida.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defense contended that Kelley\u2019s testimony was a fabrication induced by the Commonwealth\u2019s offer of an eighteen-month sentence and by her fear of remaining in prison for life if she were convicted. The Commonwealth attempted to rebut this contention by calling the friend to whom Kelley had confided the details of the murder in September, 1996, long before her indictment, arrest, and incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Knight filed a timely notice of appeal from his conviction, and a motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">2. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">a. <em>Motion to amend the indictment. </em>Knight asserts that the judge improperly allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to amend the indictment to change the date of the victim\u2019s death. Knight preserved this issue at trial, and also raised it in his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Under Mass. R. Crim. P. 4 (d), 378 Mass. 849 (1979), \u201ca judge may allow amendment of the form of a[n] . . . indictment if such amendment would not prejudice the defendant or the Commonwealth.\u201d Cases interpreting rule 4 (d) set forth two requirements for such amendments. First, the amendment must be a matter of form and not a matter of substance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>269 Mass. 598, 606 (1930).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, even if the amendment is a matter of form, it must not result in prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>385 Mass. 863, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>870 n.8 (1982). The power of the court to allow amendment to an indictment also has constitutional constraints. Under art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, \u201cno one may be convicted of a crime punishable by a term in the State prison without first being indicted for that crime by a grand jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>421 Mass. 547, 549 (1995). An amendment that \u201cmaterially changes the work of the grand jury\u201d interferes with that right. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>358 Mass. 672, 679 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We first consider whether the amendment was a matter of form or substance. Matters of form are those that are \u201cnot essential to the description of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, supra </em>at 606. \u201cThe time alleged for an offense is ordinarily treated as a matter of detail rather than substance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campiti, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 43, 50 (1996). See G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 20 (\u201cThe time and place of the commission of the crime need not be alleged [in the indictment] unless it is an essential element thereof\u201d). Although a date of death was included in the original indictment, it is not an essential element of the crime of murder. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 683 (1992) (amending date of murder alleged in indictment proper because change involved nonessential element of indictment); G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1 (definition of murder does not include date of victim\u2019s death); G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79 (form of murder indictment does not include date of victim\u2019s death). In fact, the Commonwealth could have proceeded on the original indictment and properly proved, without fear of dismissal based on variance of proof, that the murder occurred on June 19, a date that clearly comes within the original time frame of \u201con or about\u201d June 21. See G. L. c. 277, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 34, 35.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">One test for determining whether an amendment is a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>of form or one of substance is whether a conviction on the original indictment would bar the subsequent prosecution of the defendant based on the amended indictment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, supra </em>at 609 (amendment to indictment for intent to extort money to change name of person threatened was change of substance that would not bar subsequent prosecution). If Knight had been tried for the murder of the victim based on the original indictment, there is no question that the Commonwealth would be barred from prosecuting him again for the murder of the same individual based on the amended indictment. See <em>id. </em>Conversely, Knight\u2019s conviction based on the amended indictment bars the Commonwealth from prosecuting him again based on the original indictment. The change of the date of the victim\u2019s death in the indictment was a change in form, not substance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">We next consider whether the amendment created prejudice to Knight. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hobbs, supra. </em>A defendant is not prejudiced by an amendment if the \u201clanguage of the indictment inform[s] the [defendant] of the charge against him.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>415 Mass. 161, 165 (1993) (no prejudice from amendment changing \u201cand\u201d to \u201cor\u201d in bribery indictment). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parrotta, </em>316 Mass. 307, 311 (1944) (amendment adding place of larceny not prejudicial when indictment, before and after amendment, \u201csufficiently apprised defendant of the stolen property which he was charged with receiving\u201d). Here, both the original indictment and the amended indictment sufficiently informed Knight of the charge against him, the murder in the first degree of Pasquale Candelino. Although a defendant may be prejudiced if he makes the details of his alibi defense known to the prosecution before the amendment of the date of the crime, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 203 (1983), there is no evidence that Knight disclosed the details of his alibi defense to the Commonwealth. There was no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Finally, we consider whether the amendment to the indictment materially changed the work of the grand jury. Knight as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>serts that the grand jury should have been allowed to \u201cresolve the fundamental contradictions between the prosecution\u2019s new theory (that the victim was murdered on Wednesday night [June 19, 1996]) with the extensive evidence that the victim was last seen alive on Friday night [June 21, 1996].\u201d However, the circumstances of the crime that were presented to the grand jury were substantially the same as the circumstances presented to the jury at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Both the grand jury and the trial jury heard testimony that the body of the victim was found on Saturday, June 22, 1996. Both juries heard testimony that the victim was seen alive on Thursday, June 20, and Friday, June 21. With respect to Knight\u2019s involvement in the murder, the grand jury heard the testimony of Knight\u2019s jail cellmate,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to whom Knight had confided the details of the murder, and the testimony of Kelley\u2019s friend, to whom Kelley had also divulged the details of the murder. The fact that the principal evidence at trial was Kelley\u2019s testimony rather than Knight\u2019s cellmate\u2019s is of no consequence. The crime described to both juries was the same; it occurred in the same place, against the same victim, in the same manner, and by the same person. The work of the grand jury was not materially changed by the amendment to the indictment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 636, 639-640 (1974) (indictment \u201cwhich remain[s] unchanged apart from the date and which [is] buttressed by the specifications which also remainf] substantially unchanged, provides a sufficient showing that the set of circumstances before the grand jury was indeed the same set of circumstances on which the conviction rests\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The allowance of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to amend the indictment was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">b. <em>Exclusion of testimony about the Louise Woodward verdict. </em>Knight asserts that the judge improperly excluded testimony about the effect of the Louise Woodward verdict<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> on Kelley\u2019s decision to testify against him. Knight preserved this issue at trial, and also raised it in his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>On cross-examination, Knight\u2019s counsel attempted to question Kelley about the effect of the Woodward verdict on her decision to testify. The Commonwealth objected. At a bench conference, defense counsel claimed the similarities between Kelley and Woodward \u2014 both were nineteen years old and unfamiliar with the legal process \u2014 would show why even an innocent person would plead guilty rather than risk a trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Commonwealth argued that this line of questioning would be \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d because \u201cWoodward had been in the newspaper every single day\u201d and \u201c[cjounsel could have asked anything he wanted about going to trial without having to throw Woodward into this thing.\u201d The Commonwealth also noted that \u201cfejvery juror just smirked when\u201d defense counsel referred to Woodward.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The judge ruled that this line of questioning was not warranted because the Woodward case was \u201cvery controversial\u201d and \u201cemotionally loaded in many different ways,\u201d and the defense had not made a strong enough showing of relevance. Defense counsel was then permitted, however, to inquire at length \u201cas to [Kelley\u2019s] concerns and fears about conviction, about incarceration, and anything of that sort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Knight now claims that the exclusion of this testimony violated his constitutional right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. Knight argues the inquiry was relevant to Kelley\u2019s credibility, and that cross-examination would have explained to the jury why an innocent person would choose to lie and implicate herself in a murder, rather than face trial and risk being wrongly convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Although a judge may exclude evidence that is of little probative value, she may not bar all inquiry into a subject that could demonstrate a witness\u2019s bias. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aguiar, </em>400 Mass. 508, 512, 513, 515 (1987) (defendant entitled to new trial when judge foreclosed all inquiry into \u201cstar witness\u2019s\u201d true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>motive for testifying, that defendant threatened to turn witness over to police for drug dealing). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moorer, </em>431 Mass. 544, 547 (2000). There are two factors to be weighed in determining \u201cwhether a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to cross-examine and thus to confront a witness against him has been denied because of an unreasonable limitation of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>420 Mass. 67, 72 (1995). The first is the \u201cmateriality of the witness\u2019s direct testimony,\u201d and the second is the \u201cdegree of the restriction on cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is no question that Kelley\u2019s direct testimony was material to the Commonwealth\u2019s case because she provided the only first-hand account of the murder. The judge did not improperly limit the defense\u2019s cross-examination of Kelley, however, because the jury were presented with sufficient evidence with which to assess her bias and credibility. She was extensively cross-examined about her drug use, prior convictions of forgery, larceny, and fraud, her plea agreement with the Commonwealth, and her fears about being convicted of murder and incarcerated for life. Defense counsel also attempted to impeach Kelley by pointing out inconsistencies in her testimony and conflicts between Kelley\u2019s testimony and other evidence. In this context, we conclude that the judge\u2019s ruling excluding the minimally relevant but highly inflammatory line of questions about the Woodward verdict was not error.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">c. <em>Admission of prior consistent statements. </em>At trial, Kelley testified on direct examination that before she was arrested she told her father: \u201cI was in big trouble, that I was there when Eddie killed someone\u201d; and told a friend: \u201cEddie killed somebody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>and that I was there, in the North End.\u201d Defense counsel did not object to this testimony at trial. Knight asserted in his motion for a new trial and on appeal that this testimony regarding prior consistent statements m\u00e1de by the witness was improperly admitted in evidence. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">A witness\u2019s prior statement that is consistent with his testimony at trial may be admitted if the witness\u2019s testimony at trial is \u201cimpeached by a claim of recent contrivance or inducement,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Rivera, 430 Mass. 91, 99 (1999), and if the statement was \u201cmade before the witness had an incentive to fabricate testimony,\u201d <em>id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Even when admitted for this purpose, the prior statement is not admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted. <em>Id. </em>at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Knight cannot credibly contend that he did not intend to impeach Kelley\u2019s testimony at trial by claiming it was recently fabricated or the product of government inducement. Such a claim was one of the cornerstones of his defense. There remains, however, the question of timing. Kelley testified, albeit in cursory form, that she had made prior consistent statements to her father and her friend before defense counsel had attempted to impeach her testimony on cross-examination. This sequencing is not, however, determinative. The trial judge has \u201cwide discretion in deciding whether the circumstances warrant the admission of a witness\u2019s prior consistent statements when [the witness] has been or will be impeached with an inconsistent statement.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saarela, </em>376 Mass. 720, 723 (1978) (prior consistent statements properly admitted on direct examination because claim of recent contrivance unavoidable). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>425 Mass. 382, 397 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>It was not only inevitable, but necessary for the defense to attempt to impeach Kelley at trial with a claim of recent contrivance. To utilize his alibi, Knight\u2019s defense relied on establishing the victim\u2019s date of death as Friday, June 21, not Wednesday, June 19. It was imperative for Knight to establish not only that Kelley was lying about the date of the murder, but also that she had a motive to implicate herself and Knight in a murder they did not commit, and that her motive was the plea agreement that got her out of jail. This strategy was apparent to the judge at least as early as defense counsel\u2019s opening statement, which was made immediately after the Commonwealth\u2019s.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In these circumstances, the judge\u2019s failure to exclude, sua sponte, Kelley\u2019s brief testimony about having made prior consistent statements was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Knight\u2019s further claim that Kelley had a reason to fabricate a story about the robbery and murder before speaking to her father and her friend in September, 1996, is equally meritless. The gravamen of Knight\u2019s theory at trial was that Kelley fabricated the story about participating in a murder that she did not commit so that she could get out of jail as soon as possible. It would defy logic on the facts of this case to conclude that she had reason to formulate such a false story long before any indictment, arrest, or incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Finally, the fact that the judge did not give a limiting instruction when Kelley testified to these prior statements was not error. The judge properly and adequately instructed the jury on the limited use of prior statements both when Kelley\u2019s friend was called by the Commonwealth to testify about the substance of their conversation in September, 1996,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and in her charge to the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, supra </em>at 100 (no substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice created by lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>of limiting instruction at time of testimony about prior consistent statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">d. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>\u201cIn capital cases, we review an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under the substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard, which is more favorable to the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>431 Mass. 282, 289, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1020 (2000). In reviewing each claim, \u201c[w]e look to see whether there was an error in the course of the trial and, if there was, \u2018whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>420 Mass. 242, 246 &amp; n.5 (1995). Knight claims that his counsel was ineffective because he failed to request an alibi instruction, failed to call a potential defense witness, failed to produce evidence which would have impeached a portion of Kelley\u2019s testimony, and failed to cross-examine adequately the medical examiner about the time of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">We first consider whether defense counsel erred by not requesting an alibi instruction. Knight asserts that the lack of a specific alibi instruction was error because his alibi was a critical part of his defense. However, \u201cit cannot be counted a mistake to omit the [alibi] charge, if it is otherwise made clear that the burden of showing that the defendant was present at the time and place, and thus capable of committing the crime, remains on the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>380 Mass. 565, 579 (1980), <em>S.C., </em>430 Mass. 800 (2000). \u201cIn considering the judge\u2019s instructions we look to the entire charge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sarmanian, </em>426 Mass. 405, 408 (1998). There was no error because the instructions in their entirety properly informed the jury of the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Knight committed the crimes charged, and that he was physically present at the scene of the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sarmanian, su</em>pra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medina, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">We next consider whether defense counsel was ineffective in not calling Phyllis Danieli as a witness at trial. Danieli testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>before the grand jury in December, 1996, that she had coffee with the victim the day before his body was found, that the victim asked Danieli to come to his apartment that night, gave her his telephone number, and said to telephone him that evening, at 7 p.m. She did not telephone the victim that night, nor did she go to his apartment. The next day, Danieli heard the victim had been murdered. She was \u201cshocked\u201d when she heard about the victim\u2019s death, and testified that she told people, \u201cWow. Thank God I didn\u2019t go in there that night. I could have been killed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">At trial, defense counsel called five witnesses who testified that they had seen the victim alive on Friday, June 21, 1996, and a sixth witness, the victim\u2019s uncle, who testified that he had coffee with the victim on Thursday, June 20, 1996. The Commonwealth attacked the witnesses\u2019 credibility on cross-, examination by establishing that each of the them saw the victim often, in some cases, every day, and there was \u201cnothing to distinguish one day from the next.\u201d Knight asserts that the failure to call Danieli as a seventh witness was ineffective because she had a specific memory of having seen the victim \u201cthe day before he was killed\u201d; and the Commonwealth could not have impeached her by claiming that she saw the victim often, and therefore was confused about the date.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s decision not to call Danieli was a tactical one, which did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Danieli\u2019s testimony that she saw the victim alive after Wednesday, June 19, 1996, was cumulative of the testimony of six other defense witnesses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britto, </em>433 Mass. 596, 602-603 (2001) (decision not to call additional witnesses relative to issue of identification not error because testimony cumulative); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sarmanian, supra </em>at 406-407 (failure to call additional witness to bolster defendant\u2019s claim not error because additional evidence would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>cumulative, not dispositive). Moreover, Danieli\u2019s credibility was subject to serious challenge. She testified before the grand jury that she had been arrested and had a history of drug use, that she had bought and used drugs immediately after having coffee with the victim, and that she could not remember the date on which she last saw the victim other than \u201cit was in June.\u201d In addition, Danieli did not tell her story to the police until \u201cthey picked me up last Sunday [December 8, 1996],\u201d almost six months after the murder. The decision not to call Danieli as a witness was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We next consider whether defense counsel was ineffective based on his alleged failure to introduce evidence that would purportedly have impeached a portion of Kelley\u2019s testimony. The decision whether and how to \u201cimpeach a witness remains a tactical one in which a great amount of discretion is vested in the attorney.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britto, supra </em>at 603. There is no question that defense counsel exhaustively cross-examined and attempted to impeach Kelley\u2019s testimony in many ways and in many respects. Knight contends, however, that his counsel\u2019s failure to produce additional impeaching evidence was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Kelley testified on direct examination that while Knight was in the bedroom murdering the victim, she was in the kitchen \u201clooking for pills and stuff and money.\u201d Although she testified that she \u201cdidn\u2019t really want to touch anything\u201d because she did not want to leave fingerprints, she also testified that she picked up the cordless telephone from the wall and \u201cdialed the weather.\u201d After listening for a minute or so, Kelley put the telephone down \u201c[u]nder a bunch of clothes and stuff.\u201d When Kelley was asked whether she shut the telephone off, she testified, \u201cI think I \u2014 I don\u2019t think I shut it off.\u201d The victim\u2019s landlord testified that he had tried to telephone the victim on Saturday afternoon, June 22, but that the line was busy.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Knight contends that this telephone testimony could have and should have been impeached more thoroughly. In support of this contention, his appellate counsel had an experiment conducted that purportedly demonstrates that when a cordless telephone is not disconnected, a person calling that telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>will receive a \u201cbusy\u201d signal until the battery runs out, at which time the person will hear a \u201cringing\u201d signal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Knight asserts that this proves that Kelley lied about using the cordless telephone in the victim\u2019s apartment, because, he states, if Kelley had not shut off the phone on Wednesday night, the battery would have lost power by Saturday and the landlord would have received a \u201cringing\u201d signal, not a \u201cbusy\u201d signal when he telephoned that day. Trial counsel\u2019s failure to conduct a similar experiment to use as evidence to impeach Kelley\u2019s testimony, Knight argues, was ineffective. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\u201cImpeachment of a witness is, by its very nature, fraught with a host of strategic considerations, to which we will, even on \u00a7 33E review, still show deference.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>433 Mass. 340, 357 (2001). \u201cFurthermore, absent counsel\u2019s failure to pursue some obviously powerful form of impeachment available at trial, it is speculative to conclude that a different approach to impeachment would likely have affected the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, we have \u201cnever held that a lawyer must pursue every possible avenue in order to forestall an ineffective assistance claim.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britto, supra </em>at 604. We do not know whether trial counsel conducted a similar experiment and made a strategic decision not to use the results at trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We do know, however, that the information contained in the affidavit attached to Knight\u2019s motion for a new trial is less than compelling, and does not provide a basis on which to conclude that it would have changed the outcome of the trial. The probative value of this experiment is at best questionable. The telephone used in the experiment was not the actual telephone that was found in the victim\u2019s apartment, nor is it clear whether the telephone used in the experiment was even the same type or was similar in any respect to the telephone in the victim\u2019s apartment. Moreover, Kelley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>testimony about whether she shut the telephone off was equivocal. In these circumstances, the failure to attempt to impeach Kelley\u2019s testimony with the results of a similar experiment was not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Finally, we consider Knight\u2019s claim that defense counsel failed to present sufficient evidence to support the defense theory that the victim died on Friday, June 21, 1996, rather than on Wednesday, June 19, 1996. On appeal, Knight offers a portion of a police report, in which the emergency medical technician (EMT) who declared the victim deceased on Saturday, June 22, at approximately 3 p.m., stated the victim\u2019s body \u201cwas very rigid.\u201d Rigidity is consistent with rigor mortis, which occurs shortly after death and continues for approximately one day. Knight also submits a pretrial memorandum from defense counsel to the trial file, memorializing a conversation with the medical examiner during which the medical examiner \u201c [disputes [the] EMT on rigor\u201d and states \u201c[t]ime of death from early P.M. Friday consistent given heat of apartment.\u201d He contends that defense counsel did not effectively use this information in cross-examining the medical examiner.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Knight neglects to mention the very effective cross-examination of the medical examiner that his counsel did conduct. During that cross-examination, defense counsel established that the medical examiner could not pinpoint the exact time of death and that it could have occurred at any time within hours before the body was discovered. He also established that different bodies decompose at different rates; that the victim\u2019s apartment was fairly warm which would have accelerated the rate of decomposition; and that two of the victim\u2019s medical conditions, heart disease and diabetes, also could have accelerated the rate of decomposition. The fact that the examination of any witness may not have been perfect is not the standard we use to evaluate the effectiveness of counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fisher, supra </em>at 357. Counsel was not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">e. <em>G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have considered the entire record pursuant to G.
