We affirmed the murder conviction and ordered that the robbery conviction be vacated. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>428 Mass. 362, 370 (1998). Thereafter the defendant filed a motion in the Superior Court seeking a new trial. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979). The trial judge denied the motion. The defendant sought leave from a single justice of this court, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to appeal from that ruling. The single justice denied the request for leave to appeal, concluding that the defendant\u2019s motion did not present, in the words of \u00a7 33E, \u201ca new and substantial question which ought to be determined by the full court.\u201d The defendant purports to appeal from the single justice\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commonwealth has filed a motion to dismiss the \u201cappeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">This appeal is not properly before us. The single justice\u2019s decision as a gatekeeper under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, was final and unreviewable. The defendant cannot appeal to the full court. <em>Napolitano </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>432 Mass. 240, 241 (2000). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ambers, </em>397 Mass. 705, 710-711 (1986). <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>396 Mass. 740, 742 (1986). The defendant\u2019s claim that he was deprived of the effective assistance of appellate counsel on his direct appeal ignores not only the nature of plenary review, see G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, but also the single justice\u2019s determination as gatekeeper that the claim of ineffective assistance was not substantial. Nor is the defendant entitled to relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. See <em>Leaster </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>385 Mass. 547, 549 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-13\">following the single justice\u2019s ruling, the defendant filed in the county court a \u201crequest for leave for application for further appellate review,\u201d citing Mass. R. A. P. 27.1, as amended, 434 Mass. 1601 (2001), which we have treated as a notice of appeal. Rule 27.1 does not apply to the county court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
