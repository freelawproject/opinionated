(Bull), for eight years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She was laid off in April, 1995, at age fifty-three.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After she was notified about the impending layoff, Sahli applied for, but was not selected to fill, a vacant position in the human resources department. Before she left Bull, Sahli signed a release and severance agreement, in which she agreed to release Bull from any \u201ccurrent or prior claims arising out of [her] employment with or termination from Bull,\u201d in exchange for eight weeks of her salary as severance payment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Several months after leaving Bull, Sahli learned that the person who was hired to fill the vacant position was a younger woman.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Believing that she was not chosen to fill the position because of her age, Sahli filed a charge of discrimination with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD), asserting, inter alla, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">(1) \u201cBull\u2019s policy and practice in the event of a lay-off is to place a laid-off employee in another vacant position within the company, where possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">(2) \u201cI was amply qualified for [a vacant position in the human resources department].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">(3) \u201cI heard that Bull had filled the [vacant position] with an outside applicant who was a number of years younger than I was. On information or belief, the person who was hired for the position was less qualified for it than I was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">(4) \u201cI believe that Bull failed to follow its policy and practice in my case of relocating laid-off employees into vacant positions within the company and failed to hire me for the [vacant position] because of my age.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">In response to Sahli\u2019s MCAD charge, Bull filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the Superior Court alleging that Sahli\u2019s discrimination charge was barred by the terms of the release that she had signed when she left Bull. Bull contended that the essence of Sahli\u2019s discrimination claim was Bull\u2019s failure to relocate her into a vacant position instead of laying her off, and as such, was a claim arising out of her termination. Therefore, Bull asked the court to \u201cdeclar[e] the parties\u2019 respective rights, duties, and obligations under the Release Agreement,\u201d find that Sahli\u2019s bringing of the discrimination charge violated its terms, and order the return of Sahli\u2019s severance payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">One month after Bull filed its complaint, Sahli filed a second charge of discrimination with the MCAD alleging that Bull\u2019s complaint constituted discriminatory retaliation in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (4) (retaliation claim), and threats, intimidation, coercion, and interference with her protected rights in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (4A) (interference claim).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She also filed a motion to dismiss Bull\u2019s complaint in the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Court, arguing that the release did not bar her MCAD charge because it involved a \u201cfailure to hire\u201d claim that did not accrue until she discovered, several months after she had left Bull, that the person who filled the vacant position was a younger woman. Without deciding the merits of Bull\u2019s claim, a Superior Court judge allowed Sahli\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">As permitted by G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, Sahli removed both of her charges from the MCAD and filed a complaint in the Superior Court alleging age discrimination in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (IB) (Count I), retaliation in violation of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (4) (Count II), and interference with a protected right in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (4A) (Count HI). Following discovery, both parties moved for summary judgment and, on March 16, 2001, a judge allowed Bull\u2019s motion on all counts. She ruled that the undisputed fact that the person who filled the vacant position was more qualified than Sahli defeated her discrimination claim. She also ruled that Sahli\u2019s retaliation claim failed because Sahli could not show that she suffered any \u201cadverse employment consequence\u201d as a result of filing her MCAD charge, and that her interference claim failed because the filing of a lawsuit did not rise to the level of \u201cthreats, intimidation or coercion\u201d necessary to violate \u00a7 4 (4A). Bull then filed a motion for costs, which was allowed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Sahli appealed the summary judgment rulings on her claims of retaliation (Count II), and interference (Count HI). She also appealed from the allowance of the motion for costs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We transferred the case here on our own motion. We conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Bull\u2019s filing of a complaint in the Superior Court for declaratory relief did not constitute an act of retaliation or interference violative of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (4), or G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (4A), and therefore affirm the judge\u2019s allowance of Bull\u2019s motion for summary judgment, although on different grounds. <em>GTE Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>421 Mass. 22, 36 (1995). We also affirm the allowance of Bull\u2019s motion for costs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Retaliation claims under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (4), and interference claims under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (4A), constitute separate and independent causes of action. See <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>432 Mass. 107, 121 (2000). Sahli contends that Bull violated both \u00a7 4 (4) and \u00a7 4 (4A), by filing the complaint for declaratory relief which forced her to defend herself in a separate litigation, incur additional attorney\u2019s fees, and fear the loss of her severance pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The threshold question we must decide is whether the filing of a lawsuit by a corporate employer seeking a declaration of its rights, duties, and obligations under a contract entered into with one of its employees can constitute an act violative of the retaliation and interference provisions of G. L. c. 151B. To resolve this question, we must balance the constitutional right to seek judicial resolution of disputes under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and art. 11 of the Massachusetts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Declaration of Rights* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> against the statutory right under G. L. c. 151B to seek redress for allegations of discrimination without fear of retaliation for or interference with the exercise of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">We had occasion to balance similar interests in <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>424 Mass. 758 (1997) <em>(Bain). </em>In that case, a newspaper article described the plaintiff\u2019s allegations of discriminatory hiring practices in city government.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The same article also reported the mayor\u2019s response to the allegations, which included his belief that the plaintiff\u2019s complaints were \u201c \u2018baseless,\u2019 \u2018meritless,\u2019 and \u2018an example of someone trying to manipulate the civil rights laws for personal gain.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 760. The plaintiff filed suit, alleging that the mayor\u2019s comments, among other things, constituted retaliation under G. L. c. 151B against her for having voiced concerns about the city\u2019s hiring practices. <em>Id. </em>at 761, 765-766.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Balancing the plaintiff\u2019s interest in remedying discrimination with the mayor\u2019s First Amendment right to free speech, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">\u201c[W]e most emphatically cannot countenance as an instance of retaliation . . . the mayor\u2019s response in the local newspaper to the charges against him. The newspaper quoted Bain\u2019s serious and damaging charges against the mayor, an elected official. He was entitled to respond in the same forum, to defend himself and to state what political judgments seemed appropriate so long as they were not defamatory \u2014 which these were not. . . . The interest in remedying discrimination is weighty but not so weighty as to justify what amounts to a restriction on core political speech.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AII\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 766-767. Consistent with this reasoning, we conclude in the instant case that, although the interest in remedying discrimination is weighty, it is not so weighty as to justify what amounts to an absolute restriction on an employer\u2019s right to petition the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized the right to petition the government, including the courts, as one of \u201cthe most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of Rights,\u201d <em>United Mine Workers </em>v. <em>Illinois Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>389 U.S. 217, 222 (1967), implied by the \u201cvery idea of a government, republican in form,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cruikshank, </em>92 U.S. 542, 552 (1875). See <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>360 Mass. 1, 11-12 (1971) (art. 11 \u201cis clearly directed toward the preservation of procedural rights and has been so construed\u201d). The Court has protected the right to petition \u201cwhenever it is genuine, not simply when it triumphs.\u201d <em>BE &amp; K Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>536 U.S. 516, 532 (2002) <em>(BE &amp; K). </em>Thus, in the antitrust context, the Court has held that unless petitioning activity is both objectively and subjectively a \u201csham,\u201d it is immune from antitrust liability. <em>Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., </em>508 U.S. 49, 60-61 (1993). And in the labor context, the Court has held that the First Amendment protects \u201c[t]he filing and prosecution of a well-founded lawsuit [from being] enjoined as an unfair labor practice, even if it would not have been commenced but for the plaintiff\u2019s desire to retaliate against the defendant for exercising rights protected by the [National Labor Relations] Act.\u201d <em>Bill Johnson\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>461 U.S. 731, 743 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The right to petition is not, however, an absolute right. For example, \u201cbaseless\u201d or \u201csham\u201d litigation is not protected by the First Amendment. See <em>Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference </em>v. <em>Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., </em>365 U.S. 127, 144 (1961) <em>(Noerr). </em>See also <em>BE &amp; K, supra </em>at 531 (\u201cour holdings [have] limited regulation to suits that were both objectively baseless <em>and </em>subjectively motivated by an unlawful purpose\u201d [emphasis in original]). \u201cSham\u201d litigation has been defined in the antitrust context as litigation that is \u201cobjectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits,\u201d and in which the litigant\u2019s subjective motivation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>\u201c \u2018to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor\u2019 . . . through the \u2018use [of] the governmental <em>process </em>\u2014 as opposed to the <em>outcome </em>of that process \u2014 as an anticompetitive weapon\u2019\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., supra </em>at 60-61, quoting <em>Noerr, supra </em>at 144, and <em>Columbia </em>v. <em>Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., </em>499 U.S. 365, 380 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The United States Supreme Court recently granted certiorari to reexamine the scope of the right to petition when it considered whether the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) could \u201cimpose liability on an employer for filing a losing retaliatory lawsuit, even if the employer could show the suit was not objectively baseless.\u201d <em>BE &amp; K Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>534 U.S. 1074 (2002). The employer (BE &amp; K) had filed a series of unsuccessful complaints in Federal court against several unions, alleging that they had attempted to delay a construction project because BE &amp; K\u2019s employees were not unionized. <em>BE &amp; K, supra </em>at 520-522. The unions responded by lodging complaints against BE &amp; K with the NLRB, alleging that BE &amp; K had violated the antiretaliation provision of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 522. The NLRB agreed, deciding that BE &amp; K\u2019s lawsuit was not meritorious and \u201chad been unlawfully motivated because it was directed at protected conduct\u2019 and \u2018necessarily tended to discourage similar protected activity,\u2019 and because petitioner admitted it had filed suit \u2018to stop certain [u]nion conduct which it believed to be unprotected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523. Based on these conclusions, the NLRB concluded that BE &amp; K had violated the NLRA, and ordered BE &amp; K \u201cto cease and desist from prosecuting such suits and to post notice to its employees . . . promising not to pursue such litigation in the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found substantial evidence to support the NLRB\u2019s conclusions. <em>Id. </em>at 523-524.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The Supreme Court reversed, concluding that \u201cunsuccessful but reasonably based suits\u201d fall within the scope of First Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>ment protection. <em>Id. </em>at 536. In support of its decision, the Court rejected the NLRB\u2019s view of a retaliatory lawsuit \u2014 \u201cone \u2018brought with a motive to <em>interfere </em>with the exercise of protected [NLRA] rights\u2019 \u201d \u2014 because that definition \u201cbroadly covers a substantial amount of genuine petitioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533. The Court decided that if an employer\u2019s belief that certain conduct is illegal \u201cis both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable, then declaring the resulting suit illegal affects genuine petitioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533-534. The Court concluded that \u201c[a]s long as a plaintiff\u2019s <em>purpose </em>is to stop conduct he reasonably believes is illegal, petitioning is genuine both objectively and subjectively\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 534.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Where the only evidence of retaliatory purpose was the bringing of a reasonably based but unsuccessful lawsuit, combined with testimony that the employer disliked the unions, the Court held that finding the lawsuit to be violative of Federal law barring employers from interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights, unduly burdened the employer\u2019s First Amendment right to petition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Applying these principles to G. L. c. 15IB, we decline to read \u00a7 4 (4) and \u00a7 4 (4A) as reaching all reasonably based but unsuccessful lawsuits brought in response to the filing of a discrimination claim. Cf. <em>BE &amp; K, supra </em>at 536. When an employer files a complaint seeking a declaration of its rights, duties, and obligations under a contract that it entered into with an employee, and the lawsuit has a legitimate basis in law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>fact, the employer does not violate the provisions of either \u00a7 4 (4) or \u00a7 4 (4A), absent evidence that the employer\u2019s purpose is other than to stop conduct it reasonably believes violates the terms of the contract. Cf. <em>BE &amp; K, supra </em>at 533-534. We now apply this holding to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">We first consider whether Bull\u2019s complaint for declaratory relief had a legitimate basis in law. General Laws c. 231 A, \u00a7 1, allows courts to \u201cmake binding declarations of right, duty, status and other legal relations sought thereby, either before or after a breach or violation thereof has occurred in any case in which an actual controversy has arisen and is specifically set forth in the pleadings.\u201d The purpose of this statute is to provide a plaintiff relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, duties, status, and other legal relations. See, e.g., <em>Oxford </em>v. <em>Oxford Water Co., </em>391 Mass. 581, 584-585 (1984). The determination of contractual rights is a proper subject of a declaratory judgment proceeding. See, e.g., <em>Pitman </em>v. <em>J.C. Pitman &amp; Sons, </em>324 Mass. 371 (1949) (determining effect of general release signed in conjunction with sale of business). See also <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>361 Mass. 230, 234 (1972) (c. 231A \u201cwas intended to expand, at least in the discretion of the court, prior provisions for the interpretation of written instruments\u201d); <em>School Comm. of Cambridge </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of Cambridge, </em>320 Mass. 516, 518 (1946) (\u201cOne of the benefits of the declaratory procedure is that it does not require one to incur the risk of violating some term of a contract or of invading some right of the other, even if done in good faith, before he may have relief\u201d). Thus, Bull\u2019s complaint seeking declaratory relief had a legitimate basis in law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">We next consider whether there was a legitimate basis in fact to support Bull\u2019s complaint. Bull\u2019s one-count complaint sought a declaration from the court regarding its rights under the terms of the release:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>\u201cSahli released and covenanted not to sue Bull for any current or prior claims arising out of her employment with Bull or her termination from Bull. At the time she signed the Release Agreement, she knew she was being terminated and so acknowledged in the Release Agreement. The essence of her claim is that she was terminated rather than being relocated into an open position pursuant to an alleged policy or practice of Bull HN.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Bull asserted that \u201c[a] real, substantial, and justiciable controversy exists between Bull HN and Sahli concerning whether she has breached her Release Agreement with Bull HN and concerning the parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations under the General Release and Severance Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Sahli contended that there should never have been any confusion about the basis of her \u201cfailure-to-hire\u201d claim. We disagree. The correspondence between Sahli\u2019s counsel and Bull preceding the filing of the MCAD charge,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the description of the claim set out in the MCAD charge itself, and the affidavits attached to the charge<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> demonstrate that as originally filed, Sahli\u2019s MCAD charge included discrimination claims based both on Bull\u2019s failure to relocate her into the vacant position instead of laying her off (a claim likely covered by the release), and on Bull\u2019s failure to hire her into the vacant position after she had been laid off (a claim likely not covered by the release). Even if viewed in the light most favorable to Sahli, the basis for her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>original charge was unclear. To the extent that this lack of clarity could have reasonably led Bull to believe that part or all of Sahli\u2019s MCAD charge was barred by the release, there was a legitimate basis in fact to support the filing of Bull\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Finally, there is no evidence that Bull\u2019s purpose in bringing the lawsuit was anything other than to stop conduct it reasonably believed to be violative of the terms of the release.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The only evidence of retaliatory purpose was the filing of the lawsuit itself. As the Supreme Court held in <em>BE &amp; K, supra, </em>such evidence is inadequate, as a matter of law, to justify any burden on Bull\u2019s constitutional right to petition the courts. The filing of Bull\u2019s complaint did not violate \u00a7 4 (4) or \u00a7 4 (4A) of G. L. c. 15IB, and summary judgment was properly granted.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">3. <em>Award of costs. </em>The Superior Court judge properly allowed Bull\u2019s motion for costs. General Laws c. 261, \u00a7 1, states: \u201cIn civil actions the prevailing party shall recover his costs, except as otherwise provided.\u201d Rule 54 (d) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, as appearing in 382 Mass. 821 (1980), states that: \u201cExcept when express provision therefor is made either in a statute of the Commonwealth or in these rules, costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs . . . .\u201d Contrary to Sahli\u2019s contention, G. L. c. 15 IB does not preclude an award of costs to a prevailing defendant. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9 (\u201cIf the court finds for the petitioner it shall, in addition to any other relief and irrespective of the amount in controversy, award the petitioner reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Sahli worked as a manager of relocation, service awards, and employment records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b719-8\">During the period of Sahli\u2019s employment at Bull NH Information Systems, Inc.

The brief explained that the Attorney General, along with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, filed a complaint against Bull in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts under the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626 (2000), and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 et seq. (2000). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bull HN Info. Sys., </em>16 F. Supp. 2d 90 (D. Mass. 1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bull HN Info. Sys., </em>143 F. Supp. 2d 134 (D. Mass. 2001). A Federal judge ruled that the releases Bull had its employees sign in 1995, presumably including the release that Sahli signed, were invalid under Federal law. There has been no ruling as to the validity of those releases under Massachusetts law. Sahli has not contested the validity of the release in this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging ... the right of the people . . . to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d It applies to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>legislative power of the States through the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
