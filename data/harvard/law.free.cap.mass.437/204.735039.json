The defendant\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peloquin, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 960 (1991). In 1993, the defendant filed a pro se motion for a new trial. Counsel was appointed to represent him. The motion asserted that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel had provided him with ineffective representation by failing to request a jury instruction on the so-called \u201ccastle\u201d law, G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 8A. The defendant also contended that the failure to raise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>issue on direct appeal did not constitute a waiver because his trial counsel also served as appellate counsel. A judge in the Superior Court denied the motion without a hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appeals Court reversed the denial of the motion for a new trial, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peloquin, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 480 (2001), concluding that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel had been ineffective. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review and now affirm the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">1. The Commonwealth presented evidence tending to show the following. On the morning of February 20,1987, two intruders entered the defendant\u2019s apartment in Brockton and ordered the defendant and two other men, John Landolfi and Pete Watson, to lie on the floor at gunpoint. One of the intruders grabbed two children<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who also were present in the apartment and held one child under each arm. The three men on the floor were told not to move or they would be shot. The intruders robbed the defendant of over $2,000 and a gold chain. After the assailants left, no one telephoned the police to report the robbery. Instead, the defendant enlisted the aid of his younger brother, Craig M. Faria, to seek out the assailants and recover the stolen money.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">After drinking together for a short time, the defendant, Faria, and Landolfi drove around Brockton in search of a person whom the defendant believed to have been one of the assailants (Ernie Harris). The defendant and Faria were both armed with handguns. On seeing Harris, the defendant and Faria approached him, but Harris eluded them and fled down the street. Their attempt to recover the stolen money unsuccessful, the defendant, Faria, and Landolfi returned to the defendant\u2019s apartment and resumed drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The defendant was angry with Faria and a heated argument developed between the two men. The defendant accused Faria of allowing Harris to escape and told him that \u201c[he] should have shot [Harris].\u201d Faria responded, \u201cYou think you\u2019re tough [but] without guns you\u2019re nothing.\u201d The defendant called Faria a \u201cpuke\u201d and a \u201clow life.\u201d At one point during the afternoon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>the defendant took possession of Faria\u2019s gun. Several times, the defendant told Faria to leave his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Just after 5 p.m., Faria offered to go find Harris. He put on his coat and was preparing to leave, but the defendant told him to \u201cforget it.\u201d Faria sat back down in a large wicker chair with a \u201cfan back.\u201d The defendant sat directly across from him, approximately ten feet away. The defendant began waving his gun around and telling Faria that he should have shot Harris. Faria, who did not have a gun at that point, told the defendant, \u201cPut the gun away or I\u2019ll stick it up your ass.\u201d Faria also told the defendant that he would \u201crip his face off.\u201d The defendant said to Faria, \u201cI\u2019ll shoot you. I\u2019ll shoot you. You don\u2019t think I\u2019ll shoot you?,\u201d and that he was \u201cgoing to do Brockton a favor.\u201d The defendant pulled out the larger of the two guns, and, crouching on one knee, he fired two or three times at Faria. The defendant then walked out of the back door of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Faria died at a hospital shortly thereafter from two gunshot wounds to the abdomen. The pathologist who performed the autopsy testified that the bullets first grazed Faria\u2019s hands, which, the Commonwealth argued, indicated that Faria had held both hands in front of his stomach in a defensive posture at the time that he was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The defendant\u2019s evidence portrayed a much different picture of the events. The defendant testified in his own behalf and admitted that he was angry with Faria for failing to recover the money that had been taken from him. On returning to his apartment, the men began drinking heavily and the discussion grew increasingly heated. Reminding Faria, \u201cThere\u2019s kids in my house\u201d and \u201c[he did not] want no guns around here,\u201d the defendant asked Faria for his gun and then placed both his gun and Faria\u2019s gun within a hidden space above \u201can artificial ceiling\u201d in the kitchen. As the afternoon wore on, Faria become offensive and violent toward the defendant. Faria called the defendant a \u201cpunk\u201d and threatened to \u201ckick [his] ass.\u201d The defendant asked Faria to leave at least ten times.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">According to the defendant, at approximately 6 p.m., Faria took both guns out of the ceiling and handed the defendant back his gun. Faria stated, \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll go get [Harris] for you now,\u201d to which the defendant responded, \u201cNo, you already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>made matters worse than they are.\u201d The defendant added, \u201cYou\u2019re not getting me killed. If you want to go get yourself killed, go, they\u2019d be doing Brockton a favor.\u201d At this point, Faria, who was standing by the entrance to the apartment, punched the wooden door frame in anger, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll shoot you. I\u2019ll shoot you. You don\u2019t think I\u2019ll fuck[ing] shoot you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The defendant then backed off to the other side of the room. Faria sat down in the wicker chair. The defendant once again asked Faria to \u201cplease leave. You don\u2019t even care about the kids or nothing.\u201d At this, Faria got very angry and said, \u201cFuck the kids. They\u2019re not your fucking kids anyways.\u201d According to the defendant, Faria then \u201creached down and grabbed the gun out of his waist.\u201d Believing that Faria was going to shoot him, the defendant dived out of the chair that he had been sitting in and fired the gun twice at Faria. The defendant testified that the shooting was \u201cjust a reaction. . . . [Tjhis guy\u2019s going to shoot me . . . and it was just a reaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">2. We turn now to the merits of the appeal. General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 8A, inserted by St. 1981, c. 696, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">\u201cIn the prosecution of a person who is an occupant of a dwelling charged with killing or injuring one who was unlawfully in said dwelling, it shall be a defense that the occupant was in his dwelling at the time of the offense and that he acted in the reasonable belief that the person unlawfully in said dwelling was about to inflict great bodily injury or death upon said occupant or upon another person lawfully in said dwelling, and that said occupant used reasonable means to defend himself or such other person lawfully in said dwelling. There shall be no duty on said occupant to retreat from such person unlawfully in said dwelling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahv\">At common law, \u201cthe right to use deadly force by way of self-defense [was] not available to one threatened until he [had] availed himself of all reasonable and proper means\u201d to avoid combat before resorting to the use of deadly force. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shaffer, </em>367 Mass. 508, 511 (1975) (declining to adopt majority rule that one assaulted in own home need not retreat before resorting to use of deadly force). See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Reed, All </em>Mass. 100, 102 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Epsom, </em>399 Mass. 254, 258 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>379 Mass. 446, 450 (1980). The enactment of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 8A, modified the common law by justifying the use of deadly force by a person in his own home to respond to an assault threatening death or great bodily harm by someone unlawfully in the home, even though the person had a reasonable means of retreat or escape. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>429 Mass. 44, 49 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cyr, </em>425 Mass. 89, 98 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>433 Mass. 617 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 58, 64 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 651, 652-653 (1984). It is generally for the jury to determine whether the victim in a particular case was, in fact, unlawfully present in a dwelling, and the judge may instruct on the law of trespass to assist the jury in this determination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noble, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Nothing in G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 8A, however, eliminates the duty on the part of the occupant of the dwelling to retreat from a confrontation with a person who is lawfully on the premises. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapointe, </em>402 Mass. 321, 329 (1988). The statute is not applicable, therefore, in circumstances where one is threatened or assaulted in one\u2019s home by another who is an invited guest, and thus lawfully on the premises, even when that guest launches a life-threatening assault on the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Painten, </em>429 Mass. 536, 545-546 (1999) (castle law did not apply, even where victim [guest] threatened defendant with knife); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapointe, supra </em>(castle law did not apply where defendant had opened door to permit assailant to enter).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The obvious purpose of the statute is to allow an occupant to defend against unlawful intruders and not to permit the use of deadly force against social guests whenever a verbal altercation threatens to escalate into a physical confrontation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the other hand, the plain language of the statute includes someone who is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>\u201cunlawfully in said dwelling,\u201d and it is a familiar principle that a person who enters a dwelling lawfully, but refuses to leave when ordered to do so, becomes a trespasser. See G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The exact boundaries of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 8A, need not be resolved in this case. The contested issue at trial was whether the Commonwealth had proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant did not act in self-defense when he used deadly force in shooting Faria. The defendant correctly points out, that, in explaining the law of self-defense to the jury, the judge instructed in the usual manner in language that failed to express the no retreat concept embodied in G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 8A. It is possible that a castle law instruction, had one been requested by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, should have been given to the jury, along with instructions regarding the manner for determining whether a person is \u201cunlawfully in [the] dwelling.\u201d The dis-positive question on appeal, however, is whether, on this record, it can be said that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to request a castle law instruction. We examine the question under our traditional two-prong test stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974): \u201cwhether there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer \u2014 and, if that is found, then, typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egardo, </em>426 Mass. 48, 52 (1997). With respect to the second requirement, this court has stated that \u201cthere ought to be some show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ing that better work might have accomplished something material for the defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, strategic or tactical judgments of counsel will not be second guessed unless the judgment is shown to be \u201cmanifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>374 Mass. 722, 728 (1978). The burden is on the defendant to meet both prongs of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The defendant has failed to meet his burden on both parts of the test. The trial presented the jury with a stark contrast between the Commonwealth\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s accounts of the confrontation. In the cool calculation of wishful thinking, the defendant attempts to fasten labels of incompetence and strategic failure on his trial counsel that simply do not fairly apply. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>374 Mass. 453, 465 (1978) (\u201cWe look askance when counsel who has tried a case, without success, before a judge and jury on one theory of law, then attempts to obtain appellate review on an entirely different theory which was never advanced or suggested at the trial and which is not based on any objection .... Our view is the same notwithstanding the fact that the defendant is being represented on these appeals by counsel other than the one who represented him at the original trial\u201d). From all that appears in the record,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendant\u2019s trial counsel purposely pursued the reasonable strategy of using the defendant\u2019s own testimony and his other evidence, and arguing to the jury the strongest defense available, namely, that the defendant had acted properly to defend himself against Faria\u2019s imminent attack by deadly force. The conclusion that this was the operative strategy is reinforced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>by the defendant\u2019s affidavit in support of his motion for a new trial<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the lack of any affidavit from his trial counsel suggesting that he may have erred by not requesting an instruction under the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Retreat was simply not a viable issue at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">While not strictly necessary to our decision, we think it worth noting that, on the instructions given by the judge, the defendant suffered no disadvantage. The judge instructed the jury that \u201cthe defendant must have done everything that was reasonable in the circumstances to avoid physical combat before resorting to force,\u201d and that the defendant was permitted to use physical force \u201conly if he could not get out of the situation in some other way that was available and reasonable at the time.\u201d The judge notably also told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">\u201cWhere the [incident] took place may be particularly important. In some situations a person might have a clear field and be able to escape by walking away or otherwise getting to safety or by summoning help if that could be done in time or by holding the attacker at bay if the means were available or by some other method. In other cases such escape routes may not be available. The issue is whether the defendant\u2019s use of force reasonably seemed to be the only way to protect himself in the circumstances. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>considering this you are permitted to take into account that a person who is attacked may have to decide what to do quickly and under emotional strain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">These instructions, taken as a whole, explained that a defendant need not retreat unless he can do so in safety, and need not do so when he would increase the danger to his own life. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, and accepting the defendant\u2019s testimony as true, there was virtually no likelihood that a reasonable juror would have thought that the defendant, sitting a mere ten feet away when Faria drew his gun, had any opportunity to retreat. As the judge clearly instructed, the duty to retreat does not impose the duty to put oneself in danger. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>428 Mass. 393, 398 (1998), and cases cited. Moreover, it is apparent that the defendant, by his own account, did his best to avoid a physical confrontation with Faria, a man known to the defendant as exceptionally prone to violence. The defendant testified that he \u201cbacked off\u201d and asked Faria to \u201cplease leave.\u201d No reasonable juror believing the defendant\u2019s testimony would not have credited him with a genuine attempt to defuse the tension of the moment, in essence, to retreat. There is thus no substantial risk that the jury\u2019s verdict was unfairly influenced by the lack of the instruction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, on the entire case, that the defendant has not demonstrated that counsel\u2019s representation at trial constituted a constitutional violation that requires a new trial in order to prevent an injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-25\">3. The order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-27\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The trial judge had retired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The children were the daughters of the defendant\u2019s girl friend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The no retreat, or castle law, doctrine as applied in other jurisdictions may have broader implications. As stated in one treatise, \u201c[a] defendant need not retreat if he is attacked in his \u2018castle\u2019 (dwelling house), even if he can do so with reasonable safety. This is true even if the attacker is the defendant\u2019s spouse or guest or person with whom he shares the living quarters, as distinguished from a mere intruder.\u201d 2 C. Torcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>\u00a7 128, at 194-195 (15th ed. 1994). See 1 W.R. LaFave &amp; A.W. Scott, Jr., Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 5.7, at 660 (1986) (defender generally \u201cneed not retreat from his home or place of business, except perhaps when the defender was the original aggressor or the assailant is a co-occupant of those premises\u201d); Model Penal Code and Commentaries \u00a7 3.04(2)(b)(i)(A) (1985) (\u201cthe actor is not obliged to retreat from his dwelling or place of work, unless he was the initial aggressor or is assailed in his place of work by another person whose place of work the actor knows it to be\u201d). The statutes and cases from other jurisdictions on the castle law are so variegated that they render no help to the analysis of our statute, which is expressly limited to cases of an occupant\u2019s self-defense against someone \u201cunlawfully in said dwelling.\u201d G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 8A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We have recognized that this standard for testing the ineffectiveness of counsel is not significantly different from our standard of a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>429 Mass. 22, 31 n.12 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619, 624-625 n.4 (1994) (\u201cif an omission of counsel does not present a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice . . . there is no basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under either the Federal or the State Constitution\u201d). The test in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974), and the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice test are, substantively, two sides of the same coin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b232-7\">We keep in mind that an ineffective assistance of counsel challenge made on the trial record alone is the weakest form of such a challenge because it is bereft of any explanation by trial counsel for his actions and suggestive of strategy contrived by a defendant viewing the case with hindsight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\">The defendant\u2019s affidavit stated the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">\u201c17. At some point around 5:45 p.m., [the victim] again threatened to rip my face off. [The victim] then started to rise from his chair in my direction. While he was starting to stand up, I saw his hand reaching for the gun that he had tucked into the waist of his pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">\u201c18.1 jumped from the chair that I was sitting in and landed on my knees. While I was diving for the floor, I also pulled my gun out. When I saw that [the victim]\u2019s hand was on his gun, and that he was pulling it out of his belt, I fired two shots at him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b233-14\">The defendant\u2019s trial counsel may have reasoned that a castle law instruction would have focused the jury\u2019s attention on the defendant\u2019s behavior, including the evidence that the defendant was the original aggressor in the verbal altercation that led to Faria\u2019s death, and the defendant\u2019s own testimony that he told Faria <em>not </em>to leave the apartment. In view of the unlikelihood of a jury\u2019s finding that Faria, the defendant\u2019s brother and a frequent guest in his home, was unlawfully present in the apartment, it is entirely possible that the failure of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel to request a castle law instruction was a tactical decision to avoid the jury\u2019s finding deliberate premeditation, which would have convicted the defendant of murder in the first degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b234-28\">The defendant may have benefited by the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury clearly that one who is culpable in bringing on the attack that necessitated his use of lethal force is not authorized to kill in self-defense at all. The Commonwealth portrayed the defendant as the initial aggressor in this quickly escalating situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
