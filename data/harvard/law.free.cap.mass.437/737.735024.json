See <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 495, 499 (1981), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neal, </em>369 Mass. 242, 251 &amp; n.11 (1975) (Tauro, C.J., concurring). See also Fried, Reflections on Crime and Punishment, 30 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 681 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">At issue is whether the defendants \u2014 the commissioner and the superintendent of the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Cedar Junction (Cedar Junction) (superintendent) \u2014 can ignore regulations, duly enacted and still in effect, which govern the placement of prisoners in segregated confinement for nondisciplinary reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Litigation, commenced in 1985, resulted in a single justice of this court ordering the adoption of regulations that require procedural protections before a prisoner can be isolated for nondisciplinary reasons. See Hoffer vs. Fair, No. SJ-85-0071 (Mar. 3, 1988). See also 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.00 (1993). In 1995, the commissioner attempted to repeal those regulations in the wake of a lockdown of Cedar Junction following a disturbance. The commissioner was unsuccessful, and a single justice enjoined the repeal of the regulations on September 26, 1995. Notwithstanding the 1995 injunction, the commissioner and the superintendent thereafter implemented certain operational changes at Cedar Junction, the effect of which was to place a substantially increased number of prisoners in segregated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>confinement for nondisciplinary reasons under conditions substantially similar to those that existed in 1985, without complying with the applicable regulations. For reasons we shall explain, the prisoners now in or who may be in such confinement, although more in number, are entitled to the protections contained in the regulations promulgated in response to the 1988 order unless and until the applicable regulations are amended or repealed. Amendment or repeal would not be warranted unless the defendants assert meritorious grounds different from those presented to the single justice in 1995. The defendants did not seek any such relief in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The plaintiffs are a certified class of \u201call prisoners who are now confined or may at some point be confined\u201d at Cedar Junction \u201cin any housing unit other than the Departmental Disciplinary Unit\u201d (DDU). Prisoners are housed in the DDU for disciplinary reasons, and we are concerned here only with those prisoners who are segregated unrelated to any reason of discipline.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs challenge the severely restrictive conditions of their confinement in the East Wing of Cedar Junction, alleging violations of various regulations and statutes, as well as of the equal protection and due process provisions of the Massachusetts and United States Constitutions. They claim that their nondisciplinary segregation in the so-called East Wing of the prison, tantamount to indefinite solitary confinement in many cases, constitutes confinement comparable to that in the former departmental segregation unit (DSU), and that they are, therefore, entitled to the procedural due process protections applicable to prisoners segregated for nondisciplinary reasons, including those housed in the former DSU. See 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The defendants contend that the DSU at Cedar Junction has been abolished and the DSU regulations are therefore no longer of any force or effect. They further argue that the plaintiffs\u2019 liberty interests are adequately protected by a six-month \u201cclas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>sification\u201d review every prisoner in every prison under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections (department) receives pursuant to 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 420.00 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">A judge in the Superior Court, acting on cross motions for summary judgment, allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion with respect to their due process claim. After thoroughly reviewing the record evidence, the motion judge, in a carefully reasoned memorandum of decision and order, concluded that there were no disputed issues of material fact and that (1) the conditions in the East Wing imposed an \u201catypical and significant hardship,\u201d <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995), on the prisoners confined there; (2) the conditions of confinement in the East Wing are substantially similar to the conditions in the former DSU; and (3) the DSU regulations \u201cmust be fully complied with before inmates may be subjected to the restrictive conditions\u201d of the East Wing. The judge later stayed the effectiveness of the third item pending appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we reject the defendants\u2019 claims and affirm, in substantial part, the allowance of summary judgment because the record does not disclose any disputes of material fact concerning the plaintiffs\u2019 due process claim. We do so, however, for reasons different from those relied on by the Superior Court judge. We agree with the judge that the conditions of nondisciplinary segregation about which the plaintiffs complain are substantially similar to the conditions in the former DSU. The regulations that govern placement in such restrictive conditions, 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.00, have not been repealed, and have the full force of law. <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 425, 427 (1983). Those regulations must therefore be complied with before any prisoner is placed for nondisciplinary reasons in the East Wing under the segregation conditions of confinement operative there. It is accordingly not necessary to reach the constitutional claims or to apply the analysis of <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, supra, </em>as the motion judge did.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The disposition of this case necessitates a thorough recitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>of the background to the litigation, the operation of Cedar Junction, and the conditions of confinement in the East Wing. We summarize the undisputed material facts on the summary judgment record.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The plaintiffs commenced this litigation on June 30, 1995, in the wake of two changes the defendants made in the operation of Cedar Junction during a lockdown of the prison.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The first change occurred when the commissioner notified prisoners that those deemed \u201cmembers\u201d or a \u201cleader\u201d of \u201csecurity threat groups\u201d (gangs), or those \u201cinvolved in a security threat group incident\u201d would be \u201csubject to transfer to restrictive housing at MCI-Cedar Junction.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiffs claim that the defendants\u2019 application of this gang policy resulted in racially discriminatory long-term segregation placements in violation of the equal protection clause. The plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim is not before us.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Second, the superintendent notified all prisoners at Cedar Junction that the prison was undergoing \u201ca number of changes both physically and operationally,\u201d and that the housing units in the prison would be divided into two \u201cphases\u201d that are now known as the \u201cEast Wing\u201d and the \u201cWest Wing.\u201d The conditions of confinement in the East Wing would be significantly more restrictive than those in the West Wing. The defendants\u2019 placement of prisoners in the East Wing gave rise to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 due process claim, which is now before us on the allowance of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Cedar Junction is a maximum security prison, the only one in the Commonwealth. It has long consisted of two physically distinct \u201cwings,\u201d both of which house prisoners under conditions of maximum security. The West Wing is comprised of three housing units, each containing seventy-two one-man cells. The East Wing contains eight housing units, each having forty-five one-man cells. Four of the eight East Wing units are called \u201cPlymouth\u201d units and now house prisoners who have been labeled as gang members under the department\u2019s gang policy. Thus, in 1995, when this litigation commenced, this maximum security prison housed some 858 of the 10,835 prisoners in the department\u2019s custody, by definition the most violent and dangerous, presenting the most difficult and oftentimes hazardous challenges of prison management.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Both the East and West Wings also contain an identified \u201csegregation unit,\u201d where prisoners are placed for various reasons, such as discipline or pending the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>outcome of an investigation or a disciplinary hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The conditions in the segregation units and in the DDU are not at issue here.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In connection with the 1995 policy changes, the physical configuration of the two wings was not changed. Rather, the defendants implemented what they term operational changes directed at the prisoners themselves. The parties do not dispute that, for prisoners in the East Wing, conditions are now vastly more restrictive than those in the West Wing. Prisoners in the East Wing experience nondisciplinary segregated conditions that are essentially solitary confinement, while housed in the same one-man cells that existed before the department\u2019s 1995 operational changes. In the Plymouth units, for example, prisoners are released from their cells for only sixty minutes each day, while those in the other East Wing units receive only ninety minutes of \u201cout of cell\u201d time each day. During their out-of-cell time, East Wing prisoners must, for example, schedule all showers and telephone calls, affording them almost no opportunities for interaction with other prisoners.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">In contrast, prisoners housed in the West Wing are not segregated. While all of the prisoners in the West Wing have been determined to require confinement under conditions of maximum security, they are allowed out of their cells for as much as fifteen hours each day, and all day on weekends, and interact with other prisoners throughout those times. East Wing prisoners also eat alone: while they collect their meals outside of their cells, they must return to their cells to eat alone, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>prisoners in the West Wing eat their meals in a \u201cchow hall.\u201d Canteen privileges<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> for prisoners in the East Wing are forty per cent less than canteen privileges for those in the West Wing.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Moreover, segregated confinement in the East Wing may be for long periods. The average continuous period of confinement in the East Wing for the entire plaintiff class is 270 days.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In some cases prisoners are segregated in the East Wing for the duration of their sentence. Since the operational changes implemented in 1995, prisoners in the East Wing are locked up in the near-solitary confinement conditions described above effectively indefinitely, for reasons not related to any disciplinary problems and contingent solely on the defendants\u2019 subjective evaluation of the prisoners. Thus, except as stated in note 13, <em>supra, </em>for either twenty-three hours or twenty-two and one-half hours a day, a prisoner may be housed in solitary confinement solely at the superintendent\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">In Hoffer vs. Fair, No. SJ-85-0071 (Mar. 3, 1988), a single justice of this court addressed a complaint brought by prisoners in the DSU at Cedar Junction and Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Norfolk. They sought relief for the procedures by which they were placed and held in nondisciplinary segregation. The single justice ordered that changes be made to the then-existing version of the DSU regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">The modified DSU regulations issued in response to that decision are now codified at 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.00. The DSU regulations apply to all State correctional facilities and are issued pursuant to G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 <em>(b) </em>&amp; <em>(q), </em>and G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 39. See 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.02 &amp; 421.04. The purpose of the regulations is \u201cto establish rules whereby an inmate may be confined to a Departmental Segregation Unit <em>because his continued presence in a general institution population would be detrimental to the program of the </em>institution\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>(emphasis added). 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 421.01. The regulations make clear that a prisoner may not be segregated and denied interaction with other prisoners in the institution for nondisciplinary reasons without receiving certain procedural due process protections. See 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 421.07.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Rather, a prisoner may be isolated from other prisoners for nondisciplinary reasons to prevent him from injuring others, damaging property, or interrupting the safe operation of the correctional facility only in accordance with the regulations. See 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 421.09. See also <em>Hoffer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>412 Mass. 450, 455 n.6 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In July, 1995, following the lockdown that precipitated this action, the commissioner \u201cclosed\u201d the DSU at Cedar Junction and initiated the administrative process to repeal the regulations governing the placement of prisoners in the DSU. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 3. It is noteworthy that the commissioner\u2019s affidavit of August 25, 1995, submitted to the single justice in support of the repeal of the DSU regulations, relied on the same grounds asserted here: \u201ca number of large-scale prison disturbances and incidents of unusual violence\u201d during 1992 and 1993 in Massachusetts prisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Notwithstanding the commissioner\u2019s submission concerning the increased levels of violence at Cedar Junction and elsewhere, on September 26, 1995, a single justice of this court allowed a motion by the plaintiff-prisoners in the Hoffer case, to enjoin the repeal of the DSU regulations. The facts on which the commissioner relied and his arguments before the single justice all but mirror the claims made by the defendants in this case. For example, in 1995, the commissioner maintained before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>single justice that \u201cthe DSU had outlived its usefulness\u201d because \u201cthe climate in the state prison system had become more dangerous, due no doubt in part to severe overcrowding, inmates serving longer sentences, increased racial friction and a growing number of volatile, often gang-affiliated, younger inmates.\u201d The same claim is made here. The commissioner argued before the single justice that ordering the defendants to provide certain due process procedures and substantive protections is no longer of \u201cany practical effect\u201d because \u201cthere are no DSU prisoners and the Commissioner has no intention of \u2018designating\u2019 any in the future.\u201d The same claim is made here. None of these or related claims persuaded the single justice, and the regulations applicable to conditions of nondisciplinary segregation remained in effect. The commissioner did not appeal from the decision of the single justice, nor has the commissioner ever sought a reconsideration of that decision on the basis of any further or different information available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">All prisoners entering Cedar Junction are initially housed in the East Wing, including those who have failed in lower security institutions and are, as a result, being returned to Cedar Junction and prisoners who are initially classified to a maximum security institution \u2014 for example, those serving fife sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The East Wing also houses prisoners transferred from the West Wing. A prisoner is moved from the West Wing to the East Wing solely at the discretion of the superintendent or his designee. According to the deposition testimony of Mark J. Powers, the superintendent\u2019s designee at the times relevant to these cases, among the factors used in determining whether to transfer a prisoner from the West Wing to the East Wing are his disciplinary history, over-all adjustment, and \u201cenemy\u201d issues \u2014 i.e., concerns that prisoners housed in the same block might not get along well. He testified that the transfer of a prisoner from the West Wing to the East Wing is for reasons \u201cusually surrounding disciplinary reports,\u201d although it is undisputed that the transfer to the East Wing is <em>not </em>imposed for the commission of a disciplinary offense. A prisoner transferred from the West Wing to the East Wing receives no notice or hearing incident to the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">As the motion judge found, the conditions of confinement in the East Wing are substantially similar to those that existed in the former DSU at Cedar Junction. While in the East Wing, prisoners are housed in isolation for extended periods each day, confined to their single-man cells except for brief specified periods when they may leave for a particular purpose. Prisoners housed in the East Wing do not interact with other prisoners and do not participate in collective activities. Prisoners in the East Wing receive ninety minutes of out-of-cell time seven days a week, while those prisoners in the former DSU received sixty minutes of outdoor recreation five days a week. But prisoners in the East Wing must use their out-of-cell \u201crecreation\u201d time for showers and telephone calls.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The result is that prisoners in the East Wing do not receive significantly different out-of-cell time for exercise than those in the former DSU. Prisoners in both the former DSU and in the East Wing eat their meals in their cells and receive the same library and visitation privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">As to other restrictive conditions, the record reveals that there are no differences in issued clothing, religious services, educational opportunities, or programming between the former DSU and the East Wing. Prisoners in the former DSU received a greater canteen allowance ($50 a week) than prisoners in the East Wing ($30 a week). Work opportunities for prisoners in the East Wing do not match those in the DSU: there are almost no job opportunities in the East Wing; only three jobs per forty-five-man block exist in the East Wing. There were no such restrictions in the DSU.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Prisoners housed in both the East Wing and the West Wing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>are entitled, as are all other prisoners housed by the department in any facility in the Commonwealth, no matter the level of security, to receive a review of their status every six months pursuant to 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 420.00.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Beyond this postplacement, six-month classification review, the defendants do not provide any procedural protections before a prisoner is housed in the East Wing, or while he remains there. Notwithstanding the significant differences in restrictive conditions between the East and West Wings that have now been implemented, the classification reviews are the same for prisoners housed in both wings: the classification determines only in which level of security a prisoner is to be housed. If the prisoner is classified as requiring maximum security confinement, he is sent to Cedar Junction, space permitting. Beyond that, the decision to isolate some prisoners from the general population of those other prisoners also classified to maximum security is the entirely subjective and discretionary function of the prison authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Moreover, the plaintiffs submitted an uncontroverted affidavit from a correctional expert, William H. Dallman, a former maximum security prison warden in Ohio with twenty-two years of correctional experience. Dallman, who has never before testified on behalf of prisoner-plaintiffs, reviewed the records containing the information on which the defendants relied in deciding which Cedar Junction prisoners to segregate in the East Wing. The motion judge found, based on Dallman\u2019s unchallenged testimony, that the defendants do not comply with their own classification procedures. For example, fewer than fifteen per cent of prisoners are reviewed within one year of their initial placement in the East Wing.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Dallman\u2019s unrebutted analysis of a representative sampling of 486 prisoners also showed that the defendants often failed to employ or ignored the results of their own system of classification. The defendants did not compile a classification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>score in 200 out of 486 cases, and in those cases in which scoring had been completed, the defendants ignored the results one-half of the time. Dallman concluded that sixty per cent of randomly selected prisoners and 140 of the 200 prisoners at Cedar Junction whose records he reviewed \u201cwere inappropriately placed in segregation\u201d \u2014 i.e., were inappropriately confined in the East Wing according to the defendants\u2019 own procedures, not his own subjective evaluation. Eighty-five per cent of prisoners in the nonrandom sampling did \u201cnot even arguably warrant segregation placement,\u201d according to the defendants\u2019 own procedures. Nearly one-half the records Dallman reviewed lacked not only justification for segregation, but lacked a basis for confining the prisoner to maximum security.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">As noted earlier, the judge considered the plaintiffs\u2019 due process claim under <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472 (1995), in which the United States Supreme Court recognized that under the Federal Constitution, a prisoner may have a \u201cstate-created\u201d liberty interest only in remaining free from \u201crestraint which . . . imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Court held in that case that a prisoner\u2019s confinement in segregation for thirty days because of a disciplinary violation \u201cdid not present the type of atypical, significant deprivation in which a State might conceivably create a liberty interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">In this case, the motion judge concluded that the circumstances of the plaintiff-prisoner class are \u201centirely different\u201d from those of the inmate in <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, supra. </em>He pointed out that no prisoner is assigned to the East Wing for disciplinary reasons, that prisoners in the East Wing \u201cspend an indefinite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>period of time under essentially the same conditions as those facing disciplinary charges,\u201d and concluded that the conditions in the East Wing are \u201cnearly indistinguishable from a disciplinary sanction\u201d and beyond the \u201crange of confinement to be normally expected,\u201d even at a maximum security facility. The judge contrasted the indefinite confinement of those in the East Wing, conceivably \u201cthrough the entire length of their incarceration,\u201d as compared to the fixed period of the thirty days at issue in the <em>Sandin </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The judge further held that the State had \u201ccreate[dj\u201d a liberty interest that triggered due process protections in the regulations applicable to the former DSU because \u201cthe conditions in the East Wing and Plymouth units are substantially the same as those which were present in the former DSU.\u201d He specifically rejected the defendants\u2019 claim that conditions in the East Wing are \u201cless restrictive\u201d than those in the former DSU. The judge also rejected the defendants\u2019 claim that the East Wing is the \u201cgeneral population\u201d of Cedar Junction as the sort of \u201cpretextual semantic change aimed at avoiding compliance with regulations\u201d we have criticized in the past. See <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>404 Mass. 325, 328-329 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">After concluding that there were no disputed material issues of fact and granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to their due process claim, the motion judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for entry of separate and final judgment under Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974), as to that claim and stayed the aspect of the judgment requiring compliance with the DSU regulations pending appeal. The defendants have appealed, and we granted their application for direct appellate review.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">On appeal, the defendants assert that the due process mandated by 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.00 before subjecting prisoners to certain restrictive conditions of confinement \u201crests on outdated notions of liberty and due process rights of prisoners\u201d and that the six-month classification review of all prisoners pursuant to 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 420.00 is adequate. They assert that the changes over the past twenty-five years in the operation of Cedar Junction have been for the purpose, of effectively managing a maximum security prison that houses a violent prisoner population. According to the superintendent\u2019s affidavit, the \u201csuccessful prosecution of gang affiliated crimes\u201d has caused the prisoner population in the department to change \u201cdramatically\u201d: it is younger and more prone to \u201cvolatile and frequently gang-affiliated incidents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">With the minor exception described above concerning recreation time, see note 17, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text, the defendants do not dispute the facts concerning the conditions of confinement in the various housing areas of Cedar Junction or in the former DSU. Rather, they contend that the conditions of confinement in the East Wing are not the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of confinement to the former DSU. To this end, they point out that, although it is undisputed that ninety-three per cent of the prisoners confined in the East Wing are not permitted to work, work for all prisoners is at the discretion of the commissioner, and that, under the DSU regulations, employment is also discretionary. The defendants also note small differences in the manner in which prisoners in the East Wing and the former DSU take their meals, exercise, and move outside of their cells.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The plaintiffs, relying on the defendants\u2019 own documentatian,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number><footnotemark>22</footnotemark> contend that the East Wing is a de facto DSU, and therefore the regulations governing the placement of prisoners into the DSU and its operation, which are still in effect despite the official closure of the DSU, should apply to prisoners housed in or transferred to the East Wing. They argue that the defendants\u2019 position is consistent with a pattern of circumvention of the due process protections that prisoners subjected to restrictive confinement must be afforded under the Massachusetts and Federal Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The plaintiffs claim that the conditions of confinement in the East Wing also constitute an \u201catypical and significant hardship\u201d under <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472 (1995), based on the duration and the nature of the restrictive conditions to which they are subjected. In support of their claim, the plaintiffs offered the unrebutted affidavit of Dr. Stuart Grassian, a psychiatrist, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">\u201c [Prolonged solitary confinement is highly toxic to psychological functioning. Inmates go into a kind of stupor, and some even become actively psychotic, agitated and paranoid. Difficulties with concentration and memory, and even overt confesional symptoms, are quite common. Intense anxiety, agitation, and panic attacks occur frequently. Many inmates become overtly paranoid \u2014 fearful and preoccupied with the ominous significance of every noise he hears and every shadow that passes his cell. Some inmates become unable to form any coherent string of thoughts; others become progressively, and obsessively, preoccupied with a particular thought or fear, entirely unable to quiet the thought or pay attention to anything else. Many inmates develop severe perceptual disturbances, including perceptual distortions and overt hallucinations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">According to Dr. Grassian, a prisoner confined alone in a cell for extended periods is forced into idleness and restricted in his environment and social stimulation. There are extremely limited, if any, opportunities for educational, occupational, recreational, or social activities, and little opportunity to interact with or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>observe the outside world or to maintain family contacts. These hallmarks of solitary confinement, say the plaintiffs, are precisely the conditions that are present in the East Wing at Cedar Junction, and that were present in the former DSU.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">With this background, we address the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment. We have reviewed all of the evidentiary materials submitted in conjunction with those motions and agree with the carefully reached conclusion of the Superior Court judge that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>386 Mass. 367, 370, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Bellotti, </em>459 U.S. 970 (1982); <em>Beatty </em>v. <em>NP Corp., </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 607-608, 613 (1991), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">We have considered, for example, in the light most favorable to the defendants, the material submitted regarding the amount of time East Wing prisoners are confined to their cells, out-of-cell time, exercise and recreation, meals (including how prisoners obtain and where they eat their meals), showers, telephone time, library access, employment opportunities, canteen privileges, opportunities to earn good time credits, access to educational and other programming, visits, and the availability of religious services. We have also considered the conditions of confinement in, and the regulations governing, the former DSU, and have compared these conditions with the conditions of confinement in the East Wing. We sometimes noted minor discrepancies, not only between certain statements provided on behalf of the parties, but also among statements submitted by each party. Nevertheless, not one of the differences creates a genuine issue of <em>material </em>fact. See <em>Beatty </em>v. <em>NP Corp., supra </em>at 608 (substantive law will identify which facts are material).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Moreover, as noted above, while the defendants submitted detailed information about the changing racial composition of the prisoner population (increases in African-Americans, Hispanics, and others who are labeled gang members), their assertions regarding an increase in violence in the prison do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>contain any comparable level of detail. In fact, their assertions are mostly generalized statements about changes in conditions within the entire prisoner population housed by the department in all prisons in the Commonwealth, and are noticeably devoid of specific details of changes that have occurred at Cedar Junction itself. They are, in short, conclusory as to the legal issue at the core of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim: the nondisciplinary segregation of some, but not all, prisoners classified as requiring maximum security housing. See <em>Ng Bros. Constr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Cranney, </em>436 Mass. 638, 648 (2002) (\u201cAn adverse party may not manufacture disputes by conclusory factual assertions; such attempts to establish issues of fact are not sufficient to defeat summary judgment\u201d); <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Rollins Envtl. Servs. (NJ), Inc., </em>416 Mass. 684, 696 (1993) (affidavit must set forth specific facts showing genuine issue for trial; bare assertions and conclusions not enough to withstand well-pleaded motion for summary judgment). In the absence of a genuine issue as to any material fact, we consider whether the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The prisoners claim that they are being confined in conditions so similar to those of the DSU that they are entitled to the protections of the DSU regulations. See <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>404 Mass. 325 (1989). The Appeals Court recently termed the question whether prisoners in the East Wing are being housed in DSU-like conditions without being afforded the procedures mandated by DSU regulations as \u201cparticularly troubling.\u201d <em>Gilchrist </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 60, 65 (1999). See note 4, <em>supra. </em>The isolation of prisoners in segregated confinement, including for nondisciplinary purposes, has been the source of constant appellate litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">In <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra, </em>a prisoner challenged on constitutional and other grounds his transfer on two occasions to an administrative segregation unit (ASU) at the Massachusetts Correctional Institute at Concord (Concord) without a hearing and without the authorization of the commissioner. <em>Id. </em>at 327. Among other things, the prisoner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>argued that his placement in the ASU was the substantial equivalent of his being placed in a DSU because the conditions in the two segregation units were virtually identical. <em>Id. </em>at 328. We vacated the grant of summary judgment for the prisoner because there was in that case a dispute of material fact concerning the substantial similarity between the ASU and the DSU, and whether the ASU at Concord was \u201cin practical effect\u201d a DSU. <em>Id. </em>at 330. Although we remanded the case to the trial court to resolve these disputed factual issues, we cautioned that \u201cthe department and the commissioner may not sidestep statutory and regulatory provisions stating the rights of an inmate as to his placement in a DSU by assigning as a pretext another name to such a unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328-329. See <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 425, 429-430 (1983) (prison administrators \u201cmay not abuse their discretion ... by using awaiting action status as a means to accomplish an unlimited punishment immune to the procedures set forth in the rules and regulations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The Appeals Court has reaffirmed that the commissioner may not place prisoners in segregation for nondisciplinary reasons with conditions as severe as those of a DSU without the procedural protections afforded by 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.00. See, e.g., <em>Martino </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 710, 721 (1994) (\u201cwhere the conditions in a segregation unit, however named by the correction officials, were as severe as those at the DSU, the unit should be dealt with, at least for such purposes as requirements of hearings and so forth, as a DSU\u201d). See also <em>Gilchrist </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 60, 64 (1999), quoting <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra </em>at 328 (whether plaintiff \u201cwas entitled to the procedural protections set out in the regulations governing DSUs depended upon whether his \u2018placement in [restrictive confinement] . . . was shown to be the substantial equivalent of his being placed in a . . . DSU\u2019 \u201d). In several such cases, disputes as to material facts precluded the entry of summary judgment. See, e.g., <em>Gilchrist </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra </em>at 64-66; <em>DeLong </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 353, 357 (1999) (record lacked \u201cfactual wherewithal\u201d for comparing conditions suffered by plaintiff \u201cwith existing condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>tians of the general population, of other forms of segregation, and of the range of confinement expected for inmates serving the same sentence as the plaintiff\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">In this case the record is fully developed, and there are no disputes as to material facts. The motion judge had available to him the decision of the Appeals Court in <em>Gilchrist </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra, </em>and was careful to specify with particularity his reasons for determining that there were no disputed issues of material fact and that \u201c[t]he evidence in the record demonstrates that the conditions of confinement in the East Wing and Plymouth units are substantially the same as those found in the former DSU . . . .\u2019\u2019On our own review of the record we reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">In determining whether the conditions in the East Wing are as severe as those in the DSU such that due process protections are warranted, we pay particular attention to those deprivations that were the essence of confinement for nondisciplinary reasons in the DSU: the segregation of a prisoner in near solitary confinement, for no specified period.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As discussed in detail above, the degree of segregated confinement experienced by prisoners in the East Wing in every material respect is every bit as harsh \u2014 both in extent and duration \u2014 as confinement in the DSU. Despite the defendants\u2019 claim that there are differences in the conditions of confinement between the East Wing and in the former DSU, such differences are insignificant, while the essence of confinement is the same in each unit.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Prisoners are placed in segregation for an indefinite period of time, not for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>any specific disciplinary reason (for which they would be sent to the DDU and afforded the procedural protections in 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 430.00), but rather because of the prison authorities\u2019 subjective evaluation of their behavior in general. Differences in the specific amount of time a prisoner spends out of his one-man cell for particular purposes (showers or telephone calls), or the manner in which he receives his food or goes to the library, are insignificant where the explicit nature of the housing is segregation from the general prison population and constitutes, in effect, solitary confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The indefinite term of a prisoner\u2019s segregation in the East Wing is one other, critical similarity between the East Wing and the former DSU. As we noted in <em>Hoffer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>412 Mass. 450, 456 (1992), a prison resident who is not provided with a conditional release date from segregated confinement and with conditions by which to guide his behavior \u201cis possibly subjected to arbitrary treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201c[wjithout the benefit of knowing what is expected of him while segregated, the resident is denied the opportunity to work toward improving his situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the prisoner does not know when or how his confinement in segregation will end, he is denied \u201ca meaningful incentive to modify his behavior and conform to prison regulations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The thrust of the defendants\u2019 response to the overwhelming factual record that conditions in the East Wing are in substantial measure identical to those in the DSU is to argue that prison conditions have changed since the order of the single justice in 1988 requiring the process set out in the DSU regulations. As we noted earlier, it is the defendants\u2019 actions at Cedar Junction that are at issue in this case, and there is scant record support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>for any significant changes in that institution. As we explained earlier, in 1995 the commissioner attempted to repeal the DSU regulations, but his attempt to do so was enjoined by a single justice of this court.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The commissioner did not appeal from the order of the single justice, nor does the record reflect that he has made any subsequent attempt to modify or repeal the regulations. The defendants would ignore that the regulations have the full force of law. See <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>393 Mass. 28, 34 (1984); <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 425, 427 (1983). See also <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 768-769 (1980), quoting <em>DaLomba\u2019s Case, </em>352 Mass. 598, 603 (1967) (rules promulgated pursuant to legislative grant of power \u201cgenerally have the force of law\u201d).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The dissent states that there is \u201coverwhelming support in the record for the conclusion that the reconfiguration [of Cedar Junction] was necessary to secure the safety of prisoners and staff alike, in the context of an unprecedented influx of violent gang members.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 765. That generalized statement glosses over the real deficiencies in the defendants\u2019 factual submissions. What is challenged in this lawsuit is the actions of the defendants concerning some, but not all, prisoners who are classified as requiring maximum security and are thus housed in Cedar Junction. Absent from the record is evidence of any changes in the numbers of prisoners convicted of gang-related crimes who are incarcerated at Cedar Junction rather than other prisons, evidence of changes in the number of prisoners housed at Cedar Junction who have some gang affiliation, or evidence of overcrowding at this maximum security prison as opposed to other prisons, to name but a few examples. The evidence of the defendants on these points is \u201coverwhelming\u201d only in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>generalized conclusions, unsupported by facts as to conditions at Cedar Junction, are oft repeated in the affidavits and deposition testimony of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The dissent also cites to evidence in the summary judgment record concerning the increase in over-all size of the Massachusetts prisoner population, at the same time that the number of correction officers decreased. <em>Post </em>at 774-775. There is little if anything in the record linking these global changes to Cedar Junction. There is no claim of overcrowding at Cedar Junction itself. There is nothing in the record concerning a change in the ratio of guards to prisoners at Cedar Junction. While there is record support for the number of incidents during in 1995 in which guards used force against the prisoners at Cedar Junction, the record contains no evidence of comparable numbers in other years. The dissent\u2019s description of \u201can unprecedented influx of violent gang members,\u201d <em>post </em>at 765, is simply not supported as to the prison at issue in this litigation.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Even if, by the summer of 1995 when the defendants embarked on the operational changes at issue here, \u201cthe climate in the state prison system had become more dangerous,\u201d and even if the defendants were confronted by \u201csevere overcrowding, inmates serving longer sentences, increased racial friction and a growing number of volatile, often gang-affiliated younger inmates,\u201d as one of the defense affiants stated, the defendants\u2019 response to the problem \u2014 the placement of some prisoners classified to Cedar Junction into segregated confinement in near solitary conditions \u2014 violates a regulatory framework that mandates that prisoners segregated for nondisciplinary reasons are entitled to the procedural protections of due process. That regulatory framework was specifically promulgated to deal with, in part, those violent prisoners who are assigned to Cedar Junction.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The defendants\u2019 suggestion that the procedural protections contained in 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.00 are applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>only to those housing placements that the commissioner may choose to label as \u201cdepartmental segregation units\u201d has been rejected, more than once. See, e.g., <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>404 Mass. 325 (1989); <em>Martino </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 710, 721 (1994). The regulations are applicable to all placements of prisoners in segregated confinement for nondisciplinary reasons for an indefinite period of time; in other words, those prisoners whom prison authorities determine will interfere with the management of the prison unless they are segregated from the general prison population. The procedures are tailored to address precisely such housing placements: the inquiry focuses not on whether a prisoner has committed a specific infraction for which discipline may be warranted for a particular period, but on whether his conduct generally warrants long-term segregation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Those procedural protections \u201creflect the understanding that commitment of a resident to a segregation unit results in a significant reduction of that resident\u2019s liberties.\u201d <em>Hoffer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>412 Mass. 450, 455 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">We also reject the defendants\u2019 claim, as did the motion judge, that the prisoners in the East Wing comprise the \u201cgeneral population\u201d of Cedar Junction. We agree with the motion judge that such labeling is nothing more than a \u201cpretextual semantic change.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Nor is there merit to the dissent\u2019s position that to conclude that the East Wing is substantially similar to the DSU <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number><em>requires </em>a finding that there is a single general population in Cedar Junction and that the general population consists <em>only </em>of the prisoners housed in the West Wing. <em>Post </em>at 769-771. Title 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 423.06, provides that the East Wing <em>and </em>the West Wing are the \u201cgeneral population\u201d of Cedar Junction: neither is a special management unit, health service unit, DSU, DDU, or protective custody unit.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The regulatory scheme contained in 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.00 precludes the defendants from subjecting some prisoners confined to this maximum security institution to segregation for nondisciplinary reasons without due process. In short, the defendants may not circumvent the applicable regulations by labeling assignment to nonsegregated conditions in the West Wing \u201can incentive and reward for the positive behavior of prisoners,\u201d in the words of the dissent. <em>Post </em>at 767. Nothing in the regulations precludes prison authorities from rewarding those prisoners actually convicted of gang-related crimes if they participate in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>department\u2019s Security Threat Group Program.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Nothing precludes the department from segregating from the general population those prisoners who it is determined, consistent with due process, must be segregated to prevent injury to others or the interruption of the safe operation of the prison. Nothing prevents the defendants from undertaking \u201cmajor operational changefs]\u201d at Cedar Junction. <em>Post </em>at 766. But all such changes must conform to regulatory and constitutional requirements. It is the unreviewable, subjective selection of only some maximum security prisoners to be housed in severe and segregated conditions that gives rise to the constitutional problem. That problem is not \u201cresolved\u201d by dramatically increasing the number of prisoners who are treated in this manner.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The plaintiffs have established that the basis of their assignment to isolated conditions is seriously flawed, their tenure in segregation indefinite and dependent only on the defendants\u2019 subjective discretion, not subject to review. The existing regulatory scheme does not permit the defendants to act in that manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">We recognize the obligation of the commissioner and other officials of our prison system to maintain security in all institutions under their jurisdiction, and to ensure the safety of all who work there, as well as the prisoners themselves. Prison overcrowding, longer prison sentences, and the prosecution of gang-related crimes have made prison management throughout our prison system more difficult. But the solution cannot be found in violation of a constitutionally required regulatory scheme, one that continues to have the force of law. The commissioner has not challenged the testimony of the prisoners\u2019 expert that a substantial number of the certified class are inap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>propriately segregated from other prisoners and that the records of others lack any basis for confinement in a maximum security institution in the first place.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The purpose of the DSU regulations was to \u201cestablish rules\u201d whereby an inmate may be placed in segregation \u201cbecause his continued presence in a general institution population would be detrimental to the program of the institution,\u201d such that improper subjective evaluation of individual prisoners would be subject to review. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 421.01. The regulations must be complied with. See <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra </em>at 328-329.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">We affirm the decision of the motion judge that the procedural protections contained in 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.00 must be afforded to all prisoners before they are housed in DSU-like conditions operating today in the East Wing, subject only to the exception next described: all prisoners entering Cedar Junction, including some for whom there is no expectation that they will remain at that facility, apparently are first placed in the East Wing. Some are then quickly classified to other institutions, or are moved into the West Wing, perhaps in a matter of days.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> For those prisoners whose stay in the East Wing is intended to be, and is, brief, the procedural protections are not required because their placement in the East Wing implicates a lesser deprivation of individual liberty than it does for the prisoners whose confinement to the East Wing is lengthy or indefinite.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 due process claim to the extent that it applies to those prisoners who are (1) transferred to the East Wing from the West Wing; (2) labeled as gang members and placed in the Plymouth or other units of the East Wing; (3) returned to Cedar Junction; or (4) remain in the East Wing for longer than a brief period for \u201cbooking\u201d or similar reasons. For these prisoners, the procedural protections set forth in 103 Code Mass. Regs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 421.00 are required. We vacate so much of the order as may apply to prisoners sent to the East Wing of Cedar Junction initially on confinement in the expectation that their stay there will be brief.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The policy of the department to place certain prisoners at Cedar Junction in segregated conditions for nondisciplinary reasons has been in effect since at least 1995, and there are now several hundred prisoners housed in the East Wing in such conditions. The judge in the Superior Court stayed his injunction against such segregated confinement pending this appeal. To ensure that the defendants may effectuate the injunction in an orderly and safe manner, the case is remanded to the Superior Court judge for further proceedings consistent with this, opinion, and to determine the timing and manner of implementing the provisions of 103 Code Mass.

The court holds that the procedural protections governing the removal of an inmate from the general prison population and his confinement to a department segregation unit (DSU) apply to decisions regarding the housing of two-thirds of all of the prisoners in the State\u2019s only maximum security prison, Massachusetts Correctional Institution, at Cedar Junction (Cedar Junction). These protections are contained in the department\u2019s regulations at 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.00 (1993) (DSU regulations). Their application to the housing of the majority of prisoners at Cedar Junction is contrary to their purpose and the judicial and regulatory history leading to their enactment. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">This litigation arises from the 1995 operational reconfigura<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>tian of Cedar Junction into two separately functioning and controlled wings, a maximum wing (East) and a minimum wing (West).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is overwhelming support in the record for the conclusion that the reconfiguration was necessary to secure the safety of prisoners and staff alike, in the context of an unprecedented influx of violent gang members.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The plaintiff prisoners challenge the decision-making process leading to their assignment to housing in the maximum wing on due process grounds. In my view, decisions regarding the assignment of prisoners to housing within the general population of a prison are beyond the reach of the DSU regulations and not properly subject to a due process challenge in these cases. To the extent that the regimented life of a prisoner housed in the maximum wing of the prison may be too harsh, it can be challenged on grounds of cruel and unusual punishment. To the extent that a decision by the superintendent to house a prisoner in the maximum wing is arbitrary or based on improper considerations, it may be subject to an equal protection challenge. But in no event, on the record before the trial judge and this court, is there a basis in law or fact to enter summary judgment for the plaintiffs on their due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>Cedar Junction is the State\u2019s only maximum security prison. It houses the most dangerous and violent prisoners within the Massachusetts prison population. For security purposes, prisoners who have engaged in serious acts of violence or other dangerous behavior while incarcerated at other Massachusetts prisons are transferred there.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because a paramount concern and responsibility of the Department of Correction (department) is ensuring the safety of the institution\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>staff and inmates in an unimaginably dangerous environment, the department must adjust the operation of the institution to meet the challenges of the inmates sent into its custody. It is uncontested that these challenges became significantly greater in the 1990\u2019s, with a substantial increase in the number of criminals entering the prison system with lengthy sentences to serve, and with the influx of large numbers of young and violent gang members, many of whom are now serving their sentences at Cedar Junction. As found by the Superior Court judge who considered and denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for injunctive relief in this case, \u201cthe recent infusion into the state prison of substantial numbers of members of warring gangs has presented the corrections system with unprecedented problems in controlling the institution and making it reasonably safe for staff and inmates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">In the 1980\u2019s, both the minimum and maximum wings at Cedar Junction were operated in a so-called \u201copen campus\u201d manner. However, in the early 1990\u2019s, violent and organized attacks on correction officers and other inmates, combined with intelligence gathered from the prison population suggesting the planning of further, organized, large-scale acts of violence within the prison, necessitated a significant reassessment and reorganization of the institution. The institution needed to control the inmates, not vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">In 1993, in the aftermath of some particularly violent incidents, Cedar Junction instituted a three-phase program, with fewer privileges and more restrictions in the first phase, and more privileges and fewer restrictions in phases II and m. The violence continued, and by 1995, the program had been d\u00e9emed unsuccessful. In June, 1995, the superintendent announced a major operational change to the institution. The three-phase system was replaced by a two-phase system devised to take full advantage of the physical separation and the design differences between the two prison wings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Phase I was to be located in the maximum wing, and phase II, in the minimum wing. Phase I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>was characterized by higher restrictions and fewer privileges, and was to be operated under high security protocols; phase II was'characterized by fewer restrictions and greater privileges, and was to operate as an incentive and reward for positive behaviors by other Cedar Junction prisoners. The announced purpose of this change was the creation of a safer environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Following the implementation of the two-phase living system, inmates entering Cedar Junction for initial evaluation, inmates from other institutions reclassified to higher security and sent to Cedar Junction, and inmates identified as members of \u201csecurity threat groups\u201d (e.g., gang members) were housed in the maximum wing. Other prisoners were housed in the minimum wing, until and unless their conduct warranted (in the discretion of the superintendent) their relocation. Prisoners could be transferred from the maximum wing to the minimum wing on the basis of behavior and cell availability. Prisoners could also be transferred to other, lower security institutions on successful completion of a two-phase therapeutic program designed to break the cycle of gang involvement both in prison and after release.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Although they are geographically within the same prison complex, the maximum and minimum wings are physically separate from each other and operate completely diiferently with regard to meals, recreational opportunities, and privileges. The restrictions on inmate movement in the maximum wing are substantially greater than those on inmates housed in the minimum wing and are similar in some respects to restrictions in the former DSU. The point of greatest similarity is the amount of time an inmate spends out of his cell. In the DSU, an inmate was permitted out of his cell one hour a day, five days a week. In the maximum wing, inmates are permitted out of their cells between one and one and one-half hours a day, seven days a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>week.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even at this point of similarity, there are significant differences. For example, if inmates chose to spend their out-of-cell time exercising, DSU inmates were released to an exercise cage (ten feet by thirty-five feet by ten feet) where they spent their time alone, while maximum wing inmates are released in groups of up to fifteen to a recreation yard measuring fifty feet by one hundred feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">2. <em>The DSU regulations. </em>The regulations contained in 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.00, were enacted as the result of a series of orders of a single justice of this court in the case of Hoffer vs. Fair, No. SJ-85-0071 (Mar. 3, 1988). That case, commenced in 1985, dealt with the relationship between conditions under which the general prison population of Cedar Junction then functioned and the operation of the DSU as it then existed. It is reasonable to conclude from the records of both cases that the entire population of Cedar Junction had fewer restrictions and more privileges in 1985 than those currently afforded to any prisoner now housed there.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">In 1985, prisoners who posed a danger to other prisoners, prison property, or the safe operation of the prison while living within the general population could be removed from that population and placed in a DSU where conditions were significantly more restrictive. The single justice concluded that the removal of such a prisoner should be subject to specific due process protections (which he found were required by the Massachusetts Constitution) principally because \u201c[t]he nature and extent of the reduction of liberty from that experienced in the general population is . . . significant.\u201d He consequently directed that the regulations now at issue be promulgated to govern the movement of a prisoner from the general population to a DSU. The department did not appeal from the ruling of the single justice, and the merits of that ruling are not now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">By 1995, the use of the DSU as a tool to control violence within Cedar Junction\u2019s highly volatile population by isolating a few troublemakers (it housed only two inmates) from the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>population was patently ineffective, and its use was eliminated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Efforts by the department to eliminate the corresponding DSU regulations, however, were subsequently enjoined by a single justice of this court, and they remain in effect today.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">3. <em>Summary judgment. </em>The motion judge ruled on the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment that the DSU regulations applied to the confinement of a prisoner in the maximum wing. He based this ruling on three necessary subsidiary findings: (1) the conditions of confinement in the maximum wing \u201care nearly identical to those which existed in the former DSU\u201d; (2) the \u201cgeneral population\u201d of Cedar Junction is not the population housed in the maximum wing; and (3) the commissioner\u2019s reorganization and labeling of the maximum wing as the \u201cgeneral population\u201d was \u201cpretextual,\u201d \u201caimed at avoiding compliance with [DSU] regulations.\u201d See <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>404 Mass. 325, 328-329 (1989) (\u201cthe department and the commissioner may not sidestep statutory and regulatory provisions stating the rights of an inmate as to his placement in a D.S.U. by assigning as a pretext another name to such a unit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">In its opinion, the court affirms this portion of the judge\u2019s summary judgment ruling. Because the last two of the judge\u2019s three subsidiary findings are not supported by undisputed facts in the record, his ruling on summary judgment should be reversed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The second of the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings is that the population in the maximum wing is not the \u201cgeneral population\u201d of Cedar Junction. This finding is necessary to his ultimate ruling because the DSU regulations apply only to the removal of prisoners from the \u201cgeneral population\u201d and their placement in conditions of confinement involving a significant reduction of liberty from that afforded the \u201cgeneral population.\u201d If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>population in the maximum wing is the \u201cgeneral population,\u201d there is no removal and no significant reduction in liberty when a prisoner is assigned to that wing for housing. The judge bases his conclusion that the maximum wing is not the \u201cgeneral population\u201d exclusively on his first subsidiary finding that the conditions of confinement in the maximum wing are nearly identical to the conditions of confinement in the former DSU. Therefore, he concludes that \u201cthe position taken by the Department [that the maximum wing is the general population] is not persuasive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">The judge\u2019s conclusion does not follow logically from his first subsidiary finding. His reasoning is both circular and inconsistent with the appropriate legal standard to be applied. The \u201cgeneral population\u201d of a prison is not defined by the severity of the conditions of confinement. There is little question that the department could have uniformly imposed the restrictions now present in the maximum wing on the entire prison without violating the single justice\u2019s judgment in Hoffer, and without having to comply with the DSU regulations. The general population is simply where the majority of prisoners normally lives, absent confinement in a specialized unit within the prison.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the judge rejects the department\u2019s contention that the maximum wing is the general population of Cedar Junction, he makes no explicit finding of where that \u201cgeneral population\u201d resides. We assume that it must exist somewhere. If we leave the location of the \u201cgeneral population\u201d undefined, it is impossible to conclude whether the DSU regulations apply to a transfer from that population to another population.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">If the entire prison, both the maximum and minimum wings, constitute the \u201cgeneral population\u201d as the court asserts, the DSU regulations are facially inapplicable to a prisoner\u2019s place<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>ment in or transfer to either wing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Similarly, if the maximum wing constitutes the general population, the DSU regulations are likewise inapplicable to a prisoner\u2019s placement in or transfer to that wing. If the minimum wing constitutes the \u201cgeneral population,\u201d the DSU regulations presumably would apply to a prisoner\u2019s placement in or transfer to the maximum wing. But to conclude that the \u201cgeneral population\u201d is the population residing in the minimum wing one would have to view the present operation of Cedar Junction through the \u201cLooking Glass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">Four hundred and eighteen of the 634 housing cells in Cedar Junction are located in the maximum wing and are subject to high security protocols. The much smaller minimum wing is operated differently to encourage and reward positive behavior by inmates. By creating different and less restrictive conditions within a discrete area of the general population of the prison as an incentive and reward for the positive behavior of prisoners, the department has not converted the prison into one in which those more beneficent conditions constitute the general conditions of its prison population. Nor have the department\u2019s actions in creating a different living environment for a minority of prisoners converted the living area of two-thirds of the prison into something other than the \u201cgeneral population\u201d of the prison. In sum, there is no factual support, and certainly no support based on uncontested facts, for the judge\u2019s finding that the maximum wing is not part of the general population of Cedar Junction.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The judge\u2019s third subsidiary finding, that the reorganization of the maximum wing of the prison and its denomination as the \u201cgeneral population\u201d of Cedar Junction was a pretext to avoid compliance with the DSU regulations, is similarly flawed. A \u201cpretext\u201d is an \u201c[ostensible reason or motive assigned or assumed as a color or cover for the real reason or motive; false appearance, pretense.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1187 (6th ed. 1990). To succeed on their motion for summary judgment, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>plaintiffs had the burden of demonstrating that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that they were therefore entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). Whether the commissioner\u2019s stated reasons for creating the current configuration of Cedar Junction were a pretext is a classic example of a disputed issue of material fact.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Consistent with the requirements of Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (e), 365 Mass. 824 (1974), the commissioner filed affidavits from the current<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and former<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> commissioners of the department, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>the assistant deputy commissioner,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> all of which were \u201cmade on personal knowledge, ... set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and . . . show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (e). The affidavits describe the changing racial composition of the prisoner population, the sharp increase in individuals labeled as gang members, and the accompanying increase in violence in the prison system. These affidavits provide a factual explanation for the changes in the configuration of Cedar Junction that is entirely unrelated to avoiding compliance with the DSU regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The plaintiffs do not dispute the facts set forth in these affidavits. At best, the plaintiffs suggest that there is a difference of opinion as to the appropriate response of prison officials to the problem of incarcerating young, violent gang members. However, opinions are not facts. And a difference of opinion is not the same as a dispute as to material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">In his affidavit, the plaintiffs\u2019 expert provides his opinion, based on his experience as a warden of a maximum security prison in Ohio, regarding the appropriate treatment of inmates who are believed to be involved in gang activity. His review of inmate files led him to conclude that the Massachusetts prison system has \u201coveruse[d]\u201d segregation and \u201coverreact[ed]\u201d to gang identifications. This opinion does not satisfy the plaintiffs\u2019 burden of demonstrating that there is no genuine issue of material fact for summary judgment and that they are entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Indeed, if this claim had gone to trial, as I believe it should have, the jury would have had the opportunity to assess the soundness and credibility of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s opinion. See <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, </em>410 Mass. 568, 573 (1991). The expert\u2019s testimony would not necessarily have been dispositive on this issue, and the jury would have been entitled to believe or disbelieve all, some, or part of the expert\u2019s testimony. See <em>Banaghan </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>340 Mass. 73; 79 (1959); <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>288 Mass. 402, 408 (1934). In the face of conflicting affidavits, the plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s affidavit does not provide a basis on which the judge properly could have concluded that the reorganization of the maximum wing of the prison and its denomination as the \u201cgeneral population\u201d of Cedar Junction was a pretext to avoid compliance with the DSU regulations.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The court\u2019s opinion dismisses the content of the commissioner\u2019s submissions that present the department\u2019s reasons for the reorganization of Cedar Junction as \u201cconclusory.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Ante </em>at 754. I disagree on both points. The affidavits are not \u201cconclusory,\u201d but rather describe the facts and circumstances that led to the creation of the current configuration of the Cedar Junction population. It is not \u201cconclusory\u201d to state that in 1994, there were 463 correction officers assaulted by inmates in the Massachusetts prison system, or that between February, 1992, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>February, 1995, the number of inmates in the Massachusetts prison system increased nearly ten per cent, from 9,970 to 10,835, while the number of correction officers decreased 3.5%, from 3,366 to 3,249. It is not \u201cconclusory\u201d to state that in 1995, 99% of the inmates at Cedar Junction were placed there because they had been violent and disruptive in other facilities. It is not \u201cconclusory\u201d to state that the ratio of inmates to correction officers at Cedar Junction in 1995 was greater than seven inmates to each correction officer at any given time. It is not \u201cconclusory\u201d to state that between March 1, 1995, and November 29, 1995, there were fifty incidents at Cedar Junction that required correction officers to use force against inmates. It is not \u201cconclusory\u201d to describe a July, 1993, confrontation between groups of prisoners at Cedar Junction that resulted in two prisoners being sent to a hospital in critical condition. And it is not \u201cconclusory\u201d to describe the attempted murder of a Cedar Junction correction officer in April, 1995, by a group of inmates, believed to be gang affiliated, who beat and repeatedly stabbed the officer, and the riot that ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">These were the facts that the commissioner presented to the judge to demonstrate that there is a disputed issue of material fact about the \u201creal\u201d reason the commissioner created the current configuration of Cedar Junction: whether the maximum and minimum wings were created in response to the increasingly violent and gang-oriented prison population, or whether they were created for the purpose of bypassing the due process requirements in the DSU regulations. Although the court\u2019s opinion relies solely on the conditions of confinement as the basis for its conclusion that the DSU regulations are applicable to prisoners transferred to or placed in the maximum wing, <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>404 Mass. 325, 328 (1989), requires more, as do the \u201cpragmatic and flexible\u201d requirements of procedural due process. <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>434 Mass. 418, 427 (2001). On the record before him, the judge could not have found that there was no genuine dispute regarding this material fact. Summary judgment was therefore not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The DSU regulations plainly do not apply to changes in the general conditions of confinement at any prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>in the Commonwealth, or to the mere presence of severely restrictive conditions. They have no relevance to decisions about where (i.e., in which general population area) a prisoner will be housed, or to decisions to increase security requirements within different levels of confinement. They were promulgated to afford due process rights for those prisoners singled out for isolation from the general population in conditions significantly more restrictive than those experienced by that general population. The record does not support a finding on summary judgment that this is occurring at Cedar Junction. The DSU regulations apply to the current operation of Cedar Junction, if at all, only if prisoners were selected for further segregation from the maximum wing or the minimum wing populations, under conditions significantly more restrictive than those present in either.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-7\">The Massachusetts Correctional Institution, at Cedar Junction, is a maximum security prison. It consists of two wings, both of which house prisoners under maximum security conditions. The conditions of confinement in each wing vary, however. I refer to the West Wing as the \u201cminimum\u201d wing and the East Wing as the \u201cmaximum\u201d wing as a way of describing the degree of confinement in each wing within the context of a maximum security prison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b787-8\">The Department of Correction\u2019s classification regulation, 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 420.09 (4)(a) (1995), requires a classification hearing whenever an inmate is transferred to a higher security correctional facility because of disciplinary or security issues. It is not contended in the cases before us that inmates transferred to Cedar Junction for disciplinary or other \u201csecurity issues\u201d have not received classification hearings with respect to those transfers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Cedar Junction was designed and built with two separate wings. The maximum wing has eight cell blocks of forty-five inmates, organized on three tiers of fifteen cells each, with \u201cgrill\u201d doors (bars), all facing an observation wall of one-way glass so that they can be closely monitored. It also contains a cell block for new prisoners. The minimum wing has three cell blocks of seventy-two inmates, organized on one floor (no tiers), with solid doors for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>more privacy. Each wing was also built with its own department segregation unit (DSU). Prior to 1995, there were thirty DSU cells in the maximum wing and sixty DSU cells in the minimum wing. Aside from the DSU cells, there are 418 cells in the maximum wing and 216 cells in the minimum wing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b789-9\">As of May, 1998, there were 171 gang or security threat group members who successfully completed the entire program. One hundred fifty-six of these prisoners were reclassified and transferred to lower security prisons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Although the Superior Court judge appears to have assumed that inmates in the maximum wing are released from their cells only five days a week, that assumption is contrary to the evidence in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b791-8\">The former DSU cells are now used either to hold inmates awaiting disciplinary action or, in some instances, to hold inmates who are serving disciplinary sanctions as an overflow from the prison department disciplinary unit (DDU).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b791-9\">This order was also not appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b791-10\">For these purposes, I assume that the judge\u2019s finding that conditions of confinement in the former DSU and the maximum wing are nearly identical is adequately supported in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The \u201cgeneral population\u201d of a Massachusetts correctional facility is defined as \u201cany housing area other than a special management unit, health service unit, departmental segregation unit, departmental disciplinary unit, or the departmental protective custody unit.\u201d 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 423.06 (1995). This definition expressly does not apply to inmates housed in a \u201cdepartmental segregation unit [or] a departmental disciplinary unit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The DSU regulations define a DSU as an area designated \u201cfor any inmate segregated\u201d from the \u201cgeneral population.\u201d 103 Code Mass.

For example, in employment discrimination cases where a plaintiff must prove that an employer\u2019s stated justification for an adverse action is not genuine, but rather is a pretext, we examine whether the employer\u2019s proffered reason \u201chas no reasonable support in the evidence\u201d or is \u201cwholly disbeliev[able].\u201d See, e.g., <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130, 138 (1976). Injury cases, where parties may not strike jurors based on factors such as race or gender, we examine whether the proffered explanation for striking a juror is \u201cbona fide or a pretext\u201d by considering \u201cwhether the challenge has a substantive basis or is impermissibly linked to race[, gender, or another factor].\u201d See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Calderon, </em>431 Mass. 21, 26 (2000). In search and seizure cases, we look to see whether the reasons a police officer gives for conducting a search was a pretext concealing an investigatory motive.

DuBois attested in a 1995 affidavit that, as of June, 1995: \u201cthe climate in the state prison system had become more dangerous, due no doubt in part to severe overcrowding, inmates serving longer sentences, increased racial friction and a growing number of volatile, often gang-affiliated, younger inmates.\u201d He also states that: \u201cIn the past few years in Massachusetts, as law enforcement has secured the conviction of many gang leaders and members, there has been a corresponding unprecedented increase in gang membership in the Department\u2019s prisons.\u201d In support of this assertion, DuBois provides information about the size and names of different \u201csecurity threat groups\u201d (gangs and inmate organizations) in the Massachusetts prison system. At that time, \u201c[t]he ever increasing danger of the situation is reflected in the fact that, during 1994 alone, 463 correctional officers were assaulted by inmates.\u201d DuBois also described the serious injuries that inmates inflicted on three guards, which led to the lockdown in 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Assistant Deputy Commissioner Ronald Duval attested in a 1998 affidavit that: \u201cDuring my twenty-five (25) years at MCI-Cedar Junction I have personally observed dozens of changes in the operational parameters of the prison.

The extent to which the operational parameters of the [maximum] and [minium] wings have continually been adjusted, altered, and changed throughout the past 25 years, and more frequently in the past 10 years, is a direct result of corrections officials having to manage an increasingly violent prisoner population throughout the Department with limited resources.\u201d He noted that the changes to the maximum and minium wings \u201cwould drastically reduce violent acts among the prisoners.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b796-6\">In its opinion, the court suggests that the defendants should have provided additional evidence to support their assertions about the increase in gang members and violence in Massachusetts prisons. <em>Ante </em>at 758-759. However, the commissioner does not bear the burden of proof as to the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment; that burden is borne by the plaintiffs alone. The commissioner is not required to set forth his entire defense to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims to defeat a motion for summary judgment. The affidavits that the commissioner provided were sufficient to create a dispute concerning a material fact, which is all that is required to defeat such a motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\">The court also focuses on the conclusion in the expert\u2019s affidavit that less than fifteen per cent of a random sample of 110 prisoners in the maximum wing had received a follow-up classification review within twelve months of their previous classification review. This reference is not relevant to the claim regarding the applicability of the DSU regulations to the maximum wing because classification hearings are governed by an entire separate regulatory scheme.
