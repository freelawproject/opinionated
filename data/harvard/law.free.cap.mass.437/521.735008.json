(2000) (welfare reform act), which, in relevant part, barred \u201cqualified aliens\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from receiving any Federal public benefits, including assistance provided to the States through the Federal temporary assistance for needy families program (TANF), until they had resided in the United States for five years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1613(a). The welfare reform act also authorized States to impose limitations on the eligibility of qualified aliens for State-funded welfare benefits. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1624.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 8One of the stated purposes of the welfare reform act was to further the national immigration policy that \u201caliens within the Nation\u2019s borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, their sponsors, and private organizations, and . . . [that] the availability of public benefits not constitute an incentive for immigration to the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In Massachusetts, Federal TANF funds are combined with State funds to pay for the transitional aid to families with dependent children (TAFDC) program. G. L. c. 118. As a consequence, the passage of the welfare reform act made qualified aliens living in Massachusetts ineligible to receive assistance provided under the TAFDC program unless they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>lived in the United States for five years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In response, the Massachusetts Legislature enacted St. 1997, c. 43, \u00a7 210 (\u00a7 210), which changed Massachusetts welfare law in two ways: first, it amended State law to conform to the requirements of the welfare reform act by confirming that qualified aliens ineligible to receive federally funded benefits would not be eligible to receive TAFDC benefits (\u00a7 210 [a]); and second, it established a new program, supplemental transitional aid to families with dependent children (supplemental program), to be funded solely with State funds (\u00a7 210 <em>[b\\ </em>and [c]). The supplemental program was available only to qualified aliens who were no longer eligible to receive TAFDC benefits because of the passage of the welfare reform act, and was intended to mitigate the impact of the loss of those benefits. St. 1997, c. 43, \u00a7 210 <em>(b). </em>The benefits provided to qualified aliens under the supplemental program were comparable to those provided under the TAFDC program. St. 1997, c. 43, \u00a7 210 <em>(b). </em>To be eligible, qualified aliens had either to have been enrolled in the TAFDC program at the time the welfare reform act was enacted, or, if newly applying, to have resided in the Commonwealth for six months.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> St. 1997, c. 43, \u00a7 210 <em>(c) </em>(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>The plaintiffs are qualified aliens who had not resided in the United States for more than five years, nor in the Commonwealth for six months, when they applied for and were denied benefits under the supplemental program. They filed an action in the Superior Court challenging the constitutionality of the six-month residency requirement of \u00a7 210 as violative of their right to the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and by arts. 1 and 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The gravamen of these claims was that by imposing \u201ca six-month residency requirement on some legal immigrants which is not imposed on other legal immigrants or citizens, Massachusetts discriminates against legal immigrants and thereby violates plaintiffs\u2019 rights to equal protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The Superior Court judge denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. The parties filed partial cross motions for summary judgment on the equal protection claim. In ruling in favor of the defendant Commissioner of Transitional Assistance (commissioner), the judge first rejected the need to subject \u00a7 210 to strict scrutiny review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">\u201cWhen a state legislature, like the Massachusetts General Court, acts as it did here to help needy immigrants by creating and funding a Supplemental program intended solely to provide welfare benefits to immigrants who were cut off from [welfare] funds by Congress in the 1996 Act, \u2018heightened judicial solicitude\u2019 is not needed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">He then applied a rational basis standard of review based on his conclusion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">\u201cWhen a state law benignly benefits only aliens and does not in any way put citizens in a superior position to similarly situated aliens, then this Court believes that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>should be examined through the rational basis test rather than strict scrutiny.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Applying the rational basis standard, the judge found that the six-month residency requirement did not violate the State or Federal Constitutions. He therefore allowed the commissioner\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The parties entered into a stipulation dismissing the other counts of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint without prejudice, see note 6, <em>supra, </em>and judgment entered for the commissioner. The plaintiffs appealed, and we granted their application for direct appellate review. On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that \u00a7 210 must be subjected to strict scrutiny review, and that when reviewed under that standard it cannot withstand an equal protection challenge. We affirm the judgment entered in the Superior Court, concluding that the proper standard of review is rational basis, a standard that both parts of \u00a7 210 readily meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>In pertinent part, the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d The word \u201cperson\u201d in this context includes \u201clawfully admitted resident aliens as well as citizens of the United States and entitles both citizens and aliens to the equal protection of the laws of the State in which they reside.\u201d <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 371 (1971) <em>(Graham). </em>In matters concerning aliens, the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights has been interpreted to provide a right to the equal protection of the laws, coextensive with the Federal right. See <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>363 Mass. 235, 238 &amp; n.3 (1973). As the Superior Court judge correctly concluded, whether \u00a7 210 can withstand a challenge on equal protection grounds depends on the standard of review used to evaluate the distinctions it creates between aliens, subclasses of aliens, and citizens.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We examine both \u00a7 210 <em>(a) </em>and \u00a7 210 <em>(b) </em>and (c) to determine the appropriate standard to apply to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">It is the general rule that State laws that discriminate against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>legal immigrants in the distribution of economic benefits are subject to strict scrutiny. See <em>Graham, supra </em>at 375-376. This general rule does not apply, however, to State laws that merely adopt uniform Federal guidelines regarding the eligibility of aliens for benefits. See, e.g., <em>Sudomir </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>767 F.2d 1456, 1466 (9th Cir. 1985); <em>Cid </em>v. <em>South Dakota Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>598 N.W.2d 887, 892 (S.D. 1999). Judicial review of such laws has been limited to whether there is a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment between citizens and aliens and some legitimate governmental purpose (rational basis standard). See <em>Sudomir </em>v. <em>McMahon, supra </em>at 1466; <em>Cid </em>v. <em>South Dakota Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., supra </em>at 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Courts apply the rational basis standard in these circumstances because of the scope and nature of congressional authority to regulate immigration. Congress acts with plenary authority under the United States Constitution when it legislates the rights and benefits to be afforded aliens present in this country. U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 4. See <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 81-85 (1976); <em>Graham, supra </em>at 376-380; <em>Takahashi </em>v. <em>Fish &amp; Game Comm\u2019n, </em>334 U.S. 410, 419 (1948). When Congress exercises this authority, it may distinguish and discriminate between citizens and aliens in ways that a State may not do on its own, and it may establish uniform national guidelines and policies dictating how States are to regulate and legislate issues relating to aliens. See <em>Graham, supra </em>at 377. See also <em>Plyler </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 219 n.19 (1982) (\u201cif the Federal Government has by uniform rule prescribed what it believes to be appropriate standards for the treatment of an alien subclass, the States may, of course, follow the federal direction\u201d). Cf. <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Diaz, supra </em>at 85 (\u201ca division by a State of the category of persons who are not citizens of that State into subcategories of United States citizens and aliens has no apparent justification, whereas, a comparable classification by the Federal Government is a routine and normally legitimate part of its business\u201d). When Congress exercises this authority, its actions are subject to review under the rational basis standard. See <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Diaz, supra </em>at 82-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In this context, it would make no sense to say that Congress has plenary power to legislate national immigration policies and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>guidelines subject to a deferential (rational basis) standard of review, and then to hold that the equal protection clause of the Constitution restrains States from adhering to or adopting those national policies and guidelines because their actions are subject to a higher (strict scrutiny) standard of review. See <em>Sudomir </em>v. <em>McMahon, supra </em>at 1465-1466; <em>Cid </em>v. <em>South Dakota Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., supra </em>at 892 (\u201c[the plaintiffs] make no claim that South Dakota has adopted any rule or legislation that is in conflict with national policies regarding alienage, or that places any burdens, other than those contemplated in the federal law, on those subject to its provisions\u201d). Cf. <em>Plyler </em>v. <em>Doe, supra </em>at 225 (\u201cthe States do have some authority to act with respect to illegal aliens, at least where such action mirrors federal objectives and furthers a legitimate state goal\u201d); <em>Kurti </em>v. <em>Maricopa County, </em>201 Ariz. 165, 170 (Ct. App. 2001) (\u201c[u]nlike the statues at issue in <em>Sudomir </em>and <em>Cid, </em>Arizona\u2019s statutes regarding alien eligibility for health care benefits are not consistent with federal law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><em>Section 210 </em>(a). Section 210 (a) incorporates the eligibility restrictions of the Federal welfare reform act into the federally subsidized TAFDC program. It does nothing more than adopt the uniform Federal policy barring qualified aliens from receiving benefits from federally funded State programs until they have resided in the United States for five years. Section 210 <em>(a) </em>is therefore subject only to a rational basis review. See <em>Sudomir </em>v. <em>McMahon, supra; Cid </em>v. <em>South Dakota Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., supra; Kurti </em>v. <em>Maricopa County, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">For good reason, the plaintiffs do not contend that \u00a7 210 <em>(a) </em>fails to pass a rational basis review. The specific five-year eligibility restriction contained in the welfare reform act (and incorporated by \u00a7 210 [a]) has been uniformly upheld by Federal courts applying the rational basis standard. See, e.g., <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>252 F.3d 567, 583-584 (2d Cir. 2001) (Medicaid coverage for pregnant women); <em>Aleman </em>v. <em>Glickman, 217 </em>F.3d 1191, 1198-1199 (9th Cir. 2000) (food stamps); <em>Chicago </em>v. <em>Shalala, </em>189 F.3d 598, 605 (7th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1036 (2000) (welfare benefits); <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>169 F.3d 1342, 1347-1348 (11th Cir. 1999) (supplemental security income and food stamps). See also <em>Kiev </em>v. <em>Glickman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>991 F. Supp. 1090, 1100 (D. Minn. 1998) (rational basis analysis used to find welfare reform act did not violate equal protection); <em>Abreu </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>971 F. Supp. 799 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (same). Consequently, even though \u00a7 210 <em>(a) </em>(and the TAFDC program it alters) discriminates between citizens, who are immediately eligible for benefits, and qualified aliens, who must live in the United States for five years before becoming eligible, it does not violate the equal protection provisions of the United States or Massachusetts Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\"><em>Section 210 (b)-(c). </em>Section 210 <em>(b) </em>and <em>(c) </em>does not enact or incorporate into State Law a uniform Federal policy or guideline regarding the availability of welfare benefits to aliens.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It creates a State-funded supplemental program to provide assistance to qualified aliens no longer eligible for TAFDC benefits after passage of the welfare reform act. We must therefore engage in a different analysis to determine the appropriate standard of review to apply to \u00a7 210 <em>(b) </em>and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">It is undisputed that the Massachusetts Legislature was not required to establish the supplemental program. It is also undisputed that the supplemental program provides no benefits for citizens, and that the only persons eligible for its benefits are qualified aliens. It is therefore apparent that the supplemental program itself does not discriminate against aliens and in favor of citizens. What it does do is discriminate between groups of qualified aliens on the basis of the length of their residency in Massachusetts. Qualified aliens who have lived in Massachusetts for six months are eligible for benefits, but those more newly arrived must wait for benefits until they reach the six-month threshold.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Ordinarily, challenges to durational residency requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>are premised on the fundamental right to travel freely as guaranteed by the privileges and immunities clause of the United States Constitution. U.S. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 2. See <em>Saenz </em>v. <em>Roe, 526 </em>U.S. 489, 509-510 (1999) (State law limiting maximum welfare benefits available to newly arrived California residents violative of citizens\u2019 constitutional right to travel); <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618, 638 (1969) (waiting period for welfare benefits failed strict scrutiny analysis because it \u201ctouche[d] on the fundamental right of interstate movement\u201d and violated equal protection). Such a challenge is not before us, having been voluntarily dismissed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Durational residency requirements imposed on aliens are also subject to challenge under the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution because Congress has plenary authority over immigration matters. See, e.g., <em>DeCanas </em>v. <em>Bica, </em>424 U.S. 351, 354 (1976) (\u201cPower to regulate immigration is unquestionably exclusively a federal power\u201d). See also <em>Graham, supra </em>at 378 (\u201cState laws that restrict the eligibility of aliens for welfare benefits merely because of their alienage conflict with these overriding national policies in an area constitutionally entrusted to the Federal Government\u201d). Presumably because 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1624 expressly permits States to place such restrictions on aliens\u2019 receipt of public assistance, the plaintiffs have not challenged the residency requirement present here on the ground that it violates the supremacy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In the absence of such challenges, we are left to determine what standard of review to apply to a State law that does not discriminate between citizens and aliens, but includes a residency requirement for the only class of individuals eligible to participate in the program it establishes, qualified aliens. The situation appears to be unique, and there is little precedent to guide us.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We turn first to Federal jurisprudence applying equal protection principles to State actions discriminating between subclasses of aliens. The leading case is <em>Nyquist </em>v. <em>Mauclet, </em>432 U.S. 1 (1977), in which the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a New York statute that provided educational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>assistance for (1) United States citizens; and (2) aliens who had applied for or intended to apply for United States citizenship. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. In defending the statute, New York claimed that it did not distinguish between citizens and aliens, but only between aliens who agreed to apply for citizenship and those who would not. <em>Id. </em>at 8. Relying heavily on <em>Graham, supra, </em>the Court rejected the State\u2019s argument and subjected the statute to a strict scrutiny analysis because it was \u201cdirected at aliens\u201d and \u201conly aliens [were] harmed by it.\u201d <em>Nyquist </em>v. <em>Mauclet, supra </em>at 9. Because of critical differences between the statutes in issue, however, we do not find the <em>Nyquist </em>Court\u2019s reasoning to be determinative of our analysis of \u00a7 210 (h) and (c). First, all residents of New York (citizens and resident aliens alike) were eligible to apply for assistance under the New York statute, <em>id. </em>at 2-3, but the statute imposed an additional requirement on aliens solely because of their status as such. Second, the Court found that the New York statute harmed aliens by barring them from participating in the assistance program if they did not satisfy its terms. <em>Id. </em>at 4. In contrast, the Massachusetts statute establishes a program open only to aliens, imposes a residency requirement on all who are qualified to apply for its benefits, and does not harm aliens by barring them from the benefits of the program, requiring only that they wait six months to become eligible to receive the benefits. Finally, there is a troubling aspect of the statute that the <em>Nyquist </em>Court alludes to in dicta: New York\u2019s overt attempt to \u201ccoerce\u201d aliens into becoming United States citizens, <em>id. </em>at 8 &amp; p.10, <em>id. </em>at 14 (Burger,. C.J., dissenting), <em>id. </em>at 15 (Powell, J., dissenting), <em>id. </em>at 21 n.4 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), an apparent intrusion directly \u00f3n Federal authority to regulate immigration. <em>Graham, supra </em>at 376-378. In sum, because the New York statute and its requirements are not similar in kind or effect to the six-month residency requirement of \u00a7 210 <em>(b) </em>and (c), the <em>Nyquist </em>analysis does not govern the unique circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">We next look to the jurisprudence of other State courts that have decided equal protection challenges to State legislation enacted in the wake of the welfare reform act. Unfortunately, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>the circumstances of the few cases decided vary significantly from those presently here.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">For example, the plaintiffs point to a decision by the Court of Appeals in New York, <em>Aliessa </em>v. <em>Novello, 96 </em>N.Y.2d 418 (2001), in which the court applied a strict scrutiny standard in striking down a five-year residency requirement imposed on qualified aliens, but not citizens, seeking benefits under a State-only funded Medicaid program. \u201cNew York had long provided State Medicaid to needy recipients without distinguishing between legal aliens and citizens. It ceased to do so, however, after Congress enacted [the welfare reform act].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424. In response to the passage of the welfare reform act, New York enacted a statute that terminated State-funded Medicaid coverage for nonqualified aliens and imposed the five-year waiting period on qualified aliens. <em>Id. </em>at 427. Unlike the supplemental program created by \u00a7 210 <em>(b) </em>and (c), the amended New York State Medicaid program presented the Court of Appeals with the very paradigm so definitively addressed in <em>Graham, supra </em>\u2014 a State-funded benefit program available to citizens but not available to aliens on the same terms.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For this reason, among others, its authority is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>The parties, of course, espouse diametrically opposed views about the level of scrutiny we should use to analyze the supplemental program. On one end of the spectrum, the commissioner argues that, because Congress could prohibit States from providing any benefits to aliens through the exercise of its plenary power over the regulation of aliens and its power under the supremacy clause, Congress had the power to authorize States to provide State-funded benefits to some, but not all, aliens. She contends that the six-month residency requirement should be subject to rational basis scrutiny because the welfare reform act explicitly authorized States to impose restrictions on the eligibility of qualified aliens for State-funded benefits, which the Massachusetts Legislature did by imposing the six-month residency restriction on a subclass of aliens. Further, because Massachusetts acted consistently with Federal legislation, and because Federal legislation relating to aliens is subject to rational basis review, the commissioner concludes that the State\u2019s enactment of the supplemental program is also subject to that same level of review.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">On the other end of the spectrum, the plaintiffs contend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the reasoning of <em>Graham, supra, </em>governs this case because \u00a7 210 <em>(b) </em>and (c) involves an inherently suspect alienage classification. They rely on the general rule that aliens, as a class, are a prime example of a \u201cdiscrete and insular\u201d minority for whom heightened judicial review is appropriate. They conclude that \u201ca durational residency requirement that denies benefits to legal immigrants, such as Massachusetts\u2019 six-month rule, is not valid.\u201d Integral to their argument is the fact that citizens are eligible to receive comparable benefits from the TAFDC program without having a comparable six-month residency requirement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We are inclined to reject the commissioner\u2019s position for the same reasons it was rejected by the Superior Court judge. We also reject the plaintiffs\u2019 position that the strict scrutiny analysis the Court applied to a classification based on alienage in <em>Graham, supra, </em>should be applied to the unique circumstances of this case when the only group to whom benefits are available is aliens. The fact that citizens are eligible to receive benefits from a different program (TAFDC) on conditions less restrictive than those imposed on qualified aliens is a direct result of the enactment of uniform Federal policies, subject, as noted above, to a separate rational basis review, and does not affect our analysis of the proper standard of review to be used in evaluating the program established by \u00a7 210 <em>(b) </em>and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">We conclude that the appropriate standard of review in these circumstances depends on the nature of the classification that creates the distinction between subgroups of aliens. If that classification were a suspect one such as race, gender, or national origin, we would apply a strict scrutiny analysis. See, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number><em>Plyler </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 216-217 &amp; n.14 (1982). Where, as here, that classification is Massachusetts residency, the proper standard of review is rational basis. We reach this conclusion because we find that the operative classification for equal protection purposes in the setting of this case is not alienage, but residency.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">In concluding that a rational basis standard of review applies, we have also considered the context in which the supplemental program was enacted; its purpose and the clearly noninvidious intent behind its promulgation; the effect of its implementation on mitigating the harm to qualified alien families that might otherwise be without substantial assistance for five years under the requirements of the welfare reform act; and the potential harm to those same families if the Legislature could only choose to create an all-or-nothing program as a remedy to their disqualification from federally funded programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Reviewed under the rational basis standard, \u00a7 210 <em>(b) </em>and (c) passes muster, and the plaintiffs do not contend otherwise. In enacting \u00a7 210 <em>(b) </em>and (c), the Massachusetts Legislature adopted a statute that is consistent with national policies regarding alienage, and that places no additional burdens on aliens beyond those contemplated by the welfare reform act. Section 210 <em>(b) </em>and (c) furthers the Federal policy of self-sufficiency and self-reliance with respect to welfare and immigration by ensuring that aliens first attempt to be self-sufficient before applying for State-funded welfare benefits. In addition, the six-month residency requirement encourages aliens to develop enduring ties to Massachusetts.

However, in their motion for reconsideration and on appeal, the plaintiffs argue that even after the passage of the welfare reform act, qualified aliens remained eligible to receive assistance under the TAFDC program, provided that the State used only State dollars to fund the assistance given to them. We disagree. The \u201c[assistance\u201d provided under the TAFDC program was defined in the statute as \u201cbenefits funded jointly by the commonwealth and the federal government.\u201d St. 1995, c. 5, \u00a7 110 (a).

If a qualified alien had resided in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>United States for five years, but in the Commonwealth for less than six months, he or she would be eligible for benefits under the TAFDC program rather than comparable benefits under the supplemental program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b546-11\">The plaintiffs also set forth claims that the residency requirement violated the privileges and immunities clause of the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1994 &amp; Supp. V 1999), and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1624.
