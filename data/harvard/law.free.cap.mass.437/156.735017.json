The plaintiffs challenge the Attorney General\u2019s certification of an initiative petition to amend the Constitution to provide that \u201conly the union of one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in Massachusetts.\u201d The Attorney General certified that the petition is in the proper form; is not the same as any measure qualified for submission to the people at either of the two preceding biennial State elections; includes only subjects that are related and mutually dependent; and does not contain matters that are excluded by art. 48 from the initiative process. See art. 48, The Initiative, Part II, \u00a7 3, of the Amendments to the Constitution, as amended by art. 74 of the Amendments. A single justice reserved and reported the case to the full court on a statement of agreed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"ALR\">On appeal, the plaintiffs contend only that the petition was improperly certified because it contains matters excluded from the initiative process under art. 48. The plaintiffs raise two specific objections to the certification: (1) the petition violates the provisions of art. 48 excluding measures that relate to the powers of the courts; and (2) the petition contains subject matter that is not related or mutually dependent, as required by art. 48. We conclude that the Attorney General\u2019s certification was proper.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-7\">The petition, if adopted, would add to the State Constitution a provision stating that only a marriage between one man and one woman will be valid and recognized in the Commonwealth. In addition, same-sex couples would be ineligible to receive any of the benefits or incidents exclusive to marriage from the Commonwealth or any of its agencies, departments, authorities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>commissions, officials, and political subdivisions. The stated purpose of the petition is to protect \u201cthe unique relationship of marriage in order to promote ... the stability and welfare of society and the best interests of children.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">1. <em>Affecting the power of the courts. </em>Article 48 expressly excludes from the initiative process any \u201cmeasure that relates to ... the powers ... of courts.\u201d Art. 48, The Initiative, Part II, \u00a7 2. The same exclusion is contained in the Referendum portion of art. 48. We treat these exclusions similarly. Art. 48, The Referendum, Part HI, \u00a7 2. <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>432 Mass. 515, 519 (2000). Before a measure is submitted to the people, the Attorney General must certify that the petition does not cover topics excluded under art. 48. Art. 48, The Initiative, Part II, \u00a7 3. We review the Attorney General\u2019s certification de nova. <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 520. \u201cWe must conduct more than a facial inquiry into the involvement of excluded subjects and determine whether the factual impact of the legislation proposed by the petition will involve an excluded subject.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">We have specifically stated that a petition is not excluded under art. 48 merely because it changes the law enforced by the courts. <em>Id. </em>To adopt such an interpretation would be to render the popular initiative virtually useless. <em>Id. </em>at 519-520. Therefore, we have said that an initiative petition is not excluded by art. 48 unless its \u201cmain design\u201d or \u201cmain purpose\u201d is to affect the powers of the courts. <em>Id. </em>at 520. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>354 Mass. 384, 387 (1968). <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>269 Mass. 503, 511 (1929). To fall within the exclusion, the petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>must affect the powers of the courts in more than an incidental or subsidiary way. <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Previously, when we have held that a referendum \u201crelates to . . . the powers ... of courts,\u201d the measure at issue dealt exclusively and explicitly with the power to decide cases or enforce decisions. <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>391 Mass. 572, 578 (1984) (statute authorizing consolidation of related custody and adoption actions brought initially in different trial courts). <em>Kagan </em>v. <em>United Vacuum Appliance Corp., </em>357 Mass. 680, 682 (1970) (measure establishing court\u2019s long-arm jurisdiction). These provisions did not simply change the substantive law enforced by the courts; they altered the courts\u2019 basic ability to render decisions in an entire category of cases, thus imposing the type of impact on courts\u2019 powers that art. 48 envisioned. By contrast, when an initiative petition only alters the substantive law enforced by the courts, the work of the courts is affected in an incidental way; it cannot be said that the \u201cmain feature\u201d of that petition is to alter the power of the courts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yee, </em>361 Mass. 533, 537 (1972), quoting <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 511 (\u201cA general law covering a subject disconnected with courts in its main feature does not come within the prohibition of ... art. 48 .. . because, in an incidental and subsidiary way, the work of the courts may be increased or diminished or changed\u201d). See <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 522 (petition expanding category of defendants who may request diversion into drug treatment programs not within exclusion); <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 511-512 (initiative petition creating automobile insurance fund and repealing judicial review of automobile security rates not within exclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The plaintiffs maintain that the instant petition relates to the powers of the courts by eliminating the courts\u2019 authority to affirm or annul certain marriages, to exercise equitable authority to decide certain matters relating to marriage, and to construe statutes and rule on their constitutionality as they relate to family law matters. The court indeed has broad powers over marriage that are derived from statutory law. See, e.g., G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 3 (\u201cProbate courts have exclusive original jurisdiction of actions for divorce or for affirming or annulling marriage\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>However, the petition does not strip the court of its basic power to affirm and annul marriages, grant equitable relief, or decide the constitutionality of statutes; it merely changes the underlying definition of a valid marriage. Therefore, it is a change in the underlying substantive law that the courts adjudicate and enforce; it is not a change in the power of the courts to decide and enforce their decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The petition has as its \u201cmain purpose,\u201d see <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 520-521, the goal of adopting a constitutional <em>rule </em>that certain individuals cannot be considered married. But, argue the plaintiffs, the words \u201cvalid\u201d and \u201crecognized\u201d are \u201clegal terms of art that relate to the courts\u2019 power\u201d to hear and decide cases, and therefore indicate that the main design of the petition is to have an impact on the courts. The plaintiffs point to the statements of the first signer as further evidence that the courts were the main focus of the initiative petition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even assuming that the main purpose of the petition is to prevent the courts from adopting a certain interpretation of our substantive law, this purpose is not excluded by art. 48. The initiative process permits the people to petition for a constitutional amendment that overrules a court decision when the court has declared a statute to be in violation of our Constitution. <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 528 (\u201cCitizens may overrule a [court] decision based on State constitutional grounds, but may do so only by constitutional amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-28\">The plaintiffs attempt to fit the petition within the exclusion by framing it as directed at the court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to hear marriage recognition and validation cases. Article 48 prohibits an initiative petition that \u201cexpressly confers or restricts a court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yee, supra </em>at 538. The measure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>proposed here, however, is not such a rule. It does not remove the courts\u2019 power to hear marriage, divorce, recognition, and validation actions when the parties are same-sex couples. It merely sets forward a substantive rule that the court must apply in individual cases. Cf. <em>id. </em>(\u201ca statute making certain specified acts or omissions criminal . . . would not be included with the phrase \u2018powers ... of courts\u2019 because it does not relate to jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AZ0\">2. <em>The relatedness requirement. </em>The Attorney General must also determine that a petition contains only subjects \u201cwhich are related or which are mutually dependent.\u201d Art. 48, The Initiafive, Part II, \u00a7 3. The plaintiffs argue that the petition contains subjects that are neither related nor mutually dependent because it affects same-sex couples in many different contexts. In support of this position, the plaintiffs list various statutes that relate to the rights and responsibilities of marriage, including those laws that affect one\u2019s ability to inherit, to file taxes, to make medical decisions about a spouse, and to file wrongful death claims.</p>\n<p id=\"AXR\">An initiative petition can address more than one subject if those subjects are related. <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 209, 219 (1981). Subjects are related \u201c[i]f . . . one can identify a common purpose to which each subject of an initiative petition can reasonably be said to be germane . . . .\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>422 Mass. 1212, 1220 (1996), quoting <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 219-220. Here, the entire petition relates to the common purpose of restricting the benefits and incidents of marriage to opposite-sex couples. Although the plaintiffs fist many statutes that may be affected should the measure be adopted, each statute affected creates a benefit or responsibility that arises from married status. A measure does not fail the relatedness requirement just because it affects more than one statute, as long as the provisions of the petition are related by a common purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"AJs\">We have stated that the common purpose may not be \u201cso broad as to render the \u2018related subjects\u2019 limitation meaningless.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 219. For example, we have said that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>purpose of \u201c[making] the Massachusetts government more accountable to the people\u201d is \u201cunacceptably broad.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 1220, 1221. However, the purpose of limiting marriage to the union of one man and one woman is sufficiently narrow to meet art. 48\u2019s relatedness requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We remand the case to the county court for entry of a declaration that the Attorney General\u2019s certification of the petition complies with the requirements of art. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A6T\">The initiative petition, entitled \u201cA Constitutional Amendment Relative to the Protection of Marriage,\u201d was signed by more than ten qualified voters and filed with the Attorney General for certification. The Attorney General, after certification, transmitted the petition, along with summaries, to the Secretary. The proponents of the petition filed with the Secretary a sufficient number of signatures to require the Secretary to transmit the measure to the General Court. Should a joint session of the General Court approve the measure by a one-fourth vote, it will be referred to the next General Court. Art. 48, The Initiative, Part IV, \u00a7 4. If it once again receives the affirmative vote of one-fourth of the members, the Secretary will submit the amendment to the people at the next State election. Art. 48, The Initiative, Part IV, \u00a7 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The full text of the proposed amendment reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">\u201cIt being the public policy of this Commonwealth to protect the unique relationship of marriage in order to promote, among other goals, the stability and welfare of society and the best interests of children, only the union of one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in Massachusetts.
