L. c. 123, \u00a7 16 (f), mandates the dismissal of charges pending against an incompetent criminal defendant on the final date of the period prescribed under the statute and computed on the basis of the maximum sentence for the single most serious crime charged or on the basis of the maximum consecutive sentences of all of the crimes charged of equal seriousness. The single justice, ruling on a petition under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, concluded that the latter interpretation should apply and denied the petition. The petitioner (defendant) appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>from the single justice\u2019s denial of relief, pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 2:21, as amended, 434 Mass. 1301 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We conclude that the plain meaning of G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 16 (f), requires the Department of Correction to calculate the period of the pendency of criminal charges against an incompetent defendant on the basis of the single most serious crime charged and on the single maximum sentence allowable. We remand the case to the county court where an order shall enter remanding to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">1. <em>Facts. </em>On October 26, 1993, James A. Foss, Jr., was arraigned in the Lynn District Court on three counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen years, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. Immediately after arraignment, the defendant was evaluated and was found to be incompetent to stand trial. On December 13, 1993, the defendant was placed on indefinite pretrial probation in the custody of the Department of Mental Retardation and placed in one of its \u201crespite program\u201d facilities. The defendant has remained incompetent to stand trial and in such a facility since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">On August 8, 2000, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him, pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 16 (f), arguing that the statute requires dismissal of charges pending against an incompetent defendant on the expiration of a period of time \u201cequal to the time of imprisonment which the person would have had to serve prior to becoming eligible for parole if he had been convicted of the most serious crime with which he was charged in court and sentenced to the maximum sentence he could have received.\u201d On September 27, 2000, a judge of the Lynn District Court held a hearing on the motion. On October 24, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s oral motion for a reevaluation of the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">On October 31, 2000, the defendant filed his petition for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. On January 5, 2001, while the matter was under advisement, the Department of Correction, pursuant to its authority under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 16 (f), issued its computation and determination that the charges against the defendant were required to have been dismissed no later than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>October 25, 1998. The single justice entered judgment on March 16, 2001, denying the defendant\u2019s request for relief. The defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The words of a statute are the main source from which we ascertain legislative purpose, and when the text of a statute is clear and unambiguous, we construe the language in accordance with its plain and ordinary meaning. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>435 Mass. 249, 252 (2001), and cases cited. When the words are clear and, when assigned their ordinary meaning, yield a workable and logical result, we interpret the statute without resort to extrinsic aids, such as legislative history. See <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 610 (1983). General Laws c. 123, \u00a7 16 <em>(f), </em>reads, in pertinent part: \u201cIf a person is found incompetent to stand trial, the court shall send notice to the department of correction which shall compute the date of the expiration of the period of time equal to the time of imprisonment which the person would have had to serve prior to becoming eligible for parole <em>if he had been convicted of the most serious crime with which he was charged in court and sentenced to the maximum sentence he could have received, if so convicted\u201d </em>(emphasis added). When the words \u201cthe most serious\u201d are given their ordinary meaning and are used to modify the singular word \u201ccrime,\u201d their import is clear. Furthermore, when the word \u201cmaximum\u201d is used to modify the singular word \u201csentence,\u201d the same result adheres.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ordinary meaning of the words is that the Department of Correction must compute the period of time with reference to the single most serious crime charged, and the single maximum sentence allowable for that crime. When assigned their ordinary meaning, the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>\u201cthe most serious crime\u201d and \u201cthe maximum sentence\u201d yield a logical and workable result. In the thirty-two years since G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 16 <em>(f), </em>inserted by St. 1970, c. 888, \u00a7 4, was enacted, there have been several amendments to other portions of the mental health statute, however, there has been no suggestion that \u00a7 16 (/), as written, is illogical or unworkable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Furthermore, the Department of Correction calculates parole eligibility dates, and comparable \u201c16 (f)\u201d dates (as it did in this case) based on the maximum sentence allowable for the single most serious offense charged. We accord due weight and deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of statutes within its charge. See <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Newton, </em>425 Mass. 468, 470 (1997), and cases cited. We see no reason to disturb the Department of Correction\u2019s interpretation of the statute. Its interpretation accords the words their ordinary and plain meaning and achieves a logical and workable result. See Flaschner, The New Massachusetts Mental Health Code \u2014 A \u201cMagna Carta\u201d or a Magna Maze?, 56 Mass. L.Q. 49, 58 &amp; n.17 (1971) (computation is with regard to the most serious crime with which the defendant was charged, \u201c[n]ot for all the crimes with which he was charged\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Although we need not resort to extrinsic aids to resolve the issue before us, the legislative history of G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 16 <em>(f), </em>also supports our interpretation. Prior to its enactment, it was not uncommon for incompetent defendants charged with minor crimes to be confined in maximum security facilities, such as Bridgewater State Hospital, for anywhere from a decade to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>lifetime.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Empirical studies conducted at State hospitals in Massachusetts, Michigan, and Pennsylvania revealed that a finding of incompetence to stand trial was \u201ctantamount to a life sentence for many criminal defendants.\u201d Morris, Out of Mind? Out of Sight: The Uncivil Commitment of Permanently Incompetent Criminal Defendants, 27 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 1, 4 (1993). A 1969 study in Massachusetts found that more men committed as incompetent to stand trial \u201chad left Bridgwater as a result of death than all other avenues combined.\u201d McGarry, Demonstration and Research in Competency for Trial and Mental Illness: Review and Preview, 49 B.U. L. Rev. 46, 50 n.20 (1969).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Legislators and legal and medical practitioners recognized the gravity of this and other problems afflicting the treatment and care of mentally ill and incompetent persons in Massachusetts, and sought to make significant changes as early as 1961. The Massachusetts Legislature established the Special Commission on Mental Health<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in 1961 and directed \u201cin particular [to] consider the laws relating to the methods of commitment, treatment and release of patients.\u201d Resolves 1961, c. 89. Subsequent resolves continued and expanded the scope of the commission\u2019s work, ending in the presentment of draft legislation in 1967.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See Resolves 1962, c. 117, c. 130; Resolves 1963, c. 55; Resolves 1965, c. 28; Resolves 1966, c. 1, c. 46, and c. 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Among many other problems studied and addressed in the new mental health laws was the pretrial commitment of incompetent criminal defendants. A major thrust was to eliminate the highly questionable practice of committing incompetent criminal defendants indefinitely, while awaiting their unlikely restoration to competency, and also eliminating the indefinite pendency of criminal charges that, most often, significantly limited the incompetent criminal defendant\u2019s access to treatment by more effective civil means. See Joost, Massachusetts Mental Health Code: Promise and Performance, 60 A.B.A. J. 95, 97 (1974) (discussing effects of new mental health code and 1965 Report of Special Commission); Walker, Mental Health Law Reform in Massachusetts, 53 B.U. L. Rev. 986, 986-987, 1004, 1007 (1973). The civil rights of committed persons was a major consideration of the Special Commission and its proposed legislation, which served as the basis of the health code revisions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> General Laws c. 123, \u00a7 16 <em>(b) </em>and (c), effectively eliminated the problem of the indefinite commitment of incompetent defendants, providing that \u201c[a]n order of commitment . . . shall be valid for six months\u201d and \u201c[ajfter the expiration of a commitment under [\u00a7 16 (&amp;)], a person may be committed for additional one year periods . . . but no untried defendant shall be so committed unless ... the court also finds said defendant is incompetent to stand trial.\u201d A committed, incompetent defendant is guaranteed reevaluation after the first six months and at least annually thereafter, with the presumption favoring competence. The statute also addresses the issue of indefinite pendency of criminal charges against an incompetent defendant, providing that \u201cthe court shall dismiss the criminal charges against [the incompetent criminal defendant]\u201d on the final date of the period computed under \u00a7 16 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">An Illinois appellate court, interpreting a statute with similar wording in a case with similar facts concluded that the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>me\u00e1ning of the Illinois statute prohibited a parole eligibility calculation based on maximum consecutive sentences. See <em>Kulak </em>v. <em>Belletire, </em>148 Ill. App. 3d 268 (1986). The court also squarely addressed the issue whether the statute permitted consecutive sentences where the defendant was charged with multiple counts of the same offense, and concluded that it did not, stating that if the Legislature had so intended it could have done so expressly by referring to the maximum sentence for the \u201cclass of the most serious offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273-274. We find this reasoning to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Although the Commonwealth\u2019s suggested reading of the statute would eliminate the problem of indefinite pendency of criminal charges, as a requirement of dismissal at the end of the period based on the maximum consecutive sentences would still yield a definite (albeit distant) date, the Commonwealth\u2019s reading fails to account for additional significant considerations underlying the revision of the mental health laws in Massachusetts. Studies conducted at Bridgewater State Hospital beginning in 1963 revealed that of approximately 200 men then indefinitely committed, the Bridgewater staff, with the assistance of the Law-Medicine Institute (conducting the study) were able to return fifty-three to trial. McGarrey, <em>supra </em>at 50-51. Of those returned for trial, thirty-five had been committed for less than two years. <em>Id. </em>at 51. The mean length of the hospitalization of the fifty-three men returned for trial was 3.7 years. <em>Id. </em>The mean length of the hospitalization of the 147 who were not able to return for trial was fifteen years. <em>Id. </em>The implications of the study demonstrate that a significant population of the men then not able to return for trial would have been competent within two years of their hospitalization. <em>Id. </em>Thus, it makes little sense for charges to remain pending against an incompetent defendant long past the period of time in which he is likely, if at all, to regain competence. See <em>State ex rel. Haskins </em>v. <em>County Court, </em>62 Wis. 2d 250, 268 (1974) (it would be \u201ca rather pointless and a cruel application of the law, as well as an additional burden on prosecutors and courts, to keep pending criminal charges that will never be brought to trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We conclude, in light of the considerations and recommendations before the Legislature at the time of its enactment, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>statute balances the interests of an incompetent defendant in dismissal of pending charges with the interests of the Commonwealth in protecting the public and enforcing the law by providing that the charges may remain pending for a period determined on the basis of the single most serious crime charged and the maximum sentence possible therefor.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Legislature did not intend to calculate that period based on consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">It is uncontested that under the parole eligibility rules applicable to this offense (committed prior to July 1, 1994), the defendant, if convicted, would have been required to serve two-thirds of his minimum sentence. See G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133, as amended through St. 1986, c. 486; G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133, as amended by St. 1993, c. 432, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 21. Therefore, the period to be calculated under \u00a7 16 <em>(f) </em>is two-thirds of the minimum sentence (as defined in G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 16 [f]) for the single most serious offense with which the defendant was charged.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The case is remanded to the county court where an order will enter remanding the case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The Commonwealth cites G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Fourth, providing that \u201c[w]ords importing the singular number may extend and be applied to several persons or things,\u201d to support its proposition that the words \u201ccrime\u201d and \u201csentence\u201d should be read to include the plural number. We have interpreted the singular form to include the plural on occasion, however, we have done so \u201cto assure that the purpose of the statute may be fulfilled.\u201d See <em>Blue Cross of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>397 Mass. 674, 678-679 (1986), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montecalvo, </em>367 Mass. 46, 49-50 (1975), and G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6. \u201cIn the context of this statute, the [singular] form is meaningful.\u201d <em>Blue Cross of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., supra </em>at 679. See <em>Worcester Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>406 Mass. 244, 246-247 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\">As the single justice correctly observed, the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that \u00a7 16 (/) applies only where the defendant has been committed has no merit. Section 16 (/) does not distinguish between defendants who have been committed and those who have not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\">We have held with respect to an agency interpretation of a statute, \u201c[t]he basis for affording the contemporaneous interpretation deference is that the interpretation was made close to the time the Legislature enacted the statute and may represent \u2018understanding of the public regarding the enactment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Connery </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>414 Mass. 1009, 1010 (1993), quoting <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Riverside Park Enters., Inc., </em>399 Mass. 533, 539 n.14 (1987). Though commentary is not generally viewed in the same light as agency interpretation, its proximity in time to the enactment may also weigh in favor of its persuasiveness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\u201cIn 1896, a twenty-four year old man charged with vagrancy was found incompetent to stand trial and committed to Bridgewater State Hospital....

The Supreme Court of the United States left open the question whether an incompetent criminal defendant is entitled to dismissal of pending charges as a matter of due process in <em>Jackson </em>v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 740 (1972). However, other courts have reached the issue, and most conclude that an incompetent criminal defendant does not automatically have a right to the dismissal of charges based solely on the fact that he is unlikely to regain his competence. The New Jersey Supreme Court reasoned that a dismissal based on such a determination \u201cis purely prognostication,\u201d and \u201cmay simply turn out to be incorrect.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaffey, </em>92 N.J. 374, 386, 387 (1983). \u201cHence, if such a prediction is or can be wrong, other considerations, such as the protection of society and the public interest in effective law enforcement, militate strongly in favor of the right to continue or renew the prosecution or at least preserving the opportunity to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument that because he has not been indicted and remains under the jurisdiction of the District Court, his maximum sentence is two and one-half years, see Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Crim. P. 3 (b) (1), Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 134 (Lexis 2001), lacks merit. Section 16 <em>(f) </em>makes no mention of the charging instrument, and for good reason: if the defendant were tried on these charges, he would be tried in Superior Court. It would be wasteful to require grand jury indictment of incompetent defendants to avoid the District Court limitation, and we decline to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
