He was sentenced to 10 to 15 years imprisonment and appeals as of right, raising three issues. We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">First, defendant claims that statements taken from him by police officers while in their custody were involuntary since he, as a 16-year-old minor, was incapable of waiving his <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694; 10 ALR3d 974 (1966), rights to remain silent and to the presence of an attorney. On December 13, 1977, defendant was arrested with his brother in connection with the December 12, 1977, robbery and shooting death of Janet DeCoster at her home in Macomb County. While in custody the following day, and after he was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, defendant was questioned by the police. This questioning resulted in two or three incriminating statements. Defendant now challenges the admissibility of these confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">We need not reach the merits of defendant\u2019s claim that the confessions were illegally obtained because defendant\u2019s counselled guilty plea, nearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>eight months after the statements were made, constitutes a waiver of the purported infirmity. <em>People v Peters, </em>397 Mich 360, 369-371; 244 NW2d 898 (1976). See <em>People v Figlus, </em>86 Mich App 552; 272 NW2d 722 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Second, defendant contends that his plea bargain was illusory because, while he accepted the prosecutor\u2019s oifer to plead guilty to armed robbery in exchange for the prosecutor\u2019s dismissal of a felony-murder charge, defendant states that he could not have been properly convicted of this charge since he neither committed nor aided and abetted in the murder of Janet DeCoster.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Following the lead of the United States Court of Appeals in <em>Hammond v United States, </em>528 F2d 15 (CA 4, 1975), this Court has not hesitated to take appropriate action on an appeal from a guilty plea which is involuntary as a matter of law because the bargain on which the plea was based was illusory. <em>People v Lawson, </em>75 Mich App 726; 255 NW2d 748 (1977), <em>People v Roderick Johnson, </em>86 Mich App 77; 272 NW2d 200 (1978), <em>People v Sanders, </em>91 Mich App 737; 283 NW2d 841 (1979). Conversely, if the facts in the case indicate that \"the plea was nevertheless voluntary\u201d, the plea will be upheld notwithstanding that there was a failure of consideration between the parties regarding part of the plea agreement. <em>People v Phillip Smith, </em>407 Mich 906 (1979), <em>People v James, </em>90 Mich App 424; 282 NW2d 344 (1979), <em>People v Rowe, </em>85 Mich App 106; 270 NW2d 472 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Nonetheless, in the instant case, it is unnecessary to consider the merits of the plea-bargaining arrangement since, as a matter of law, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>could have been properly charged with felony murder in count I of the information.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As such, a valid promise by the prosecutor to forego prosecution of this charge in exchange for defendant\u2019s plea to the second count was of significant benefit to the defendant. The value of the bargain to defendant was genuine, valid, and known to defendant. Therefore, since defendant surrendered his right to trial in full apprehension of the value of the commitments made to him, his plea of guilty cannot be challenged as being the result of an illusory plea bargin.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Finally, defendant claims that the testimony offered at the waiver hearing and the preliminary examination was insufficient to show probable cause to charge him with felony murder. Whatever may be said about the merits of this contention, by pleading guilty without seeking review in the circuit court of the juvenile waiver decision, defendant waived any infirmity in that proceeding. <em>People v Figlus, supra, People v Mahone, </em>75 Mich App 407; 254 NW2d 907 (1977). Likewise, \"[e]rrors and irregularities relating to the preliminary examination may not be raised on appeal [to this Court] unless those issues were timely raised prior to or at trial\u201d or before defendant pleads guilty. <em>People v Miller, </em>62 Mich App 495, 497; 233 NW2d 629 (1975). In addition, the defendant cannot, subsequent to his guilty plea, raise questions about the sufficiency of the evidence before the examining magistrate. <em>Id., </em>at 498, <em>People v Cullens, </em>55 Mich App 272; 222 NW2d 315 (1974). Accordingly, we conclude that the issue has not been preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\"> See <em>e.g., People v Poplar, </em>20 Mich App 132; 173 NW2d 732 (1969), <em>People v Wirth, </em>87 Mich App 41; 273 NW2d 104 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
