(ASR), in marketing memberships in a system of outdoor resort campgrounds, is offering securities to the public so as to require compliance with the registration provisions of section 352-e of New York\u2019s \"Blue Sky\u201d Law, the Martin Act (General Business Law art 23-A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ASR is a Washington corporation authorized to do business in the State of New York. It neither operates campgrounds nor solicits memberships in New York, but it desires to do both. In the declaratory judgment action before us, ASR seeks to enjoin the Attorney-General from applying the statute to it and requests a determination that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the memberships it offers to the public are not securities under General Business Law \u00a7 352-e.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">ASR owns and operates campgrounds for the use and enjoyment of its members in seven States outside of New York. Each campground contains parking sites for recreational vehicles improved with facilities for providing electrical, water and sewer services. In addition, at a typical campground ASR provides a general store, a recreational hall, a swimming area and facilities and equipment for various athletic and recreational activities. The rights and obligations of the members are spelled out in the membership agreement, the certificate of membership and a question and answer sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Membership, as defined in the membership agreement, constitutes \"only a license for nonexclusive use of such recreational facilities as may be provided from time to time by ASR\u201d. The certificate of membership provides that a member \"is entitled to use all present and future resorts available through ASR for the benefit of its membership as a whole, wheresoever such resorts are located * * * ASR may purchase, lease, operate, or otherwise make such resorts available. The location and nature of all such resorts and the properties, existing or intended, are subject to change by ASR but ASR agrees to use its best efforts to maintain or improve the existing quality of such properties and resorts * * * All such resorts will be developed in such manner as ASR may deem suitable for the enhancement of enjoyment and recreational value, provided, however (1) ASR shall be under no obligation to increase the number of resorts; and (2) ASR may dispose of resorts at any time and in any manner deemed appropriate by ASR, provided however, in such event ASR will provide alternate resort facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">By specific terms of the agreement, members acquire no \"legal or beneficial interest in ASR or its assets\u201d and no \"right or interest in property, contract rights or business of ASR\u201d. Members are not entitled to \"any share of income, gain or distribution by or of ASR\u201d. Nor do members acquire \"any voting rights in ASR or pertaining to its business\u201d or any right to participate in ASR\u2019s management.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">In the agreement a member represents that he is acquiring the membership solely for his personal enjoyment and that of his immediate family and \"not for resale or profit and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>[the] membership has not been represented or sold * * * as an investment opportunity.\u201d To prevent the acquisition or sale of memberships for investment purposes, the agreement imposes restrictions upon the alienation of memberships. For the first two years a membership may not be transferred at all, except to family members by operation of law. It may not, in any event, be transferred more than twice and may be sold only once. The price paid on a transfer may not exceed the original purchase price plus the reasonable cost of the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The question and answer sheet provided to prospective members includes the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">\"does my membership represent a good investment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">\"Only as an investment in your future outdoor recreational needs. ASR is selling use, not investment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Members must pay an initial fee which ranges from $4,495 to $6,095 depending upon which, if any, of certain optional features they purchase. Annual dues are $152. Increases in the dues are limited to the yearly increase in a specified consumer price index.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">The Attorney-General moved to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (7) and ASR cross-moved under CPLR 3211 (c) for summary judgment. Special Term concluded that ASR memberships are not participation interests or investments in real estate or cooperative interests in real estate as those terms are used in section 352-e (1) (a) and that the memberships do not come within the statute\u2019s general definition of \"securities\u201d. The court declared that the registration requirements of section 352-e did not apply and granted injunctive relief. The Appellate Division reversed, noting that the Martin Act is a remedial statute which should be liberally interpreted. It held that, although a membership did not include the right to share in any profits and entailed no ownership interest in any of the assets of ASR, it should, nevertheless, in view of the large size of the initial fee, be construed as a participation interest in real estate within the sense of that term in section 352-e (1) (a). Plaintiff appeals as a matter of right (CPLR 5601 former [a] [ii]). For reasons hereinafter stated, we now reverse and reinstate the judgment of Special Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">In construing section 352-e (1) (a), we are mindful that the statute, as part of New York\u2019s Blue Sky Law, should be liberally construed to give effect to its remedial purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>protecting the public from fraudulent exploitation in the offer and sale of securities <em>(see, People v Federated Radio Corp., </em>244 NY 33, 38; Mihaly &amp; Kaufmann, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 19, General Business Law art 23-A, pp 9-13; <em>see also, Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. v Joiner Corp., </em>320 US 344, 353). In our application of the statute, we find it appropriate to consider as persuasive authority the decisions of the United States Supreme Court and other Federal courts construing the Federal Blue Sky Laws (Securities Act of 1933, \u00a7 1 <em>et seq., </em>15 USC \u00a7 77-a <em>et seq.; </em>Securities Exchange Act of 1934, \u00a7 1 <em>et seq., </em>15 USC \u00a7 78-a <em>et seq.; see, Dunwoody Country Club v Fortson, </em>243 Ga 236, 253 SE2d 700, 703). Although the language of the State and Federal statutes is not identical, the remedial purpose is the same <em>(see, Matter of Gardner v Lefkowitz, </em>97 Misc 2d 806, 812), and section 352-e (1) (a), we note, makes specific reference to the Federal Securities Act of 1933. <em>(See also, </em>NY State Div of Housing, Memorandum of Apr. 19, 1960 recommending adoption of \u00a7 352-e and describing the bill as covering intrastate \u201creal estate syndicates and cooperative ventures of the type to which the [SEC] rules and regulations apply\u201d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Because the sole issue is whether ASR memberships are \u201csecurities\u201d within section 352-e, our analysis must start with an examination of the definition of \u201csecurities\u201d in the statute itself <em>(see, </em>McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 94). The pertinent statutory language is as follows: \u201csecurities constituted of participation interests or investments in real estate, mortgages or leases, including stocks, bonds, debentures, evidences of interest or indebtedness, limited partnership interests or other security or securities as defined in section three hundred fifty-two of this article, when such securities consist primarily of participation interests or investments in one or more real estate ventures, including cooperative interests in realty\u201d (General Business Law \u00a7 352-e [1] [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The definition includes a list of specific categories of interests or instruments which constitute securities and, in addition, a general category of \u201csecurities as defined in section [352<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>].\u201d Accordingly, we must determine both whether the ASR membership falls within one of the specific categories <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>and, if not, whether, on examination of its characteristics in the light of decisional law, it meets the broader general definition of \"securities\u201d in section 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">This two-fold analysis dictated by the statutory language comports with the analysis employed by the Supreme Court for determining the existence of a security <em>(see, Landreth Timber Co. v Landreth, </em>471 US 681,685-689; <em>United Hous. Found. v Forman, </em>421 US 837,848-851; <em>Tcherepnin v Knight, </em>389 US 332, 336; <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. v Howey Co., </em>328 US 293, 298). Whether the label of a particular interest and the description given to it by the parties brings it literally within one of the enumerated categories in section 352-e is not determinative <em>(see, Landreth Timber Co. v Landreth, supra, </em>at pp 686-687; <em>United Hous. Found. v Forman, </em>421 US 837, 850-851, <em>supra). </em>We must go beyond the \"literal test\u201d and \u2014 applying a flexible and adaptable approach <em>(see, Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. v Howey Co., supra, </em>at p 299) \u2014 \"look to the function of [the ASR membership], to search for substance over form with emphasis on economic reality <em>\u201d (Matter of Avon Prods. v State Tax Commn., </em>90 AD2d 393, 395), to see if it displays the characteristics of \"securities\u201d in the <em>general sense </em>of the term as used in sections 352 and 352-e <em>(see, Landreth Timber Co. v Landreth, supra, </em>at pp 685-689; <em>United Hous. Found. v Forman, supra, </em>at pp 848-851; <em>Tcherepnin v Knight, supra, </em>at p 336; <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. v Howey Co., supra, </em>at p 298; <em>Daily v Morgan, </em>701 F2d 496, 499).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\"> In examining the specific categories in section 352-e (1) (a), it is apparent that only two can be applied to ASR memberships: (1) the category of \"participation interests or investments in one or more real estate ventures\u201d and (2) the included subcategory, \"cooperative interests in realty\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ASR memberships fall within neither. An ASR membership is not an investment as the term is commonly understood. Whether we refer to the dictionary definition<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or to the meaning as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>cribed to the term in the cases, it is clear that the <em>sine qua non </em>of an investment is the expectation of financial profit or return <em>(see, e.g., United Hous. Found. v Forman, </em>421 US 837, 851-852, <em>supra; Weaver v Marine Bank, </em>637 F2d 157, 162, <em>revd on other grounds </em>455 US 551; <em>Matter of Gardner v Lefkowitz, </em>97 Misc 2d 806, 812-814, <em>supra; </em>Mihaly &amp; Kaufmann, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 19, General Business Law art 23-A, p 13). An ASR member receives no profit, shares in no gain, and acquires no interest in ASR\u2019s assets. Clearly, the ASR membership cannot be classified as a security for having the essential characteristics of an investment <em>(see, Matter of Waldstein, </em>160 Misc 763, 767).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Similarly, because the members obtain no rights to share in any profits or gains, ASR memberships cannot constitute \"participation interests in real estate\u201d. It is significant that \"participation interests\u201d are treated in the statute not as a separate category but as being equivalent to and virtually synonymous with \"investments\u201d. Wherever the words \"participation interests\u201d appear in the statute they are paired with the word \"investments\u201d in the phrase \"participation interests or investments\u201d. Moreover, the statute specifically characterizes the interests as being participation interests \"in real estate <em>ventures\u2019</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(\u00a7 352-e [1] [a]; emphasis added). The use of the word \"ventures\u201d provides further support for the conclusion that what is meant by \"participation interest\u201d is an investment for financial gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Consistent with what appears to be the meaning attributed to the term in the statute, various courts have used the terms \"participation\u201d and \"participation interests\u201d as descriptive of forms of ownership in which the expectation of sharing of profits is an essential element <em>(see, Reiter v Greenberg, </em>21 NY2d 388; <em>Weaver v Marine Bank, </em>637 F2d 157, 161-162, <em>revd on other grounds </em>455 US 551, <em>supra; A.N.S. Props. v Gough Indus., </em>102 Ariz 180, 427 P2d 131, 133; <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson v Hudson, </em>190 Ore 458, 226 P2d 501, 505). Indeed, \"participation\u201d appears in the decisions most often when applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>shares in limited real estate partnerships or real estate syndicates. In <em>Reiter v Greenberg (supra), </em>for example, we referred to shares in a syndicate formed to acquire real estate for investment purposes as \"participating interests\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 390). <em>(See also, Steingart v 21 Assoc., </em>31 Misc 2d 212, 214; <em>Freeze v Smith, </em>254 Mich 386, 236 NW 810; <em>Conroy v Schultz, </em>80 NJ Super 443, 194 A2d 20 [all applying the term \"participation interests\u201d or \"units\u201d to real estate syndicates].)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">It is in this sense (i.e., as descriptive of participating interests in limited partnerships or syndicates) that, we believe, the term is used in section 352-e (1) (a). Such construction is consistent with the usual meaning of the term, with its use in the statute in conjunction with the terms \"investments\u201d and \"real estate ventures\u201d, with the title of the statute \"The Real Estate Syndicate Act\u201d, and with the statutory purpose in protecting the public from fraudulent exploitation in the marketing and sale of securities and speculative investment schemes <em>(see, People v Lexington 61st Assoc., </em>38 NY2d 588, 595; <em>People v Federated Radio Corp., </em>244 NY 33, 38, <em>supra; Matter of Gardner v Lefkowitz, </em>97 Misc 2d 806, 809, <em>supra; </em>Mihaly &amp; Kaufmann, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 19, General Business Law art 23-A, pp 7-13). We hold, then, contrary to the conclusion of the Appellate Division, that ASR memberships do not amount to \"participation interests or investments\u201d in real estate ventures (\u00a7352-e [1] M).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Nor do the ASR memberships fall within the term \"cooperative interests in realty\u201d estate. From its use elsewhere in our statutory law, the phrase \"cooperative interests in realty\u201d estate has acquired a meaning which includes cooperatives, as the term is usually understood, condominiums and interests in real estate owned through homeowner associations <em>(see, </em>Condominium Act, Real Property Law art 9-b, \u00a7 339-ee; General Business Law \u00a7 352-e [2-b]). ASR memberships do not fit any of these forms of interests in real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">A person having a cooperative interest in real estate <em>(e.g., </em>a tenant-shareholder in a cooperative apartment) typically owns stock in a cooperative corporation and has a \"proprietary\u201d leasehold granted by the corporation <em>(see, Matter of State Tax Commn. v Shor, </em>43 NY2d 151, 154; <em>Matter of Payson v Caputa, </em>9 AD2d 226, 232; <em>People ex rel. McGoldrick v Sterling, </em>283 App Div 88, 90-91; 19 NY Jur 2d, Condominiums and Co-operative Apartments, \u00a7 47). The characteristics of condominium owner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>ship are individual ownership of a unit, an undivided interest in designated common elements, and an agreement among unit owners regulating the administration and maintenance of the property <em>(see, Kaufman &amp; Broad Homes v Albertson, </em>73 Misc 2d 84; 19 NY Jur 2d, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 9). A homeowners association is another form of ownership of property by the individual. Ordinarily, the association holds title to the property and the homeowners derive their ownership through shares of interest in the association <em>(see, </em>General Business Law \u00a7 352-e [2-b]; 13 NYCRR 22.1 [a] [3]; see, <em>e.g., People v Development Servs., </em>92 Misc 2d 759).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Membership in ASR does not convey a cooperative interest or a condominium interest because the members hold no stock in ASR and no ownership or leasehold interest in or right to exclusive possession of any of its property. Moreover, the characteristics of ownership through a homeowners association are simply not present. The common element in all of these forms of cooperative ownership \u2014 that the individual holds some ownership interest in the property \u2014 is absent. Indeed, by the very terms of the agreement, an ASR membership can constitute \"only a license for nonexclusive use of * * * recreational facilities\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">We conclude, then, that ASR memberships are neither \"participation interests or investments\u201d in real estate ventures nor \"cooperative interests in realty\u201d within the meaning of section 352-e (1) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The next question is whether the ASR memberships are securities in the general or common-law sense as the term is used in the broad category \"securities\u201d in sections 352 and 352-e (1) (a). Although our court has not defined the term \"securities\u201d, there is ample authority in the decisions of lower courts in our State and the courts of other jurisdictions <em>(see generally, What Constitutes an \"Investment Contract\u201d Within the Meaning of State Blue Sky Laws, </em>Ann., 47 ALR3d 1375, 1382; Coffey, <em>Economic Realities of a \"Security\u201d: Is There a More Meaningful Formula?, </em>18 W Res L Rev 367, 377 [1967]; Mihaly &amp; Kaufmann, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 19, General Business Law art 23-A, p 15; <em>and see, Meagher v Metropolitan Life Ins.

Found. v Forman </em>(421 US, at p 852 [\"either capital appreciation resulting from the development of the initial investment\u201d or \"a participation in earnings resulting from the use of investors\u2019 funds\u201d]), we must conclude that the ASR membership is not a \"security\u201d. For an interest to be a security under <em>Howey, </em>there must be an expectation of financial gain or profit. There is simply none here.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Nor does the membership have the attributes of an investment <em>(see, Matter of Waldstein, </em>160 Misc 763, 767, <em>supra, </em>defining security as \"any form of instrument used for the purpose of financing and promoting enterprises, and which is designed for <em>investment\u201d </em>[emphasis added]). The membership may be transferred only twice and sold once and then, not at a profit. As specified in the ASR question and answer form, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>ASR \"is selling use, not investment.\u201d There is certainly nothing about the ASR membership which would whet the \"foolish cupidity\u201d of the \"inexperienced, confiding and credulous investor\u201d <em>(see, People v Smith Co., </em>230 App Div 268, 269).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The Attorney-General, however, asks us to avoid a restrictive application of the tests in <em>Howey </em>and <em>Waldstein. </em>He requests that we adopt instead a broader definition of \"security\u201d, one in which risk of loss of the subscriber\u2019s initial value and an expectation of future benefits in excess of that value\u2014 instead of the expectation of financial gain or profit \u2014 are the essential elements. While the <em>\"Howey </em>test\u201d has been applied in New York <em>(see, Matter of Gardner v Lefkowitz, </em>97 Misc 2d 806, 812-813, <em>supra) </em>and remains the accepted rule in most jurisdictions <em>(see, </em>Ann., 47 ALR3d 1375, 1380, 1382), some States have adopted this so-called \"risk capital\u201d test or a version of it <em>(see, e.g., State v Hawaii Mkt. Center, </em>52 Hawaii 642, 485 P2d 105; <em>State ex rel. Healy v Consumer Business Sys., </em>5 Ore App 19, 482 P2d 549; <em>Silver Hills Country Club v Sobieski, </em>55 Cal 2d 811, 361 P2d 906; <em>compare, Jet Set Travel Club v Corporation Commr., </em>21 Ore App 362, 535 P2d 109; <em>contra, Sauve v K.C., Inc., </em>91 Wn 2d 698, 591 P2d 1207; <em>see, </em>Ann., 47 ALR3d 1375, 1382; <em>see generally, </em>Coffey, <em>op. cit, </em>18 W Res L Rev 367).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The circumstances in these cases vary, but there is a common pattern: the \"risk capital\u201d is furnished not in exchange for immediate benefits but to establish a prospective enterprise; some or all of a subscriber\u2019s initial value is at risk if the enterprise fails; and the subscriber\u2019s payment is made in the expectation that he will enjoy the benefits of the enterprise if and when it is successfully completed <em>(see, e.g., Silver Hills Country Club v Sobieski, </em>55 Cal 2d 811, 361 P2d 906, <em>supra, </em>the leading California decision articulating the \"risk capital\u201d test, which involved the sale of founder memberships to finance the construction of a proposed country club where the promoters had invested only $400 for the down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>payment to purchase the land; <em>see also, State v Hawaii Mkt. Center, </em>52 Hawaii 642, 485 P2d 105, <em>supra, </em>applying a \"risk capital\u201d analysis where the promoters of a thinly capitalized corporation engaged in the marketing of \"Founder-Member Purchasing Contract Agreements\u201d to construct and develop a proposed market center).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Special Term concluded that the ASR membership is not a security under the <em>\"Howey </em>test\u201d or the \"investment\u201d definition in <em>Matter of Waldstein </em>(160 Misc 763, <em>supra) </em>and, as noted, we agree. Special Term also \u2014 while remarking that it was not deciding that the \"risk capital\u201d test would be applicable \u2014 found that the ASR memberships could not be securities under that rule either, because the members \"are buying the <em>right to use the existing campgrounds, </em>and are not merely funding a business venture for a developing business.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (127 Misc 2d 145, 148; emphasis added.) Because we agree with Special Term that the memberships could not constitute securities even under a \"risk capital\u201d analysis, we need not decide whether, under other circumstances, the <em>Silver Hills Country Club </em>rule or some variant of it<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> could prove to be a helpful addition to the <em>\"Howey </em>test\u201d and <em>Matter of Waldstein (supra) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>for determining the existence of a security under New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Suffice to say that a \"risk capital\u201d analysis, if used, would not affect the result. The memberships being sold are in an established business which operates several campground resorts in seven different States. A member and his family receive the immediate right to use all existing facilities without charge. Although the initial membership fee is substantial, a prospective member is not induced to join by representations that ASR will provide more or better campgrounds in the future. Indeed, the membership agreement specifies that ASR \"shall be under no obligation to increase the number of resorts\u201d. To be sure, the value of a membership \u2014 purchased in the expectation that the member and his family will for many years enjoy the use of ASR campgrounds \u2014 is not free from risk of loss or diminution. ASR is a young business and, as pointed out by Special Term, a member runs the risk that ASR \"will go out of business due to poor management, embezzlement, etc., a risk which every business of necessity incurs\u201d. But that is not the same as the risk incurred by one who puts up capital for a new enterprise in return not for what he then receives but for what he hopes to receive when the enterprise materializes. <em>(See, Jet Set Travel Club v Corporation Commr., </em>21 Ore App 362, 535 P2d 109, in which the court found this distinction determinative in holding that the \"risk capital\u201d test was not met.)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">We conclude, then, that ASR memberships as described in this record do not fall within any of the statutory categories or within the general definition of securities so as to require registration under General Business Law \u00a7 352-e. The order should, therefore, be reversed, with costs, and the judgment of Special Term reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Meyer, Simons, Kaye, Alexander and Titone concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-9\">. \"Securities\u201d for purposes of compliance with the Martin Act is defined in General Business Law \u00a7 352-e (1) (a). <em>(See, </em>p 87, <em>infra, </em>for pertinent language of the statute.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\">.

In <em>Jet Set Travel Club v Corporation Commr. </em>(21 Ore App 362, 367, 535 P2d 109, 112), the Court of Appeals of Oregon declined to apply the \"risk capital\u201d test which it had adopted in <em>State ex rel. Healy v Consumer Business Sys. </em>(5 Ore App 19, 482 P2d 549), noting that the \"requirements of the 'risk capital\u2019 test are not fulfilled because the benefits of the membership have materialized and have been realized by other members prior to any capital raised by the sale of Oregon memberships.\u201d In <em>Sauve v K.C., Inc. </em>(91 Wn 2d 698, 591 P2d 1207) the Supreme Court of Washington expressly rejected the \"risk capital\u201d test and reaffirmed its adherence to <em>Securities &amp; Exch.

The Appellate Division held that the membership met the literal definition of participation interests under section 352-e (1) (a) relying on <em>People v Development Servs. </em>(92 Misc 2d 759, 761-762). Accordingly, it did not reach the question whether the membership met the general definition of \"securities\u201d and did not refer either to the <em>\"Howey </em>test\u201d or <em>Matter of Waldstein </em>(160 Misc 763). While it did not mention the \"risk capital\u201d test, the Appellate Division did emphasize the size of the initial required payment and that the value of the membership could be lost because of the possibility of ASR\u2019s financial failure. <em>People </em>v <em>Development Servs. (supra), </em>involved the offering and sale of individual lots of real property where the purchasers were required to become members of a homeowners association which would give them a share in the common support and recreational facilities contemplated for a planned community.
