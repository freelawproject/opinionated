The defendant contends that the plaintiff is not entitled to arbitration since the contract required that the plaintiff first obtain a ruling by the architect and also that the claim be presented within a year from the completion of the work. The court ruled that these were questions to be determined by the arbitrators and not by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">Whether the arbitrability of a dispute is a question for the court or for the arbitrators depends upon the language of the contract. The agreement in the present case provided that \u201c[a]ny disagree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>ment arising out of this contract or from the breach thereof shall be submitted to arbitration\u201d. We have consistently held that under such broad and all-embracing language the question of what is subject to arbitration is for the arbitrators themselves. <em>Gores </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>150 Conn. 554, 557, 192 A.2d 210; <em>Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>148 Conn. 192, 196, 198, 169 A.2d 646; <em>International Brotherhood </em>v. <em>Trudon &amp; Platt Motor Lines, Inc., </em>146 Conn. 17, 21, 147 A.2d 484; <em>Liggett </em>v. <em>Torrington Building Co., </em>114 Conn. 425, 430, 158 A. 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
