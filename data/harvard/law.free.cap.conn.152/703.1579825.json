General Statutes \u00a7 53-239. The defendant entered a plea of guilty to simple assault but was tried on the more serious charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">The sole issue on this appeal is whether the evidence was sufficient, beyond a reasonable doubt, to sustain the conviction. To determine this question, it is necessary to review the evidence which has been printed in the appendices in the briefs.

While the state printed no appendix, the defendant did. Prom the testimony of the witnesses and the exhibits, there was sufficient evidence to sustain the court\u2019s conclusion that the assault upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>complaining witness by the defendant was with the intent of forcibly haying sexual relations with her against her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
