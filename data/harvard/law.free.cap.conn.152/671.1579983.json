It owns land on which are reservoirs, distribution systems and watershed areas. It has planted part of its watershed area with orchard and nursery stock. It has sold fruit and other produce from the orchards to the general public at wholesale and retail and has also sold nursery stock and Christmas trees which it had not needed in its own program of conservation and reforestation. General Statutes \u00a7 12-264 imposes a tax on the gross earnings of certain public utility companies, including water companies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the calendar year ending December 31, 1962, the plaintiff filed a return of its gross earnings from all sources except its orchard and nursery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>operations. As to these operations, it reported only net earnings of $5953.83, whereas its gross earnings were in fact $149,732.58. The defendant thereupon sent to the plaintiff a notice of the additional tax computed on the gross earnings from the orchard and nursery operations excluding the gross expenses claimed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff paid the additional tax under protest to avoid the running of interest and appealed from the assessment to the Superior Court. From the judgment dismissing the appeal, the plaintiff has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">A gross earnings tax was originally imposed on water companies in 1915. Public Acts 1915, c. 292, \u00a711 (Rev. 1918, \u00a71370). The statute appeared in substantially its original form in the 1930 Revision of the General Statutes. Rev. 1930, \u00a7 1322. The statute at that time imposed \u201can annual tax upon gross earnings from operations in this state.\u201d We held that the term \u201cgross earnings\u201d as used in the statute meant the entire earnings or receipts. This holding was based on the common meaning of the words read in the light of the prohibition against deductions in the statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>United Electric Light &amp; Water Co., </em>90 Conn. 452, 460, 97 A. 857; <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>131 Conn. 1, 6, 37 A.2d 361. In <em>McLaughlin, </em>we also construed (p. 7) that statute to include within gross earnings earnings from incidental, subordinate and subsidiary operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The statute as it presently exists was not enacted until 1945. Sup. 1945, \u00a7 298h. This section added to the statute the following provision: \u201cGross earnings from operations shall include all income classified as operating revenues by the public utilities commission in the uniform systems of accounts prescribed by said commission . . . .\u201d This is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>language on which the plaintiff rests its ease. The plaintiff looks to the uniform system of accounts and contends that operating revenues as defined in income account 501 include the revenues included in revenue accounts 601-16.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The revenues from the sale of orchard produce and nursery stock is governed by revenue account 615,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which states in part B: \u201cThis account shall be charged with the cost of harvesting, cutting and marketing ice, fruit, crops and similar products.\u201d Thus, the plaintiff argues that its account of the revenues from these operations is brought forth into income account 501 of the uniform system of accounts only as a net figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">This argument is refuted by the language of General Statutes \u00a7 12-264. That statute imposes a tax on gross earnings and provides that gross earnings shall include \u201cincome from nonutility operations.\u201d The only reasonable construction of this language is that it means gross income. The statute itself lists the items which may be deducted in determining gross earnings. None of them is applicable to the situation in the present case. The statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>may not be modified or altered by a regulation of the public utilities commission. Thus, the plaintiff was not entitled to deduct the expenses of its orchard and nursery operations for the purposes of this tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-4\"> \u201cSee. 12-264. tax on gross earnings, return. . . .
