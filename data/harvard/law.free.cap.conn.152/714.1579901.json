With the exception that the public hearing by the defendant on Washington\u2019s birthday followed the public hearing in the <em>Zieky </em>case by two weeks, the facts are so similar as to be almost identical. Both applications were denied at the same executive session. The defendant gave no reasons for denying the plaintiff\u2019s application for a special exception to permit the construction of garden apartments containing seventy-six dwelling units on a 7.2-acre tract in an R-15 zone. And we are unable to glean any facts from the record to sustain the defendant\u2019s action. The trial court was justified in sustaining the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
