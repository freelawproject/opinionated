Another assignment of error questions the failure of the commissioner to rule on the contention that the plaintiff\u2019s condition was aggravated by nonemployment illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The principal issue on appeal is whether the commissioner was justified in finding partial incapacity on the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to her constant pain and stiffness resulting from a \u201cfibrositis syndrome.\u201d The testimony of two doctors who had treated the plaintiff from April, 1959, through January, 1961, supported the fact that she had this condition. There was undisputed evidence that an accidental fall of the plaintiff on the premises of her employer, the named defendant, in April, 1959, caused an incapacity which persisted until June, 1959. There is an indication in the evidence that the insurer allowed a claim for this period of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">A little more than a year after her original injury and subsequent treatment for muscle strain and muscular pain, and after working with some unrelated interruptions between June, 1959, and July, 1960, the plaintiff again complained of severe pain and stillness extending throughout most of her right side. She was given some therapy treatment at this time, but, because of her failure to return to her work as an audit clerk in October, 1960, she was discharged for absenteeism in November, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The defendants do not contest the scope or dura<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>tion of the award if the basis for it exists. They contend that the plaintiff\u2019s testimony about her inability to work more than one day per week, total, is not \u201ccompetent evidence\u201d on which the commissioner could have based his conclusion. They do not question the diagnoses of the two doctors that the plaintiff had in fact been, and was, suffering from the \u201cfibrositis syndrome\u201d through August, 1960. They contest, however, the finding that this condition resulted in the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cpartial incapacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In <em>Zawisza </em>v. <em>Quality Name Plate, Inc., </em>149 Conn. 115, 116, 176 A.2d 578, we said that a compensation award \u201ccannot be based on incompetent evidence.\u201d The main issue in that case was whether the testimony of a physician who had examined the claimant solely for the purposes of testifying before the compensation commissioner was a qualified expert on whose testimony an award could be based. We held that the opinions of experts were to be received and considered as in \u201cother cases generally\u201d but that \u201cthe opinion of a physician which is based wholly or partly on statements and symptoms related to the physician by the patient on a personal examination is inadmissible where the examination was made for the purpose of qualifying the physician to testify as a medical expert.\u201d Id., 119; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Sherwood, </em>74 Conn. 475, 482, 51 A. 526. In the case at bar, the testimony of both Dr. Elliott B. Sweet and Dr. Arnold Goldenberg was based on their reports made at the time of consultation and their diagnoses for the treatment of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Dr. Goldenberg was the first medical expert to testify. He saw the plaintiff on one occasion and diagnosed her condition as fibrositis. In putting his reports before the commissioner, he related extensive examinations that were made upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>person of the plaintiff which indicated severe tenderness in many areas. Dr. Goldenberg also testified to the description of the plaintiff\u2019s discomfort as given to him by the plaintiff. He concluded that, although she was, in his opinion, capable of doing \u201csome type of work,\u201d he did feel that there would be \u201cdays when she wouldn\u2019t be able to go to work.\u201d Dr. Sweet followed Dr. Goldenberg to the stand and agreed with his predecessor\u2019s characterization of the fibrositis syndrome and in greater detail testified to the symptoms of this condition and his treatment of the plaintiff over a period of eighteen months. With regard to the renewed aggravation of the injury in 1960, Dr. Sweet felt that it was possible that a bronchitis condition, which had plagued the plaintiff for many years and an attack of enteritis in July, 1960, could have been the cause for the reappearance of the fibrositis symptoms after a year of apparent dormancy. Although Dr. Sweet felt that the plaintiff should have been back to work on October 15, 1960, at the conclusion of his testimony he did agree that fibrositis could exist in a chronic state. The conclusion of the commissioner, based on conflicting medical opinions, cannot be disturbed. <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Electric Boat Co., </em>142 Conn. 404, 408, 114 A.2d 850; <em>Marschner </em>v. <em>American Hardware Corporation, </em>141 Conn. 742, 746, 110 A.2d 461; <em>Kulak </em>v. <em>Landers, Frary &amp; Clark, </em>120 Conn. 606, 608, 181 A. 720; <em>Zawisza </em>v. <em>Quality Name Plate, Inc., </em>149 Conn. 115, 118, 176 A.2d 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The opinions and testimony of the doctors did not stand alone. The commissioner had the benefit of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, which, in almost every respect, was corroborated by the records and testimony of the doctors. The commissioner was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>to credit the plaintiff\u2019s testimony even absent the degree of corroboration it had from the expert testimony. See <em>Topps </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>149 Conn. 145, 148, 176 A.2d 569. An injury is not excludable as an element of damage \u201cmerely because it is not clinically or objectively demonstrable.\u201d <em>Putney </em>v. <em>Lehigh Truck Equipment Corporation, </em>145 Conn. 731, 732,141 A.2d 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The defendants claim, and the doctors agree, that the disabling injury in this case, or the condition which grew out of it, known as the fibrositis syndrome, is not susceptible to a full and objective clinical exposition. That fact, however, does not make the pain, suffering or disablity resulting from the condition any the less real. Here, at least, there was testimony concerning inflammation of the tissues and observed stiffness. Although the observed symptoms of the disability were not as apparent in 1960 as in 1959, there was no direct contradiction of the plaintiff\u2019s complaints by either doctor, even if the plaintiff\u2019s condition had developed into a psychosomatic one. The commissioner was well within the bounds of his discretion in believing the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to her pain and suffering and her resulting inability to perform work for more than one day a week. Even though a witness may stand alone, the trier is warranted in making an award consistent with the witness\u2019 testimony, if believed. <em>Fengar </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>57 Conn. 60, 65, 17 A. 321. The weight of the evidence is not determined by the number of witnesses for or against any one proposition. <em>Dunbar </em>v. <em>Jones, 87 </em>Conn. 253, 259, 87 A. 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Since this is a workmen\u2019s compensation case, the rules recited above, which have been drawn from opinions in civil personal injury cases, should apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>with equal or greater force in this remedial area of the law. There is an essential distinction between tort and compensation matters which centers on a different view of \u201cfault,\u201d but the proof of damage in both should be regarded with equal liberality. Where, as here, the proof of damage in a workmen\u2019s compensation case meets the requirements of such proof in a civil personal injury case, an award in favor of the plaintiff, based on such proof, is not erroneous. General Statutes \u00a7 31-298; <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Hotel Bond Co., </em>89 Conn. 143, 145, 93 A. 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
