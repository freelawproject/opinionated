Section 4.1.7 of the zoning regulations purports to provide that the subdivision of a tract or parcel of land in a residence R zone for residential development for more than ten dwellings shall be contingent on and subject to a change of zone to residence A A or residence A. Although the regulations are of the permissive type, they make no express provision for a subdivision, whether in an R zone, an AA zone, or an A zone. The plaintiffs filed their application for a change of zone on April 2, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Section 4.1.7, under which the application was made, has been erroneously interpreted by both the plaintiffs and the commission as permitting the subdivision of a tract or parcel of land for residential development for not more than ten dwellings in an R zone and for more than that number in an AA or A zone. The plaintiffs\u2019 claim is that the commission acted illegally, arbitrarily and in abuse of its discretion in denying their application for a change of zone. The sole ground of this claim is that the plaintiffs wished to establish a subdivision of more than ten houses and, therefore, wanted to have their property in an A zone. The plaintiffs argue that the commission\u2019s approval of the requested zone change should have been automatic. As far as appears from the record, this contention was the basis on which the application for a change of zone was presented to the commission. Since there was actually no provision for a subdivision in the regulations, such a presentation furnishes no basis on which this court can conclude that the plaintiffs have sustained their burden of proving that the commission\u2019s action in denying the zone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>change was arbitrary, illegal or in abuse of its discretion. <em>Senior </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>146 Conn. 531, 534, 153 A.2d 415, appeal dismissed, 363 U.S. 143, 80 S.
