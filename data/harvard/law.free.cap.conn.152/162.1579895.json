The plaintiff offered evidence and claimed to have proved that he sustained a fractured jaw and also a fracture of the left arm which resulted in a deformity and a 15 percent permanent partial disability. At the time of the accident the plaintiff was a self-employed carpenter, was forty-three years old and was earning $160 a week. He was out of work for two months as a result of his injuries and incurred medical expenses of $604.50. It was stipulated that the damage to his car required repairs in the sum of $811. Interest thereon to the date of the trial amounted to $296.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The jury returned a verdict of $3000 for the plaintiff which the court did not accept but said: \u201cI think probably, ladies and gentlemen, I might send you back to reconsider. If you resolved the question of liability in favor of the plaintiff, I think it might be on the low side. The property damage comes to \u2014 I think it\u2019s $1107. If you found liability in this case . . . then you awarded damages of $1893 for personal injury \u2014 I think actually you might \u2014 I would like to have you go back and reconsider the verdict under the statute, if you will. That doesn\u2019t mean that you have to change your minds in the case, but I would like to have you go back and you may deliberate and then come in again.\u201d The jury retired and after further deliberation returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $7500, which the court accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The defendant assigns error in the court\u2019s refusal to grant his motion for a mistrial on the ground of improper argument. There was no request by either counsel to record the arguments, and so the exact words spoken are not known. The defendant\u2019s counsel claimed that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel had \u201cgone right into\u201d insurance in his argument; that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>stated in so many words that there are some jurors who feel that plaintiffs are fakers trying to bilk insurance companies, and that he referred to insurance repeatedly. The court intervened to say: \u201cHe was stopped the moment you made the motion.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel replied: \u201cBut he had gone into it.\u201d The court said: \u201cHe said that some jurors think insurance companies are being bilked. Now, what else was there?\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel replied: \u201cHe said insurance is in this picture, but I didn\u2019t want to bring it in, but Mr. Wilson [the defendant] brought it in, and he said they should not be moved by the fact that insurance is in the case.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel also said: \u201cI think the argument has been very inflammatory and prejudicial. . . . That\u2019s improper argument.\u201d The court submitted the case to the jury and in its charge informed them that insurance had absolutely nothing to do with the case, that counsel had mentioned it in argument and was stopped and admonished, and that they, the jury, were also then instructed to pay no attention whatsoever to any argument about insurance \u2014 as to payment of insurance claims \u2014 or anything of that nature whatsoever, that under our jurisprudence they were to decide the facts in the case solely on the evidence which had been offered in the courtroom, and that they were to apply the law given to them by the court to those facts in reaching a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The time when the mere mention of insurance before a jury in the trial of a negligence case automatically called for a mistrial has long since passed. See <em>Antel </em>v. <em>Poli, </em>100 Conn. 64, 75, 123 A. 272; <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Zavaritis, </em>95 Conn. 111, 115,110 A. 878; Segal, \u201c \u2018Insurance\u2019 \u2014 a Nasty Word,\u201d 31 Conn. B. J. 87, 100. A deliberate attempt by counsel to create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>a prejudice in the minds of the jury, however, is another matter and may justify the trial court in granting a motion for a mistrial as a punitive measure. <em>Furber </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>117 Conn. 478, 481, 169 A. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The trial court is invested with a large discretion with regard to arguments of counsel, and we should interfere only where that discretion was clearly exceeded or abused to the manifest injury of some party. <em>Cascella </em>v. <em>Jay James Camera Shop, Inc., </em>147 Conn. 337, 343, 160 A.2d 899; <em>James </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>83 Conn. 702, 706, 78 A. 420. The discretion should be exercised most carefully. Here, the jury\u2019s first verdict in the amount of $3000, which the court considered \u201cmight be on the low side\u201d indicated that the jury had not been prejudiced in favor of the plaintiff by his counsel\u2019s grossly improper argument. The court\u2019s instructions were proper, restrained and apparently effective in producing a just result. Under the circumstances, the verdict, in view of the jury\u2019s reconsideration and the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to set it aside, the reasons for which were set forth in a carefully prepared memorandum, should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The other errors assigned require little discussion. The paragraphs sought to be added to the finding would have added nothing material to it. The admission of three of the plaintiff\u2019s exhibits for the limited purposes stated was not erroneous. The case of <em>Stephanofsky </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>136 Conn. 379, 384, 71 A.2d 560, does not support the defendant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
