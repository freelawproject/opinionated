Gorsuch, U.S. Circuit Judge for the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b88-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-16\">Isaac Grillo appeals the district court\u2019s grant of the California Department of Corrections\u2019 (\u201cCDC\u2019s\u201d) Motion to Dismiss. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 over those claims not barred by the Eleventh Amendment. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-17\">As an initial matter, Dr. Norcross is not a proper party to this appeal. Grillo filed a voluntary motion to dismiss Dr. Norcross without prejudice, which the district court granted. This is not an appealable order. <em>Concha v. London, </em>62 F.3d 1493, 1507 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-18\">Next, we must decide whether we have jurisdiction over any of Grillo\u2019s claims against CDC and the California Medical Board (\u201cCMB\u201d), or whether they are barred by sovereign immunity. Grillo has not appealed the district court\u2019s finding that his claims for unlawful retaliation in violation of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 551.90 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997 <em>et seq., </em>and for violation of Equal Contracting Rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, are barred by sovereign immunity. Accordingly, we need not address these claims and leave the district court\u2019s ruling undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-19\">Instead, Grillo confines his Eleventh Amendment arguments to his remaining claims against CDC: discrimination and wrongful termination in violation of Title VI and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Congress has abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to Title VI and Title VII claims. <em>See, e.g., Alexander v. Sandoval, </em>532 U.S. 275, 280, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001); <em>Cholla Ready Mix, Inc. v. Civish, </em>382 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Cerrato v. San Francisco Community College Dist., </em>26 F.3d 968, 976 (9th Cir.1994); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-7. Therefore, we have jurisdiction to review these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">We find that Grillo\u2019s Title VI and Title VII claims are precluded by the 2002 Settlement Agreement between Grillo and CDC. This agreement covers all conduct prior to 2002.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Whether or not it covers future conduct is irrelevant, since Grillo\u2019s only post-2002 claim against CDC is for unlawful termination. This claim fails because it was CMB, and not CDC, that required Grillo to attend the PACE program and that revoked Grillo\u2019s license. Once he was no longer licensed, CDC could not lawfully employ him; thus, his termination was not unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b88-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-21\">. Grillo\u2019s First Amended Complaint alleges claims under Titles VI and VII against CDC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>only, and not CMB.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-26\">. Grillo has failed to allege facts sufficient to support a claim for fraudulent inducement; thus, the Agreement is valid and enforceable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
