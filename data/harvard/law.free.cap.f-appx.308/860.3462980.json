Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). The decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is discretionary, and we review the denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Moore based his motion on the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s adoption of Amendment 706, which modified the sentencing ranges applicable to crack cocaine offenses to reduce the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine sentences. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>Supp. to Appendix C, Amendment 706, p. 226-31 (Nov. 1, 2007) (amending U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)). Moore argues that the sentencing court erred in sentencing him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and that in the light of Amendment 706, he was eligible for a reduction in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">Moore has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to reduce his sentence. A reduction in Moore\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 pursuant to Amendment 706 would not affect his guidelines range of imprisonment, because the guidelines range was calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1. Because Moore\u2019s guidelines range of imprisonment was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, Moore was not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). To the extent that Moore argues that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in the light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the argument is unavailing because <em>Booker </em>was not \u201cbased on a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines.\u201d <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Moore\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b884-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
