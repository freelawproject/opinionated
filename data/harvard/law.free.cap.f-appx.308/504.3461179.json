Weis-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>el pretermitting his application for asylum and denying his application for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Ahmed Anisur Rahman, </em>No. A96 426 104 (B.I.A. Mar. 4, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 426 104 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 28, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao v. BIA </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">We are without jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s findings with respect to the untimeliness of Rahman\u2019s asylum application because Rahman contests only \u201cthe correctness of the [agency\u2019s] factual findings or justification for the discretionary choices\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (D). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006). We are also without jurisdiction to consider any argument regarding CAT relief because Rahman did not challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of that claim before the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, to the extent Rahman challenges the agency\u2019s pretermission of his asylum application and denial of his CAT claim, we dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Regarding Rahman\u2019s withholding of removal claim, we conclude that the agency\u2019s determination that he failed to establish a nexus between his persecution and a protected ground is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). Rahman argues that he was threatened by Mostaque Hossain, his contact at Stylecraft, a client organization, because of his \u201cwillingness to combat the governing party\u2019s corruption.\u201d We have been directed to, and have ourselves found, no support for this contention in the record. Although an individuals attempt to oppose a government\u2019s economic practices can constitute political opinion, Osorio <em>v. INS, </em>18 F.3d 1017, 1029 (2d Cir.1994), there was no indication that Rahman was fighting government corruption or that Hossain was motivated by anything other than his personal gain, <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cThe applicant must also show, through direct or circumstantial evidence, that the persecutor\u2019s motive to persecute arises from the applicant\u2019s political belief.\u201d) (citing <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). Rahman testified that he and Hossain had a deal whereby he agreed to pay Hossain 10% of payments owed by Stylecraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">Rahman argues that the Bangladeshi government was \u201cclearly involved in the threats to [Rahman].\u201d The agency properly found that there is no support for this in the record. Such government involvement is generally required for such actions to serve as a basis for withholding of removal. <em>Delgado v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 702, 709 n. 5 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 342 (2d Cir.2006). Rahman testified that Style-craft was a government industry and that the Bangladesh government was unwilling to control Stylecraft because Stylecraft conducted import/export business. Hos-sain was not, however, a government official. There was no evidence that the government directed, condoned, or was even aware that Hossain was extorting money from Rahman.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Rahman also argues that the IJ erred in giving minimal consideration to the documentary evidence that he submitted. This Court does not require the agency to provide a detailed analysis of each aspect of a petitioner\u2019s documentary evidence and background materials. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d at 338 n. 17; <em>Guan Shan Liao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 68 (2d Cir.2002). Here, in addition to referencing the original and supplemental asylum applications, the IJ specifically referenced other documentary evidence, such as the country report and a letter from Rahman\u2019s parents. There was no evidence compelling a finding that Hossain\u2019s actions towards Rah-man were motivated by Rahman\u2019s political opinion or other protected ground. In this vein, there is no indication that the agency did not consider this evidence in reaching its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Because Rahman failed to establish a nexus between a statutorily protected ground and the alleged harm that he suffered in Bangladesh, the agency reasonably found that he failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution under the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part. Having completed our review, we DENY petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
