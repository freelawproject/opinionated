Defendants moved for summary judgment, which was granted by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Gleeson, J.). The District Court found, <em>inter alia, </em>that summary judgment was appropriate on Gathers\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim because the search was reasonably related to Ruiz\u2019s performance of his duties as a parole officer, and that Gathers\u2019s claims regarding false arrest and malicious prosecution required Gathers to prove that there was no probable cause for his arrest, which he could not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-24\">Having thoroughly reviewed the record and all of Gathers\u2019s claims, we find those claims to be meritless for substantially the reasons stated by the District Court. Accordingly, we AFFIRM its decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
