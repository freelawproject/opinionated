Jan. 11, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that such motions are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322-23, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-15\">As we recently held in <em>Yuen Jin v. Mukasey, </em>section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii), requires that any successive asylum application be filed in conjunction with a motion to reopen. <em>See </em>538 F.3d 143, 156-57 (2d Cir.2008). If the application is filed more than ninety days after a final order of removal is entered, the motion to reopen must be based on changed country conditions. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>see also Matter of C-W-L-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 346, 353 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-18\">Because Li\u2019s involvement in the Chinese Democracy Party was a change in personal circumstances, and because she failed to establish changed circumstances arising in China, <em>see Wei Guang Wang v. BIA </em>437 F.3d 270 (2d Cir.2006), we find the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Li\u2019s successive asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-19\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
