The district court sentenced Brown as a career offender to a 262-month sentence, the bottom of the advisory sentencing guideline range. Brown\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), suggesting that counsel, who represented Brown in the district court, provided ineffective assistance. Appellate counsel states, however, that, in her view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Brown was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-22\">Appellate counsel asserts that counsel below provided ineffective assistance by failing to inform Brown that he was subject to a twenty-year mandatory minimum sentence and could be sentenced as a career offender. This court, however, \u201cmay address [claims of ineffective assistance] on direct appeal only if the lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears from the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.2006). We find that Brown has failed to meet this high standard and, therefore, decline to review this claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-23\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
