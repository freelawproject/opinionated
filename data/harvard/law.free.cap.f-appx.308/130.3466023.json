Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. The BIA relied in part on the IJ\u2019s decision, so we review the BIA\u2019s decision and \u201clook to the IJ\u2019s oral decision as a guide to what lay behind the BIA\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Keisler, </em>504 F.3d 1183, 1191 (9th Cir.2007). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-19\">We review for substantial evidence the denial of asylum. <em>See Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000). Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Siquina Cacatzum did not establish that guerillas forcibly recruited him on account of his actual or imputed political opinion. Siquina Cacatzum merely speculated that guerillas might have persecuted him because his brother had been in the Guatemalan military, but he offered no evidence linking the guerillas\u2019 recruitment to his brother\u2019s military service or Siquina Cacatzum\u2019s perceived or actual support of the Guatemalan military. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1094-95 (9th Cir.2002). Substantial evidence also demonstrates that Siquina Cacatzum would not suffer future persecution because no evidence suggested that guerillas still sought him after his lengthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>absence and conditions had improved enough that he would not be subject to persecution if he returned. <em>See Molina-Estrada, </em>293 F.3d at 1095-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Because Siquina Cacatzum did not establish eligibility for asylum, he cannot demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Siquina Cacatzum also abandoned his claim for CAT relief by failing to raise it in his opening brief. <em>Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that Siquina Cacatzum failed to show that his daughter would suffer \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d if Siquina Cacatzum were removed. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 891 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b155-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
