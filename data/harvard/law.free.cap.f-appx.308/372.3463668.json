On appeal, Sims argues that he is not automatically ineligible for the reduction based on the district court\u2019s finding at the original sentencing that the offense involved more than 15 kilograms of crack cocaine. Sims also argues that his sentence is above the statutory maximum allowable based upon the jury\u2019s verdict, in violation of <em>Apprendi.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Sims also asserts that the district court should have rejected the Commission\u2019s policy statement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 because it is inconsistent with the \u00a7 3553(a)(2) sentencing purposes and the rationale behind Amendment 706. Finally, Sims argues that the policy statement violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses based on the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings in <em>Apprendi, Booker</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and may be rejected under <em>Kimbrough</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>because the guidelines are not tied to empirical data.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-16\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>ant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction in the term of imprisonment is not consistent with the Guidelines policy statement, and therefore not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), if \u201can amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">I. Drug Quantity</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Amendment 706, which is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c), was made retroactive by Amendment 713. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). Amendment 706 reduced offense levels in certain crack cocaine cases by two levels, as reflected in the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">We have held that a defendant who was accountable for 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706 because his base offense level remained at 38 and his guideline range was not reduced. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366,---, slip op. at 443\u201414 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">Because the record demonstrates that Sims was held responsible at the original sentencing for over 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, Amendment 706 did not reduce his guideline range. <em>See Jones, </em>548 F.3d at---, slip op. at 443-44. Consequently, we conclude that the district court did not err by denying Sims\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">II. Sentence Reduction under <em>Apprendi, Booker, Kimbrough, </em>and \u00a7 3553(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 258-260, 125 S.Ct. at 764-65. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court held that a district court could consider the crack cocaine/powder cocaine disparity in considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at sentencing. <em>Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 575. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Court held that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable. <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001) (in the context of collateral review).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-16\">A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce a sentence does not provide the basis for <em>de novo </em>resentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir. 2000). A district court should leave intact its previous factual decisions from the sentencing hearing when deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-18\">Because <em>Booker </em>is not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment, it is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. Moreover, in <em>Jones </em>we explicitly rejected an argument, from a defendant who was ineligible for the reduction because of the amount of cocaine, that the district court nevertheless had the authority to reduce his sentence under <em>Booker. Jones, </em>548 F.3d at---, slip op. at 443\u201414.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-20\">Because the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings were limited in scope, we conclude that the district court properly declined to revisit the determination that Sims was responsible for 15 kilograms of crack cocaine. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>Cothran, </em>106 F.3d at 1563; <em>see also Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781-82. Additionally, because <em>Apprendi, Booker, Kimbrough, </em>and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors do not provide an independent basis for reconsideration of a defendant\u2019s sentence, we conclude that the district court did not err in rejecting Sims\u2019s argument that he was still eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. Consequently, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Sims\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-12\">. <em>Apprendi v.
