We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the procedural history of this case, and the scope of the issues presented by this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Even assuming that evidence procured pursuant to an initial search \u2014 including Shaik\u2019s signed affidavit admitting that he had never worked on a farm, but had paid someone for fraudulent papers certifying that he had worked on a farm \u2014 was inadmissible, the Immigration Judge did not err in concluding that Shaik did not testify credibly at trial in support of his claim of having worked on a farm. As the Immigration Judge concluded, Shaik \u201cprovided almost no details about the alleged work\u201d and \u201cwas unable to give any details about the location of the farm.\u201d Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the agency\u2019s conclusions were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review of the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals is hereby DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
