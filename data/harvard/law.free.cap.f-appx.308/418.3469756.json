The class the Plaintiffs seek to represent consists of amateur athletes who have had their 1-140 applications (filed under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103) denied or revoked, and amateur athletes whose \u00a7 1103 applications the Defendants threaten to revoke. The Second Amended Complaint (the version of the complaint the district court addressed) alleges that this action was filed \u201cto compel the defendants to adjudicate\u201d their petitions. (R.2-35 at 1.) It is clear from the complaint, however, that what Plaintiffs seek is a <em>favorable </em>adjudication. The complaint does not allege that the Defendants have failed to act, or that there has been unreasonable delay in action on the applications. What is complained of is denial of applications, revocation of applications and threats to revoke applications.</p>\n<p id=\"A4B\">The Second Amended Complaint asserts jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329 (the INA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (the mandamus statute), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (federal question jurisdiction), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 555(b) (the Administrative Procedure Act), and supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-16\">The Defendants moved to dismiss, asserting that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The Plaintiffs\u2019 response did not address the Defendants\u2019 jurisdictional arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-17\">The district court granted the motion to dismiss. (R.2-35 at 1-5.) The court concluded that none of the grounds for subject matter jurisdiction alleged in the complaint supported the Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Additionally, the court held that the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of the INA contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) bar judicial review of discretionary decisions made under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151-1378 of the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-18\">The district court\u2019s order (R.2-35 at 1-5) carefully considered each of the bases for jurisdiction in the district court alleged by the Plaintiffs, and correctly concluded that none of them supported jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions to deny visas to aliens of extraordinary ability in the field of athletics under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b)(1)(A) or to review revocations of such visas under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1155.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-19\">The district court carefully concluded that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, the mandamus statute, provides no basis for jurisdiction because the action complained of is discretionary. (R.2-35 at 4.) The court could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>have also bottomed this conclusion on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), which explicitly strips the district court of jurisdiction under the mandamus statute. The jurisdiction-stripping statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\">(B) Denials of discretionary relief</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of Title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, and except as provided in subparagraph (D), and regardless of whether the judgment, decision, or action is made in removal proceedings, no court shall have jurisdiction to review\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">(ii) any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchap-ter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, other than the granting of relief under section 1158(a) of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). The phrase \u201cthis subchapter\u201d includes 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153(b)(1)(A) and 1155.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The district court\u2019s dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
