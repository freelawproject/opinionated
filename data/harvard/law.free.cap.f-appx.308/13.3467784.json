After finding that Morin had testified falsely at a suppression hearing, the district court applied a two-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement to Morin\u2019s offense level, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, and imposed a prison term of 90 months, seven months shorter than the low end of the guidelines range of 97 to 121 months. Morin appeals, but his appointed counsel now seeks to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), because he cannot discern a nonfrivolous issue to pursue. We invited Morin to comment on counsel\u2019s motion, <em>see </em>C\u00ede. R. 51(b), but he did not respond, so we review only the potential issues identified in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Counsel first informs us that Morin does not wish to withdraw his guilty plea, so counsel properly avoids discussing whether Morin could challenge the voluntariness of the plea. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 671 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Counsel next considers whether Morin could challenge the two-level upward adjustment for obstruction of justice. A district court may increase a defendant\u2019s offense level if it finds that the defendant obstructed or attempted to obstruct justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the offense of conviction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Providing materially false information to a judge is one example of obstructive behavior. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n. 4(f). We would review for clear error a finding that a defendant has obstructed justice and would overturn it only if we have \u201ca definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Dale, </em>498 F.3d 604, 608 (7th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks- and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The basis for the obstruction-of-justice increase was Morin\u2019s testimony at a suppression hearing that he repeatedly requested an attorney during questioning by FBI agents. But contrary testimony from the FBI agents and from Morin\u2019s girlfriend, who testified that she heard him ask only \u201cDo I need a lawyer?\u201d, led the district court to doubt Morin\u2019s assertion. And because Morin later met voluntarily with the agents alone at a nearby firehouse, passing up the chance to call for an attorney first, the district court concluded that his testimony was implausible. Although a different fact-finder might have concluded otherwise, the district court was in the best position to assess the witnesses\u2019 credibility, and any contention that the district court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous would be frivolous. Furthermore, because Morin offered this false testimony to the judge in an effort to suppress incriminating evidence against him and avoid guilt, it was material. <em>See United States v. Stokes, </em>211 F.3d 1039, 1045-46 (7th Cir. 2000). Accordingly, we agree with counsel that it would be frivolous to challenge the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">We also agree that any challenge to Morin\u2019s 90-month sentence, which was below the low end of the guidelines range, would be frivolous. A below-guidelines sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Liddell, </em>543 F.3d 877, 885 (7th Cir.2008). Moreover, the district court gave meaningful consideration to the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the gravity of the drug problem in Morin\u2019s community, Morin\u2019s criminal and employment histories, and his devotion to his family. Counsel is unable to articulate any basis for rebutting the presumption that the resulting sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
