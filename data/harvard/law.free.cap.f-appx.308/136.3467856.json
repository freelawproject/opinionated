Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Because the BIA adopted \u201cthe decision of the IJ, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were that of the BIA.\u201d <em>Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1039-41 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The BIA dismissed Francisco-Juan\u2019s asylum petition as untimely. We lack jurisdiction to review Francisco-Juan\u2019s claim that deteriorating conditions in Guatemala constitute \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d that would excuse her delay because it turns on disputed facts. <em>See Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 650 (9th Cir.2007) (per cu-riam). We also lack jurisdiction to review Francisco-Juan\u2019s claim that her inability to find an Kanjobal translator in Nebraska constitutes an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d because it turns on disputed facts. <em>See Dhital v. Mukasey, </em>532 F.3d 1044, 1049 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Husyev v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir.2008). We reject Francisco-Juan\u2019s claim that ignorance of the law is an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d that would excuse her delay. <em>See Antonio-Martinez v. INS, </em>317 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2003). We therefore dismiss Francisco-Juan\u2019s petition seeking review the BIA\u2019s denial of her asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal, <em>see Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000), and CAT relief, <em>see Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1070 (9th Cir.2008). Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that, at most, Francisco-Juan was subject to forcible recruitment by guerillas in Guatemala, and was not targeted because of her status as a Kanjobal Indian. <em>Silaya, </em>524 F.3d at 1070; <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Substantial evidence also supports the conclusion that Francisco-Juan could relocate to Guatemala City without facing persecution because she admitted that conditions were better in the cities and she would only be \u201cinconvenienced\u201d by relocating. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(ii). We therefore uphold the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Francisco-Juan\u2019s testimony that \u201csomething might happen\u201d to her if she were to return to Guatemala falls well short of establishing that she will \u201cmore likely than not\u201d be tortured upon return. <em>See Dhital, </em>532 F.3d at 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b160-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\">. We need not reach the agency\u2019s conclusion that Francisco-Juan failed to show that Kan-jobal Indians constitute a particular social group.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
