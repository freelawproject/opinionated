Because the BIA relied on the IJ\u2019s decision, we may review the IJ\u2019s factual findings and conclusions. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). We will uphold the BIA\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Ozde-mir v. INS, </em>46 F.3d 6, 7 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">Chen argues that the IJ erred in relying on a consular investigative report that determined that a subpoena ordering Chen\u2019s appearance in court for a violation of the one-child policy was fabricated. The subpoena was submitted to Chinese officials to verify its authenticity. Chen argues that the report did not provide detailed information about the investigation and that the officials could have deemed the subpoena fraudulent to frustrate his asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">The subpoena pertained to the coercive family planning measures practiced in the People\u2019s Republic of China, which are commonly relied upon as a basis for an asylum application. A person who is forced to undergo involuntary sterilization \u201cshall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(1), 1101(a)(42). To obtain eligibility for relief, the spouse of a person who is forced to undergo sterilization must show that he has suffered past persecution or has a well founded fear of future persecution on account of his resistance to the coercive population control program. <em>See Matter of J-S, </em>24 I &amp; N Dec. 520, 542 (BIA 2008); <em>Shi Liang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 309-10 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">The Chinese government could have inferred that, in seeking authentication of the subpoena, Chen was seeking asylum based on the forced sterilization policy. The report did not provide sufficient detailed information for a determination of its reliability. It did not reveal the names or positions of the individuals who performed the investigation or what steps were taken to determine that the document was fabricated. There is no indication that the person who prepared the report had any personal knowledge of what had occurred during the investigation. The report that the document was fabricated was not sufficiently reliable to support the adverse credibility finding that admittedly went to the heart of Chen\u2019s claim. <em>See Lin v. U.S. Department of Justice, </em>459 F.3d 255, 268, 270-72 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-16\">Chen argues that the IJ\u2019s other adverse credibility findings should not have been relied upon in denying his claims. Chen contends that he provided specific facts to prove his refugee status and that trivial inconsistencies and omissions in his testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>mony should not result in an adverse credibility finding. Although we will not ordinarily review credibility findings, we will not uphold findings unsupported by the record or based on pure speculation or conjecture. <em>Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 410 (5th Cir.2006). An adverse credibility determination still \u201cmust be supported by specific and cogent reasons derived from the record.\u201d <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">The IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s heavy reliance on the absence of testimony from family members living in the United States is misplaced, because there was no evidence that these individuals had personal knowledge of the forced sterilization of Chen\u2019s wife or of Chen\u2019s confinement suffered as a result of violating the one-child policy. The BIA did not appear to consider Chen\u2019s wife\u2019s affidavit stating that she was forced to undergo sterilization and that her husband was incarcerated for violating the one-child policy. The IJ and the BIA ignored the IJ\u2019s determination that Chen\u2019s testimony on the essential facts supporting his claim was consistent. The BIA\u2019s decision must reflect a meaningful consideration of the relevant substantial evidence supporting an alien\u2019s claim. <em>Abdel-Masieh v. U.S. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 585 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The IJ\u2019s suspicion that the Chen family came to the United States for economic reasons only was not based on record evidence and thus did not constitute substantial evidence. <em>Mwembie, </em>443 F.3d at 410. The finding that Chen gave inconsistent testimony about whether he or his sister had personally received some documents from a courier addressed a trivial matter that had no bearing on the issues. In light of the questionable reliability of the report that the subpoena issued to Chen was fabricated and of the fact that the inconsistencies relied on by the IJ and BIA were not central to the asylum claim, the BIA\u2019s determination that Chen was not entitled to asylum is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Lin, </em>459 F.3d at 268-72; <em>Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Chen claims that the IJ\u2019s ruling on the CAT claim was erroneous because the IJ relied solely on the denial of his asylum claim. To succeed on this claim, Chen \u201cmust meet his burden of showing that more likely than not he would be subjected to \u2018torture\u2019 upon his return.\u201d <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 354 (5th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). Chen testified that he feared being returned to jail or being compelled to pay more fines if he is returned to the People\u2019s Republic of China. He did not present any evidence that he would be subjected to an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1), (2). Even assuming that he is entitled to asylum, there was substantial evidence to support the denial of the CAT claim. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">In his brief, Chen has not addressed the denial of his eligibility for withholding of removal. Thus, he has abandoned that claim on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Chen argues that the United States Government breached the confidentiality owed to an asylum applicant when it submitted the document to the Chinese government. Chen did not make this argument in his appeal to the BIA. This court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies. <em>Arce-Vences v. Mukasey, </em>512 F.3d 167, 172 (5th Cir.2007). This claim is not subject to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">Chen contends that the IJ and BIA erred in finding that his asylum petition was untimely filed. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158, an alien seeking asylum must file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>an application for asylum within one year of his arrival in the United States, absent a showing of \u201cchanged circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the [one-year] period.\u201d \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (D). Neither the IJ nor the BIA addressed the timeliness of Chen\u2019s asylum application in their second decisions. This court cannot review issues that have not been addressed by the administrative agency. <em>Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 196 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The case is remanded to the BIA for consideration of the timeliness of the asylum application. If exceptional circumstances are found that justified the late filing, the asylum claim should be reconsidered, including the evidence of Zhang\u2019s affidavit and the subpoena notice. The BIA should also take into consideration <em>MATTER OF J-S, </em>24 I &amp; N Dec. 520, 542 (BIA 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b810-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
