Retaliation</p>\n<p id=\"b349-17\">Beal asserts that she was retaliated against when Randstad: (1) barred her from future work assignments; (2) impeded her ability to find work in Jacksonville, Florida; (3) interfered with her unemployment benefits; and, (4) aided in her termination from Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-18\">Title VII prohibits retaliation in employment and provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-19\">It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of [its] employees ... because [the employee] has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because [s]he has made a charge, testified, as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>sisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u201cTo establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that (l)[s]he engaged in statutorily protected expression; (2)[s]he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there is some causal relation between the two events.\u201d <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Regarding the causal link, \u201ca plaintiff merely has to prove that the protected activity and the negative employment action are not completely unrelated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Once the plaintiff has met her burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, the employer then has an opportunity to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment action. <em>Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 976 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Here, Beal acknowledged in her deposition that she never reported the harassment that she allegedly experienced at CSX to Randstad. She further testified that she did not complain to CSX, either verbally or in writing, of either sexual or racial harassment until after her assignment there ended. Therefore, Beal\u2019s claim that she was retaliated against after complaining about harassment is without merit, given that she has admitted that she never made any such complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Beal failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation because she did not demonstrate that Randstad was aware of her protected activity at the time it allegedly retaliated against her. The district court therefore did not err in granting summary judgment to Randstad as to Beal\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">II. Failure to Hire</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">Beal contends that she was qualified for at least one of the more than 20 positions for which she applied at CSX. However, she asserts that CSX either abolished the positions for which she was qualified or filled those positions with Caucasian candidates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">Title VII prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of a number of characteristics, including race and gender. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). Because Beal is alleging a failure to hire claim, she must show that: (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she applied for and was qualified for an available position; (3) she was rejected; and, (4) the defendant filled the position with a person outside of her protected class. <em>Walker v. Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>286 F.3d 1270, 1274-75 (11th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). Once a plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case, \u201cthe burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for his adverse action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1274. When the defendant articulates such a reason, \u201cthe presumption of discrimination is eliminated, and the plaintiff must submit evidence showing that the articulated reason is pretextual.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">Although Beal satisfies the first prong of test, as she is a member of a protected class, she has not presented evidence demonstrating that she was qualified for the positions for which she applied. Additionally, Beal has not demonstrated that CSX filled the positions for which she applied with individuals outside of her protected class. In fact, she acknowledged that she knew nothing about how, why, or by whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the positions were filled. Furthermore, CSX provided a non-discriminatory reason why each other candidate was selected. Thus, Beal failed to establish a <em>prima fade </em>case of sex or race discrimination based on failure to hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">III. Order to Pay Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Finally, Beal argues that the district court erred by not granting her relief from court costs. She alleges that she is being punished for exercising her constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\u201cThis court will not disturb an award of costs unless a clear abuse of discretion is demonstrated.\u201d <em>Manor Healthcare Corp. v. Lomelo, </em>929 F.2d 633, 639 (11th Cir. 1991) (citation omitted). \u201c[T]he proper inquiry is not how the reviewing court would have ruled if it had been considering the case in the first place, but whether the premise upon which the district court exercised its discretion was correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1) provides that, \u201c[u]nless a federal statute, these rules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs \u2014 other than attorney\u2019s fees\u2014 should be allowed to the prevailing party.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Here, Beal has neither alleged nor demonstrated how the district court abused its discretion in ordering that she be taxed costs. The district court properly awarded costs to the prevailing party and taxed Beal only the court costs, not including attorney\u2019s fees. Thus, the district court has not abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-13\">. Beal failed to address the following claims in her initial brief on appeal: (1) the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to alter or amend judgment; (2) the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to defendants on her slander claim; and, (3) the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Randstad on her racial and sexual discrimination claims. Therefore, she has abandoned these claims. <em>APA Excelsior III L.P. v. Premiere Techs., Inc., </em>476 F.3d 1261, 1269-70 (11th Cir.2007) (issues raised only in passing in an initial brief are abandoned); <em>Lovett v. Ray, </em>327 F.3d 1181, 1183 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (issues raised for the first time in a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s reply brief are abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\">. Beal also asserts that CSX was motivated not to hire her so that Howard Elliott, Vice President of Public Safety, could take possession of her Journey Track program for CSX\u2019s own use. This claim is not actionable under Title VII. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
