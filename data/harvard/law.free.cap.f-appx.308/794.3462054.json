The district court sentenced Gonzalez to 18 months imprisonment. As part of his plea agreement, Gonzalez preserved his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence. Gonzalez now appeals that denial. He contends that a Texas state trooper\u2019s prolonged roadside questioning following a traffic stop constituted an unconstitutional seizure. Gonzalez claims that, because of that unlawful <em>seizure, </em>his subsequent consent to a search of his vehicle was not voluntary, making the ensuing <em>search </em>unconstitutional and the evidence resulting from it subject to suppression under the exclusionary rule. Following a review of all of the circumstances surrounding Gonzalez\u2019s traffic stop, we hold that the search was legal because it was made after Gonzalez gave free and voluntary consent to the search. As we find that the consent was freely and voluntarily given, we need not decide whether Gonzalez\u2019s preceding detention for questioning by the Texas trooper was unconstitutional. We therefore affirm the denial of Gonzalez\u2019s suppression motion, albeit on reasoning somewhat different from that of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-15\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b819-16\">Late one afternoon in April 2006, Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper Joseph Hogue pulled Roberto Gonzalez over to the side of Interstate 30 in Titus County, Texas, after seeing Gonzalez\u2019s car swerve into the left (passing) lane, nearly hitting a car in the process before returning to the right lane. Once his patrol car and Gonzalez\u2019s car were parked on the shoulder, Trooper Hogue approached the passenger side of Gonzalez\u2019s car and leaned his arms on the sill of the open passenger-side window to converse with Gonzalez (We assume Hogue went to the passenger side because Gonzalez had stopped so close to the active right lane of the highway that speaking to him from the driver\u2019s side could have been dangerous to the officer). Hogue told Gonzalez the reason for the stop and asked for his driver\u2019s license and proof of insurance. (The entire encounter was recorded by the video camera in Hogue\u2019s patrol car. Although Hogue can be heard clearly throughout, Gonzalez can only be heard intermittently, because of the traffic noise and his distance from the microphone worn by Ho-gue).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-17\">When Gonzalez reached into his glove compartment to produce his insurance document, Hogue noticed a piece of paper with handwritten notes on it. Gonzalez appears to have rapidly covered it, but this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>cannot be seen on the videotape.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gonzalez\u2019s quick hand movement seems to have sparked Hogue\u2019s suspicion that Gonzalez wanted to hide what was on the paper, prompting Hogue to ask Gonzalez what the paper contained. Gonzalez responded that he had written down where and when he had refueled the car. Hogue asked Gonzalez a series of questions during this encounter, most having to do with how long Gonzalez had been driving, where he was heading, and, repeatedly, the purpose of the writing on the paper. After about three minutes of questioning, Hogue told Gonzalez he would issue a warning ticket for the driving infraction. The trooper went to his patrol car for a few minutes, then returned to Gonzalez\u2019s car to return Gonzalez\u2019s driver\u2019s license and hand him the written warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Again leaning on the windowsill, Hogue began a further inquiry into Gonzalez\u2019s travel plans, albeit unrelated to the reason for the stop.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gonzalez mentioned that he was going to see his aunt, and, after a dozen or so other questions, Hogue asked Gonzalez if he had any luggage with him. Gonzalez replied that he did, whereupon Hogue asked several times if it was in the trunk. Gonzalez then offered to show Ho-gue the luggage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was not until his inspection of the luggage \u2014 and, presumably, the visible interior of the trunk\u2014 turned up nothing that the trooper asked Gonzalez if he could search the car. Gonzalez, who speaks in somewhat broken English throughout, said he did not understand the question. Hogue repeated it once in English and then again in Spanish: Hogue asked \u201cno problema?\u201d Gonzalez responded \u201cno, no problem.\u201d In less than 30 seconds, Hogue discovered a plastic-wrapped bundle of United States currency inside a panel in the trunk.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He then placed Gonzalez under arrest. The entire incident took about 10 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">Prior to pleading guilty, Gonzalez filed a motion to suppress the cash as fruit of the poisonous tree stemming from an unconstitutional seizure and search. The district court ruled that the seizure was constitutional and, therefore, that the ensuing search was constitutional as well. Gonzalez insists that (1) the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to extend the stop, and (2) the part of the stop following the return of his license was not consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">We review for clear error the factual underpinnings of a denial of a motion to suppress.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In our analy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>sis, we construe all inferences in favor of the prevailing party, in this case, the government.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">B. Consent to Search</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">A search following a valid consent, i.e., one that is freely and voluntarily given, is constitutional.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Gonzalez asserts that his consent was not freely given because he was being detained involuntarily at the time that he agreed to the trooper\u2019s search of the car\u2019s trunk. If consent to <em>search </em>is given during an unconstitutional <em>seizure, </em>the consent is valid only if it is the product of independent free will. To make that determination, our inquiry is two-pronged: (1) Was the consent voluntary?; (2) Was it the product of free will? <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The government has the initial burden of demonstrating that the consent was free and voluntary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We afford the district court\u2019s determination substantial deference; <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> our review is for clear error.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Voluntariness is a fact question determined from the totality of the circumstances.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We consider a number of factors in our assessment, including: (1) the voluntariness of the individual\u2019s custodial status; (2) the presence of coercive police procedures; (3) the extent and level of the individual\u2019s cooperation with police; (4) his awareness of his right to refuse consent; (5) his education and intelligence; and (6) his belief that no incriminating evidence will be found.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As in all Fourth Amendment cases the touchstone of the inquiry is reasonableness.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">Applying that analysis to the facts of this case, we conclude that Gonzalez\u2019s consent was voluntary. Hogue was not confrontational and did not speak in a manner so commanding of authority as to be intimidating.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Gonzalez was cooperative; in fact, he expressly offered the officer a view of his luggage.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, although Gonzalez\u2019s English was not fluent, he was conversant with the trooper, talkative even, and only showed hesitation when asked for permission to search, which question Ho-gue then repeated in Spanish. Against this backdrop, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s determination of voluntariness in this case was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-15\">This brings us to the second prong of the inquiry, free will. When an individual consents to a search while he is unconstitutionally detained, the government must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>demonstrate that there was a break in the causal chain between the unlawful detention and the act of consent.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">We conclude that Gonzalez\u2019s consent was an act of free will. Even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that Trooper Hogue\u2019s act of leaning on the car\u2019s windowsill constituted an illegal seizure, Gonzalez\u2019s impromptu offer to show his luggage to Hogue was sufficient to break the causal chain. When Gonzalez asked Hogue if he would like a look at Gonzalez\u2019s luggage, the trooper had not asked to search the car. Gonzalez broached the subject before Hogue ever did so. On these facts,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we cannot accept that Gonzalez could freely offer an inspection of his luggage, then be unable to consent freely to a search of his car. Although the luggage inspection did not turn out to be the critical search, the effect of Gonzalez\u2019s offer was thenceforth to make him a free participant in the interview, regardless of his prior status. We are satisfied that Gonzalez\u2019s consent to the search of the trunk was voluntary and freely given, as a result of which the search was constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">As we conclude that Gonzalez\u2019s consent to search his vehicle is free of constitutional taint, we need not and do not reach the question whether the officer\u2019s detention of Gonzalez was an illegal seizure. The district court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b819-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-5\">. Following a few seconds of silence Hogue can be heard to ask \"Did you have some directions there?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b820-6\">. In his brief, Gonzalez makes much of Trooper Hogue's posture in leaning through the passenger window of Gonzalez's car. Although it is indeed difficult to imagine the individual who would feel free to drive off while an officer is leaning on (and into) his vehicle, we need not address whether this constituted an unconstitutional seizure to reach our conclusion today, and therefore we decline to consider the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\">.

We note again that the other elements of the stop also tilt in favor of reasonableness. The display of police authority was minimal. We are not confronted with strong evidence of intimidation. The entire stop lasted no longer than 10 minutes. Still, we should not be perceived as saying that any offer by an individual such as Gonzalez's to have his luggage searched will always break the causal chain between an unconstitutional seizure and a consensual search.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
