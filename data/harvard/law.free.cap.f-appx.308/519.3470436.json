In October 2004, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Ross, J.) dismissed Wilson\u2019s complaint against all defendants except for Jones. In July 2006, Jones moved for summary judgment on the grounds that she was not deliberately indifferent to Wilson\u2019s medical needs and that she was entitled to qualified immunity. In February 2007, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Court granted summary judgment for Jones, finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that summary judgment was appropriate because there was not sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to find that Jones had acted with deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Having thoroughly reviewed the record, we find Wilson\u2019s claims to be meritless for substantially the reasons stated by the District Court. Accordingly, we AFFIRM its decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
