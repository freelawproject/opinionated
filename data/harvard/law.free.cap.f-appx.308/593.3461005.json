Interdigital argues that the District Court should have stayed confirmation of the award so it can assert a recoupment claim against Federal. The District Court confirmed the award after it held that Interdigital no longer possessed a recoupment claim. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">Because we write exclusively for the parties, we recount only the facts essential to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">Interdigital was embroiled in patent litigation with Ericsson for ten years. During that case, Interdigital and Federal had an insurance coverage dispute that was resolved in 2000 by a Reimbursement Agreement under which Federal agreed to pay all litigation costs in exchange for a percentage of any payment Interdigital might receive from Ericsson. In 2003, Ericsson agreed to pay Interdigital more than $100 million to settle the patent litigation. Federal sought payment under the Reimbursement Agreement and, when In-terdigital refused to pay, Federal demanded arbitration pursuant to a mandatory arbitration clause contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-17\">In response to Federal\u2019s demand for arbitration, Interdigital filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court, claiming that the Reimbursement Agreement was void. The District Court disagreed and compelled arbitration. Significantly, In-terdigital did not argue that any particular issue exceeded the arbitrator\u2019s authority under the arbitration clause; instead it merely objected to the timing of Federal\u2019s arbitration demand, claiming that the parties had not yet expended reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute on their own. Before addressing that argument, the District Court noted: \u201cas a threshold matter, the [Cjourt must address whether the parties agreed to arbitrate and the scope of the [arbitration] agreement between the parties.\u201d Finding that \u201cthe parties have formally agreed to arbitrate their dispute and the dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement,\u201d the District Court concluded that the arbitrator had to decide whether the parties had expended reasonable efforts to settle their dispute. <em>InterDigital Commc\u2019ns Corp. v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>392 F.Supp.2d 707, 716-17 (E.D.Pa. 2005). The District Court also noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-18\"><em>Interdigital has not argued that its claims with respect to the amount of Federal\u2019s reimbursement do not fall </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>within the scope of the agreement to arbitrate. </em>Rather, Interdigital argues that arbitration is not timely because the parties have not satisfied a condition precedent that the parties meet to resolve the dispute prior to submitting the matter to arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 716 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The parties proceeded to arbitration, where they disagreed regarding royalty payments subject to the Reimbursement Agreement, as well as the \u201cadditional value\u201d derived from non-monetary provisions of the Ericsson settlement. At no point did Interdigital assert a defense to liability under the Reimbursement Agreement, or attempt to assert any counterclaim against Federal. The arbitrator awarded Federal almost $20 million, and Federal sought confirmation by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Interdigital requested a stay so it could assert a counterclaim for recoupment based on Federal\u2019s alleged \u201cbad faith and [breach of) contractual and fiduciary duties to ... Interdigital, by withholding reimbursement for attorneys\u2019 fees ... to coerce Interdigital to enter the Reimbursement Agreement.\u201d App. 392. Significantly, Interdigital averred that its recoupment claim sought \u201cthe same monetary relief as Federal was awarded in the arbitration.\u201d App. 393. The District Court denied the stay, holding that the recoupment claim should have been presented to the arbitrator because it was a defense to the merits of Federal\u2019s claim in arbitration. Interdigi-tal timely appealed the order of the District Court confirming Federal\u2019s arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">The gravamen of Interdigital\u2019s argument is that the District Court erred in precluding it from prosecuting in federal court a recoupment claim that it could not have brought in arbitration. Interdigital\u2019s appeal succeeds or fails depending upon whether its recoupment claim is properly characterized as a counterclaim to Federal\u2019s arbitration claim or as a defense on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">We begin with a brief discussion of re-coupment. The leading treatise counsels that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-13\">untimely counterclaims [may] be asserted on the ground that the ability to seek relief in the form of a common-law re-coupment, which was a species of defense, survives for as long as plaintiffs claim can be asserted and therefore is not barred by untimeliness. Thus, although a defendant cannot seek affirmative relief on the counterclaim ... [he] may assert [it as a recoupment claim] to the extent that it defeats or diminishes plaintiffs recovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">6 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice <em>&amp; </em>Procedure \u00a7 1419 (2008). Under Pennsylvania law, \u201c[Recoupment is the setting up of a demand arising from the same transaction as the plaintiffs claim or cause of action, strictly for the purpose of abatement or reduction of such claim,\u201d and \u201cit is essentially a defense to the debtor\u2019s claim against the creditor rather than a mutual obligation.\u201d <em>Cohen v. Goldberg, </em>554 Pa. 201, 720 A.2d 1028, 1030 (1998). In the context of a contract dispute, when \u201csome claim [a] defendant has against [a] plaintiff aris[es] out of the very contract giving rise to plaintiffs claim,\u201d the same transaction requirement is met and the defendant\u2019s claim may be asserted as recoupment, even if it would otherwise be time-barred. 6 Federal Practice <em>&amp; </em>Procedure \u00a7 1401 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">The requirement that a recoupment claim must arise out of the same transaction as the plaintiffs claim mirrors part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>the compulsory counterclaim rule in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Fed. R. CivP. 13(a) (\u201cA pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim [ ].\u201d). Scholars and courts have noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">[Recoupment is the common law precursor to the modern compulsory counterclaim. Yet, the recoupment doctrine is more than a precursor; it has survived the codification of compulsory counterclaims and enjoys continuing vitality today as a means of asserting an otherwise time-barred counterclaim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvZ\">David G. Epstein <em>&amp; </em>Jonathan A. Nockels, <em>Recoupment: Apples, Oranges and Fruit Basket Turnover, </em>58 SMU L.Rev. 51, 58 (2005) (quoting <em>Berger v. City of N. Miami, </em>820 F.Supp. 989, 992 (E.D.Va.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">This is but a glimpse of the precedent on recoupment. Suffice it to say for present purposes that recoupment is a type of counterclaim arising from the same transaction as the plaintiffs claim, and may be asserted for defensive purposes to diminish or extinguish the plaintiffs claim after the normal limitations period has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">The distinction between counterclaim and defense is significant in the context of arbitration. On one hand, parties may strictly limit the scope of an arbitration clause and a court cannot compel parties to arbitrate claims beyond the arbitrator\u2019s authority. <em>See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Coviello, </em>233 F.3d 710 (3d Cir. 2000); <em>AT &amp; T Techs., Inc. v. Commc\u2019ns Workers of Am., </em>475 U.S. 643, 648, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 89 L.Ed.2d 648 (1986); <em>Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers v. Verizon N.J., Inc., </em>458 F.3d 305 (3d Cir.2006). Therefore, even though recoupment mirrors a compulsory counterclaim in certain respects, one may not assert a recoupment claim in the course of arbitration if it is excluded by a narrow arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">On the other hand, a defense to an arbitrable claim is, in most cases, considered \u201ca component of the dispute on the merits and must be considered by the arbitrator, not the court.\u201d <em>Chiron Corp. v. Ortho Diag. Sys., Inc., </em>207 F.3d 1126, 1132 (9th Cir.2000). <em>See also Messa v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>433 Pa.Super. 594, 641 A.2d 1167, 1170 (1994) (\u201c[I]t is for the arbitrators to rule on the merits of the parties\u2019 claims and defenses.\u201d). In <em>Chiron, </em>the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that \u201c[a]s with other affirmative defenses such as laches and statute of limitations ... <em>a res judicata </em>defense is a \u2018component\u2019 of the merits of the dispute and is thus an arbitrable issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1134. <em>See also John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Olick, </em>151 F.3d 132, 138 (3d Cir.1998) <em>(res judicata </em>defense to arbitrable claim should be heard by the arbitrator, unless a prior federal judgment is at issue); <em>Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Belco Petroleum Corp., </em>88 F.3d 129, 135 (2d Cir.1996) (\u201cThe preclusion issue is not ... a disagreement over whether the parties agreed to arbitrate the merits of then-dispute. [Rather, the] claim of preclusion is a legal defense to National Union\u2019s claim. As such, it is itself a component of the dispute on the merits.\u201d) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">Interdigital characterizes its recoupment claim as a counterclaim rather than a defense, arguing that because the arbitration provision in the Reimbursement Agreement involved only the monetary value of services that might be part of a settlement agreement with Ericsson, it was unable to raise its recoupment claim in the arbitration. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">Although recoupment may be properly characterized as a counterclaim in certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>circumstances, here InterdigitaPs recoupment claim is entirely dependent on Federal\u2019s claim \u2014 not merely to revive its timeliness, but also in substance. Interdigital has crafted a theory of recovery superficially distinct from Federal\u2019s reimbursement claim, but the only damages claimed by Interdigital are the arbitration award itself. App. 393 (\u201cInterdigitaPs claims of bad faith and breach of contractual and fiduciary duties ... seek the same monetary relief as Federal was awarded in the arbitration.\u201d). Contrary to InterdigitaPs assertion that its defense \u201cdoes not relate to the merits of Federal\u2019s claim,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 9, the bad faith and breach of contract/fiduciary duty claims exist only to the extent that the alleged harms led to the arbitration award. Thus, the recoupment claim is a component of the underlying arbitration dispute in the same sense as other affirmative defenses. <em>See In re Trans World Airlines, </em>322 F.3d 283, 289 (3d Cir.2003) (in bankruptcy context, assuming that recoupment claim is an affirmative defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">We have previously held that a <em>res judi-cata </em>defense to an arbitration claim must be decided by the court, not the arbitrator, if it involves the prior judgment of a federal court. <em>John Hancock, </em>151 F.3d at 138. But the policy concerns about the integrity and finality of judgments, <em>id., </em>that justified the exception crafted in that case are absent in the context of InterdigitaPs recoupment claim, which was based on bad faith and breach of contract. Requiring Inter-digital to present its recoupment claim to the arbitrator as a defense on the merits is consistent with our view of arbitration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVb\">[W]e have consistently admonished the courts to exercise the utmost restraint and to tread gingerly before intruding upon the arbitral process. There is, of course, good reason for this restrained approach. Arbitration is, above all, a matter of contract and courts must respect the parties\u2019 bargained-for method of dispute resolution. Indeed, arbitration most often arises in areas where courts are at a significant experiential disadvantage and arbitrators, who understand the language and workings of the shop, may best serve the interest of the parties. Thus, there is a strong policy in favor of arbitration and courts must resist the attempt to intrude upon arbitration proceedings where the statute does not explicitly authorize court involvement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 136-37 (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">We also find it significant that construing InterdigitaPs recoupment claim as an independent counterclaim beyond the scope of arbitration would be contrary to InterdigitaPs own position in 2005. <em>See InterDigital Commc\u2019ns, </em>392 F.Supp.2d at 716 (noting that \u201cInterdigital has not argued that its claims with respect to the amount of Federal\u2019s reimbursement do not fall within the scope of the agreement to arbitrate\u201d). We therefore conclude that InterdigitaPs recoupment claim constitutes a defense on the merits that should have been presented to the arbitrator. <em>See United Steelworkers of Am. v. Am. Smelting and Ref. Co., 648 </em>F.2d 863, 870 (3d Cir.1981) (rejecting attack on arbitration award because the argument was not presented to the arbitrator); <em>InterDigital Comm\u2019cns Corp. v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>No. 03-6082, 2008 WL 783560, at *7 (E.D.Pa. Mar.24, 2008) (\u201cA new defense, interjected at this late stage, is not a ground for relief from the arbitration award.\u201d) (citing 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 7314).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\">. Even if Interdigital\u2019s claim were a counterclaim instead of a defense, it waived that claim by waiting until after arbitration to present it to the District Court.
