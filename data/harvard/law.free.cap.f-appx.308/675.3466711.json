Dounou is the primary applicant for asylum; the claims of his wife are derivative of his application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(3) (2006); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.21(a) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-21\">In their petition for review, the Petitioners first argue that they established extraordinary circumstances to excuse Dounou\u2019s failure to file his asylum application within one year of his arrival. We lack jurisdiction to review this claim pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2006). <em>See Almuhtaseb v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 743, 747-48 (6th Cir.2006) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, we also cannot review the underlying merits of the Petitioners\u2019 asylum claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-22\">The Petitioners also contend that the immigration judge erred in denying their request for withholding of removal. \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b) (2008). Based on our review of the record, we find that substantial evidence supports the finding that the Petitioners failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court. We therefore uphold the denial of their request for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Accordingly, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b700-15\"> The Petitioners fail to raise any specific issues regarding the denial of their request for protection under the Convention Against Torture in their brief before this court and have therefore waived appellate review of this claim. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) (\"[T] he argument ... must contain ... appellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations t\u00f3 the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (\"Failure to comply with the specific dictates of [Rule 28] with respect to a particular claim triggers abandonment of that claim on appeal.\u201d); <em>see also Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 189 n. 7 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
