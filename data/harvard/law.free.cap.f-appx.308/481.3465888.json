Nelson, who pleaded guilty to multiple counts of mailing life-threatening and/or extortionate letters, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(b), (c), appeals his 235-month prison sentence. That sentence reflects the low end of the Guidelines range yielded by Nelson\u2019s offense level of 33 and criminal history category of VI. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-19\">In the aftermath of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>we review sentences for \u201creasonableness,\u201d 543 U.S. 220, 262, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u201ca deferential standard limited to identifying abuse of discretion regardless of whether a challenged sentence is \u2018inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>531 F.3d 163, 170 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Our review proceeds in two steps: we \u201cmust first ascertain whether the sentence was administered without procedural error,\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>524 F.3d 209, 214 (2d Cir.2008); and second, if the sentence is \u201cprocedurally sound,\u201d we must \u201cconsider [its] substantive reasonableness,\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>128 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>597, by evaluating \u201cwhether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3558(a) factors supported\u201d the sentence imposed, <em>id. </em>at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">On this appeal, Nelson argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to give due consideration to the totality of circumstances warranting \u00a7 3553(a) consideration. Specifically, he argues that the court failed to consider the fact that his crimes, which were committed while Nelson was in the custody of the New York State Department of Correctional Services (the \u201cDOC\u201d) could have been prevented if the DOC had inspected and restricted his outgoing mail. This argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u201c[W]e presume, in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise, that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged [his] duty to consider the statutory factors\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2006). We have \u201csteadfastly refused to require judges to explain or enumerate how such consideration was conducted.\u201d <em>United States v. Pereira, </em>465 F.3d 515, 523 (2d Cir.2006). Nothing in the record supports Nelson\u2019s argument that the district court here failed to consider his claim that the DOC bore some responsibility for defendant\u2019s criminal conduct. Nelson\u2019s lawyer raised the issue at sentencing in urging consideration for Nelson\u2019s diminished capacity. <em>See </em>Sentencing Tr. at 5 (observing that crimes \u201ccould have been prevented, to one extent, by a simple order that Mr. Nelson only has contact with counsel and [to] withhold all his other mail \u2014 I think there are a lot of things that could have been done \u2014 I think Mr. Nelson qualifies for the Diminished Capacity Departure.\u201d). After providing an opportunity for both parties to speak, the district judge stated on the record that he had \u201cconsidered everything submitted to [him]\u201d in light of \u201ceach and every factor set forth in 3553.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The district court explained that Nelson\u2019s \u201cdisabilities\u201d prompted it to sentence defendant at the low end of his Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 10. Although counsel argues on appeal that the mitigating effect of the DOC\u2019s inaction was a circumstance distinct from Nelson\u2019s disabilities, because the defense presented the former point to the court as a fact relevant to the latter, we expect the district court treated it as such, even if it did not assign the fact the weight wished for by the defense. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 34 (so long as ultimate sentence is reasonable, \u201cwe will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the judge accorded to a given factor or to a specific argument made pursuant to that factor.\u201d). Indeed, our conclusion that the district court fairly considered the defense argument is reinforced by the court\u2019s imposition of limits on Nelson\u2019s mailings while in <em>federal </em>custody. <em>See </em>Sentencing Tr. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">To the extent Nelson complains that his 235-month sentence runs afoul of the parsimony clause, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), we are not persuaded. As already noted, the sentence represents the low end of the applicable Guidelines range, and as we have recently observed \u201cin the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Eberhard, </em>525 F.3d 175, 179 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). This is because \u201cwhere [the sentencing] judge and [Sentencing] Commission both determine that the Guidelines sentence[] is an appropriate sentence for the case at hand, that sentence likely reflects the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>2467, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (emphasis in original). Nelson\u2019s sentence warrants no different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Consequently, for the reasons stated above, the judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
