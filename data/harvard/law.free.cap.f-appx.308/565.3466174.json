We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case, as well as with the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The district court correctly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to grant Peters\u2019s petition because he sought the writ to attack two state court convictions. <em>See Finkelstein v. Spitzer, </em>455 F.3d 131, 133-34 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that district courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to issue writs of error coram <em>nobis </em>to set aside judgments of state courts). Further, Peters is not entitled to habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 because he was not \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of the statute at the time he filed his petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); <em>Lackawanna County Dist. Attorney v. Coss, </em>532 U.S. 394, 401-02, 121 S.Ct. 1567, 149 L.Ed.2d 608 (2001). Although Peters asks us to revisit these precedents, this panel lacks authority to overturn precedent from either the Supreme Court or another panel of this Court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Santiago, </em>268 F.3d 151, 154, 155 n. 6 (2d Cir.2001). Peters\u2019s remaining contentions that the district court erred by (1) denying his request for a subpoena, (2) failing to consider his proffered three volume record appendix, and (3) failing to hold a writ hearing are without merit because the district court lacked the ability to grant the relief sought by Peters.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
