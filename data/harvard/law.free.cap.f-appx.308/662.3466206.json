Samuel seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order treating his Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion as a successive 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2008) motion, and dismissing it on that basis. He also appeals the court\u2019s order granting his motion for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) (2006). The order denying his Rule 60(b) motion as successive is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2006); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 369 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>\u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude Samuel has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal from court\u2019s denial of Samuel\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Additionally, we construe Samuel\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief as an application to file a second or successive motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a prisoner must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence, not previously discoverable by due diligence, that would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(2), 2255 (West 2006 &amp; Supp.2008). Samuel\u2019s claims do not satisfy either of these criteria. Therefore, we deny authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In addition, we find the district did not abuse its discretion granting Samuel\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction. <em>United States v. Goines, </em>357 F.3d 469, 478 (4th Cir.2004) (stating standard of review). Insofar as Samuel suggests the court could have considered an even lower sentence below the Guidelines sentencing range, this claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Dunphy, </em>551 F.3d 247, 257 (4th Cir.2009) (\u201c[A] district judge is not authorized to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended guideline range.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal from the order denying the Rule 60(b) motion and we affirm the order granting Samuel a sentence reduction. We also deny Samuel\u2019s motion for production of documents. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
