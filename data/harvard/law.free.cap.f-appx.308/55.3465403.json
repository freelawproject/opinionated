We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">We affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny the motion to dismiss \u00a7 1326 indictment. The Immigration Judge failed to make a voluntariness determination, as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.25(b). However, assuming that this error violated Balderas\u2019 due process rights, Balderas failed to show any prejudice, because he has no plausible grounds for relief. <em>See U.S. v. Bahena-Cardenas, </em>411 F.3d 1067, 1077 (9th Cir.2005); <em>U.S. v. Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d 1042, 1052 (9th Cir.2004). Balderas\u2019 2006 stipulated removal was based on his 2006 entry without inspection, not the 1997 deportation after his conviction for an aggravated felony. <em>See Hernandez-Almanza v. U.S., </em>547 F.2d 100, 102 (9th Cir.1976) (validity of a removal for entry without inspection is not affected by the legality of a prior exclusion). As a result, Balderas was legally deportable in 2006, despite any error in the 1997 proceeding, and the stipulated removal proceeding could not have produced a different result. <em>See United States v. Galicia-Gonzalez, </em>997 F.2d 602, 603 (9th Cir.1993) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the government\u2019s questioning constituted a custodial interrogation for <em>Miranda </em>purposes. We review for clear error the district court\u2019s underlying findings of fact. <em>U.S. v. Chen, </em>439 F.3d 1037, 1040 (9th Cir.2006). We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Balderas\u2019 motion to suppress statements contained in the Stipulated Waiver. Assuming without deciding that a <em>Miranda </em>violation occurred when the district court faded to suppress certain admissions contained in the Stipulated Waiver, any such error would have been harmless. The government introduced other evidence at trial-including other statements made by Balderas-to prove Balder-as\u2019 alienage and deportation status.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s formulation of jury instructions for an abuse of discretion. <em>U.S. v. de Cruz, </em>82 F.3d 856, 864 (9th Cir.1996). The district court did not abuse its discretion, because the jury instructions as a whole were not misleading or inadequate to guide the jury\u2019s deliberation. <em>Id. </em>The jury instructions were sufficient to cover the deportation element of \u00a7 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The district court did not err in increasing Balderas\u2019 offense level for his prior state law conviction, because a conviction for assault with a firearm under California Penal Code \u00a7 245(a)(2) is categorically a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 under both the \u201ccatchall\u201d and \u201caggravated assault\u201d provisions. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Argueta, </em>447 F.3d 1167, 1170 (9th Cir.2006), <em>overruled on other grounds by U.S. v. Snellenberger, </em>548 F.3d 699, 702 (9th Cir.2008). <em>Cf. United States v. Sanchez-Ruedas, </em>452 F.3d 409, 413 (5th Cir.2006) (California assault is \u201csufficiently similar to the generic contemporary definition of aggravated assault to qualify categorically as an enumerated crime of violence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">We find no reason to question the constitutionality of <em>Almendarez-Torres. See United States v. Lopez-Torres, </em>443 F.3d 1182, 1184 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b80-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir.
