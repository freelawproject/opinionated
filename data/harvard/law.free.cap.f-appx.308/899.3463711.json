Jackson was sentenced to 360 months of imprisonment, and Hines was sentenced to 97 months of imprisonment. On direct appeal, we affirmed Jackson\u2019s and Hines\u2019 convictions, but remanded for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>166 Fed. Appx. 823 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">On remand, the district court once again sentenced Jackson to 360 months of imprisonment and Hines to 97 months of imprisonment. Jackson and Hines now appeal these sentences, arguing that their sentences were improperly enhanced based on judicially found facts contrary to those found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, and further arguing that, even if properly considered, those judicially found facts were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Jackson\u2019s and Hines\u2019 sentences are AFFIRMED. The district court\u2019s factual findings do not increase Jackson\u2019s or Hines\u2019 sentences beyond the statutory m\u00e1ximums for the crimes on which the jury convicted them, and the district court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">The following facts are from this Court\u2019s earlier opinion addressing Jackson\u2019s and Hines\u2019 convictions and sentences. In April 2002, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\u201cATF\u201d) Special Agent David Hayes received information about drug-dealing activity in the Russellville, Kentucky area. Agent Hayes and three confidential informants began an investigation lasting from approximately May 20, 2002 until November 2, 2002 and involving numerous controlled buys of crack and powder cocaine. The facts as to Jackson are set out first.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">A. Nakeitha Jackson</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">In the course of investigating another individual, Marcel Edwards, the ATF became aware of Jackson\u2019s drug-dealing activities.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-12\">On September 6, 2002, Confidential Informant Chris Bratcher purchased an \u201ceight ball\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of crack cocaine from one Douglas Steven Johnson. Jackson sold this eight ball to Johnson, and Johnson in turn sold it to Bratcher. On September 8, 2002, Confidential Informant Bratcher purchased approximately 5 grams of crack from Johnson and Jackson. Both exchanges were tape-recorded. Agent Hayes observed both of these interactions from afar. During the September transaction, Agent Hayes observed a gold Jeep Cherokee, the kind of automobile Jackson drove, pull out of the driveway. Agent Hayes saw an individual he later identified as Jackson during the September 8 sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-13\">Jackson was arrested on January 10, 2003. Jackson signed a waiver of his right to remain silent and his right to counsel and made a tape-recorded statement to the police. In this statement, Jackson indicated that he had a contact in Nashville who would supply him with approximately 9 ounces of cocaine approximately once or twice a week. He also indicated that Marios Hines would occasionally buy approximately 1 ounce of cocaine from him at a time. Jackson claimed that Hines had purchased cocaine from him one week prior to the interview. Jackson further indicated that Edwards would buy cocaine from him on an occasional basis. Jackson stated that the most Edwards ever purchased from him was 1 ounce. Jackson noted that Edwards often had a larger quantity of cocaine in his possession than the amount purchased from Jack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>son, and that Edwards had other sources because Edwards felt that Jackson\u2019s prices were too high. Jackson also indicated that he and Edwards did not get along particularly well due to a \u201cfalling out\u201d in their past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-4\">On January 8, 2003, a grand jury in the Western District of Kentucky returned a Superseding Indictment against Marcel Edwards, Marios Hines, Nakeitha Jackson, Douglas Steven Johnson, Calvin Merrell and Tonya Washington. Edwards, Johnson, and Merrell pled guilty to the charges against them contained in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-5\">The grand jury charged Jackson in Count one with conspiring, between April 28, 2002 and November 2, 2002, to aid and abet in the knowing and intentional possession with intent to distribute and distribution of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base, commonly known as crack cocaine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Count five charged Jackson with knowingly and intentionally possessing with intent to distribute and distribution of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base on September 6, 2002, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(c). Count six charged Jackson with knowingly and intentionally possessing with intent to distribute and distributing cocaine base on September 8, 2002, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(iii).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-7\">At trial, Marcel Edwards and Douglas Steven Johnson, two charged co-conspirators; Tommy Stewart, John Stewart and Chris Bratcher, three confidential informants involved in this case; and Special Agent David Hayes testified regarding Jackson\u2019s involvement in drug dealing.... The jury returned a guilty verdict for Jackson on Counts one, five, and six of the indictment. The jury further returned a special verdict, finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Jackson possessed 5 or more grams of cocaine base in connection with Count one of the indictment....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-9\">After a sentencing hearing conducted on November 12, 2003, the district court determined that Jackson had possessed 1.5 kilograms or more of cocaine base, thereby making his offense level thirty-eight according to the Drug Quantity Table set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). The district court then applied a four level enhancement to Jackson\u2019s sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 over defense counsel\u2019s objection based on a finding that Jackson was \u201cat least one of the leaders of this criminal activity and ... there were five or more participants involved in it.\u201d (JA 480).... Jackson\u2019s final offense level was a forty-two and his criminal history category was six, placing him in a sentencing range of 360 months to life imprisonment. The district court then sentenced Jackson to 360 months imprisonment....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">166 FedAppx. at 825-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">B. Marios Hines</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">The following discussion of the facts concerning Hines\u2019 conviction and first sentencing also come from this Court\u2019s earlier opinion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-13\">Marios Hines, Edwards\u2019 half-brother, was also identified during the investigation as an individual involved in dealing cocaine. On May 22, 2002, Hines delivered .46 grams of crack cocaine to confidential informant Tommy Stewart, on Edwards\u2019 behalf. On May 31, 2002, Hines delivered 1.15 grams of crack cocaine to the confidential informant Stewart again on Edwards\u2019 behalf. A confidential informant also spoke with Hines on the telephone on July 3, 2002, regarding a shortage in the amount of crack cocaine purchased from Edwards earlier in the day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-14\">On January 8, 2003, the grand jury charged Hines in Count one with con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>spiring between April 28, 2002 and November 2, 2002 to aid and abet in the knowing and intentional possession with intent distribute and distribution of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Count three charged Hines with knowingly and intentionally possessing with intent to distribute and distribution of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base on May 31, 2002, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-5\">The jury returned a guilty verdict for Hines on Counts one and three of the superseding indictment. The jury also returned a special verdict in which it did not find beyond a reasonable doubt that Hines possessed 5 or more grams of cocaine base in connection with Count one. The district court subsequently determined that approximately 34.72 grams of crack cocaine and 29 grams of powder cocaine were attributable to Hines, yielding a base offense level of thirty according to the Drug Quantity Table set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). Hines sought a two level reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility, which the district court rejected. Hines\u2019 criminal history category was one, placing him in a sentencing range of 97 to 121 months imprisonment. The district court imposed a sentence of 97 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-6\"><em>Washington, </em>166 FedAppx. at 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">C. Direct Appeal and Remand in Light of <em>Booker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Jackson and Hines both appealed their convictions and sentences. After affirming their convictions and the district court\u2019s denial of their motions for a downward adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility, we remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Booker. Washington, </em>166 Fed-Appx. at 830, 832-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">D. Resentencing on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">On remand, at their May 26, 2006 resen-tencings, the district court rejected Jackson\u2019s and Hines\u2019 arguments that the special jury verdict, this Court\u2019s remand, and <em>Booker </em>precluded it from finding facts that raised Jackson\u2019s offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines above twenty-six and that raised Hines\u2019 offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines above twenty-four. The district court explained that this Court had vacated Jackson\u2019s and Hines\u2019 sentences in <em>Washington </em>not because the district court had erred in finding facts that it then used to calculate the appropriate Guidelines range but rather because, <em>pre-Booker, </em>the district court had treated the Guidelines as mandatory as opposed to advisory. Thus, the district court concluded that: (1) post <em>-Booker, </em>the special verdict meant only that the district court\u2019s sentence must not exceed the statutory maximum; and (2) this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Washington </em>did not preclude it from finding facts that placed Jackson\u2019s sentence for count one of the indictment within the statutory range of 10 years to life imprisonment and placed Hines\u2019 sentence within the statutory range of zero to twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">The district court then resentenced Jackson and Hines, relying on the same evidence used to support its fact-finding about drug quantity and Jackson\u2019s leadership role at their original sentencings. It once again calculated the Guidelines range for Jackson to be 360 months to life, and once again sentenced him to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court once again calculated the Guidelines range for Hines to be 97 months to 121 months, and once again sentenced him to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">Jackson and Hines now appeal their most recent sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">\u201cUnder this Circuit\u2019s <em>post-Booker </em>protocol, the sentencing court must: (1) correctly calculate the advisory guideline sentencing <em>range, </em>(2) consider the other [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and (3) impose a sentence that is sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Lanesky, </em>494 F.3d 558, 561 (6th Cir.2007). Sentences imposed by the district court are reviewed by this Court for reasonableness. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201c[A] sentence is unreasonable when the district judge fails to \u2018consider\u2019 the applicable Guidelines range or neglects to \u2018consider\u2019 the other factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and instead simply selects what the judge deems an appropriate sentence without such required consideration.\u201d <em>Lanesky, </em>494 F.3d at 561 (quoting <em>United States v. Webb, </em>403 F.3d 373, 383 (6th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">\u201c[T]he district court\u2019s determination of the quantity of drugs attributable to a defendant for sentencing purposes\u201d is reviewed for clear error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>470 F.3d 299, 310 (6th Cir.2006). \u201c[A] district court\u2019s decision concerning a defendant\u2019s role in an offense\u201d is also reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Gates, </em>461 F.3d 703, 709 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Jackson and Hines both challenge their new sentences, arguing that (1) the district court incorrectly calculated their Sentencing Guidelines range by considering judicially found facts contrary to those found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, and (2) even if properly considered, those judicially found facts were clearly erroneous. We first consider whether the district court correctly calculated the advisory Guidelines sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">A. The District Court Correctly Calculated the Advisory Guidelines Range at Resentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">Hines argues that the district court used an improper Guidelines range at resen-tencing because it deviated from the law of the case established by this Court in his first appeal and calculated an advisory Guidelines range that improperly considered acquitted conduct. Jackson similarly argues that the district court improperly calculated the Guidelines range by relying on judicial fact finding rather than facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Arguments similar to Hines\u2019 law-of-the-case and Jackson\u2019s and Hines\u2019 arguments about judicial fact-finding that deviates from facts found beyond a reasonable doubt in a special jury verdict were recently rejected by this Court in <em>United States v. Mendez, </em>498 F.3d 423 (6th Cir.2007) (per curiam).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">1. Law-of-the-Case Doctrine Not Implicated</p>\n<p id=\"b928-13\">Similar to the defendant in <em>Mendez, </em>Hines argues here that the law-of-the-case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>doctrine applies. Hines is mistaken. Under this doctrine, \u201cfindings made at one point in the litigation become the law of the case for subsequent stages of that same litigation.\u201d <em>Mendez, </em>498 F.3d at 426 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). To determine whether the doctrine applies, the appellate court\u2019s decision \u201cmust be read against the backdrop of prior proceedings in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Just as in <em>Mendez, </em>\u201c[although the remand order could have been clearer,\u201d we construe it as saying what the maximum base offense level should have been for Jackson and Hines <em>\u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines regime,\u201d </em>because that was what was \u201csupported by a jury\u2019s beyond-a-reasonable-doubt factual findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSo read, this language says nothing about the appropriate range under the <em>advisory </em>Guidelines regime to be used by the district court at the post <em>-Booker </em>resentencing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">2. Acquitted Conduct Was Properly Considered at Resentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Hines next argues that the district court calculated an advisory Guidelines range that improperly considered acquitted conduct. Specifically, he asserts that, because the jury determined in the special jury verdict form that he did not possess more than 5 grams of cocaine base beyond a reasonable doubt, the district court cannot consider conduct on which he was acquitted to find otherwise. Although framed differently, Jackson also argues that the district court improperly engaged in judicial fact-finding post <em>-Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Similar arguments were rejected in <em>Mendez. </em>Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 157, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997), we observed that \u201cthis court has repeatedly held since <em>Booker </em>that sentencing courts may still find facts using the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard,\u201d \u201cthat <em>Booker </em>did not disturb <em>Watts,\u201d </em>and thus reasoned that \u201ca <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing court may consider even \u2018acquitted conduct\u2019 if it finds facts supporting that conduct by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Mendez, </em>498 F.3d at 426-27.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-9\">In <em>United States v. Watts, </em>the Supreme Court held \u201cthat a jury\u2019s verdict of acquittal does not prevent the sentencing court from considering conduct underlying the acquitted charge, so long as that conduct has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d 519 U.S. 148, 157, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997). <em>Watts </em>preceded <em>Booker, </em>but this court has repeatedly held since <em>Booker </em>that sentencing courts may still find facts using the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. <em>See United States v. Gates, </em>461 F.3d 703, 708 (6th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Coffee, </em>434 F.3d 887, 897-98 (6th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Stone, </em>432 F.3d 651, 654-55 (6th Cir. 2005) <em>(\u201cBooker </em>did not eliminate judicial fact-finding. Instead, the remedial majority gave district courts the option, after calculating the Guideline range, to sentence a defendant outside the resulting Guideline range.\u201d). And in <em>United States v. Brika, </em>487 F.3d 450, 458-60 (6th Cir.2007), this court concluded after a thorough analysis that <em>Booker </em>did not disturb <em>Watts, </em>and therefore confirmed that a <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing court may consider even \u201cacquitted conduct\u201d if it finds facts supporting that conduct by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-10\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). This Court\u2019s en banc decision in White acknowledges that \u201cMendez accords with the view expressed by our sister circuits that Booker did not alter the Watts position on acquitted conduct.\u201d <em>White, </em>551 F.3d at 383-84 (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">As we observed in <em>White, </em>it is not improper <em>post-Booker </em>for a district court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>\u201cto rely [ ] on acquitted conduct in applying an <em>advisory </em>Guidelines system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384-85. Rather, \u201c[i]n the <em>post-Booker </em>world, the relevant statutory ceiling is no longer the Guidelines range but the maximum penalty authorized by the United States Code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Jackson and Hines received sentences \u201cbelow the statutory ceiling set by the jury\u2019s verdict, the district court [did] not abridge the defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial by looking to other facts, including acquitted conduct, when selecting a sentence within that statutory range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In Hines\u2019 case, the \u201cstatutory ceiling\u201d of 20 years \u201cset by the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d is well above Hines\u2019 actual sentence of 8 years, 1 month. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). In Jackson\u2019s case, the \u201cstatutory ceiling\u201d of life imprisonment \u201cset by the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d is well above Jackson\u2019s actual sentence of 30 years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The district court committed no error when it considered acquitted conduct on resentencing. \u201cTaking acquitted conduct into account ... is permitted for the limited purpose of determining the sentence for convicted conduct, which must be shown by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>White, </em>551 F.3d at 385-86. \u201c[T]he district court\u2019s consideration of acquitted conduct in sentencing passes constitutional muster ... insofar as enhancements based on acquitted conduct do not increase a sentence beyond the maximum penalty provided by the United States Code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">B. The District Court\u2019s Factual Findings Are Not Clearly Erroneous</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">We now address Jackson\u2019s and Hines\u2019 arguments that the district court\u2019s factual findings about drug quantities and Jackson\u2019s leadership role were clearly erroneous. We begin with the district court\u2019s drug quantity findings as to Hines.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">1. Quantity of Drugs Attributed to Hines</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">At Hines\u2019 resentencing, the district court considered counsel\u2019s arguments, relied on the same evidence presented at his original February 10, 2004 sentencing\u2014 e.g. trial testimony, Jackson\u2019s statement to Agent Hayes, Edwards\u2019 post-trial affidavit, and testimony that both Edwards and Hines used co-defendant Calvin Merrell as a runner for small amounts of cocaine\u2014 and reaffirmed the drug quantity findings made at Hines\u2019 original sentencing. Those findings are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">First, as to the period between May 20, 2002 and June 13, 2002, there were several drug deliveries; some made by Hines and some by others. Because the evidence showed that Hines was involved at both the beginning and the end of this time period, the district court found all criminal activity of Edwards and Merrell during this time was reasonably foreseeable to Hines, thereby making him accountable for 13.46 grams of crack cocaine and 660 milligrams of powder cocaine. Second, none of drug quantities involved in July 2002 would be attributable to Hines. Third, considering Edwards\u2019 trial testimony and his post-trial affidavit, the district court attributed to Hines the one-half ounce of crack cocaine (14.17 grams) that Edwards testified he fronted to Hines because this testimony showed that they were still working toward a common goal. As to the one-half ounce of crack cocaine that Edwards testified he and Hines had obtained from Jackson and split, the district court attributed to Hines one-half of that one-half, or 7.09 grams of crack cocaine. Finally, based on Jackson\u2019s statement to Agent Hayes that Hines frequently purchased drugs from him and had even done so as <em>recent </em>as a week ago, the district court found that, even if outside the conspiracy period, this was still relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2) and at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>tributed Hines with 29 grams of powder cocaine. The district court thus determined that Hines would be attributed with 34.72 grams of crack cocaine and 29 grams of powder cocaine, thereby arriving at a base offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines of 30. (JA 902-906).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Hines challenges these findings, arguing that the district court failed to determine the scope of his agreement and improperly relied on Edwards\u2019 post-trial affidavit that conflicted with his trial testimony. Each of these arguments is addressed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">a. District Court Did Determine Scope of Hines\u2019 Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Hines first argues that, in calculating the drug quantity attributable to him, the district court improperly applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and held him accountable for the conduct of others in the criminal drug conspiracy without first determining the scope of the criminal activity that Hines agreed to join. In <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>279 F.3d 392, 400 (6th Cir.2002), this Court held that \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) \u201crequires that the district court make <em>particularized </em>findings with respect to both the scope of the defendant\u2019s agreement <em>and </em>the foreseeability of his co-conspirators\u2019 conduct before holding the defendant accountable for the scope of the entire conspiracy.\u201d Contrary to Hines\u2019 arguments here, the district court satisfied these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">First, the district court did not find Hines accountable for all of his co-conspirators\u2019 conduct during the entire April through November 2002 scope of the conspiracy. Rather, the district court made particularized findings that Hines was involved in the conspiracy to purchase and distribute cocaine both at the beginning and the end of the time period between May 20, 2002 and June 13, 2002, during which time several deliveries were made by Hines and others. Next, the district court found all criminal activity of co-conspirators Edwards and Merrell during this time to be reasonably foreseeable to Hines. The district court further found that, based on Edwards\u2019 trial testimony and his post-trial affidavit, that Edwards and Hines were still working towards a common goal of the criminal conspiracy at the time they split a one-half ounce of crack and at the time Edwards fronted another one-half ounce of crack to Hines.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">In <em>Campbell, </em>this Court observed that the district court may infer the scope of a defendant\u2019s agreement \u201cfrom the conduct of the defendant and others.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>279 F.3d at 400. That is what the district court did here. It examined the time period Hines was actively involved in the conspiracy, its common goal, and the conduct of Hines\u2019 co-conspirators that was reasonably foreseeable during that time period. The district court\u2019s findings as to the scope of Hines\u2019 agreement to participate in the charged criminal conspiracy are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">2. Edwards\u2019 Trial Testimony and Post-Trial Affidavit Are Consistent</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">Hines also challenges the district court\u2019s attribution of any drug quantity based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>Edwards\u2019 testimony that he and Hines had split a half ounce of crack cocaine that they had purchased from Jackson. In particular, Hines argues that the district court improperly relied on Edwards\u2019 affidavit averring that this occurred during the April through November 2002 time frame of the charged conspiracy (JA 159)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because it conflicts with his trial testimony (JA 295-298, 307-09, 333, 342-43, 346, 350-55). Hines misconstrues Edwards\u2019 trial testimony. Edwards testified that he did recall one instance where both he and Hines bought a half ounce of cocaine from Jackson that they split, but he could not recall the precise date. He admitted that he had previously told the government that he had purchased crack cocaine from Jackson in the summer of 2002. (JA 350). On cross-examination, Edwards testified that he dealt with Jackson in 2001 or 2002, that he could not give a precise date, but it was probably in the summer of 2002. (JA 353-54). Thus, the district court\u2019s finding that this drug transaction occurred during the time frame of the charged conspiracy is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Hines also challenges the district court\u2019s attribution of any drug quantity based on Edwards\u2019 testimony that he also fronted Hines a half ounce of crack cocaine. In particular, Hines argues that the district court improperly relied on Edwards\u2019 affidavit averring that there was one instance where Edwards and Hines split a half ounce of crack cocaine that they purchased from Jackson and another instance where Edwards fronted Hines a half ounce of crack cocaine (JA 159) because it conflicts with his trial testimony (JA 296, 308-309). Contrary to Hines\u2019 argument here, there is no conflict with Edwards\u2019 testimony at trial and that in his post-trial affidavit. At trial, Edwards testified that he did not sell Hines any cocaine that he got from Jackson. When asked whether he bought crack cocaine from sources other than Jackson, Edwards replied that he did. He further testified that he never sold it to Hines but rather had fronted it to him one time. (JA 296). When asked specifically whether Jackson was a source for Hines, Edwards testified that there was only one time that he and Hines split some crack cocaine that Jackson supplied. (JA 308-309). Thus, the district court\u2019s findings attributing to Hines all of the drug quantity that he and Edwards purchased from Jackson (14.17 grams) and half of the drug quantity Edwards obtained from another source and fronted to Hines (7.09 grams) are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">B. Quantity of Drugs Attributable to Jackson</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Jackson challenges the quantity of drugs that the district court attributed to him. In particular, Jackson argues that, although the district court is permitted to estimate the drug quantity to be attributed to him, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 12 (2002), it improperly found a drug quantity here that is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Despite Jackson\u2019s argu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>merits to the contrary, the drug quantity estimated by the district court and attributed to Jackson is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. There is no clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">At Jackson\u2019s original sentencing, the district court heard testimony from ATF Special Agent David Hayes, the individual to whom Jackson gave a statement after his arrest. Agent Hayes testified that he explained to Jackson at the outset of the interview that the grand jury had charged him with crack cocaine offenses; and consequently, the discussion was about crack cocaine. (JA 832-834, 837-38). Jackson admitted to Agent Hayes that he would usually pick up about nine ounces a week from his source in Nashville and bring it back to Russellville, Kentucky. Sometimes Jackson made more than one trip in a week. (JA 835). Jackson also discussed his prices. (JA 838). Agent Hayes asked Jackson about Marios Hines (also known as \u201cFrog\u201d) and Marcel Edwards (\u201cMeat Grease\u201d). Jackson admitted that he had dealt with Hines extensively, and that Hines had approached him about obtaining drugs within the last few days. (JA 836). Based on Jackson\u2019s statement to Agent Hayes, Agent Hayes\u2019s testimony, and testimony at trial, the district court found that Jackson was talking about crack cocaine in his statement to Agent Hayes and that Jackson possessed at least 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine (thereby making his base offense level thirty-eight under the Sentencing Guidelines). (JA 861-65). The district court observed that the highest offense level under U.S. S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 applied when a defendant\u2019s drug-trafficking offense involved 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. Thus, the court estimated, at the 9 ounces a week that Jackson said he usually picked up from his source, Jackson would have obtained 1.5 kilograms in six weeks and this would place him at an offense level of 38. (JA 861).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the district court acknowledged, even if Jackson was obtaining powder cocaine from his Nashville source, the evidence showed that he had distributed crack cocaine. Thus, the district court found that Jackson had possessed 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine during the time of the charged conspiracy, attributed that drug quantity to him, and determined that his base offense level would be 38. When re-sentencing Jackson, the district court relied on the same evidence, made the same findings, and arrived at the same conclusion. (JA 915-19, 930-32).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">C. Leadership Role Attributed to Jackson</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">At his original sentencing, the district court found that Jackson was at least one of the leaders of the criminal activity set out in Count one of the indictment and that there were five or more participants involved. The district court thus applied a four-level enhancement to Jackson\u2019s sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (JA 861-65). Based on these findings, the district court calculated Jackson\u2019s offense level as forty-two and his criminal history category was six, placing him in a sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines of 360 months to life imprisonment. (JA 366, 870). When re-sentencing Jackson, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>the district court relied on the same evidence supporting its earlier finding about Jackson\u2019s leadership role, once again calculated the Guidelines range to be 360 months to life, and once again sentenced Jackson to 360 months imprisonment. (JA 915-19, 930-32).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Jackson argues that the district court erred when it attributed to him a leadership role in the criminal conspiracy and thus applied a four-level enhancement when calculating the Guidelines sentencing range. In making this determination, the district should consider</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aho-dedup-1\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others. There can, of course, be more than one person who qualifies as a leader or organizer of a criminal association or conspiracy. This adjustment does not apply to a defendant who merely suggests committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 4 (2002). Here, the evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding and four-level enhancement. Testimony from Agent Hayes, Jackson\u2019s statement, and trial testimony show that (1) Jackson frequently purchased large amounts of cocaine that he would then sell to \u201cmiddlemen\u201d in the Russellville, Kentucky area; (2) he sold the drugs he had purchased in varying amounts to Edwards, Johnson and Hines, who then delivered even smaller amounts to others; (3) Jackson set the price for the drugs offered for sale to Edwards, Johnson and Hines; (4) Edwards testified that Jackson\u2019s prices were often \u201ctoo high,\u201d indicating that he claimed a right to a larger share of the fruits of the criminal activity; and (5) Jackson, Edwards, Hines, Johnson, and Merrell were all participants in the charged criminal activity. The district court\u2019s attribution of a leadership role to Jackson was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Jackson\u2019s and Hines\u2019 sentences.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-9\">.
