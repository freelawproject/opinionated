Spirtos appeals from the district court\u2019s order awarding $9,248 in attorneys\u2019 fees and $212.50 in costs to John B. Schlaerth, et al., for improperly removing this case to federal court. Defendants allege that the award of fees was improper and excessive; that plaintiffs did not follow proper procedures in pleading for fees; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>that defendants did not receive a chance to appeal the subsequent remand order back to state court, and that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel has a conflict of interest on this matter and must recuse himself. We review the district court\u2019s determinations of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>Husain v. Olympic Airways, </em>316 F.3d 829, 835 (9th Cir.2002). We review attorneys\u2019 fees awards for abuse of discretion. <em>Merritt v. Mackey, </em>932 F.2d 1317, 1324 (9th Cir.1991). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Defendants propose that removal to federal court was reasonable according to <em>Grable &amp; Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering &amp; Mfg., </em>545 U.S. 308, 312, 125 S.Ct. 2363, 162 L.Ed.2d 257 (2005), but this is incorrect. <em>Grable </em>did not deal with RICO lawsuits, and defendants have not shown that \u201csubstantial questions of federal law\u201d exist that would justify removal. <em>Id. </em>Defendants\u2019 claim that removal was justified under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1965 also fails since the venue provisions of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) only allow parties in a RICO action to bring other possible parties into court, not to bring non-RICO lawsuits into a RICO action. <em>Southmark Prime Plus, L.P. v. Falzone, </em>768 F.Supp. 487, 490 (D.Del.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Defendants also argue that the award of attorneys\u2019 fees was excessive. The district court methodically went through the steps of the lodestar method to calculate the award. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Defendants next claim that plaintiffs did not plead for attorneys\u2019 fees, did not file fee requests, and that defendants were not provided with adequate notice and the opportunity to be heard regarding attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The record, supports the plaintiffs\u2019 position. There is also no basis in the record to support defendants\u2019 claim that the plaintiffs were required to file fee requests. We have allowed the awarding of attorneys\u2019 fees on remand by motion. <em>Moore v. Permanente Medical Group, </em>981 F.2d 443, 445 (9th Cir.1992). Further, defendants had an opportunity to oppose the award since they filed an opposition brief on the subject and were able to fully litigate the underlying question of removal. Defendants\u2019 arguments on this claim fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">Defendants also claim they were improperly denied an appeal of the remand order. Such remand orders are unappealable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">Finally, defendants claim plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, Howard Janssen, has a conflict of interest, having previously worked in a law firm that represented Spirtos, and thus Janssen must withdraw from this lawsuit. Since plaintiffs\u2019 counsel does not currently represent any of the defendants, the question is whether a \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d exists between Janssen and Spirtos, with a special focus on three factors: \u201c(1) factual similarities between the two representations, (2) similarities in legal issues, and (3) the nature and extent of the attorney\u2019s involvement with the case and whether he was in a position to learn of the client\u2019s policy or strategy.\u201d <em>Adams v. Aerojet-General Carp., </em>86 Cal.App.4th 1324, 1332, 104 Cal.Rptr.2d 116 (2001). Nothing in the record suggest that Janssen ever was in a position to learn of Spirtos\u2019s policy or strategy, or even that the firm was repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>senting Spirtos at all. This claim also fails. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b221-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
