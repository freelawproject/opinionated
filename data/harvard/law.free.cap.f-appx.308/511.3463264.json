Plaintiffs brought the underlying action claiming that Defendants-Appellees the City of New York and the named New York City Police Department officials (\u201cDefendants\u201d) have violated Plaintiffs\u2019 rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments by the imposition of the city\u2019s new Parade Rules, which require group bicycle rides of 50 or more participants to obtain a permit in advance. In particular, Plaintiffs allege that the Parade Rules impose a burdensome and disorganized permitting process, severely restrict their spontaneous group expression, materially limit their right to travel, and dictate the terms on which they may associate for political and other purposes. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In this appeal, Plaintiffs argue that the district court\u2019s denial of a preliminary injunction was improper. Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that the district court committed fundamental error by: (1) failing to apply the requirement that restrictions on expressive conduct must be narrowly tailored, as outlined by the Supreme Court in <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. 781, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989); (2) making clearly erroneous factual findings, based on \u201cuncritical deference to the city\u2019s speculative and generalized assertions\u201d and on \u201cthe court\u2019s own perceptions\u201d about group bicycling; and (3) failing to recognize the constitutional gravity of the burdens imposed by the Parade Rules on Plaintiffs\u2019 rights to speech, travel, and association. We find no merit in these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">A motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting a government from taking action in furtherance of \u201cthe public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme\u201d should not be granted unless the movant \u201cdemonstrates both a likelihood of success on the merits, and the likelihood of irreparable harm if an injunction is not granted.\u201d <em>Vincenty v. Bloomberg, </em>476 F.3d 74, 83 (2d Cir.2007). When an injunction seeks to protect First Amendment rights, the Court must \u201cmake an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.\u201d <em>Metro. Opera Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Local 100 Hotel Employees &amp; Restaurant Employees Int'l Union, </em>239 F.3d 172, 176 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). This Court reviews the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. <em>Bery v. City of New York, </em>97 F.3d 689, 693 (2d Cir.1996). A district court abuses its discretion when: \u201c(1) its decision rests on an error of law (such as application of the wrong legal principle) or a clearly erroneous factual finding, or (2) its decision \u2014 though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding \u2014 cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Vincenty, </em>476 F.3d at 83 (internal quotation marks omitted). We see no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The applicable legal principles are well established. The Supreme Court in <em>Ward </em>held that \u201ca regulation of the time, place, or manner of protected speech must be narrowly tailored to serve the government\u2019s legitimate, content-neutral interests but that it need not be the least restrictive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>or least intrusive means of doing so.\u201d <em>Ward, </em>491 U.S. at 798, 109 S.Ct. 2746. \u201c[T]he requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied,\u201d explained the Supreme Court, \u201cso long as the ... regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 799, 109 S.Ct. 2746 (internal quotation marks omitted) (omission in original). At the same time, the Court cautioned that \u201c[t]o be sure, this standard does not mean that a time, place, or manner regulation may burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government\u2019s legitimate interests. Government may not regulate expression in such a manner that a substantial portion of the burden on speech does not serve to advance its goals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Frisby v. Schultz, </em>487 U.S. 474, 485, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 101 L.Ed.2d 420 (1988)); <em>Vincenty, </em>476 F.3d at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">This Court has stated that a content-neutral regulation furthering a legitimate government interest and imposing only an incidental burden on speech will be narrowly tailored \u201cif the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.\u201d <em>Vincenty, </em>476 F.3d at 84 (quoting <em>Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Fed. Commc\u2019n Comm\u2019n, </em>512 U.S. 622, 662, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994)) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). In other words, \u201c \u2018[t]he essence of narrow tailoring\u2019 is having the regulation \u2018foeus[ ] on the source of the evils the city seeks to eliminate ... and eliminate[ ] them without at the same time banning or significantly restricting a substantial quantity of speech that does not create the same evils.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84-85 (quoting <em>Ward, </em>491 U.S. at 799 n. 7, 109 S.Ct. 2746) (alterations in Vincenty).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In considering Plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction motion in this case, the district court correctly stated the standard for the granting of such a motion, and it correctly described the standards stated by the Supreme Court and this Court with regard to the balancing process that the Constitution requires where governmental regulations have an effect on speech. We cannot conclude that the district court\u2019s decision rested on an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Plaintiffs claim that the district court made errors in its findings of fact, contending that the court ignored evidence that the majority of their group bicycle rides did not implicate the City\u2019s interests in traffic flow, safety, or public convenience. The record shows, however, that the district court expressly considered Plaintiffs\u2019 expert testimony that \u201cgroup bicycle rides of 50 or more \u2018enhance safety and do not disrupt traffic.\u2019\u201d <em>Five Borough Bicycle Club v. City of New York, </em>483 F.Supp.2d 351, 371 (S.D.N.Y.2007). The court also considered Plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to show that group bicycling can be managed by ordinary traffic rules, and it critically examined the apparent inconsistency in Lieutenant Caneco\u2019s statements. <em>Id. </em>at 371-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">While the district court recognized that not every group bicycle ride of 50 or more participants will necessarily disrupt traffic, endanger others, or disobey traffic laws, it concluded that because \u201cgroup bicycle rides of that size can and do present such risks\u201d the Parade Rules requiring advance permitting of all group rides of 50 or more participants were likely justified. <em>Id. </em>at 374-75. \u201cAt some point,\u201d the district court wrote, \u201cbicycle rides of a certain magnitude require coordination with the police for everyone\u2019s safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The court also noted that the Parade Rules leave open alternative channels of expression: the rules do not ban group bicycle riding on public roads and leave almost all roads open to group cycling provided a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>permit is obtained; the rules do not appear to have any \u201ceffect on the quantity or content of [Plaintiffs\u2019] expression,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Ward, </em>491 U.S. at 802, 109 S.Ct. 2746); and in the event a permit is denied, the rules require the police department to employ reasonable efforts to offer the applicant a suitable alternative. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">In sum, while acknowledging that \u201csome groups of that size will proceed safely and with no detrimental impact on traffic,\u201d the court determined that, on balance, Defendants provided sufficient evidence to justify denial of a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of the 50-person threshold. <em>Id. </em>at 357, 371-73. The district court\u2019s factual findings were not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d and accordingly do not represent an abuse of its discretion. <em>Vin-centy, </em>476 F.3d at 83 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Finally, we speak to the severity of the burden imposed by the Parade Rules on Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights. The court explicitly recognized that Plaintiffs\u2019 rights to travel, freedom of association, and speech were potentially implicated by the Parade Rules. <em>Five Borough Bicycle Club, </em>483 F.Supp.2d at 361-69. The court then undertook a point-by-point analysis of Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints about the burdens imposed by the rules, in each case weighing the degree to which the alleged harm might encumber Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights. It also considered in-depth whether the rules left open ample alternative channels of expression. <em>Id. </em>at 375. The court did not draw any legally erroneous conclusions while so doing, nor were its factual findings with respect to this process \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Vincenty, </em>476 F.3d at 83 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court appropriately exercised its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Accordingly, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. We have considered all of Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. For the reasons stated herein, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
