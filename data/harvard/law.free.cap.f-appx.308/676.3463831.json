The immigration judge found Martinez failed to show he was of good moral character, that he had been continuously present in the United States for ten years or that his removal would be an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his family. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l) (2006). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-20\">We are without jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s affirmance of the immigration judge\u2019s finding that Martinez was not of good moral character or that his removal would be a hardship to his family, as defined under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l). <em>See Jean v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 481-82 (4th Cir.2006) (court does not have jurisdiction to review the denial of cancellation of removal); <em>see also Obioha v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d 400, 405 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201cIt is quite clear that the gatekeeper provision bars our jurisdiction to review a decision of the B[oard] to actually deny a petition for cancellation of removal or the other enumerated forms of discretionary relief.\u201d). We find substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Martinez was not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>tinuously present in the United States for ten years prior to service of the notice to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The Board\u2019s decision denying Martinez\u2019s motion to remand is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Obioha, </em>481 F.3d at 408. We find no abuse of discretion because Martinez failed to establish that the new evidence he intended on submitting was previously unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
