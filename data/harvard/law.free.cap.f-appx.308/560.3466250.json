Rakoff, of United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Petitioner-appellant Steven Singleton appeals the District Court\u2019s February 9, 2007 judgment denying his habeas corpus petition, which alleged ineffective assistance of counsel at his New York state trial. The District Court granted a certificate of appealability with respect to petitioner\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for eliciting inadmissible hearsay, and we granted a certificate of appealability with respect to petitioner\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to consult with an expert witness and for failing to call such a witness at trial. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s denial of the writ. <em>See, e.g., Doe v. Menefee, </em>391 F.3d 147, 163 (2d Cir.2004). Because petitioner\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance were presented to the state courts and adjudicated on the merits, <em>see People v. Singleton, </em>284 A.D.2d 249, 726 N.Y.S.2d 561 (1st Dept.2001), <em>aff'd </em>97 N.Y.2d 761, 742 N.Y.S.2d 622, 769 N.E.2d 368 (2002), we may issue the writ only if the state court\u2019s resolution of the claim \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). In other words, we may disturb the state court\u2019s determination only if its application of Supreme Court precedent manifests \u201csome increment of incorrectness beyond error,\u201d although the \u201cincrement need not be great.\u201d <em>Henry v. Poole, </em>409 F.3d 48, 68 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are governed by <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), which requires a petitioner to show both that his trial counsel\u2019s assistance was objectively unreasonable and that, but for counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome at trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">In this case, the Magistrate Judge concluded that trial counsel was not objectively deficient in failing to call as a witness a psychological expert, but the Magistrate Judge determined that counsel\u2019s failure to object to inadmissable hearsay \u2014 to wit, details of the offense revealed by witnesses whose testimony simply recounted what the victim had told them \u2014 amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. On this, ground alone, the Magistrate Judge found the state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>to be unreasonable and recommended that the District Court grant the writ. However, the District Court disagreed with the Magistrate Judge. The Court noted, \u201cAlthough the Court is far from convinced that it would have reached the same conclusion as the state court in weighing coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>sel\u2019s proffered strategic justification and finds [the Magistrate Judge\u2019s] analysis of the merits thoughtful and compelling, the Court cannot conclude that the state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>was objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Singleton v. Davis, </em>No. 03 Civ. 1446, slip. op. at 2, 2007 WL 152136 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 18, 2007) (opinion and order). <em>Cf. Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (\u201cStated simply, a federal habe-as court making the \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 inquiry should ask whether the state court\u2019s application of clearly established federal law was objectively reasonable.\u201d). Accordingly, the District Court denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Like the District Court and the Magistrate Judge, we conclude that trial counsel was not deficient in making a strategic decision not to call as a witness an expert in child psychology. <em>See Greiner v. Wells, </em>417 F.3d 305, 323 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cThe decision not to call a particular witness is typically a question of trial strategy that [reviewing] courts are ill-suited to second-guess .... [C]ounsel\u2019s decision as to whether to call specific witnesses \u2014 even ones that might offer exculpatory evidence \u2014 is ordinarily not viewed as a lapse in professional judgment.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (brackets in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">We also agree with the District Court\u2019s finding that the state court did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland </em>in determining that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to inadmissible hearsay did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. The record demonstrates that counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of second-hand accounts of the offense \u2014 his decision to elicit hearsay in at least one instance \u2014 was part of a strategy designed to highlight for the jury what defense counsel perceived to be an inconsistency between the victim\u2019s testimony and the physical evidence presented by the prosecution. <em>See Loliscio v. Goord, </em>263 F.3d 178, 195 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201c[I]n case after case, we have declined to deem counsel ineffective notwithstanding a course of action (or inaction) that seems risky, unorthodox or downright ill-advised.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). In any event, petitioner has failed to demonstrate that counsel\u2019s failure to object to inadmissible hearsay prejudiced him at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Accordingly, the state court did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland </em>in this case, and the District Court did not err in denying the writ. The February 9, 2007 judgment entered by the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
