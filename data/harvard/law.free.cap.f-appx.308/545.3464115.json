Nov. 30, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-19\">Our review in this case is limited to the BIA\u2019s November 2007 denial of Khatun\u2019s motion to reconsider, because that is the only decision from which she filed a timely petition for review. <em>See Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 89-90 (2d Cir.2001). As the government argues, however, Khatun waives any challenge to that decision. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Instead, Khatun\u2019s brief is devoted to challenging the findings the BIA made in denying her motion to reopen, a decision that is not properly before us. <em>See Ke Zhen Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 89-90. Because Khatun has effectively waived any challenge to the decision we are \u201cempowered to review,\u201d her petition for review must be denied. <em>See Nwogu v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 80, 84 (2d Cir.2007) (denying petition where applicant failed to raise \u201cany of the issues relevant\u201d to BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-20\">We note that even if Khatun had not waived such arguments, we would conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying her motion to reconsider where she merely repeated the same arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>that the BIA had previously considered and rejected in denying her motion to reopen. <em>See Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, Khatun\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
