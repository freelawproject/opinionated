Walker made repeated sexual advances towards Singleton at work, threatened Singleton when he spurned those advances, and called and sent a letter to Singleton\u2019s then-girlfriend \u2014 the mother of Singleton\u2019s child \u2014 alleging in graphic terms that Singleton had been unfaithful. Singleton and his girlfriend thereafter broke up, and he became depressed at work. Singleton subsequently sued Walker, the City of New York, and various employees of the City. Following a five-day trial, a jury awarded Singleton $1 million in damages on his claim that he had been subjected to a hostile work environment on account of his sex. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Ra-koff, J.) rejected the City\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial. The District Court did, however, reduce the damages award to $300,000. The City appeals, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because there was not sufficient evidence to establish a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">To state a Title VII claim based on a hostile work environment, a plaintiff must plead facts tending to show that the complained of conduct: \u201c(1) is objectively severe or pervasive \u2014 that is, ... creates an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive; (2) creates an environment that the plaintiff subjectively perceives as hostile or abusive; and (3) creates such an environment because of the plaintiffs sex.\u201d <em>Patane v. Clark, </em>508 F.3d 106, 113 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cJudgment as a matter of law may not properly be granted under Rule 50 unless the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the opposing party, is insufficient to permit a reasonable juror to find in [his] favor.\u201d <em>Galdieri-Ambrosini v. Nat\u2019l Realty &amp; Dev. Corp., </em>136 F.3d 276, 289 (2d Cir.1998). Reviewing <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s denial of the City\u2019s post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law, and applying the same standards as the District Court, <em>Madeira v. Affordable Hous. Found., </em>469 F.3d 219, 226-27 (2d Cir.2006), we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that Singleton faced a hostile work environment. And for substantially the same reasons as it did not err in granting the City\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, the District Court also did not abuse its discretion in denying the City\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">The City nonetheless argues that it is entitled to a further reduction in damages. New York law requires that a court grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>remittitur when a jury award \u201cdeviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation.\u201d N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5501(c) (McKinney 2008). <em>See Patterson v. Balsamico, </em>440 F.3d 104, 119 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab., </em>381 F.3d 56, 78 (2d Cir.2004), <em>vacated on other grounds sub nom KAPL, Inc. v. Meacham, </em>544 U.S. 957, 125 S.Ct. 1731, 161 L.Ed.2d 596 (2005). Under federal law, \u201cprimary responsibility for application of \u00a7 5501(c)\u2019s \u2018deviates materially1 check\u201d is \u201clodge[d] in the district court, not the court of appeals.\u201d <em>Gasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities, Inc., </em>518 U.S. 415, 438, 116 S.Ct. 2211, 135 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996). \u201cThis Court\u2019s function upon review of the district court\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether the district court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Patterson, </em>440 F.3d at 120. In the particular circumstances presented in this case, we cannot conclude that the District Court\u2019s refusal to lower the damages award was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We have considered all of Singleton\u2019s claims, and find them to be meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the decision of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
