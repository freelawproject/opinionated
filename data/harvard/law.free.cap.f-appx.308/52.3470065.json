We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), and we grant the petition in part, deny in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">1. Doherty challenges the BIA\u2019s determination that he did not establish changed or extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his failure to file his asylum application before the one-year filing deadline. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (D). We review the BIA\u2019s determinations regarding changed and extraordinary circumstances for substantial evidence. <em>Dhital v. Mukasey, </em>532 F.3d 1044, 1050 (9th Cir.2008) (extraordinary circumstances); <em>see Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 657 (9th Cir.2007) (changed circumstances). Doherty filed his application in 2005, five years after entering the United States and four years after learning that his brother in Northern Ireland had received a letter warning him that he was on a Loyalist/Protestant paramilitary group\u2019s \u201cdeath list.\u201d We hold that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that, even if the letter constituted changed circumstances, Doherty failed to file his asylum application within a reasonable time of learning of the letter. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Moreover, Doherty\u2019s lack of formal education, his soft-spoken nature, his difficulty in obtaining advice regarding asylum from attorneys with whom he consulted, and his despondency at being unable to legalize his status do not rise to the level of extraordinary circumstances. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(5). We therefore hold that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Doherty failed to establish extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimeliness of his asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">However, although Doherty raised the issue before the BIA the BIA did not consider whether the alleged erosion of the Irish peace process beginning in 2005, when Doherty filed his application for asylum, constituted changed circumstances that would excuse his failure to meet the one-year deadline. The BIA is \u201cnot free to ignore arguments raised by [a party].\u201d <em>Sagaydak v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 1035, 1040 (9th Cir.2005). We therefore grant the petition in part, and remand the case to the BIA to determine whether this alleged erosion of the Irish peace process constituted changed circumstances. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 1170, 1173 (9th Cir. 2007) (remanding to the BIA when it was not clear from the BIA\u2019s decision whether it had considered the effect of the petitioner\u2019s affidavits).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">2. Doherty also challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal to the United Kingdom based on its determination that Doherty could safely relocate within the United Kingdom. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i)(B). We review the BIA\u2019s withholding of removal determination for substantial evidence. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir. 2006). The BIA did not disturb the IJ\u2019s determination that Doherty had suffered past persecution, creating a presumption of eligibility for withholding of removal, <em>Hanna v. Keisler, </em>506 F.3d 933, 940 (9th Cir.2007), <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i), and shifting the burden to the government to show by a preponderance of evidence that Doherty could safely relocate within the United Kingdom, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1)(h). Substantial evidence, including evidence that Doherty\u2019s siblings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>continue to live in both England and Northern Ireland and a lack of evidence showing that the Loyalist/Protestant paramilitary groups that are a threat to Do-herty operate in England, supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Doherty could safely relocate within the United Kingdom and its denial of withholding of removal to the United Kingdom. We therefore deny Doherty\u2019s petition for review on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">PETITION GRANTED in part; DENIED in part; and REMANDED.
