We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity as to the facts, procedural history, and issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Plaintiff argues, primarily, that the ALJ erred in crediting the testimony of Dr. Gerald Greenberg, a medical expert, over that of Mr. Hancock\u2019s treating physicians and erred in disregarding a vocational expert\u2019s statement that Plaintiff could not perform his previous work. We review the District Court\u2019s judgment on the pleadings de novo. <em>Jasinski v. Barnhart, </em>341 F.3d 182, 184 (2d Cir.2003). We may, however, set aside the Commissioner\u2019s determinations only if they are not supported by substantial evidence or otherwise are based on incorrect legal standards. <em>See Bubnis v. Apfel, </em>150 F.3d 177, 181 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The Commissioner\u2019s decision that Plaintiff can perform his previous work is supported by substantial evidence. Several doctor\u2019s opinions as to Plaintiffs residual functional capacity support the ALJ\u2019s finding. The ALJ was permitted to credit other physicians\u2019 opinions over the opinion of Dr. Sureka and the opinion expressed in Dr. Mittal\u2019s first evaluation where, as here, the treating physicians lacked objective medical evidence supporting their opinions, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2); <em>see also Schisler v. Sullivan, </em>3 F.3d 563, 568 (2d Cir.1993), and \u201cthe treating physician issued opinions that are not consistent with other substantial evidence in the record, such as the opinions of other medical experts,\u201d <em>Halloran v. Barnhart, </em>362 F.3d 28, 32 (2d Cir.2004). Additionally, the Commissioner did not err in disregarding the vocational expert\u2019s opinion. The vocational expert did not testify that Plaintiff could not perform his previous work but rather offered an opinion about a hypothetical person with particular residual function.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">We have considered all of Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments and have found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
