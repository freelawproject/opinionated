Mar. 13, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The IJ found Ye removable to China and denied his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The BIA affirmed in August 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">More than two and a half years later (in December 2005), Ye moved to reopen his asylum petition based on \u201cchanged circumstances.\u201d Ye argued that he would face persecution in China based on (1) his marriage, the (then ending) birth of his second child in the United States, and hina\u2019s family planning policy; and (2) his recent involvement, through his wife, in Falun Gong. Ye claimed that Chinese authorities identified him in a crowd of Falun Gong protestors in front of the United Nations in New York, and had sent officials to his father\u2019s home in China with an arrest warrant. Ye appended to his motion affidavits from himself and his father, copies of recent articles concerning China\u2019s family planning policies and Falun Gong, and two photographs purportedly showing Ye holding banners during Falun Gong demonstrations in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">By order dated January 13, 2006, the BIA denied Ye\u2019s motion to reopen. The BIA ruled that the motion was untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of the final administrative decision, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and did not fall within any of the applicable exceptions to the timeliness requirement set forth 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Specifically, the exception for changed <em>country </em>conditions in the country of nationality was held inapplicable because Ye\u2019s evidence did not meet the \u201cheavy evidentiary burden\u201d required for renewed asylum applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">On February 9, 2006, Ye filed a \u201cMotion to Reconsider Motion to Reopen\u201d which argued that the BIA did not apply the correct <em>prima facie </em>standard in assessing his evidence of changed country conditions. Included was new evidence: a copy of a \u201cvillage notice\u201d issued to his family in China requesting Ye to return to China to accept punishment for his Falun Gong activities. Ye submitted a new application for asylum in conjunction with this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">The BIA construed Ye\u2019s motion as both a motion to reconsider and a motion to reopen, and denied both by order dated March 13, 2006. With respect to the motion to reconsider, the BIA adhered to its previous decision. With respect to the motion to reopen, the BIA ruled the motion untimely and number-barred pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, the BIA found that Ye had presented most of his evidence in his earlier motion to reopen, and that the allegedly new evidence \u2014 the \u201cvillage notice\u201d \u2014 could have been presented at that time. Ye petitioned for review on April 3, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">Only the BIA\u2019s March 13, 2006 decision is before us as that is the only decision from which a petition for review was timely filed. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>conclude that the BIA\u2019s decision with respect to that motion was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">1. Motion to Reconsider</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Construing Ye\u2019s February 9, 2006 motion as one for reconsideration, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in rejecting arguments that the agency had already considered and denied. <em>See Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir. 2006)(per curiam)(\u201cThe BIA does not abuse its discretion by denying a motion to reconsider where the motion repeats arguments that the BIA has previously rejected.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Ye\u2019s novel legal argument \u2014 that the BIA applied the wrong standard \u2014 fails because there is no indication that the BIA applied anything other than the <em>prima facie </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">2. Motion to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Nor did the BIA abuse its discretion in denying Ye\u2019s motion to reopen his asylum application. The regulations permit an alien to file only one motion to reopen, and require such a motion to be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). There is an exception to these time and number limitations when the motion to reopen is \u201cbased on changed circumstances <em>arising in the country of nationality </em>or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii)(emphasis added). This Court has recently held that an alien who is subject to a final removal order and who wishes to file a successive asylum application must do so in conjunction with a motion to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(3)(ii) and thus may not do so based solely on changed <em>personal </em>conditions. <em>Yuen Jin v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 143, 156 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">To the extent Ye\u2019s motion was based on the birth of his children and desire to have more children, it alleges a change in personal circumstances, and therefore does not excuse compliance with the time and number limitations. <em>See Li Yong Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 130-31 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 273-74 (2d Cir.2006)(\u201cThe law is clear that a petitioner must show changed country conditions in order to exceed the 90-day filing requirement for seeking to reopen removal proceedings.... A self-induced change in personal circumstances cannot suffice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">Ye also sought to reopen his asylum application on the ground of his new Falun Gong practice, and the issuance of an arrest warrant delivered in China. Even if such a development could amount to changed <em>country </em>conditions, it was no abuse of discretion for the BIA to deny Ye\u2019s second motion to reopen because Ye has not shown that he submitted any new evidence that was not available and could not have been discovered or presented in his previous motion to reopen. The only new evidence introduced in Ye\u2019s February 9, 2006 motion, as compared with his December 2005 motion to reopen, was an actual copy of the arrest warrant. This warrant was issued in October 2005, a full two months prior to the submission of Ye\u2019s December 2005 motion. Ye\u2019s parents may have delayed sending him a copy of the arrest warrant until a few months later, but that delay did not render the evidence unavailable. A movant bears a heavy burden to reopen matters due to discovery of previously unavailable evidence. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 107-08, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">Thus, the BIA\u2019s denial of Ye\u2019s motion to reopen was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>D. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">For the foregoing reasons, and because we find no merit in Ye\u2019s remaining arguments, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
