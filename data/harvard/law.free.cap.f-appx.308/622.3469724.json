Whitner argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the District Court mechanically applied the guideline range calculated in his Presentence Investigative Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) without due consideration of the other sentencing factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-16\">The government contends that Whit-ner\u2019s argument must fail because (1) the within-guidelines sentence was reasonable, and (2) Whitner waived his right to appeal his sentence in his plea agreement subject to several inapplicable exceptions. Relying on the latter contention, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-17\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. <em>See United States v. Gwinnett, </em>483 F.3d 200, 203 (3d Cir.2007). However, \u201cwe will not exercise that jurisdiction to review the merits of [a defendant\u2019s] appeal if we conclude that []he knowingly and voluntarily waived h[is] right to appeal unless the result would work a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-18\">Whitner does not reference his waiver of appeal in his appellate brief. It is, however, contained in the plea agreement, which is included in the Supplemental Appendix submitted by the government. (S.A. 26-30.) Section A.5 of the plea agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-19\">Regie Edward Whitner waives the right to take a direct appeal from his conviction or sentence ... subject to the following exceptions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-20\">(a) If the United States appeals from the sentence....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-21\">(b) If (1) the sentence exceeds the applicable statutory limits set forth in the United States Code, or (2) the sentence unreasonably exceeds the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>guideline range determined by the Court under the Sentencing Guidelines ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">(S.A. 27.) None of the exceptions apply here: the government has not appealed, Whitner\u2019s sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum of life, and the sentence imposed falls within the guideline range of 235-293 months determined by the District Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">As noted above, we must ensure that Whitner entered into the waiver knowingly and voluntarily, and that enforcement of the waiver would not work a miscarriage of justice. <em>Gwinnett, </em>483 F.3d at 203; <em>United States v. Khattak, </em>273 F.3d 557, 562-63 (3d Cir.2001). At the change of plea hearing, Whitner appeared in open court, heard a recitation of the content and scope of his plea agreement, including the appellate waiver (S.A. 12), and acknowledged that it accurately described the agreement he had reached with the government (S.A. 14). The District Court then specifically asked Whitner whether he understood that he was waiving his right to appeal subject to the exceptions stated above. (S.A. 16.) Whitner responded affirmatively. (S.A. 16-17.) The District Court thereafter accepted the plea, finding that it was \u201cknowing and voluntary.\u201d (S.A.23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In light of the foregoing, and Whitner not contending that his waiver was otherwise unenforceable, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\">. We note that the District Court applied a downward departure of one criminal history category pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(1) based on its conclusion that the recommended criminal history category of VI overstated the seriousness of two of Whitner\u2019s prior convictions for relatively minor drug offenses. (See A. 7, 10, 33.) This reduced the guideline range from 262-327 months, as recommended in the PSR, to 235-293 months. Whitner argues that, even with this reduction, the guideline range overstated his criminal history.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
