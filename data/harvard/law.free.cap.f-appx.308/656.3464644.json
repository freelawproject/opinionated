Ford seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008) motion. For the reasons that follow, we remand to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-24\">In civil cases in which the United States or its officer or agency is a party, parties have sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B). A district court may extend the time to appeal upon a motion filed within thirty days after expiration of the prescribed time and a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-25\">The district court\u2019s order was filed and entered on its docket on July 10, 2008. The district court received Ford\u2019s notice of appeal on September 22, 2008, which was after the sixty-day appeal period expired but before the expiration of the thirty-day excusable neglect period. In his notice of appeal, Ford stated that he received the July 10 order \u201cseveral weeks late,\u201d and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>requests permission to file a \u201ctimely notice\u201d of appeal. We liberally construe Ford\u2019s pro se filing as a motion for an extension of time to file his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Because the notice of appeal was filed within the excusable neglect period and because the district court has not ruled on the motion for extension, we remand this case to the district court for the limited purpose of enabling the district court to determine whether Ford has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the sixty-day appeal period. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
