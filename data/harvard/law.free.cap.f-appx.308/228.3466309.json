We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is de novo. <em>Toguchi v. Chung, </em>391 F.3d 1051, 1056 (9th Cir.2004). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Brooks\u2019s failure-to-protect claim because Brooks did not raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether defendant Millingar was deliberately indifferent to his safety. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (holding that \u201ca prison official cannot be found liable [for deliberate indifference] unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The district court properly granted summary judgment for defendants Harman and Yin Hui because Brooks did not raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether these defendants were deliberately indifferent to Brooks\u2019s serious medical needs. <em>See id.; Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (\u201c[A] complaint that a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d); <em>Jett v. Penner, </em>439 F.3d 1091, 1096 (9th Cir.2006) (stating prison officials may manifest deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s medical needs if they deny, delay or intentionally interfere with medical treatment).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Brooks\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
