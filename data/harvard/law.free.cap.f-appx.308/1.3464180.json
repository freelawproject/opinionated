On the state\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The court reasoned that the State of Wisconsin \u2014 the only defendant \u2014 cannot be sued for money damages under the civil-rights statutes. <em>See Lapides v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Ga., </em>535 U.S. 613, 617, 122 S.Ct. 1640, 152 L.Ed.2d 806 (2002); <em>Keri v. Bd. of Trs. of Purdue Univ., </em>458 F.3d 620, 641 (7th Cir.2006). What\u2019s more, the court explained, the suit would be barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because it challenges the propriety of Miller\u2019s criminal conviction. Miller appeals both the dismissal and a later order denying his motion to vacate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Miller argues in both appeals that the district court should have dismissed his complaint <em>without </em>prejudice, not with prejudice. Miller reasons that because he already had litigated and lost a postconviction challenge under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, the court was obligated to recharacterize this suit as an unauthorized \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition and dismiss it for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b); <em>Pavlovsky v. VanNatta, </em>431 F.3d 1063, 1064 (7th Cir.2005). In the alternative, says Miller, the district court was obligated to screen the complaint pri- or to service, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, and dismiss it at that state without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">These appeals, like Miller\u2019s complaint and his motion to vacate, are frivolous. Miller\u2019s arguments, if accepted, would turn on their heads rules designed to prevent prisoners from flooding the federal courts with frivolous litigation. The district court was not obligated to recharacterize Miller\u2019s complaint as a petition for habeas corpus. <em>See Poe v. United States, </em>468 F.3d 473, 476 (7th Cir.2006); <em>Melton v. United States, </em>359 F.3d 855, 858 (7th Cir. 2004). And while the court should have screened Miller\u2019s complaint and dismissed it immediately upon receipt, that omission was harmless from Miller\u2019s perspective because a dismissal for failure to state a claim, at any stage, should be with prejudice. <em>See Gladney v. Pendleton Corr. Fac., </em>302 F.3d 773, 775 (7th Cir.2002); <em>Paganis v. Blonstein, </em>3 F.3d 1067, 1071 (7th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">Miller\u2019s remaining arguments require no discussion. Miller has incurred \u201cstrikes\u201d for his complaint, his Rule 60(b) motion, and both of these appeals. He already had at least one strike, <em>Miller v. Morgan, </em>2005 WL 1364507, at *3 (E.D.Wisc.2005), so now with four more he has \u201cstruck out.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The judgments in both cases are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
