He was found guilty of both counts and sentenced to 252 months of imprisonment. On appeal, Lewis raises the following issues: (1) whether the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction for Count 2; (2) whether the district court erred by failing to give a lesser-included-offense instruction for Count 2; and (3) whether the district court erred by considering historical evidence of Lewis\u2019 drug dealing for purposes of sentencing. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">First, viewing the evidence as required, we find Count 2 is supported by substantial evidence, and therefore the district court properly denied Lewis\u2019 motion for acquittal on this count. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Alerre, </em>430 F.3d 681, 693 (4th Cir.2005). Second, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to deny Lewis a lesser-included-offense instruction for possession of cocaine for Count 2. <em>S. Atl. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Riese, </em>284 F.3d 518, 530 (4th Cir.2002) (providing standard). Finally, we perceive no clear error in the district court\u2019s factual findings regarding drug weight attributable to Lewis based on his prior drug dealing. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir. 1989) (providing standard); <em>see United States v. Hodge, </em>354 F.3d 305, 312-13 (4th Cir.2004) (referencing <em>U.S Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2) cmt. n. 9(B) (2007) and noting that when a defendant has committed multiple offenses similar to the charged offense, that conduct may be considered as relevant conduct for sentencing purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">Accordingly, we affirm Lewis\u2019 convictions and sentence. Although we grant Lewis\u2019 motion to file a pro se supplemental brief, we find no meritorious issues raised therein. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
