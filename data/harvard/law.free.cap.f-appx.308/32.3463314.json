At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied Jacobsen\u2019s motion for a downward departure for her family responsibilities under \u00a7 5H1.6 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (Guidelines). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-26\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b56-27\">In 1989, Jacobsen moved to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico (Cabo). Jacobsen began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>working as a real estate agent in Cabo and eventually became an independent franchisee of Coldwell Banker real estate company. As part of her real estate agency, Jacobsen maintained an escrow account with First International Bank (FIB) in San Diego, California. Jacobsen directed clients who wanted to purchase real estate in Cabo to wire funds for the purchase of the Cabo property to the FIB escrow account. Jacobsen told her clients the money wired to the escrow account would be held in the account and used to purchase the property the client desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">In September 2001, one of Jacobsen\u2019s clients wired money to the FIB escrow account for the purchase of property in Cabo. The client learned in December 2001 Jacobsen had not used the money wired to the FIB escrow account for the acquisition of the Cabo property. A subsequent investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation revealed Jacobsen had been transferring some of the money her clients were wiring to the FIB escrow account to various bank accounts in Mexico. Jacob-sen then used the clients\u2019 money for Jacob-sen\u2019s own personal expenses and other liabilities rather than the purchase of the clients\u2019 designated property.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">On September 19, 2006, a federal grand jury indicted Jacobsen on one count of wire fraud, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, in connection with the money Jacobsen\u2019s client wired to the FIB escrow account in September 2001. Jacobsen pled guilty to this charge on August 17, 2007. Before her sentencing hearing, Jacobsen filed a motion asking the district court for a downward departure under \u00a7 5H1.6 of the Guidelines due to her family circumstances and responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court denied Jacobsen\u2019s motion for a downward departure. The district court then sentenced Jacobsen to 27 months imprisonment, payment of $804,035.14 in restitution, payment of a $100 special assessment, and three years supervised release. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">Jacobsen argues the district court abused its discretion in denying her motion for a downward departure under \u00a7 5H1.6. Jacobsen contends a downward departure was warranted because she is the sole caretaker, as well as the only financial and emotional support, for her husband, who has several serious health problems which make day-to-day tasks virtually impossible for him to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">Once a district court denies a motion for a downward departure under \u00a7 5H1.6, the district court\u2019s decision is unreviewable unless there has been a claim that the district court acted with an unconstitutional motive or was unaware of its authority to make a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Phelps, </em>536 F.3d 862, 868 (8th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>525 F.3d 627, 629 (8th Cir.2008)); <em>United States v. Orozco-Rodriguez, </em>220 F.3d 940, 942 (8th Cir.2000) (affirming a denial of a request for a downward departure under \u00a7 5H1.6 because \u201cwe have consistently held that the district court\u2019s decision <em>not </em>to depart downward is unreviewable so long as the court was aware of its authority to depart\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">Neither of the exceptions for reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a downward departure is present in Jacobsen\u2019s case. Jacobsen does not allege the district court acted with any unconstitutional motive, and the district court was aware of its authority to depart downward under \u00a7 5H1.6. During the sentencing hearing, the district court heard argument from Jacobsen\u2019s counsel and the government regarding Jacobsen\u2019s family circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>and her motion for a downward departure. The district court then \u201caccepted] basically the representations made by Ms. Jacob-sen with respect to her husband and her caring for him in his medical condition as true and accurate,\u201d and denied Jacobsen\u2019s motion for a downward departure. The district court explained it did \u201cnot think this is a case which is so out of the ordinary from other cases where a primary caregiver commits a crime,\u201d and \u201c[t]he crime which was committed here is an extremely serious one.\u201d Based upon this record, there are no grounds to reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Jacobsen\u2019s motion for a downward departure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-16\">. The Honorable Richard H. Kyle, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b58-16\">. The government also argues the district court's sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable under <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Jacobsen has not raised any challenge to the reasonableness of the sentence. Jacobsen confined her arguments to the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for a downward departure under \u00a7 5HI.6. Thus, we need not address the government\u2019s superfluous argument regarding the reasonableness of Jacobsen\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
