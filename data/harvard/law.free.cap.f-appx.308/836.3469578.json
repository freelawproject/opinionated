We review the district court\u2019s dismissal <em>de novo, </em>accepting all of Gutierrez\u2019s allegations as true. <em>See In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Gen. Elec. Capital Corp. v. Posey, </em>415 F.3d 391, 395 (5th Cir.2005). Finding no error, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Gutierrez asserts that dismissal of her claims under Rule 12(b)(6) was error because she adequately pleaded a RICO violation. She further contends that the district court\u2019s dismissal orders are insufficient and deprived her of due process because they do not provide reasons for the granting of the defendants\u2019 motions. Gutierrez seeks remand for \u201ca proper ruling\u201d with a written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Gutierrez\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s dismissal orders in the instant case were improper for lack of findings and conclusions is without merit. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 52(a)(3). Moreover, in stating that the defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motions were \u201cmeritorious and well-taken,\u201d the district court accepted the grounds for dismissal advanced by the defendants and thus implicitly found that Gutierrez had failed to state a claim under RICO and that her claims were alternatively barred by res judicata. Such a statement provides this court with sufficient reasons to conduct effective review. <em>Cf. McIncrow v. Harris County, </em>878 F.2d 835, 836 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Applying <em>de novo </em>review and accepting all of Gutierrez\u2019s allegations as true, the district court did not err in its ruling. Gutierrez\u2019s complaints did not allege any RICO \u201centerprise.\u201d <em>See In re Burzynski, </em>989 F.2d 733, 743 (5th Cir. 1993). Moreover, the complaints did not allege the requisite \u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d because Gutierrez did not plead two or more related acts of racketeering that either constituted or threatened continued criminal activity. <em>See id. </em>at 742. Thus, she failed to state a claim for a RICO violation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">Moreover, the claims Gutierrez raised were complaints against the defendants for negligence and/or fraud arising out of her original wrongful-termination lawsuit. As such, the claims were barred by her prior unsuccessful state-court malpractice lawsuit against the same defendants. <em>See Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Gutierrez\u2019s claims under Rule 12(b)(6) was proper. Her allegation that the July 3, 2007, dismissal orders were not properly signed by the district court judge due to the proximity of the July 4 holiday is wholly speculative and finds no support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">Gutierrez additionally argues that the district court erred in denying her Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(1) motion because she demonstrated excusable neglect. She contends that the court\u2019s scheduling order provided her until July 21, 2007, to respond to the motions to dismiss and that the entry of a dismissal order prior to that date was improper. Contrary to Gutierrez\u2019s assertions, the district court did not abuse its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>denying Gutierrez\u2019s Rule 60(b)(1) motion because her misunderstanding of the applicable time limits does not give rise to the requisite excusable neglect. <em>See Edward H. Bohlin Co. v. Banning Co., </em>6 F.3d 350, 353, 357 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b862-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
