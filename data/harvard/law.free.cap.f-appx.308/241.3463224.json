Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we must uphold the finding \u201c \u2018unless the evidence presented compels a reasonable factfinder to reach a contrary result.\u2019 \u201d <em>de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Lopez-Reyes v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 908, 911 (9th Cir. 1996)). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The IJ cited \u201cspecific cogent\u201d reasons for the adverse credibility determination, including Singh\u2019s demeanor, inconsistent statements, and vague, hesitant and unresponsive testimony during the merits hearing, and these reasons are supported by evidence in the record. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002). In addition, the IJ did not engage in speculation or conjecture in finding Singh\u2019s testimony that he fled India because he was afraid for his life inconsistent with his decision to sit for a college exam before fleeing. See <em>Jibril v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1129, 1135 (9th Cir.2005) (noting that an IJ may apply \u201ccommon sense\u201d in evaluating the plausibility of testimony). The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, and therefore we uphold the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision to deny Singh\u2019s CAT claim because Singh based the claim on the testimony found to be incredible. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1157 (9th Cir. 2003). Singh did not point to other record evidence which would compel a finding that if he were returned to India, he would more likely than not be tortured. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b265-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

Where, as here, the BIA adopts and affirms the decision of the IJ in its entirety, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were that of the BIA. <em>See Abebe v.
