Dec. 31, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 890 192 Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 13, 2006. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-22\">When the BIA\u2019s decision affirms in part and modifies in part the decision of the IJ, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as modified by the BIA. <em>See Brito v. Mukasey, </em>521 F.3d 160, 163 (2d Cir.2008). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). For applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see Matter of J-Y-C-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 260, 265 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">As an initial matter, because Chen fails to raise any challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of her CAT claim before this Court, it is deemed waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Regarding Chen\u2019s asylum and withholding claims, we find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The agency appropriately relied on the implausibility of Chen\u2019s testimony that the same three cadres that came to her home to collect her also performed the surgical abortion on her. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 168 (2d Cir.2008). Chen\u2019s contention that she underwent a non-surgical abortion is contradicted by her testimony, in which she stated that the three village cadres held her down on an operating table where they scraped her uterus and ordered her not to move while doing so. The agency also reasonably relied on inconsistencies between Chen\u2019s testimony and her statements in her airport interview, where she said that she had no fear of returning to China, only a \u201cworry\u201d about abortion policies, and she did not mention the forced abortion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Because substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, the agency\u2019s denial of Chen\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal was not improper. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006) (recognizing that withholding of removal claims must fail if petitioner is unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim and the claims are based on the same factual predicate).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
