We have carefully reviewed the administrative record and find that we lack jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s order of November 30, 2007. <em>See Tamenut v. Mukasey, </em>521 F.3d 1000, 1002-05 (8th Cir.2008). We thus dismiss the petition for review in part with respect to that order. Next, we find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s denial of Kamara\u2019s second motion to reconsider. We accordingly deny the petition for review with respect to that order for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In Re: Kamara </em>(B.I.A. Apr. 8, 2008). We deny Kamara\u2019s motion to remand and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">\n<em>PETITIONS DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
