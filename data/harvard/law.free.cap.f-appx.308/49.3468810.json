SMITH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b74-11\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">Michael Doran, Dana Doran, and Reel Big Fish (collectively \u201cthe Dorans\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in their action against the Kaanapali Hillside Homeowner\u2019s Association, members of its board of directors, its property manager, and the law firm representing the Association (collectively \u201cKHHA\u201d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-14\">Prior to the hearing, the Dorans requested this court to take judicial notice of materials from the state court proceedings and KHHA moved to strike this request and the opening brief. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 201, we grant the Dorans\u2019 request for judicial notice and deny KHHA\u2019s motion to strike the Dorans\u2019 opening brief. Materials from a proceeding in another tribunal are appropriate for judicial notice. <em>See Papai v. Harbor Tug &amp; Barge Co., </em>67 F.3d 203, 207 n. 5 (9th Cir.1995), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>520 U.S. 548, 117 S.Ct. 1535, 137 L.Ed.2d 800 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-15\">We review de novo a grant of summary judgment regarding (1) collateral estoppel, (2) res judicata, and (3) the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d). <em>Littlejohn v. United States, </em>321 F.3d 915, 919 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Slenk v. Transworld Sys., Inc., </em>236 F.3d 1072, 1074 (9th Cir.2001). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-16\">We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that the Dorans were collaterally es-topped from proceeding on their claims for fraud and misrepresentation. Under Hawaii law, an appellate court does not err when it grants summary judgment on issues and facts that were previously determined in a prior suit. <em>See Kaho\u2018ohanohano v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>117 Hawai\u2019i 262, 178 P.3d 538, 578 (2008). The state trial court previously determined that KHHA was entitled to assessments. Therefore, the Dorans\u2019 allegations of fraud and misrepresentation for asserting that KHHA was entitled to assessments are foreclosed. While the district court erred in granting summary judgment, by adopting the state circuit court decision prior to the Hawaii appellate courts\u2019 affirming of the judgment, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The Dorans claim that the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment denied them the opportunity to discover facts necessary to preclude summary judgment. However, this argument was never raised in the district court and the Dorans failed to file the appropriate Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">A court may deny leave to amend after considering factors such as \u201cbad faith, undue delay, prejudice to the opposing party, futility of the amendment, and whether the party has previously amended his pleadings.\u201d <em>Bonin v. Calderon, </em>59 F.3d 815, 845 (9th Cir.1995). Futility alone can justify a court\u2019s refusal to grant leave to amend. <em>See id. </em>We find that any amendment of the Dorans\u2019 third amended complaint would be futile. The Dorans also failed to specify what allegations they would add or revise if allowed to do so. Therefore, we deny the Dorans\u2019 request for leave to amend their complaint for a fourth time.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Finally, the district court did not err in granting the motion for summary judgment as to the Dorans\u2019 FDCPA claims. KHHA was not a debt collector under the FDCPA, because it was collecting its own debt. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6). There is no evidence in the record to substantiate the Dorans\u2019 claims that KHHA\u2019s attorneys were debt collectors within the meaning of the FDCPA. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b74-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
