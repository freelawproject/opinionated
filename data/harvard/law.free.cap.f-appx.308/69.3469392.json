Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that Robinson\u2019s reports were not protected speech because they were made as part of his professional duties or because he failed to present the reports through the chain of command as required by written department policy. The district court denied the motion, finding \u201cgenuine issues of material fact\u201d on the scope of Robinson\u2019s job duties and holding that a violation of a written chain of command policy was not dispositive, but was merely one of the factors to be considered as part of the balancing test established in <em>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., </em>391 U.S. 563, 571, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Although a district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity is subject to immediate appeal as a collateral order, the scope of appellate jurisdiction is limited to questions of law. <em>Moran v. Washington, </em>147 F.3d 839, 843 (9th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 528 <em>&amp; </em>n. 9, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985)) (\u201cA public-official defendant may appeal the \u2018purely legal\u2019 issue \u2018whether the facts alleged ... support a claim of [violation of] clearly established law.\u2019\u201d). A defendant may not \u201cappeal a district court\u2019s summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether the pretrial record sets forth a \u2018genuine\u2019 issue of fact for trial.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Jones, </em>515 U.S. 304, 319-20, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">A First Amendment claim against a public employer must establish: (1) engagement in constitutionally protected speech, (2) an adverse employment action, and (3) the employee\u2019s speech was a \u2018substantial or motivating\u2019 factor in the adverse action. <em>Freitag v. Ayers, </em>468 F.3d 528, 543 (9th Cir.2006). At this stage, Defendants challenge only the conclusion that Robinson\u2019s allegations could support a finding that he engaged in constitutionally protected speech under clearly established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">When evaluating whether an employee\u2019s speech is constitutionally protected, courts must \u201cdetermine first whether the expressions in question were made by the speaker ... upon matters of public concern, ... second whether the state lacked adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public,\u201d and third \u201cwhether the plaintiff spoke as a private citizen, [rather than] a public employee.\u201d <em>Posey v. Lake Pend Oreille Sch. Dist. No. 84, </em>546 F.3d 1121, 1130-31 (9th Cir.2008) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">Even where an employee did engage in constitutionally protected speech, a qualified immunity summary judgment motion requires courts to decide whether the rights the plaintiff claims were \u201cclearly established at the time of the alleged deprivations,\u201d viewing \u201cthe disputed facts in the light most favorable to [the plaintiff].\u201d <em>Brewster v. Bd. of Educ., </em>149 F.3d 971, 976-977 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">\n<em>Public Concern</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">To be protected under the First Amendment, an employee\u2019s speech must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>address \u201ca matter of legitimate public concern.\u201d <em>Pickering, </em>391 U.S. at 571, 88 S.Ct. 1731. \u201c[T]he competency of the police force is surely a matter of great public concern.\u201d <em>McKinley v. City of Eloy, </em>705 F.2d 1110, 1114 (9th Cir.1983). Only speech that deals with \u201cindividual personnel disputes and grievances\u201d and that would be of \u201cno relevance to the public\u2019s evaluation of the performance of governmental agencies\u201d is generally not of \u201cpublic concern.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Robinson alleges he was retaliated against for, among other things, testifying in a class action lawsuit that the County had engaged in systematic discrimination and harassment against OPS officers, reporting numerous instances of possible corruption, discrimination, or misconduct by fellow OPS officers, and following up on those complaints. With the exception of the three incidents identified by the district court as individual personnel disputes, each of these is clearly a \u201cmatter of public concern.\u201d <em>See Thomas v. City of Beaverton, </em>379 F.3d 802, 809 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cUnlawful conduct by a government employee or illegal activity within a government agency is a matter of public concern.\u201d); <em>Johnson v. Multnomah County, </em>48 F.3d 420, 425 (9th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Roth v. Veteran\u2019s Admin., </em>856 F.2d 1401, 1405 (9th Cir.1988)) (The \u201cmisuse of public funds, wastefulness, and inefficiency in managing and operating government entities are matters of inherent public concern.\u201d); <em>see also Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 148, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983) (speech merits stronger protection when employee seeks \u201cto bring to light actual or potential wrongdoing or breach of public trust\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Defendants concede that some of Robinson\u2019s \u201cinternal reports of certain alleged misconduct involved matters of public concern,\u201d but contend that others did not. They argue that Robinson\u2019s follow-up communications pressing his reports of misconduct are not \u201cmatters of public concern,\u201d citing <em>Douglas v. Lexington-Fayette Urban County Gov\u2019t, </em>2007 WL 3355481, at *6, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82818, at *18 (E.D.Ky. Nov. 7, 2007), which held that plaintiffs\u2019 complaints are not matters of public concern where they are \u201cabout the job performance of their coworkers\u201d and \u201cthe intent of the plaintiffs [is] not to protect public safety, but rather to complain about the management\u2019s response to the situation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Robinson, his complaints, unlike those of the plaintiffs in <em>Douglas, </em>did not merely contain \u201cpassing references to public safety [that] were \u2018incidental to the message conveyed,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>but rather were motivated by the danger the misconduct posed and the need to respond to it. Whether OPS treats complaints of misconduct seriously or fails to followup is also a matter of \u201crelevance to the public\u2019s evaluation of the performance of governmental agencies\u201d and consequently a matter of public concern. <em>Coszalter v. City of Salem, </em>320 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Defendants suggest that Robinson\u2019s reports \u2014 regarding an officer suspected of working for an outside employer while on the clock and alleged discrimination against another officer \u2014 both addressed individual personnel disputes, not matters of public concern. Reports pertaining to others, even if they concern personnel matters including discriminatory conduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>can still be \u201cprotected under the public concern test.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>379 F.3d at 808 (explaining that though employee\u2019s speech \u201cconcerned a personnel matter, it did not pertain to [her] own job status\u201d); <em>see also Alpha Energy Savers, Inc. v. Hansen, </em>381 F.3d 917, 926 (9th Cir.2004) (holding \u201cinvidious discrimination\u201d inherently a matter of public concern \u201cwhether it consists of a single act or a pattern of conduct\u201d); <em>Cochran v. City of Los Angeles, </em>222 F.3d 1195, 1201 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cAlthough focused on one employee and not addressed directly to the public, the speech here did concern matters which are relevant to the public\u2019s evaluation of its police department.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Robinson\u2019s testimony in a class action against the County is also of public concern, regardless of whether it had an impact on the result of that litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 927 (\u201c[A] public employee\u2019s testimony addresses a matter of public concern if it contributes in some way to the resolution of a judicial or administrative proceeding in which discrimination or other significant government misconduct is at issue \u2014 even if the speech itself would not ... in isolation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\n<em>Adequate Justi\u00f1cation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Courts must also seek to balance the interests of the employee, \u201cin commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d <em>Pickering, </em>391 U.S. at 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731. \u201cFor us to find that the government\u2019s interest as an employer in a smoothly-running office outweighs [an employee\u2019s] first amendment right, defendants must demonstrate actual, material and substantial disruption,\u201d or \u201creasonable predictions of disruption.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>856 F.2d at 1407; <em>Waters v. Churchill, </em>511 U.S. 661, 673, 114 S.Ct. 1878, 128 L.Ed.2d 686 (1994); <em>see also Keyser v. Sacramento City Unified Sch. Dist., </em>265 F.3d 741, 749 (9th Cir.2001) (noting that \u201ca showing of actual disruption will weigh more heavily\u201d). \u201c[T]he workplace disruption hurdle for government employers is higher in cases, like this one, where the speech involved unlawful activities rather than policy differences.\u201d <em>Key-ser, </em>265 F.3d at 749 (citing <em>Moran, </em>147 F.3d at 849 n. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Ninth Circuit cases applying <em>Pickering </em>to an \u201cemployee\u2019s reports of \u201cwastefulness, mismanagement, unethical conduct, violations of regulations, and incompetence\u2019 \u201d to his supervisor hold \u201cthat the public\u2019s interest in learning about illegal conduct by public officials and other matters at the core of First Amendment protection outweighs a state employer\u2019s interest in avoiding a mere potential disturbance to the workplace.\u201d <em>Keyser, </em>265 F.3d at 747-48 (discussing <em>Gilbrook v. City of Westminster, </em>177 F.3d 839, 867-70 (9th Cir. 1999); <em>Roth, </em>856 F.2d at 1403-08; and <em>Johnson, </em>48 F.3d at 425-27). In the context of \u201cgood-faith whistleblowing\u201d involving reports within a government department rather than to the public, \u201cthe breadth of one\u2019s audience is irrelevant\u201d because \u201c[i]t would be absurd to extend First Amendment protection only to those whistleblowers who immediately appear on the local news.\u201d <em>Hufford v. McEnaney, </em>249 F.3d 1142, 1150 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\n<em>Chain of Command</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">Defendants argue an exception to this clearly established law exists, citing <em>Sanchez v. City of Santa Ana, </em>936 F.2d 1027, 1039 (9th Cir.1990), which states that there is \u201cno constitutional violation in requiring officers to communicate \u2018through channels\u2019 before enlisting public opinion to their cause.\u201d <em>Sanchez </em>limited its holding, however, to cases where the \u201cchannels\u201d policy \u201cis reasonable and not arbitrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[E]ven in a police department, the complained-of disruption must be \u2018real, [and] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>not imagined\u2019 \u201d and the \u201cdisruption exception cannot \u2018serve as a pretext for stifling legitimate speech or penalizing public employees for expressing unpopular views.\u2019 \u201d <em>Allen v. Scribner, </em>812 F.2d 426, 432 (9th Cir.1987) (citing <em>McKinley, </em>705 F.2d at 1115); <em>accord Brockell v. Norton, </em>732 F.2d 664, 667 (8th Cir.1984) (courts cannot \u201cdecide in the abstract, however, that a chain-of-command policy designed to protect [a police department\u2019s] interest[s] will always take precedence over the interest of a public employee in open communication\u201d and \u201cmust look to the particular circumstances of each case to determine the importance of enforcing the chain of command against an employee whose speech breaches that policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The <em>Pickering </em>balancing test can favor protected speech even where the speech violates the employer\u2019s written policy requiring speech to occur through specified \u201cchannels.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Central Point School Dist., </em>746 F.2d 505, 506 (9th Cir. 1984); <em>see also Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 153 n. 14, 103 S.Ct. 1684 (violation of a rule governing the circumstances when speech is permitted would strengthen a claimant\u2019s position in the <em>Pickering </em>balance, but alone would not be dispositive).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Defendants correctly note that we have sometimes found a police department\u2019s interests in discipline and <em>esprit de corps </em>to outweigh First Amendment interests, but even in these cases, the <em>Pickering </em>balancing was not conducted while genuine issues of material fact (including the extent of the workplace disruption) remained. <em>See, e.g., Cochran, </em>222 F.3d at 1196 (finding the city\u2019s interest in the proper functioning of its police department outweighed plaintiffs\u2019 expressive interests, but only after a detailed discussion of the facts as found at trial); <em>Kannisto v. San Francisco, </em>541 F.2d 841, 843-44 (9th Cir.1976) (noting that \u201c[t]he facts in this case sharply contrast with those in <em>Pickering </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Therefore, although the existence of a written \u201cchain of command\u201d policy may be relevant to evaluating workplace disruption, it is not dispositive, particularly given the allegations suggesting that Robinson\u2019s superiors may have been more concerned with the frequency with which Robinson reported misconduct than the persons to whom he directed those reports. When the <em>Pickering </em>test must be applied and \u201cthere are underlying factual issues regarding the extent of office disruption,\u201d it is proper to deny a motion for summary judgment. <em>Roth, </em>856 F.2d at 1408.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">\n<em>Scope of Job Duties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Defendants also argue that Robinson\u2019s reports were made in conjunction with his official job duties and therefore were not protected by the First Amendment under <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). The district court found that whether the scope of Robinson\u2019s duties included reporting police misconduct was contested and presented a \u201cgenuine issue of material fact for trial,\u201d a holding we lack jurisdiction to review. <em>See Johnson, </em>515 U.S. at 319-20, 115 S.Ct. 2151. In so concluding, the district court noted that the message that Robinson should make fewer misconduct reports, which he claims he repeatedly received from his supervisors, \u201ctends to undermine the assertion by Defendants that the reports Robinson made were within the scope of his duties unless one is to believe that certain duties must not be performed if one wants to advance in the organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">Although OPS policy states that an OPS member \u201cshall promptly report to his immediate supervisor any information or incident coming to his attention that might indicate the need for Office of Public Safety actions,\u201d formal job requirements are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>not dispositive. <em>Garcetti </em>rejected \u201cthe suggestion that employers can restrict employees\u2019 rights by creating excessively broad job descriptions,\u201d holding that formal job descriptions are \u201cneither necessary nor sufficient to demonstrate that conducting [a] task is within the scope of the employee\u2019s professional duties.\u201d <em>Garcetti </em>547 U.S. at 424-25, 126 S.Ct. 1951. <em>Garcetti </em>therefore demands a \u201cpractical\u201d inquiry. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Under Ninth Circuit precedent, the scope of Robinson\u2019s job duties is a question of fact. <em>Posey, </em>546 F.3d at 1130. \u201c[W]hen there are genuine and material disputes as to the scope and content of the plaintiffs job responsibilities, the court must reserve judgment ... until after the fact-finding process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\n<em>Qualif\u00eded Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Because a \u201cconstitutional right would have been violated were [the plaintiffs] allegations established,\u201d the next step in evaluating a claim to qualified immunity \u201cis to ask whether the right was clearly established.\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). \u201cWhether an official protected by qualified immunity may be held personally liable for an allegedly unlawful official action generally turns on the \u2018objective legal reasonableness\u2019 of the action assessed in light of the legal rules that were \u2018clearly established\u2019 at the time it was taken.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987) (citing <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818-19, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). The plaintiff \u201cbears the burden of proving that the rights [he] claims were \u2018clearly established\u2019 at the time of the alleged violation.\u201d <em>Moran, </em>147 F.3d at 844. The \u201ccontours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>483 U.S. at 640,107 S.Ct. 3034. \u201cNotwithstanding this particularity requirement, \u2018closely analogous preexisting case law is not required to show that a right was clearly established.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hufford, </em>249 F.3d at 1148 (citing <em>White v. Lee, </em>227 F.3d 1214, 1238 (9th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">All of the key decisions discussed <em>supra </em>were decided well before April of 2005, when Robinson first might have been considered for promotion to lieutenant. The Supreme Court had decided <em>Pickering, </em>establishing that the First Amendment protects employee speech on matters of \u201clegitimate public concern,\u201d in 1968. <em>Pickering, </em>391 U.S. at 571-72, 88 S.Ct. 1731. It was also already clear that only a \u201creal, not imagined, disruption\u201d might outweigh the expressive interests of the employee, that this exception cannot serve as a \u201cpretext,\u201d and that \u201cemployers would be required to make an even \u2018stronger showing\u2019 of disruption when the speech dealt ... directly with issues of public concern.\u201d <em>McKinley, </em>705 F.2d at 1114. An employer\u2019s written policy requiring speech to occur through specified \u201cchannels\u201d had been held insufficient to justify retaliation motivated by protected speech. <em>Anderson, </em>746 F.2d at 506. \u201c[M]isuse of public funds, wastefulness, and inefficiency in managing and operating government entities\u201d had been held \u201cmatters of inherent public concern.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>856 F.2d at 1405. Therefore, at the time defendants acted in 2005 and 2006, both the constitutional protection of employee speech and a First Amendment cause of action for retaliation against protected speech were clearly established and potentially applicable to defendants\u2019 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">In 2006, the Supreme Court clarified the existence of an exception to these precedents, holding unprotected \u201cexpressions employees make pursuant to their professional duties.\u201d <em>Garcetti, </em>547 U.S. at 426, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>126 S.Ct. 1951. If the plaintiffs version of the facts, including his professional duties, turns out to be inaccurate, defendants may then be entitled to qualified immunity under <em>Garcetti </em>At this stage, however, the court evaluates only the sufficiency of the plaintiffs factual allegations and therefore \u201cmust reserve judgment on this third prong of the protected status inquiry until after the fact-finding process.\u201d <em>Posey, </em>546 F.3d at 1131. The district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b94-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-6\">.
