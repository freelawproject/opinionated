He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ninety-four months and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $67,357.51. He now appeals. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">In late September 2005, Little stole two rolls of credit card receipts from a gas station in Palmerton, Pennsylvania. The rolls of receipts contained credit and debit card numbers used to make purchases at the gas station from September 13, 2005 to September 16, 2005, and from September 19, 2005 to September 22, 2005. Little gave the rolls to a friend, who gave them to another friend, who in turn gave them to Brian Lee Morgan. Morgan used the information on the receipts to make counterfeit credit and debit cards. As payment for his efforts, Little received several fraudulent credit cards in the name \u201cR. Little,\u201d which he used to buy $763.40 worth of goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The other credit and debit cards made using the information from the rolls of receipts yielded far more extensive fraudulent purchases. The rolls contained approximately 886 account numbers. In an effort to determine whether any of the credit and debit card accounts suffered losses, Secret Service Special Agent Kelly Fincher identified the banks that issued each of the credit and debit card numbers on the stolen rolls and contacted the fraud investigators at each of the banks. The fraud investigators orally reported losses of $154,369.15. Fincher requested documentation from the banks to support the reported losses. The banks provided error resolution reports, victim affidavits, police reports, and other computerized bank records. The documentation supported only $67,357.51 in losses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">On April 12, 2007, a grand jury sitting in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania returned a four count superseding indictment charging Little with one count of possessing fifteen or more unauthorized access devices, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(3); one count of causing the production of and trafficking in counterfeit access devices, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(1); and two counts of aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028A(a)(l) and 2. On August 27, 2007 \u2014 the eve of trial \u2014 Little moved to dismiss one of the aggravated identity theft counts for lack of venue. The District Court granted the motion, and Little proceeded to plead guilty to the remaining three counts without a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">At sentencing, the District Court adopted the Sentencing Guideline range recommended in the Presentence Report.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court grouped the two 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a) counts, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d). The third count \u2014 aggravated identity theft \u2014 could not be grouped because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) mandates a consecutive sentence of twenty-four months. The grouped offenses yielded a base offense level of six, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1. Guideline \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l) instructs the Court to increase the offense level according to the amount of any consequential loss from the offense. However, \u201c[i]n a case involving any counterfeit access device or unauthorized access device,\u201d such as this case, the loss <em>\u201cshall not he less than </em>$500 per access device.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 3(F)(i) (emphasis added). Because approximately 886 credit and debit cards were involved here, each with a minimum loss of $500, the resultant loss was greater than $400,000, and the offense level was thus increased by fourteen. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H). Because there were more than ten victims, the offense level was increased by two, <em>see id. </em>at \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A), although that increase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>was offset by a two-level acceptance of responsibility reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a). The government did not move for an additional reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(b) because Little waited until the eve of trial to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The total offense level for the grouped counts, therefore, was twenty which, when considered with Little\u2019s criminal history category of VI, resulted in a Guideline range of seventy to eighty-seven months. The mandatory twenty-four month consecutive sentence for aggravated identity theft resulted in an adjusted Guideline range of ninety-four to 111 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Little was also subject to mandatory restitution pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A, in an amount to be determined by the District Court at sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3664(e); <em>see United States v. </em>Leahy, 438 F.3d 328, 331 (3d Cir.2006) (en banc) (\u201cthe amount a defendant must restore to his or her victim need not be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). The government called Fincher to testify as to how she calculated the losses caused by Little. She stated that she organized the credit and debit cards by the bank from which they were issued, and then contacted the fraud investigators at each bank to inquire about the relevant account numbers. The fraud investigators orally reported losses totalling $154,369.15, of which $67,357.51 was documented.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Little objected to Fincher\u2019s testimony contending that it was improper for her to testify to the contents of bank records and victims\u2019 reports, and asserting that her testimony was unreliable hearsay. Little argued that bank employees must authenticate their records and explain their policies regarding reliance on police and victim reports in documenting fraud. The District Court disagreed and overruled Little\u2019s objection. The Court, however, only credited documented loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">As noted at the outset, the District Court imposed a sentence of ninety-four months imprisonment, and ordered restitution in the amount of $67,357.51.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">On appeal, Little renews his objection to Fincher\u2019s testimony and to the bank records admitted into evidence at the sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-14\">The admissibility of hearsay at sentencing is a question of law, and is subject to plenary review. <em>See United States v. Brothers, </em>75 F.3d 845, 848 (3d Cir.1996). \u201cThe admission of hearsay statements in the sentencing context is subject to the requirements of the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>482 F.3d 244, 246 (3d Cir.2007).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cUnder the precedent of this Court, hearsay statements must have some \u2018minimal indicum of reliability beyond mere allegation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Kikumura, </em>918 F.2d 1084, 1102 (3d Cir.1990), overruled on other grounds by <em>United States v. Grier, </em>449 F.3d 558 (3d Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-15\">We are thus presented with the question of whether the government\u2019s evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>loss, which it introduced to establish the amount of restitution, bore \u201csufficient indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>United States v. Brigman, </em>350 F.3d 310, 315 (3d Cir.2003). Fincher testified that fraud investigators at the banks involved provided documents in the form of bank records; victim statements, including affidavits and letters, often supported with credit card bills with unauthorized charges circled or highlighted; and police reports. Those records are of the type routinely relied upon by banks in determining whether or not to bill credit card holders for allegedly fraudulent charges made using their cards. We have found similar evidence to be sufficiently reliable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Leekins, </em>493 F.3d 143, 149-50 (3d Cir.2007) (admitting at sentencing unverified police report even though officers who prepared the report did not testify at hearing); <em>United States v. Paulino, </em>996 F.2d 1541, 1548 (3d Cir.1993) (holding that special agent\u2019s testimony regarding discussions with a confidential informant met \u201cthe standard of minimum indicia of reliability\u201d). The Eleventh Circuit, faced with similar facts, concluded that a letter from a bank\u2019s attorney specifying the amount of bank fraud was sufficiently reliable, even absent his testimony. <em>United States v. Hairston, </em>888 F.2d 1349, 1353 (11th Cir. 1989). We similarly conclude that \u201cthe evidence offered by the government through the testimony of [Fincher] easily passes\u201d the minimal indicia of reliability threshold. <em>Robinson, </em>482 F.3d at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Little\u2019s counsel also argues, but only at Little\u2019s request, that Little was entitled to a one-level reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(b). This argument is entirely without merit. Guideline \u00a7 3El.l(b) states that an additional one-level reduction for timely notifying the government of intent to plead guilty may be granted only \u201cupon motion of the government.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at cmt. n. 6 (\u201cBecause the Government is in the best position to determine whether the defendant has assisted authorities in a manner that avoids preparing for trial, an adjustment ... may only be granted upon a formal motion by the Government at the time of sentencing\u201d). No such motion was made here, nor was one called for, given that Little did not plead guilty until the eve of trial. \u201cAccordingly, the absence of a government motion left the District Court powerless to grant the adjustment ... under \u00a7 3El.l(b).\u201d <em>United States v. Drennon, </em>516 F.3d 160, 162 (3d Cir.2008).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\">. That amount included the $763.40 spent by Little.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b658-13\">. The Presentence Report was prepared using the 2006 United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\">. We have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b659-9\">. This holds true even in the wake of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). As we stated in <em>Robinson, post-Crawford, </em>\"[t]he law on this issue is well settled ... the Confrontation Clause does not apply in the sentencing context and does not prevent the introduction of hearsay testimony at a sentencing hearing.\" 482 F.3d at 246; <em>see also United States v. Roche, </em>415 F.3d 614, 618 (7th Cir.2005) (\"the relevant provision at sentencing is the [D]ue [Pjrocess [Cjlause, not the [Cjonfrontation [Cjlause ... witnesses providing information to the court after guilt is established are not accusers within the meaning of the [Cjonfron-tation [Cjlause\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b660-5\">. As we stated in <em>Drennon, </em>the government\u2019s broad discretion to decline to file a \u00a7 3E 1.1(b) motion is not unlimited. 516 F.3d at 162. The government is \u201csubject, of course, to constitutional restraints,\u201d and may not base its decision on the defendant\u2019s race, religion, or gender. <em>Id. </em>It did not do so here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
