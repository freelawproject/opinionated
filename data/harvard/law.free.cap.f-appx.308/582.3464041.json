Appellant alleged that the Superior Court of Pennsylvania and the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia violated her constitutional rights by failing to follow certain Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure during the course of proceedings she initiated to challenge Wachovia Bank\u2019s final account of Appellant\u2019s son\u2019s finances in its role as Guardian of his estate. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>District Court granted Appellant <em>in forma pauperis </em>status and dismissed her complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We agree with the District Court that the state courts, as state entities, are entitled to immunity from suit in federal court pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Benn v. First Judicial Dist. of Pa., </em>426 F.3d 233, 240-41 (3d Cir.2005). Appellant fails to allege any claims against Wachovia Bank in the instant action. Accordingly, we conclude that this appeal presents no \u201csubstantial question,\u201d and will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4 &amp; I.O.P. 10.6. Appellant\u2019s motions to expand the District Court record, for leave to correct clerical mistakes, and for leave to file a revised notice of appeal are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
