Pearson pled guilty to Counts 3, 4 and 5 relating to a bank robbery committed on January 25, 2007, and a jury convicted him of Counts 1 and 2 relating to a bank robbery committed on January 12, 2007. On appeal, Pearson challenges: (1) the district court\u2019s denial of his motion <em>in li-mine </em>and objections at his trial, pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), to the introduction of extrinsic evidence of the January 25, 2007 robbery; and (2) his sentence on the grounds that his prior conviction should not have been considered a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a), and that his sentence was unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">We review the district court\u2019s admission of prior crimes or bad acts under Fed. R.Evid. 404(b) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1267 (11th Cir.2008). In applying the standard, we will reverse only if an erroneous ruling resulted in \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d and will affirm \u201cunless the district court has made a clear error of judgment or has applied an incorrect legal standard.\u201d <em>Conroy v. Abraham Chevrolet-Tampa, Inc., </em>375 F.3d 1228, 1232 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). The decision to classify a defendant as a career offender is a question of law also reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>Furthermore, we review a sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">First, we reject Pearson\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) by admitting evidence of an extrinsic bank robbery committed by Pearson on January 25, 2007. Generally, \u201c[ejvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Thus, \u201c[ejvidence of extrinsic offenses is inadmissible to prove that the accused has the propensity to commit the crime charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Veltmann, </em>6 F.3d 1483, 1498 (11th Cir.1993). Extrinsic evidence \u201cmay, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">To be admissible under Rule 404(b), \u201c(1) the evidence must be relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character; (2) there must be sufficient proof so that the factfinder could find that the defendant committed the extrinsic act; and (3) the evidence must possess probative value that is not substantially outweighed by undue prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>443 F.3d 772, 779 (11th Cir.2006). Unfair prejudice, however, can be mitigated by limiting instructions from the court. <em>United States v. Diaz-Lizaraza, </em>981 F.2d 1216, 1225 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Pearson focuses exclusively on the third prong of <em>Perez </em>test, asserting in his brief that \u201cit seems as if the only issue for this Court to determine is whether the probative value of the 404(b) evidence to prove \u2018identity\u2019 substantially outweighs the risk of \u2018unfair prejudice\u2019 to the Defendant.\u201d When evidence is introduced to prove identity, its probity \u201cdepends upon both the uniqueness of the modus operandi and the degree of similarity between the charged' crime and the uncharged crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Myers, </em>550 F.2d 1036, 1044-45 (5th Cir.1977).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While \u201cit is not necessary that the charged crime and the other crimes be identical in every detail[,j they must possess a common feature or features that make it very likely that the unknown perpetrator of the charged crime and the known perpetrator of the uncharged crime are the same person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1045. <em>See also United States v. Lail, </em>846 F.2d 1299, 1301 (11th Cir.1988) (\u201cthe likeness of the offenses is the crucial consideration. The physical similarity must be such that it marks the offenses as the handiwork of the accused.\u201d) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">The record here shows that the physical similarities between the January 12 and January 25 bank robberies were sufficiently similar to mark them as the \u201chandiwork\u201d of the same individual and, thus, demonstrate a <em>modus operandi. Lail, </em>846 F.2d at 1301. Not only did both robberies involve a lone perpetrator wearing a coat and hat to rob a bank with a black handgun who told the bank\u2019s occupants to \u201cget down\u201d and placed the money in a black zippered backpack, but also, in both robberies, the robber wore a camouflage bandana over his face and light-colored gloves, jumped over the tellers\u2019 counters, and escaped in a vehicle without a license plate \u2014 which in total, amounts to a sufficiently unique <em>modus operandi. </em>Furthermore, Pearson presented no evidence of dissimilarities between the two robber<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ies. Thus, the evidence of the January 25 robbery was sufficiently probative of the identity of the perpetrator of the January 12 robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Moreover, the probative value of this evidence was not substantially outweighed by undue prejudice. Due to conflicting testimony, the identity of the January 12 perpetrator remained at issue throughout the trial, and the <em>modus operandi </em>of the January 25 robber remained relevant to the identity of the January 12 robber. Furthermore, the district court read limiting instructions to the jury at two points during trial \u2014 before the January 25 witnesses testified and at the close of all the evidence \u2014 which greatly diminished the risk of undue prejudice. <em>Diaz-Lizaraza, </em>981 F.2d at 1225. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the extrinsic evidence of the January 25 robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Next, we find no merit to Pearson\u2019s claim that the district court erred in imposing the career-offender sentencing enhancement based in part on his prior conviction for discharging a firearm into an unoccupied vehicle. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant is a career offender if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">(1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">(2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">(3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqq-dedup-0\">any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">To determine if a crime is a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d a court should \u201clook only to the elements of the convicted offense, and not to the conduct underlying the conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>527 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). We have \u201cbroadly interpreted \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s definition to include crimes that do not fit neatly into a category of hostile, aggressive acts[]\u201d but do involve \u201ca serious potential risk of physical injury----\u201d <em>United States v. McGill, </em>450 F.3d 1276, 1280 (11th Cir.2006) (collecting cases). The burden of proof for establishing that a sentence enhancement is warranted lies with the prosecution, and the district court must insure that the prosecution carries its burden of proof. <em>Young, </em>527 F.3d at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">Pearson was previously convicted of violating Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-ll-61(a), which provides that \u201c[n]o person shall shoot or discharge a firearm, explosive or other weapon which discharges a dangerous projectile into any occupied or unoccupied dwelling or building or railroad locomotive or railroad ear, aircraft, automobile, truck or watercraft in this state.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-ll-61(a). A person who violates this section with regard to an unoccupied vehicle commits a Class C felony, as opposed to a Class B felony with regard to an occupied vehicle. Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-11-61(b) and (c). We have held in an unpublished opinion that a conviction for a violation of Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-ll-61(a) was a crime of violence within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), because discharging a firearm into a dwelling \u2014 occupied or unoccupied \u2014 involved a potential risk of physical injury. <em>United States v. Rabb, </em>248 Fed.Appx. 133, 134 (11th Cir.2007) (unpublished). In light of the analysis in <em>Rabb </em>and our broad interpretation of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), the district court did not err in determining that Pearson\u2019s conviction for discharging a firearm into an unoccupied vehicle was a crime of violence and, thus, correctly adjusted Pearson\u2019s offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Finally, we are unpersuaded by Pearson\u2019s argument that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we typically perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">We recognize that \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). In addition, the district court should acknowledge that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but it need not explicitly discuss each of them. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">In determining Pearson\u2019s sentence, the district court discussed several of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the need to provide restitution to the victims, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for just punishment for the offense, and the sentencing guidelines. The court imposed a sentence below the sentencing guidelines range, acknowledging that an in-range sentence \u201cwould not achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing and ... would essentially be too great a punishment in this case.\u201d Because the district court sentenced Pearson below the guidelines range and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in detail, Pearson cannot satisfy his burden of establishing that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>sentence was unreasonable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, the sentence was not greater than necessary, as the district court took into account the seriousness of the offense and the need to provide for just punishment, both of which are proper considerations under \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, Ala., </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) <em>(en banc), </em>we adopted as binding precedent decisions of the former Fifth Circuit issued before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b403-8\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). According to the statute, the district court shall impose a sentence that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b404-16\">. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462 (holding that a court of appeals may afford a presumption of reasonableness to a within-Guidelines sentence); <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1314 n. 8 (11th Cir.2007) (noting that, although we have not normally afforded a within-Guidelines sentence a presumption of reasonableness, the <em>Rita </em>decision calls that policy into question).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
