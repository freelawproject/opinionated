The IJ made an adverse credibility finding, and determined Kaur had failed to meet her burden of proof on her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Adverse credibility findings are reviewed under the deferential substantial evidence standard and will be upheld unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>Tawadrus v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir.2004). Where the BIA affirms the decision of the IJ without opinion, the court treats the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">Kaur\u2019s testimony at the hearing contained numerous inconsistencies and ambiguities \u2014 including as to her identity and political affiliation \u2014 that go to the heart of her claim, and substantial evidence thus supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Kaur failed to meet her burden of proof on her applications for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">Moreover, Kaur relies solely on her testimony, which was properly deemed incredible, in contending she established eligibility for relief under CAT. The record contains no other probative evidence suggesting it would be \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that Kaur would be subject to torture if returned to India. Substantial evidence thus supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion Kaur failed to meet her burden of proof on her application for relief under CAT. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283-84 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-14\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b168-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
