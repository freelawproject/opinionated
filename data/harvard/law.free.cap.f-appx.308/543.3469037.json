Horn, which denied his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Alion Woppa, </em>No. A73 620 813 (B.I.A. Aug. 9, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A73 620 813 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 29, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The IJ\u2019s determination was predicated upon its finding that Woppa\u2019s testimony was not credible. That credibility, determination, however, is flawed. In finding Woppa not credible, the IJ relied on two purported inconsistencies that are not supported by the record. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">First, the IJ found Woppa\u2019s testimony that he was just a financial contributor to the Front Liberation for the Africans Mauritania (\u201cFLAM\u201d) and did nothing else for the organization was contradicted by his subsequent testimony that he participated in two FLAM demonstrations and attended several meetings. The record reveals, however, that Woppa testified that he \u201cjust gave [FLAM] money to participate.\u201d Contrary to the IJ\u2019s findings, this statement does not indicate that Woppa\u2019s role was limited to financial contributions or that Woppa did not participate in meetings or demonstrations. Indeed, Woppa\u2019s statement that he gave money \u201cto participate\u201d indicates that he <em>did </em>participate in FLAM activities. In fact, when asked about FLAM, he expressly stated that he participated in meetings and demonstrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Second, the IJ found Woppa\u2019s claim that he was arrested and detained for seven months from April 1989 until November 1989 to be inconsistent with his later assertion that he was arrested only once in November 1989. The IJ based that finding on Woppa\u2019s statement that he \u201cwas never arrested besides the day that we were taken out of the country.\u201d Woppa\u2019s statement, however, while perhaps confusing does not contradict his other statements. Woppa testified that he and his family were arrested in April 1989 at which time his family was taken to Senegal and he was held for seven months, until November 1989, at which time he joined his family. This is consistent with his statement that he was arrested only once. And while his statement that the arrest occurred when <em>\u201cwe </em>were taken out of the country\u201d was slightly confusing, the \u201cwe\u201d accurately referred to the rest of his family and arguably referred to himself as well insofar as the April arrest and departure to Senegal meant that he too no longer had a home in the country, as evidenced by his immediate departure to join his family in Senegal upon his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Because the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was based on these two purported inconsistencies that were not supported by the record, we find that the credibility determination was flawed and remand for reconsideration. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307. Because the BIA did not review the IJ\u2019s alternate finding that Wop-pa found a \u201csafe haven\u201d in Senegal, we cannot review that finding. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 107 n. 1, 122 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Woppa failed to challenge before the BIA the IJ\u2019s denial of his claim for relief under the CAT. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to consider any challenge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the agency\u2019s denial of his application for CAT relief, and dismiss the petition for review to that extent. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>see also Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Beharry v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 51, 59 (2d Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED in part and DISMISSED in part. The decision of the BIA is VACATED and REMANDED for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
