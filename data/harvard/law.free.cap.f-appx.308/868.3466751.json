BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b892-27\">Defendant Ricardo Cornejo pleaded guilty, without the benefit of a plea agreement, to one count of conspiracy to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1). Cornejo now appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred by finding that he obstructed justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>and by refusing to grant him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">After investigating Cornejo for a period of time, law enforcement authorities intercepted a shipment of drugs that included over 1600 pounds of marijuana; Cornejo and three co-defendants were arrested, and Cornejo eventually pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute marijuana. At least two of Cornejo\u2019s co-defendants admitted that the conspiracy consisted of three shipments, and indicated that Cornejo was involved in all three. Cornejo, however, never acknowledged being involved with three shipments: at his plea hearing, he attempted to limit his involvement in the conspiracy, and during his presentence interview he admitted only that he had been involved with one shipment, and denied involvement with the other two.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">At sentencing, the government argued that Cornejo should receive an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstructing justice, and that he should not be entitled to any reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility. In support of its obstruction-of-justice argument, the government presented the testimony of Cornejo\u2019s co-defendant, Ruben Reyna, and Reyna\u2019s girlfriend, Yesenia Pena. Both testified that after Corne-jo was arrested for the drug charges and released on bond, he made threats against the two of them, apparently in an attempt to influence Reyna\u2019s testimony. Pena testified that Cornejo told her to tell Reyna to \u201cstick to the story,\u201d and that \u201cif something were to happen [Cornejo] was going to ... send some people ... [to] pick up [Pena] and [Reyna\u2019s] father.\u201d She also testified that Cornejo referred to Reyna as a \u201csnitch\u201d on a separate occasion. Reyna testified that Cornejo told him that he knew the addresses of Reyna\u2019s relatives and that Reyna\u2019s \u201cfamily was going to be hurt\u201d should he cooperate with the government. The district court found Pena a credible witness, and, while specifically acknowledging that Reyna\u2019s long criminal history might, under other circumstances, undermine his credibility, the court nonetheless credited the testimony of both witnesses, finding that Reyna\u2019s testimony corroborated the story told by Pena. The district court found that Cornejo had obstructed justice under \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">In support of its acceptance-of-responsibility argument, the government pointed out that, under Application Note 4 to \u00a7 3E1.1, it was only in \u201cextraordinary cases\u201d that a defendant who obstructed justice could also be found to have accepted responsibility, and further, that Cornejo had not \u201cclearly\u201d accepted responsibility because he consistently denied his involvement in activity that amounted to relevant conduct and never admitted to the full extent of his involvement in the conspiracy. The district court once again agreed with the government and refused to grant Cornejo any reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"axv-dedup-1\">A. Obstruction of Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s application of the obstruction enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, we review the district court\u2019s factual determinations for clear error; we review de novo its determination that specific conduct constituted obstruction of justice. <em>United States v. Camejo, </em>333 F.3d 669, 674-75 (6th Cir. 2003). The Sentencing Guidelines provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajb-dedup-1\">If (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>fendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The district court did not err by accepting the testimony of Reyna and Pena; neither is its finding clearly erroneous that this testimony established that Cornejo did, in fact, make threats for the purpose of influencing Reyna\u2019s testimony. Pena, a witness the district court found to be credible, corroborated the testimony of Reyna. And clearly the district court was correct that such conduct constitutes obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1. Attempts to obstruct evidence need not be backed by actual physical violence, nor do they even need to be detailed with much specificity. <em>United States v. Bingham, </em>81 F.3d 617, 632 (6th Cir.1996). Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding that Cor-nejo obstructed justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">B. Acceptance of Responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">\u201cWe review the determination of whether a defendant has accepted responsibility [under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 ] for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Paulette, </em>457 F.3d 601, 608 (6th Cir.2006). Section 3E1.1 provides that the offense level shall be decreased by two levels if a \u201cdefendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d The defendant bears the burden of showing that he has accepted responsibility. <em>Paulette, </em>457 F.3d at 608. Application Note 4 to \u00a7 3E1.1 provides that \u201c[cjonduct resulting in an enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct. There may, however, be extraordinary cases in which adjustments under both \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 and 3E1.1 may apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">As the district court correctly recognized, Application Note 4 to \u00a7 3E1.1 makes clear that Cornejo\u2019s burden of demonstrating acceptance of responsibility was especially difficult to meet in light of the court\u2019s finding that he had obstructed justice. And the district court did not err in concluding that Cornejo did not satisfy that burden. Cornejo never expressly acknowledged the full extent of his involvement in the conspiracy, and he provided nothing to demonstrate his acceptance of responsibility except the facts that he eventually pleaded guilty and did not object to the use of relevant conduct at sentencing. The district court found this was not one of these \u201cextraordinary cases\u201d which both \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 and 3E1.1 may be applied. We agree. We find no error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
