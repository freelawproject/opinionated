Cisneros, 328 F.3d 610, 613 </em>(10th Cir.2003). Applying these standards of review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Pretrial detention is governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142. Under \u00a7 3142(e) and (f), a defendant may be detained only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions of release \u201cwill reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other person and the community.\u201d But \u00a7 3142(e) also establishes two rebuttable presumptions favoring detention: one applicable to certain previous violators and one applicable to certain drug-and-ffrearm offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u201cOnce [a] presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant,\u201d but \u201cthe burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the community always remains with the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Stricklin, </em>932 F.2d 1353, 1354-55 (10th Cir.1991). \u201cThe defendant\u2019s burden of production is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a defendant\u2019s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for consideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">In this case, the magistrate judge conducted an arraignment and detention hearing and found probable cause to believe defendant had committed a drug offense for which the maximum term of imprisonment is ten years or more. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3142(e)(3)(A). Thus, the drug-and-firearm-offender presumption applied and defendant was presumed to be both a flight risk and danger to the community. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3142(e)(1). The magistrate judge also found defendant\u2019s \u201cfamily ties to Mexico\u201d made him a flight risk. ApltApp. at 29. On appeal of the magistrate judge\u2019s order, the district court affirmed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145 (setting forth process for appealing detention decisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">In challenging his detention in this court, defendant first advances a novel interpretation of \u00a7 3142(e). He asserts that no presumption arises unless the government shows that defendant has a qualifying prior conviction <em>and </em>has \u201cbeen found by probable cause to have committed the charged offense.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 8. In the absence of any case-law support for conflating the \u201cprevious-violator\u201d presumption and the drug-and-firearm-offender presumption, we decline to credit this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">Next, defendant claims that the record lacks evidence concerning danger to the community and likelihood of flight risk. The record, however, indicates that the charged crime involves a copious amount of methamphetamine and that defendant employed a sophisticated method of carrying the substance. Additionally, defendant, a resident alien, is employed only intermittently. His mother, one daughter, and fifteen of his siblings live in Mexico. Although defendant produced some evidence supporting his release, we determine the evidence presented to the district court, coupled with the detention presumption, demonstrates that the government sustained its burden of proving defendant is a danger to the community and a flight risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-18\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
