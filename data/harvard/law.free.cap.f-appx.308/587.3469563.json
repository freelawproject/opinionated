For the following reasons, the Petition will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Because we write primarily for the parties, who are familiar with this case, we need not reiterate the factual or procedural background of this appeal except insofar as may be helpful to our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">In a May 2001 hearing before the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) on an application for deferral of removal under the U.N. Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), Thomas claimed that he more likely than not would be tortured if repatriated to Haiti. In granting Thomas\u2019 application for deferral of removal, the IJ found that testimony Thomas provided the Government to support the prosecution of several Haitian drug dealers in the United States would put him at unique risk of harm \u2014 rising to the level of torture \u2014 if repatriated to Haiti. The IJ also found persuasive Thomas\u2019 documentary evidence showing the deplorable conditions in Haitian prisons. In November 2003, the BIA reversed the IJ\u2019s decision and ordered that Thomas be deported. The BIA rejected Thomas\u2019 testimony that he would be individually targeted by those connected to the drug dealers against whom he had testified and determined that prison conditions in Haiti did not alone establish the requisite probability of torture. The BIA relied upon <em>Matter of J-E-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 291 (BIA 2002), to support its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">In December 2006, we denied Thomas\u2019 first petition for review, finding that the BIA had applied the proper specific intent requirement to Thomas\u2019 CAT claim. <em>See Thomas v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>210 Fed.Appx. 195, 202 (3d Cir.2006). We also denied Thomas\u2019 request for remand for additional fact-finding because we determined we lacked jurisdiction to do so under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) and \u00a7 1252(b)(a)(4)(A). <em>Id. </em>at 203. We did suggest, however, that Thomas could move to reopen removal proceedings on the basis of changed country conditions, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(n), despite the fact that he sought deferral of removal, rather than withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>(citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.17(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">In March 2007, Thomas filed a motion to reopen based on both a change in the legal standard applied to CAT claims and changed conditions in Haiti. The BIA denied the motion on August 31, 2007. At the outset of its analysis, the BIA stated it would \u201cfirst consider whether the respondent ha[d] established changed circumstances in Haiti that warrant reopening.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> App. at 2. The BIA then rejected Thomas\u2019 claim that \u201cthere ha[d] been a change in the <em>analysis of claims </em>for protection under the Convention Against Torture.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Lavira v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>478 F.3d 158, 168 (3d Cir.2007) (emphasis added), <em>overruled by Pierre v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>528 F.3d 180 (3d Cir.2008) (en banc)). The BIA also disagreed that \u201cthe proffered evidence established] that conditions ha[d] deteriorated since March 22, 2002, when [the BIA] issued [its] decision in <em>Matter of J-E-,\u201d </em>despite finding that Thomas\u2019 motion was \u201csupported by extensive evidence regarding country conditions in Haiti.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. Rather, the BIA found Thomas\u2019 documents \u201c[did] not show that conditions in Haiti ha[d] worsened since the time of the respondent\u2019s removal hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the BIA found that, at the time of Thomas\u2019 May 2001 removal hearing, the IJ \u201cwas on notice ... of these conditions in Haiti based on other evidence of record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The BIA ultimately denied Thomas\u2019 motion and concluded that he \u201cha[d] failed to show a reasonable likelihood that he can establish that he [would] more likely than not ... be tortured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The BIA has jurisdiction over a motion to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(b) and \u00a7 1003.2(c). We have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal pursuant to \u00a7 242 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\u201cINA\u201d), codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) and as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B., 119 Stat. 231 (2005) (\u201cREAL ID Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Because Thomas was convicted in 1991 of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, an aggravated felony, he is deportable under the INA. <em>See generally 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1227(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). We generally lack jurisdiction \u201cto review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ni) or \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Notwithstanding the jurisdiction-stripping provision of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we retain jurisdiction under \u00a7 106 of the REAL ID Act to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Because our jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(a)(2) remains strictly limited to \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law,\u201d however, we lack jurisdiction to review any factual or discretionary determinations made by the BIA. <em>See Alaka v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>456 F.3d 88, 102 (3d Cir.2006) (\u201c \u2018[D]espite the changes of the REAL ID Act, factual or discretionary determinations continue to fall outside [our] jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Sukwanputra v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 627, 634 (3d Cir.2006))).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Our review under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2) is extremely narrow in scope. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, and will disturb it \u201conly if it was arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Rranci v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>540 F.3d 165, 171 (3d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Filja v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 241, 251 (3d Cir. 2006)). In applying that standard, \u201c[w]e review the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>but will afford <em>Chevron </em>deference to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretations of the statutes which it is charged with administering.\u201d <em>Kamara v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>420 F.3d 202, 211 (3d Cir.2005) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">Unlike with petitions for review brought under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), however, we do not examine for substantial evidence factual determinations on petitions brought pursuant to \u00a7 1252(a)(2). <em>See Pierre, </em>528 F.3d at 184 (\u201cUnder the REAL ID Act, factual or discretionary determinations are outside of our scope of review.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Sukwanputra, </em>434 F.3d at 634 (same). Nevertheless, because the REAL ID Act gives us jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>tion to consider \u201cquestions of law,\u201d our review encompasses the \u201capplication of law to <em>undisputed </em>facts or <em>adjudicated </em>facts, raised in the initial petition for ... relief.\u201d <em>Mudric v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>469 F.3d 94, 97 (3d Cir.2006) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Ka-mara, </em>420 F.3d at 211); <em>see also Francois v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 645, 648 (3d Cir. 2006). <em>Cf. Bakhtriger v. Elwood, </em>360 F.3d 414, 425 (3d Cir.2004) (\u201c[A]lthough review as a matter of law encompasses deciding whether legal principles have been properly applied to <em>undisputed </em>facts, it does not encompass deciding the factual issues themselves.\u201d (internal citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Thomas argues that the BIA abused its discretion in two ways when it denied his motion to reopen: first, it applied the wrong \u201cspecific intent\u201d standard to claims for protection under the CAT; second, it improperly found he failed to make out a prima facie case that he was eligible for CAT protection. The Government concedes that the former is a question of law which we have jurisdiction to review. However, the Government argues that we lack jurisdiction over the latter question because \u201cwhether the documentary evidence Thomas proffered establishes prima facie eligibility ... is purely a factual determination ... requiring] <em>weighing and evaluation of the evidence ... </em>[which is] reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>See Saintha v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 243, 249 (4th Cir.2008) (\u201c[W]e conclude that BIA determinations that we would ordinarily review under the substantial evidence standard are necessarily factual in nature, and therefore beyond our jurisdiction to review when the petitioner has been convicted of an aggravated felony.\u201d); <em>Conteh v. Gonzales, </em>461 F.3d 45, 63 (1st Cir.2006) (\u201cThis proscription extends to review of the BIA\u2019s factual findings as to credibility, evidentiary weight, and satisfaction of a correctly framed burden of proof.\u201d); <em>cf. Hamid v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 642, 647 (7th Cir.2005) (finding no jurisdiction to review \u201cwhether the IJ correctly considered, interpreted, and weighed the evidence presented \u2014 that is to say, whether the IJ\u2019s conclusion was based on substantial evidence\u201d). Thomas contends that we do have jurisdiction over the latter claim because he seeks review of the BIA\u2019s legal determination, <em>i.e., </em>prima facie eligibility for protection under the CAT. Thomas alleges that this determination was improper because the BIA misapplied the legal standard governing motions to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">We have jurisdiction over both of Thomas\u2019 claims. Whether the BIA applied the proper \u201cspecific intent\u201d standard plainly is a question of law. Moreover, whether an alien is prima facie eligible for CAT relief is a legal determination because it involves the application of a legal principal to a set of facts. <em>See Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 174-75 (3d Cir.2002) (\u201cAn applicant for relief on the merits under the Convention Against Torture bears the burden of establishing \u2018that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u2019 ... [T]he prima facie case standard ... requires the applicant to produce objective evidence showing a \u2018reasonable likelihood\u2019 that he can establish that he is more likely than not to be tortured.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>see also Ragen Corp. v. Kearney &amp; Trecker Corp., </em>912 F.2d 619, 625-26 (3d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">Turning to Thomas\u2019 first argument, we note that an intervening change in the law controlling CAT claims does not, under the regulations, excuse an otherwise time \u2014 or number-barred motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3). Thus, the BIA\u2019s decision not to grant Thomas\u2019 mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>tion on the basis of any alleged change in law falls squarely within its discretionary authority to reopen <em>sua sponte, </em>which we lack jurisdiction to review. <em>See Calle-Vujiles v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 472, 474-75 (3d Cir.2003).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">With respect to Thomas\u2019 second argument, we noted in <em>Sevoian </em>that there are three grounds on which the BIA may deny a motion to reopen immigration proceedings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">First, it may hold that the movant has failed to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought.... Second, it may hold that the movant has failed to introduce previously unavailable, material evidence that justifies reopening.... Third, in cases in which the ultimate grant of relief being sought is discretionary (asylum ... but not withholding of deportation), the Board can leap ahead over the two threshold concerns (prima facie case and new evidence/reasonable explanation) and simply determine that even if they were met, the movant would not be entitled to the discretionary grant of relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\"><em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 556, 564 n. 8 (3d Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Sevoian, </em>290 F.3d at 169-70). Thomas argues that the BIA abused its discretion by improperly denying his motion on the first of these grounds. We find, however, that the BIA actually denied Thomas\u2019 motion to reopen based upon the second <em>Sevoian </em>ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The instant motion to reopen is Thomas\u2019 second, brought nearly four years after the BIA\u2019s final determination of the merits of his CAT claim. Thus, it is generally both time-and number-barred under the regulations. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (\u201cExcept as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a party may file only one motion to reopen deportation or exclusion proceedings ... and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened .... \u201d). The regulations, however, provide that the time and numerical limitations that typically apply to motions to reopen may be waived if the motions are \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">Thus, with an otherwise time \u2014 and number-barred motion to reopen brought pursuant to \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), the BIA first considers whether the petitioner has proved, by material evidence not otherwise available at the time of the previous hearing, that circumstances in the country of deportation have sufficiently changed to warrant reopening. <em>See, e.g., Shardar v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>503 F.3d 308, 314-15 (3d Cir. 2007) (examining the record in a \u00a7 1003.2(e)(3)(ii) case for evidence of changed circumstances, and not the likelihood of torture); <em>see also Filja, </em>447 F.3d at 255-56. This determination does not consider whether the petitioner would be entitled to substantive relief. Prima facie eligibility for substantive relief, therefore, is insufficient when an otherwise untimely motion fails to establish a change in coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>try circumstances. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (\u201cThe Board has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has made out a <em>prima facie </em>case for relief.\u201d). In effect, the \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d criteria is a procedural hurdle that must be overcome before an untimely motion to reopen may be considered. <em>See Shardar, </em>503 F.3d at 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In its decision, the BIA properly determined whether Thomas had \u201cestablished changed circumstances in Haiti that warrant reopening.\u201d App. at 2. In making its determination, the BIA found that documents submitted by Thomas did \u201cnot show that conditions in Haiti ha[d] worsened since the time of [his] removal hearing [in 2003].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. The BIA also found that recent Department of State reports \u201cshow[ed] no worsening in torture in Haitian prisons and a decrease in torture generally,\u201d and that non-governmental organizations like the Red Cross \u201cmonitored prison conditions and <em>offer </em>assistance to prisoners.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the BIA found as a matter of fact that there had not been a change <em>(i.e., </em>a worsening) in circumstances in Haiti to warrant reopening Thomas\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">We find, therefore, that the BIA properly denied Thomas\u2019 motion to reopen as untimely. Absent a showing of changed circumstances in Haiti, the BIA need not have considered the merits of Thomas\u2019 CAT claim because his motion was both time \u2014 and number-barred under the regulations. For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the decision of the BIA and deny Thomas\u2019 Petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-10\">. The BIA proceeded with Thomas\u2019 claims \"without determining whether the exception to the time limits on motions to reopen codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) extends to applications for protection under the Convention Against Torture....\u201d App. at 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\">. We also note that, whatever the merits of Thomas\u2019 change-in-the-law argument before we rendered our decision in <em>Pierre, </em>we find any alleged error to be harmless. Thomas effectively concedes, as he must, that the specific intent standard we sanctioned in <em>Pierre </em>now controls his case. Thus, no matter whether the BIA applied the wrong standard in 2007 to Thomas\u2019 CAT claim, the standard it indisputably did apply is the standard presently governing CAT claims. <em>See Pierre, </em>528 F.3d at 190-91 (applying <em>Matter of J-E- </em>to a CAT claim brought by an alien who was to be repatriated to Haiti).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\">. Because we find the BIA properly denied Thomas\u2019 motion as untimely, we need not address whether the BIA abused its discretion in finding Thomas failed to establish prima facie eligibility for relief under the CAT.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
