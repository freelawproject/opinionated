We review for substantial evidence the denial of asylum and must uphold the agency unless \u201cthe evidence [] presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Irma Menendez testified that she was beaten by guerillas for refusing to accede to supply requests. Because the record does not compel the conclusion that Irma Menendez was or would be targeted because of her political opinion or any other protected ground, <em>see Castro-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 1069, 1072 (9th Cir. 2005), substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The BIA\u2019s denial of humanitarian asylum is also supported by substantial evidence because the isolated incidents Irma Menendez described do not rise to the level of \u201catrocious forms of persecution.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii); <em>see also Kebede v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 808, 812 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that Irma Menendez failed to show the exceptional and extremely unusual hardship required for cancellation of removal, <em>see Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003), and Irma Menendez does not raise a constitutional or legal challenge to the hardship finding, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (court has jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">The Clerk shall amend the docket to reflect that the sole petitioner is Irma Juventina Menendez, A073-936-671.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b232-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
