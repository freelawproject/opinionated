Dec. 31, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 420 364 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Oct. 6, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-24\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>As a preliminary matter, we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s pretermission of Mansouratou\u2019s asylum application. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). While we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), Mansouratou\u2019s argument that her \u201cuncontroverted testimony\u201d established that she timely filed her asylum application \u201cmerely quarrels over the correctness of the [IJ\u2019s] factual findings.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B); <em>see Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006). Because we are without jurisdiction to review such an argument, we dismiss the petition for review to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">We further conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ found inconsistencies in the record with respect to Mansouratou\u2019s alleged rape. Indeed, while her first asylum application did not include an allegation of rape, her second application did. Moreover, Mansouratou initially testified that, while detained in 2001, \u201cbesides being slap on the face, being cursed, being hit, there\u2019s nothing else that happened,\u201d but then testified to being raped after she was prompted by her lawyer. In a pre-REAL ID Act case like the one at issue here, to form the basis of an adverse credibility determination, an inconsistency must be \u201csubstantial\u201d when measured against the record as a whole. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308-309 (2d Cir.2003) <em>abrogated, in part, by Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162 (2d Cir.2008). Here, Mansouratou\u2019s inconsistent testimony is plainly substantial because it casts doubt on whether the alleged rape \u2014 a central element of her claim \u2014 ever occurred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The IJ found numerous other discrepancies in the record, including: (1) her testimony that her father died in 2001, which was inconsistent with her assertion in her application that he was killed in August 2003; (2) her claim in her first asylum application that she was beaten during a demonstration, which contradicted her testimony that she had never participated in a demonstration; and (7) her testimony that her entire family was taken away in September 2002, which was inconsistent with her later testimony that only she and her father were taken away. Mansouratou calls these discrepancies \u201cminor\u201d and \u201ccompletely irrelevant.\u201d However, each of these inconsistencies relates to a central aspect of her claim, casting doubt on whether she was politically active, and whether she was ever arrested or mistreated. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308-309. Even if Mansouratou were correct that these inconsistencies were minor, taken together, they provided proper support for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that \u201ceven where an IJ relies on discrepancies or lacunae that, if taken separately, concern matters collateral or ancillary to the claim, ... the cumulative effect may nevertheless be deemed consequential by the fact-finder\u201d). Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s denial of Man-souratou\u2019s application for withholding of removal was proper. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic, </em>519 F.3d at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Finally, inasmuch as Mansouratou based her claim for CAT relief on the same factual predicate as her withholding claim, and the IJ properly found that such claim lacked credibility, her CAT claim necessarily fails. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
