We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-24\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded the medical records and drawing because Morgan failed to authenticate that evidence. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 803(6), 901(a); <em>United States v. Pang, </em>362 F.3d 1187, 1192 (9th Cir.2004) (\u2018We may affirm an evidentiary ruling on any ground supported by the record, regardless of whether the district court relied on the same grounds or reasoning we adopt.\u201d); <em>Tritchler v. County of Lake, </em>358 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir.2004) (reviewing for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-25\">The ruling, made in relation to the cross-motions for summary judgment, that the medical records could be considered as non-hearsay under Federal Rule of Evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>dence 808(6), did not render the medical records admissible at trial. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <em>Canada v. Blain\u2019s Helicopters, Inc., </em>831 F.2d 920, 925 (9th Cir.1987) (explaining that affidavits, although admissible on summary-judgment, \u201care evidence produced in a form that would not be admissible at trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Morgan\u2019s motions to amend his complaint because amendment would have caused undue delay and prejudice to the defendants. <em>See Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Network Solutions, Inc., </em>194 F.3d 980, 986 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The jury instruction on <em>de minimis </em>injury accurately and fairly stated the law. <em>See Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 9-10, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992) (\u201cEighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of \u2018cruel and unusual\u2019 punishments necessarily excludes from constitutional recognition de minimis uses of physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a sort \u2018repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s refusal to give Morgan\u2019s proffered instruction was not error. <em>See United States v. Streit, </em>962 F.2d 894, 898-99 (9th Cir.1992) (holding that refusal to give a defendant\u2019s proffered instruction was not error where the instructions given by the district court accurately stated the law).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We have considered and reject all other arguments raised on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b255-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
