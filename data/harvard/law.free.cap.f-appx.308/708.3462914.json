Hing subsequently removed the case to the Eastern District of North Carolina. Concluding that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking, the district court dismissed and remanded the action back to the state court. Hing moved for reconsideration pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), and the district court denied the motion. Hing filed a timely appeal. For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-21\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) (2006), \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443 ... shall be reviewable ...\u201d The Supreme Court has limited \u00a7 1447(d) to insulate from appellate review those remand orders based on the grounds specified in \u00a7 1447(c): a defect in the removal procedure and a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>517 U.S. 706, 711-12, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996). Because the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 1441, its remand order is not subject to appellate review. <em>See Severonickel v. Gaston Reymenants, </em>115 F.3d 265, 266-69 (4th Cir. 1997); <em>Mangold v. Analytic Servs., Inc., </em>77 F.3d 1442, 1450 (4th Cir.1996); <em>Noel v. McCain, </em>538 F.2d 633, 635 (4th Cir.1976). Moreover, having determined that subject matter jurisdiction over Hing\u2019s case was lacking, the district court was without jurisdiction to consider Hing\u2019s motion to reconsider. <em>See In re Lowe, </em>102 F.3d 731, 734-35 (4th Cir.1996). Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal. We also deny Hing\u2019s motion for a transcript at government expense. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
