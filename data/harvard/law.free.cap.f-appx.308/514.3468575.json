Man-narino\u2019s motion \u2014 which we construe as a motion to recall the mandate \u2014 is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">Mannarino pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to obstruct justice in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Mukasey, C.J.) sentenced Mannarino principally to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment, the minimum sentence available under the \u201cStipulated Sentencing Guidelines Range\u201d of 57-60 months set forth in Mannarino\u2019s plea agreement. On November 12, 2004, Man-narino appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-15\">On March 6, 2007, Mannarino\u2019s attorney filed a motion to be relieved as counsel and a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), explaining why no non-frivolous basis existed for challenging the validity of Mannarino\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-16\">On April 17, 2007, Mannarino <em>pro se </em>urged that the <em>Anders </em>Brief be denied and that he be granted a sixty day extension to file a supplemental response. This Court granted Mannarino\u2019s initial request for an extension \u2014 and several additional extensions thereafter. Nonetheless, Mannarino failed to file his supplemental response to the <em>Anders </em>Brief until July 1, 2008, nearly a month after this court summarily affirmed his conviction and sentence, and a day after the issuance of the mandate closing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-17\">On July 3, 2008, the Clerk of the Court advised Mannarino that the mandate had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>issued in his case and that he would need to submit a motion to recall the mandate. On August 4, 2008, Mannarino filed a motion to recall the mandate to which he attached a postal receipt indicating that he mailed his supplemental response to counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>Brief before the mandate issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">On August 19, 2008, this Court accepted the filing of Mannarino\u2019s late brief but denied his motion to recall the mandate. Thereafter, Mannarino filed this motion for a ruling on his response to his attorney\u2019s <em>Anders </em>Brief. Since the mandate has issued, we construe the motion as a renewed motion to recall the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The power to recall a mandate \u201ccan be exercised only in extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Calderon v. Thompson, </em>523 U.S. 538, 550, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998); <em>see also Nnebe v. United States, </em>534 F.3d 87, 91 (2d Cir.2008) (same). In this case, no \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d favor recall of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Mannarino argues that the mandate was issued in error because he had mailed his supplemental brief three days before the mandate issued. However, even if Man-narino mailed his supplemental response prior to issuance of the mandate, that would not excuse the delay of more than a year between the filing of the <em>Anders </em>Brief and Mannarino\u2019s supplemental response, and the delay of nearly a month between this Court\u2019s denial of Mannarino\u2019s appeal and his filing of the brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">At the time we summarily affirmed, we had the benefit of Mannarino\u2019s initial response to the <em>Anders </em>Brief, as well as the <em>Anders </em>Brief itself and the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance. Mannar-ino has failed to identify any extraordinary circumstances warranting vacation of his plea or the sentence to which he explicitly consented in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">We have considered Mannarino\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, Mannarino\u2019s motion, which we construe as a motion to recall the mandate, is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
