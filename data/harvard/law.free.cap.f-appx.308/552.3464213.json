Dec. 13, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-25\">In its decision, the BIA construed Dong\u2019s motion as both a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider, and concluded that, to the extent that Dong was bringing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>a motion to reconsider, that motion was untimely. Dong does not contest the BIA\u2019s decision that any motion to reconsider would have been untimely. Rather, she argues that her October 28, 2007 application before the BIA was solely a motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">We find that the BIA properly denied Dong\u2019s motion to reopen due to her failure \u201cto state any new facts in support of her motion.\u201d Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1), a \u201cmotion to reopen proceedings shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d <em>See also Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 91 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Dong argues that although the cover letter accompanying her motion sought leave to supplement the motion with an affidavit, the BIA failed to respond to her request. This argument is unavailing where Dong failed to state either in her cover letter or her motion what facts (much less \u201cnew\u201d facts) would be presented should her ease be reopened. In light of Dong\u2019s failure to submit an affidavit or evidence pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1), or even state what new facts she sought to establish, we find that the BIA properly denied Dong\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See INS v. Jong Ha Wang, </em>450 U.S. 139, 143, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 67 L.Ed.2d 123 (1981); <em>see also INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
