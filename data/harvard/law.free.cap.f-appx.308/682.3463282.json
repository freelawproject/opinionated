This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2006), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2006); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order Lewis seeks to appeal is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. <em>See United States v. MacDonald, </em>435 U.S. 850, 853-54, 98 S.Ct. 1547, 56 L.Ed.2d 18 (1978); <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>946 F.2d 325 (4th Cir.1991). Accordingly, we deny Lewis\u2019 motions for appointment of counsel and to dismiss the charges against him, deny his remaining pending motions, and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
