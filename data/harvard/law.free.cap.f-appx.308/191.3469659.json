Knies-peck brought this action under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a) to recover benefits that he alleges were wrongfully denied him under a group long-term disability policy (the Pokey) issued by UNUM.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">On appeal, UNUM argues that the district court erred in construing the Pokey to require no proof of disabikty when the insured seeks partial disabikty benefits. We agree. Although the language of the Pokey is not a model of clarity, the district court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpartial dis-abikty\u201d conflicts with the rest of the plan\u2019s provisions. <em>See Tr. of S. Cal. IBEW-NECA Pension Trust Fund v. Flores, </em>519 F.3d 1045, 1047-48 (9th Cir.2008). Reading the term \u201cdisabikty\u201d to mean a condition distinct from \u201cpartial disabikty\u201d creates numerous internal inconsistencies in the Pokey. We thus construe \u201cdisabikty\u201d to include \u201cpartial disabikty,\u201d such that the Pokey\u2019s proof of claim requirement also appkes to Kniespeck\u2019s claim of partial disabikty. Upon request from UNUM, Kniespeek had to provide proof of continuing disabikty and care of a physician. Because he failed to provide this proof after multiple requests, UNUM was entitled to discontinue its payment of disabikty benefits to Kniespeek.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-16\">Section IV of the Pokey requires Knies-peck to provide \u201cproof\u2019 in order for UNUM to continue to pay benefits. Although the Pokey has ambiguities and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>construe them against the insurer, the requirement of proof is unambiguous, and we cannot \u201ctorture or twist the language\u201d to reach a different result. <em>See Babikian v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>63 F.3d 837 (9th Cir.1995). Section VI, titled \u201cGeneral Policy Provisions,\u201d defines proof to include (1) the date the disability started; (2) the cause of the disability; and (3) how serious the disability is. Kniespeck was required to submit that information in 1998 when UNUM requested it.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">It is undisputed that Kniespeck never offered proof of continuing disability to support his claim of partial disability. Specifically, Kniespeck never offered proof that because of \u201cthe injury or sickness that caused the [total] disability\u201d he was \u201cunable to perform all the material duties of his regular occupation on a full-time basis.\u201d In 2000, Kniespeck allegedly submitted a form from a chiropractor, not a medical doctor. The form stated that he was \u201cpermanently [illegible word] disable (sic).\u201d It did not state the extent of the disability or that it made him \u201cunable to perform all the material duties of his regular occupation on a full-time basis.\u201d The vocational evaluation report by Pride Industries was from February 1997, while UNUM was still paying total disability and before Kniespeck claimed partial disability. It says that he is totally disabled, but it is by a vocational evaluator, not a physician, and does not state that the disability was \u201cbecause of injury\u201d or was a \u201cresult from the injury ... that cause the [total] disability.\u201d After phase one of the bench trial, three physicians provided opinions that Kniespeck was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Even if we assume that UNUM waived the thirty-one day time limit for receipt of proof, it was incumbent on Kniespeck to provide proof that he had a continuing disability in order to collect benefits for partial disability. The Policy does not presume continuing disability after any total disability, but instead requires proof of partial disability as a condition of obtaining benefits for partial disability, and Knies-peck did not provide proof. Thus, as a matter of law, Kniespeck is not entitled to any past or future benefits under the Policy-</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">VACATED and REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b216-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
