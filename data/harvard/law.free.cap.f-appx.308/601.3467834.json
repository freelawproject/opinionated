Duncan argues that we should vacate his conviction and remand for a new trial based on three alternate grounds. First, he complains of two evidentiary exclusions by the District Court. Second, he maintains that the District Court misapplied the \u201cpublic safety\u201d exception to <em>Miranda </em>when it refused to suppress statements that he allegedly made to the arresting officers. Third, Duncan asserts that the Government committed prosecutorial misconduct during its summation by commenting on his failure to introduce evidence that the District Court had excluded. We have considered all three grounds, and we will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">We recount the facts in some detail, as they are essential to our reasoning. On October 28, 2005, there was a shooting at the Kingsbury Apartment Complex in Trenton, New Jersey. It is undisputed that Duncan had nothing to do with it. Late the next night, Duncan was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a red car parked near the Complex when Detectives Astbury and Woodhead pulled up in an unmarked police car. Astbury and Woodhead were members of the Trenton Police Department\u2019s Tactical Anti-Crime Unit (\u201cTAC\u201d). Ast-bury and Woodhead both testified that they were in the neighborhood of the Kingsbury Apartment Complex investigating a drug tip that did not pan out. They explained that they then happened to see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Duncan sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a red car parked on a quiet street. They testified that they pulled up next to the car and then approached it on foot because Duncan was drinking a bottle of beer. According to the detectives, Astbury approached the driver\u2019s side, Woodhead approached the passenger\u2019s side, and Duncan was the only person in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Astbury testified that when he shined a flashlight into the car, he saw Duncan attempting to hide the beer bottle on the floor with his left hand and \u201cshoving\u201d a \u201cshiny silver object\u201d into his right jacket pocket with his right hand. Based on his experience, Astbury thought that the shiny silver object was a handgun. Astbury then asked Duncan for the beer and identification, intending to write him up for public drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">According to Astbury, the following sequence of events transpired next: Duncan got out of the car without having been asked to do so, appeared nervous, \u201cmade a quick movement towards his right pocket with his right hand, [and] began to bend down towards the roadway.\u201d (App.126.) Astbury then grabbed Duncan\u2019s arms and held them on the roof of the car, but Duncan once more reached toward his right jacket pocket. Astbury again grabbed Duncan\u2019s arms, put them back on the roof of the car, and \u201cconducted a quick pat-frisk\u201d of the jacket pocket area. (App. 127.) He \u201cfelt a hard object that was similar in size and shape to a weapon [and] believed it to be a handgun.\u201d (App.128.) Astbury then pulled Duncan\u2019s arms behind his back and, without advising him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, asked him whether the object was a gun. Duncan answered, \u201c[Y]es, but it\u2019s not mine.\u201d (App.129.) At trial, Astbury gave the following explanation as to why he asked Duncan this question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">Sometimes it\u2019s better on the street to know if you have a gun, if somebody who has a gun knows that the police know you have a gun or anything that they don\u2019t want the police to find, it makes the situation a little bit easier. If they think that they\u2019re still hiding it, they\u2019re still more nervous, as well as if I know it\u2019s a gun, I can go inside of his pocket more carefully and get it out rather than just going in there and not knowing what it is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">(App.129-30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Both detectives testified that, at this point, Astbury called out to Woodhead the Trenton police codeword for gun \u2014 \u201c301\u201d\u2014 put Duncan in handcuffs, and removed a silver handgun from Duncan\u2019s right jacket pocket. In addition, Astbury related that he called for backup after Duncan confirmed that the object in his pocket was a gun. According to Astbury, it took \u201cless than two minutes\u201d from the time that he and Woodhead first saw Duncan until the time they placed him under arrest. (App. 136.)</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">Woodhead told the Court that he then took Duncan to the rear of the police car and \u201cconducted a secondary search\u201d of Duncan\u2019s person. (App.296.) According to Woodhead, neither of the detectives said anything during this search, but Duncan said again that the gun was not his and elaborated that he had a \u201cstory\u201d and that he had \u201cborrowed the jacket from someone on Monmouth Street.\u201d (App.296-97.) According to Astbury, Duncan made these statements to Woodhead \u201c[l]ess than three minutes\u201d after he told Astbury that the object in his pocket was a gun. (App.36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">Duncan\u2019s mother, who lived at the Kingsbury Apartment Complex, testified that police in the neighborhood were \u201clooking for a red [ ] car with a black man in it\u201d in connection with the shooting from the previous night. (App.357, 362-63.) Duncan\u2019s defense theory was that (1) an alert went out over Trenton police radio about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>the Kingsbury shooting, informing officers that an African-American man in a red car was a suspect; (2) as members of the TAC unit, Astbury and Woodhead heard the alert; and (3) the detectives fabricated the entire gun story as a pretext for bringing Duncan in for questioning about the shooting because he matched the suspect profile and because they saw a red scarf \u2014 typical attire for local gang members \u2014 in the back seat of the red car.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Duncan did not take the stand, but a friend, Joseph Myles, testified that he was in the front passenger\u2019s seat next to Duncan when the officers pulled up next to the red car and that it was he (not Duncan) who was drinking at the time. Myles explained that the officers did not immediately address him, even though he was the one with the beer; rather, one of the officers approached the car and asked Duncan about the red scarf that was in the back seat. According to Myles, Duncan responded that the scarf and the car were not his, after which the police ordered Duncan out of the car and frisked him. Myles stated that three officers then came to the passenger\u2019s side of the ear, ordered him to step out, frisked him, and then told him that \u201cyou better go before you get locked up.\u201d (App.403.) Myles\u2019s testimony indicated that there were at least five officers at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Myles told the Court that at no time that night did he see Duncan with a gun, let alone see him trying to hide one in his jacket pocket. In addition, Myles testified that, as far as he remembered, Duncan was not even wearing a jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The first evidentiary ruling that Duncan challenges on appeal is the District Court\u2019s refusal to allow defense counsel to ask Detective Astbury whether anyone from the TAC unit had interviewed Duncan about the Kingsbury shooting at the station house after his arrest. The second evidentiary ruling that Duncan now challenges is the District Court\u2019s refusal to enforce a subpoena against a Trenton police officer who would have testified about sending the alleged alert about the Kings-bury shooting over Trenton police radio. Duncan urges that allowing these pieces of evidence would have made more probable his defense theory that the weapons charge against Mr. Duncan was a pretext for questioning him about the Kingsbury shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Taking the second exclusion first, we credit the District Court\u2019s view that the testimony would not have been relevant. The officer presumably would have testified that an alert went out, but this was not the issue. The issue was whether Astbury and Woodhead were aware of the shooting and, thus, may have been acting with the motive that Duncan suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Similarly, as to the first exclusion, the relevance of the information sought to be elicited is dubious at best. The mere fact that Duncan was questioned at the station house about the Kingsbury shooting, without more, does not \u201chav[e] any tendency\u201d to make it \u201cmore probable ... than it would be without th[at] evidence\u201d that the arresting officers at the scene knew about the shooting and were motivated by that knowledge to fabricate the story about the gun. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 401. Based on the record as it was developed before the District Court, Astbury and Woodhead\u2019s motivation and the actions of officers at the station house are two different things. Without some nexus between them, the argument that subsequent station house questioning bears on the detectives\u2019 motivation for arresting Duncan is no more than speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in making either of these exclusionary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">Before trial, Duncan moved to suppress the statements that he allegedly made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Detectives Astbury and Woodhead after Astbury had asked \u2014 without Duncan having been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights\u2014 whether the object in his jacket pocket was a gun. The Government conceded that this was a custodial situation, which ordinarily triggers <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>requirements, but argued that Astbury\u2019s question fell under the \u201cpublic safety\u201d exception to <em>Miranda. </em>The District Court agreed and therefore refused to suppress Duncan\u2019s statements to Astbury.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">While statements made by a defendant stemming from custodial interrogation are generally inadmissible at trial and presumed to have been compelled if the defendant was not previously advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the Supreme Court, in <em>New York v. Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 655, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984), established a \u201c \u2018public safety\u2019 exception\u201d to <em>Miranda. </em>Under this narrow exception, the police do not need to give the <em>Miranda </em>warnings before asking a suspect questions that are necessary to protect the public or the police from immediate danger, <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S. at 656-59 &amp; n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 2626. The exception applies when it would have been objectively reasonable for the officer to believe that asking the question was necessary to protect the public or police from immediate danger. <em>Id. </em>at 656, 659 n. 8,104 S.Ct. 2626.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The Government urges that the District Court correctly applied the public safety exception because, \u201cwith Duncan repeatedly reaching for his pocket despite Detective Astbury\u2019s commands to stay still and efforts to restrain his arms, it was important for the detectives, to ensure their personal safety and the safety of nearby residents, to immediately ascertain whether Duncan in fact had a gun on him.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Br. 17.) In addition to Duncan\u2019s furtive, uncooperative behavior, the Government points to the rapidity with which the encounter transpired as support for the application of the exception. Further, it contends that Astbury\u2019s conduct immediately after Duncan answered his question \u2014 his use of a codeword to inform Woodhead about the gun and his decision to call for backup \u2014 demonstrate that Ast-bury had \u201can objectively reasonable safety concern in a volatile situation.\u201d (Appel-lee\u2019s Br. 17.) Duncan counters that the exception is a narrow one and that there was no necessity for the officer to inquire whether he had a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">The public safety exception requires examination of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>See United States v. Reyes, </em>353 F.3d 148, 152 (2d Cir.2003) (citing <em>United States v. Banks, </em>540 U.S. 31, 42, 124 S.Ct. 521, 157 L.Ed.2d 343 (2003)); <em>United States v. DeSantis, </em>870 F.2d 536, 541 (9th Cir.1989). The dispositive question here is whether, considering all the circumstances, it was objectively reasonable for Detective Astbury to have thought that asking Duncan whether the object indeed was a gun was necessary to protect himself, his partner, or the public from immediate danger.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>While this is a close case given the narrowness of the exception, we conclude that we should answer in the affirmative in the fact pattern before us. Given Duncan\u2019s movement of his arms and reaching toward his pocket, and the perceived and obvious danger if the object was in fact a gun and were to go off, we find that the one question that was asked, clearly for reasons of safety, was permissible under the totality of the circumstances. Accordingly, the District Court properly refused to suppress Duncan\u2019s statement in response to the question.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Duncan also urges on appeal that the prosecutor improperly argued in summation that there was no evidence to support the theory that Astbury or Woodhead had fabricated the story about the gun and had lied on the stand. The prosecutor urged that Duncan had failed to adduce any evidence that he had been questioned about the shooting, although she knew full well that the District Court had prevented him from pursuing this line of inquiry. We agree that this was unfair. The prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding the lack of evidence supporting the alleged motive for Astbury and Woodhead to frame Duncan were improper. The main reason the jury was not presented with this evidence was that the Court had granted the <em>Government\u2019s </em>earlier requests to exclude it. While the District Court probably should have taken action in response to Duncan\u2019s objection, we conclude that this was harmless error because the entire issue of whether Duncan had been questioned at the station house was, at best, of attenuated relevance to the officers\u2019 credibility, as</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">we have discussed above, and, thus, to Duncan\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Accordingly, we will AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s Judgment and Commitment Order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-14\">. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\">. We review for clear error factual findings underlying the denial of a motion to suppress a defendant\u2019s non-Mirandized statement and review <em>de novo </em>the application of the law to those findings. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>280 F.3d 318, 336 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\">. Judge Chagares writes separately, urging that three factors are useful in determining whether the public safety exception applies. He acknowledges, however, that these factors are not \"the test.\u201d We do not join in his concurring opinion because we believe that his proposed distillation of the <em>Quarles </em>test is unnecessary, and we are concerned that it could be mistaken for a \"test.\u201d This would be unfortunate because it misses the mark: the necessity, urgency, and immediacy mandated by <em>Quarles </em>get lost in the focus on three static aspects. It could also lead to an unwarranted expansion of this narrow exception to <em>Miranda. </em>The test under <em>Quarles </em>\u2014 whether police questioning is necessary to protect the public or police from an immediate danger\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>is straightforward, and entails a \"snapshot\u201d look at the situation facing an officer at a moment in time, under the totality of the circumstances. It needs no distillation. Moreover, the \"snapshot\u201d here satisfies the <em>Quarles </em>test, with the required necessity, urgency, and immediacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b630-11\">. The Court also held that Duncan\u2019s statements to Woodhead were admissible on a separate ground, finding that they were volunteered and thus beyond the ambit of <em>Miranda </em>altogether. Because we conclude that the public safety exception applied, we need not reach this alternate ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b630-8\">CHAGARES, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ayc-dedup-1\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"a4b-dedup-0\">During a brief, fast-moving confrontation with an uneuffed, uncooperative, and possibly intoxicated Eugene Duncan, Trenton Detective Jason Astbury saw Duncan stuff a silver object into his jacket pocket. Astbury frisked the pocket and felt something hard and heavy. He then asked Duncan a single question \u2014 whether \u201cit was a gun\u201d in Duncan\u2019s pocket \u2014 without first reciting <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Joint Appendix (JA) 129. Duncan\u2019s answer established that indeed he had, hidden on his person, a .38 caliber five-shot revolver, fully loaded with hollow-point bullets. I believe Duncan\u2019s answer falls squarely within the narrow \u201cpublic safety\u201d exception to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), established by <em>New York v. Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984). Therefore, although I agree with my learned colleagues\u2019 conclusion that we should affirm the District Court\u2019s Judgment and Commitment Order, I write separately because I do not believe that the application of <em>Quarles </em>here presents a \u201cclose case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">At approximately 11:00 p.m. on October 29, 2005, Detective Astbury and his partner, Detective Ryan Woodhead, of the Trenton Police Department\u2019s Anti-Crime Unit were patrolling the area of Ardmore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>and Farragut Avenues in an unmarked police car. The detectives knew from an informant that a drug dealer operated out of a house on Ardmore Avenue and also out of a brown Chevrolet Caprice that the dealer parked nearby. Driving up Ard-more Avenue, the detectives flipped on their car\u2019s spotlight to illuminate the suspected drug house. No one was visible. As they turned the corner onto Farragut Avenue, they spotted the brown Caprice. It was empty. The police car crawled past the Caprice and the spotlight shone on Duncan, sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a red Chevrolet Beretta parked behind the Caprice. Duncan had a green glass bottle of Heineken beer raised to his lips.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">When the light hit Duncan, he was \u201cvisibly startled. His eyes got big and he began to frantically move around inside the vehicle,\u201d reaching down \u201ctoward the floor board.\u201d JA 120, 123. Astbury stopped his car, intending to write Duncan a ticket for violating the Trenton ordinance against drinking alcohol in public. Ast-bury exited his vehicle and walked toward Duncan. As he closed from seven feet to three feet from the Beretta, Astbury saw something more than a relatively innocuous green bottle in Duncan\u2019s hand: \u201c[A]s I approached the car, I observed him with his right hand attempting to conceal a silver object in his right front [jacket] pocket.\u201d JA 30. As he fumbled with the object, Duncan \u201cwas still visibly nervous, moving around a lot inside the vehicle.\u201d JA 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Astbury believed \u2014 but \u201cwasn\u2019t 100 percent sure\u201d \u2014 that the silver object was a gun. JA 50. Duncan succeeded in both shoving the object into his jacket pocket and hiding the beer, and his hands were now empty and in a position where Ast-bury could see them. Astbury told Duncan to stop moving and \u201cto hand the beer over to me, and he cracked the door and handed me the beer.\u201d JA 32. Astbury put the bottle on the Beretta\u2019s roof. He then asked Duncan for identification, but did not ask him to get out of the car. Duncan did not follow this direction. Instead, without prompting, Duncan \u201cstepped out of the vehicle and turned his back away from\u201d Astbury. <em>Id. </em>After this unprompted maneuver, Duncan, who appeared to be \u201cstill nervous,\u201d performed another unsettling act: he immediately \u201cmade a quick movement toward his right [jacket] pocket with his right hand [and] began to bend down towards the ground.\u201d JA 126. Thinking that Duncan was reaching for the silver object, Astbury instantly grabbed Duncan\u2019s arms and pulled them up onto the roof of the car. This did not end Duncan\u2019s resistance, however, for Duncan pulled his arm down and again \u201creached towards his right jacket pocket with his right hand. This time he did not bend down towards the roadway, though.\u201d JA 127. Again, to stop Duncan from grabbing whatever was in that pocket, Astbury grabbed Duncan\u2019s arms and put them back on the roof of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">His suspicion now fully aroused, Astbury began a pat-frisk of Duncan\u2019s right side\u2014 the area into which Duncan had placed the silver object, and the area that Duncan had just reached for, twice, against Ast-bury\u2019s command. Astbury felt a \u201chard object\u201d in the right jacket pocket. JA 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Immediately, Astbury grabbed Duncan\u2019s arms, pulled them behind Duncan\u2019s back, \u201cand asked him if it was a gun in his pocket.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Duncan replied, \u201cyes, but it\u2019s not my gun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Astbury posed no other questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">Duncan\u2019s demeanor now changed \u2014 he \u201cgave up\u201d and stopped resisting. <em>Id. </em>At this point, Astbury called out \u201c301\u201d to Woodhead, which is the Trenton Police Department\u2019s radio code for \u201cgun.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The entire interaction described above transpired in \u201cless than two minutes.\u201d JA 136. Astbury handcuffed Duncan, called for backup, and searched Duncan\u2019s pockets. In the right pocket of Duncan\u2019s jacket, Astbury found a silver-colored Taurus .38 caliber five-shot revolver. The gun was loaded to capacity with hollow-point bullets. Without being questioned further, Duncan repeated \u2014 approximately five times \u2014 that the gun was not his, that he had a story, and that the story was that he had borrowed the jacket from someone else. The officers placed Duncan into the back of their car and brought him to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">On April 13, 2006, a grand jury indicted Duncan on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(2). The District Court heard argument on and denied Duncan\u2019s suppression motion on October 3, 2006, holding that the public safety exception applied to Duncan\u2019s response to Detective Astbury, and that Duncan\u2019s subsequent explanations were volunteered statements. Duncan\u2019s trial began later that day, and on October 6, 2006, a jury found him guilty. On January 8, 2007, the District Court sentenced Duncan to 78 months imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">In <em>Miranda, </em>the Supreme Court found that certain procedures are necessary to protect an individual\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to be free from compelled self-incrimination while subject to custodial interrogation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>384 U.S. at 468, 86 S.Ct. 1602. These procedures include the now-familiar requirement that a suspect be \u201cMirandized,\u201d or, in other words, be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqy\">warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602. Without a \u201cvoluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver\u201d of these rights, police may not \u201cquestion a suspect without counsel being present [nor] introduce at trial any statements made during the interrogation.\u201d <em>Alston v. Redman, </em>34 F.3d 1237, 1242 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">In <em>Quarles, </em>however, the Supreme Court recognized that certain situations demand an exception to the <em>Miranda </em>rule, specifically where the safety of the public or the police is jeopardized. <em>See </em>467 U.S. at 655-56, 104 S.Ct. 2626. In <em>Quarles, </em>a woman approached two police officers on patrol in Queens and said that a man had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>raped her and then fled on foot into a supermarket. She gave a detailed description of the perpetrator and told the police that he was carrying a gun. The officers entered the supermarket and saw Quarles, who fit the description given by the victim. Quarles ran towards the back of the store. The police ran after, apprehended, and frisked him. Quarles was wearing an empty shoulder holster. An officer handcuffed him and, without giving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, \u201casked [Quarles] where the gun was.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652, 104 S.Ct. 2626. Quarles nodded his head toward some empty liquid soap cartons and said, \u201cthe gun is over there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The officer searched the cartons and discovered a .38-caliber revolver. At that point, Quarles was notified that he was under arrest, and the police proceeded to give him <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The Supreme Court reversed the state court\u2019s suppression of Quarles\u2019 statement that \u201cthe gun is over there.\u201d The Court held that police officers may \u201cask questions reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety\u201d without first giving <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Id. </em>at 656, 104 S.Ct. 2626. Moreover, the Court noted that the exception is applied using an objective, not a subjective, test, and therefore \u201cthe subjective motivation of the arresting officer\u201d does not impact the reviewing court\u2019s analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 656, 104 S.Ct. 2626. Instead, courts must focus on whether the situation presented an \u201cobjectively reasonable need to protect the police or the public from any immediate danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659 n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 2626.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The Court applied what amounts to a cost-benefit analysis to the protection afforded by the <em>Miranda </em>warnings: where police conduct non-Mirandized questioning simply to \u201cmake [their] case\u201d against a defendant, \u201cwhatever the cost to society in terms of fewer convictions of guilty subjects ... [will] simply have to be borne in the interest of enlarged protection for the Fifth Amendment privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656-57, 104 S.Ct. 2626. But where the police engage in custodial interrogation not to obtain testimonial evidence, because they \u201cneed [] answers to questions in a situation posing a threat to the public safety,\u201d then this need \u201coutweighs the need for the prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657, 104 S.Ct. 2626. The crucial distinction, which the Court believed police officers \u201cwill distinguish almost instinctively,\u201d is \u201cbetween questions necessary to secure their own safety or the safety of the public and questions designed solely to elicit testimonial evidence from a suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658-59, 104 S.Ct. 2626. The Court made clear, however, that it was recognizing only a \u201cnarrow exception to the Miranda rule,\u201d one that in each case is \u201ccircumscribed by the exigency which justifies it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658, 104 S.Ct. 2626.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Application of <em>Quarles </em>in this case demands affirmance for two reasons. First, our facts are similar to those in <em>Quarles </em>itself, and the major factual discrepancy actually demonstrates a more dire exigency in the instant case. In <em>Quarles, </em>the police thought, but did not know, that they could be facing an armed man because of what the rape victim told them and because they saw that Quarles had an empty shoulder holster. Detective Astbury also believed, but \u201cwasn\u2019t 100 percent sure,\u201d that he confronted an armed suspect based on his own observations of Duncan. JA 50. In each case, the officer asked just a single question, and in each case, the question was directed solely at establishing the presence of a firearm. Further, in both cases, immediately after the police located and neutralized the public safety threat, they ceased asking questions. In the words of <em>Quarles, </em>Detective Astbury, \u201cin the very act of apprehending\u201d Duncan, was \u201cconfronted with the immediate necessity of ascertaining the whereabouts of a gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>which\u201d Astbury \u201chad every reason to believe\u201d Duncan had just placed into his pocket. 467 U.S. at 657, 104 S.Ct. 2626. \u201cSo long as the gun was concealed,\u201d with its whereabouts unverified, \u201cit obviously posed more than one danger to the public safety.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The factual difference between this case and <em>Quarles </em>is that here, Astbury had seen what he thought was a gun, and there was only one place where he thought it could be. But this means that Duncan\u2019s gun presented an even more immediate danger than did the one in <em>Quarles. </em>There, Quarles was handcuffed and surrounded by at least four officers at the time of questioning. Justice Rehnquist conceded that, on the facts, \u201cthere was nothing to suggest that any of the officers were any longer concerned for their own physical safety.\u201d <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S. at 655, 104 S.Ct. 2626. Indeed, Justice Marshall based his dissent in part upon the remoteness of the threat: \u201cAs the other officers trained their guns on the suspect.... Officer Kraft then handcuffed Quarles, and the other officers holstered their guns. With Quarles\u2019 hands manacled behind his back and the other officers standing close by, Officer Kraft questioned Quarles.\u201d 467 U.S. at 674-75, 104 S.Ct. 2626 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Therefore, argued Justice Marshall, \u201c[bjefore the interrogation began, Quarles had been reduced to a condition of physical powerlessness,\u201d and the public safety risk was merely hypothetical. <em>Id. </em>at 675, 104 S.Ct. 2626 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (quotation marks and citations omitted). The majority in <em>Quarles </em>acknowledged that there was no precipitous threat; rather, the danger stemmed only from the possibility that \u201can accomplice might make use of [the gun, or that] a customer or employee might later come upon it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657,104 S.Ct. 2626.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Here, by contrast, only two officers were present, and Astbury testified that as he approached Duncan\u2019s car, he could not see where Detective Woodhead was because he was \u201cconcentrating on Mr. Duncan\u2019s actions.\u201d JA 48. Unlike Quarles, Duncan was not handcuffed. Unlike the officers in <em>Quarles, </em>Astbury feared that Duncan had a gun on his person. Unlike Quarles, Duncan had not \u201cbeen reduced to a condition of physical powerlessness,\u201d since he twice reached for the exact pocket that Astbury thought contained a gun. In sum, the public safety risk posed by Duncan was not a matter of \u201cmight.\u201d It was very real.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Second, and more fundamentally, admitting Duncan\u2019s response into evidence would accord with <em>Quarles\u2019 </em>central holding: that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not required in the face of an \u201cobjectively reasonable need to protect the police or the public from any immediate danger associated with [a] weapon.\u201d 467 U.S. at 659 n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 2626. So we must ask: did the totality of the circumstances create such an objectively reasonable need here? I believe the answer is clearly yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Consider what confronted Detective Ast-bury at the moment he asked his single question: (1) late at night, he saw Duncan drinking alcohol; (2) when illuminated by the police spotlight, Duncan became \u201cvisibly nervous\u201d and began moving \u201cfrantically,\u201d reaching around inside his car; (3) he saw Duncan stuff something that flashed silver into his right pocket; (4) he asked Duncan for identification, but instead of complying, Duncan exited the car and turned his back to Astbury; (5) Duncan was not handcuffed; (6) Astbury forced Duncan\u2019s hands up onto the car\u2019s roof to frisk him, but Duncan twice pulled his arms down and reached for the same pocket that contained the flash of silver; and (7) Astbury frisked that very pocket, and it contained something hard and heavy.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">It was objectively reasonable to think that the totality of these circumstances created a threat to Astbury\u2019s safety, to the safety of his partner, to the safety of Duncan, and to the safety of anyone living in the houses on Ardmore Avenue. Indeed, if Astbury had ignored the objectively reasonable threat posed by that hard, heavy flash of silver in Duncan\u2019s pocket, and the gun had gone off, this panel could well be deciding a tort or civil rights action today.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">Each public safety case presents its own \u201ckaleidoscopic situation,\u201d with its own unique factual scenario. <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S. at 656, 104 S.Ct. 2626. Nonetheless, three factors are useful in determining whether or not the public safety exception applies. The first factor is the questions the police ask. Relevant here are how many questions were asked; the scope of these questions; and most importantly, the content\u2014 in other words, were the questions investigatory or safety-related. The second factor is what the police knew about the defendant at the time of the encounter. A court may thus consider facts such as whether the defendant is suspected of crimes involving weapons or violence; and whether the officers had any knowledge or belief as to the defendant\u2019s potential dangerousness. The third factor examines the characteristics of the encounter: whether the defendant was handcuffed or otherwise secured; whether the defendant made furtive, irregular, or other disconcerting movements; and the general dangerousness of the atmosphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">I am not suggesting that these three factors constitute a \u201ctest\u201d to the exclusion of all other possible factors. Of course, the totality of the circumstances is the touchstone for any inquiry into the public safety exception\u2019s applicability. But when examining the totality of the circumstances, these three factors are useful in analyzing whether the public safety exception should apply. In the instant case, all three factors point clearly to application of the public safety exception in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">The Supreme Court\u2019s object in <em>Miranda </em>was to prohibit the authorities, when seeking to solve a crime, from using the coer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>cion inherent in custodial interrogation to compel a suspect to incriminate himself. But the <em>Quarles </em>Court recognized that when faced with an \u201cexigency requiring immediate action,\u201d 467 U.S. at 659 n. 8,104 S.Ct. 2626, the police are not asking questions \u201cdesigned solely to elicit testimonial evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 659, 104 S.Ct. 2626. Rather, when public safety is legitimately at risk, the police seek answers that will expose, and ehminate, the public safety threat. The purpose of the exception, of course, is to defuse dangerous situations, and the questions posed by the police must be geared toward that \u2014 and only that\u2014 goal. Such questions, \u201cnecessary to secure [the police\u2019s] safety or the safety of the public,\u201d are permissible under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Thus, the first factor used to determine whether the public safety exception applies is the questions the police ask. Relevant here are the number of questions asked; the scope of the questions; and the content of the questions, in other words, whether they are safety-related (limited solely to gaining the information needed to ehminate the danger) or testimonial (geared towards solving a crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">When an officer asks just one question directed at uncovering the threat and then stops, this factor weighs in favor of applying the public safety exception to the defendant\u2019s answer. For example, in <em>Quarles </em>itself, the officer asked just a single question (where was the gun) before reciting <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Only after securing the gun and giving the warnings did the officer \u201ccontinue[ ] with investigatory questions about the ownership and place of purchase of the gun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 104 S.Ct. 2626. This indicated that the officer\u2019s question sought to eliminate a threat, not obtain evidence. <em>See also United States v. Reilly, </em>224 F.3d 986, 993 (9th Cir.2000) (applying public safety exception in part because officer\u2019s \u201cinquiry was narrow, asking only a single question directed at determining the presence of [a] gun\u201d); <em>Carrillo, </em>16 F.3d at 1050 (applying public safety exception where even after defendant gave an incriminating response to single question, officer asked no more questions, since this \u201cdeliberate refusal to pursue the subject heightens our confidence that, in this case, the narrowly tailored question was a reasonable attempt by a police officer to ensure his personal safety in the midst of a search\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Next, questioning with a limited scope\u2014 such as an inquiry that requires just a yes or no answer \u2014 points towards permitting the answer under the public safety exception. This was the case in <em>Carrillo, </em>where before frisking a drug dealer, an officer asked whether the dealer had any needles on him. 16 F.3d at 1049. The <em>Quarles </em>exception applied in part because of \u201cthe non-investigatory nature of the officer\u2019s question. The question called for a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no,\u2019 not a testimonial response. Ordinarily, a question framed in this manner would not elicit any incriminating evidence not produced by the search itself.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>F.3d at 1049-50; <em>see also Allen v. Roe, </em>305 F.3d 1046, 1051 (9th Cir.2002) (applying exception in part because after locating gun, and thereby eliminating safety threat, officer did not ask defendant \u201cany further questions after the gun was retrieved. The officer did not ask Allen ... any other questions regarding the crime.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Finally, there is a critical distinction between questions asked to defuse a dangerous encounter and questions that seek to solve a crime.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Alien, </em>for instance, an officer asked a man who had just shot his son at a campsite, and who had discarded the gun somewhere in the woods, to try and help the police find the gun. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit permitted the man\u2019s answer in large part because \u201cthere was no indication that the officer\u2019s questioning was intended to elicit incriminating evidence.... The questioning was limited to finding the gun and was not investigatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1051 (citations omitted). Another example is <em>Reilly, </em>where the police arrested a defendant suspected of numerous robberies and armed carjackings, and asked him \u201c[w]here is the gun.\u201d 224 F.3d at 990. The <em>Quarles </em>exception applied because the question \u201cb[ore] no indication of an attempt to elicit testimonial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 993. The inquiring officer \u201cdid not ask his question in an attempt to link Reilly to the bank robberies,\u201d and although it \u201ccalled for more than a simple \u2018yes\u2019 or Ino\u2019 answer,\u201d the question required \u201conly the bare minimum necessary to locate and contain a potential threat.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Accordingly, answers to questions that are \u201cnarrow in scope, directly targeting the safety concern, and [] not posed to elicit incriminating evidence,\u201d will often be permissible pursuant to the public safety exception. <em>Estrada, </em>430 F.3d at 613 (permitting answers to several \u201cfocused\u201d questions regarding whether guns were in the apartment of a known drug dealer, as \u201cthe questions were aimed at controlling a potentially dangerous situation and relieving an immediate threat to the officers\u2019 safe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>ty,\u201d and not \u201ca subterfuge for collecting evidence\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Brady, </em>819 F.2d 884, 888 (9th Cir.1987) (admitting answer to questions including \u201cDo you have a gun?\u201d because they were \u201cnot designed to elicit testimonial evidence. That is, they were not investigatory,\u201d instead arising from officer\u2019s \u201cconcern with public safety, his desire to obtain control of what could be a dangerous situation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Applying this first factor to the instant case leads to only one conclusion: Duncan\u2019s statement in response to Detective Astbury\u2019s question was well within the scope of the public safety exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">First, Astbury posed only a single question. The question was nearly identical in form to those upheld by other courts, and numerous courts have held that even multiple questions can fall within the exception. <em>See, e.g., Newsome, </em>475 F.3d at 1223; <em>United States v. Fox, </em>393 F.3d 52, 56-57 (1st Cir.2004) <em>(remanded for farther consideration </em>in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by <em>Fox v. United States, </em>545 U.S. 1125, 125 S.Ct. 2949, 162 L.Ed.2d 864 (2005), conviction and sentence upheld by <em>United States v. Fox, </em>429 F.3d 316 (1st Cir.2005)); <em>United States v. Newton, </em>369 F.3d 659, 663-64, 678-79 (2d Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Khalil, </em>214 F.3d 111, 115 (2d Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>991 F.2d 1308, 1311 (7th Cir. 1993); <em>Fleming v. Collins, </em>954 F.2d 1109, 1111 (5th Cir.1992) (en banc); <em>Edwards, </em>885 F.2d at 384-85; <em>Brady, </em>819 F.2d at 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Second, Astbury asked the most narrow kind of question possible, requiring only a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer. <em>See Carrillo, </em>16 F.3d at 1049-50. Far broader questions, calling for more testimonial responses, have been upheld under <em>Quarles. See, e.g., Newsome, </em>475 F.3d at 1223 (\u201canything or anyone in the room that [police] should know about\u201d); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>406 F.3d 1160, 1163 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cwhat are those [weapons] doing there\u201d); <em>United States v. Luker, </em>395 F.3d 830, 832 (8th Cir.2005) (\u201cif there was anything in Luker\u2019s vehicle that shouldn\u2019t be there or that [the police] should know about\u201d); <em>Newton, </em>369 F.3d at 663 (inquiry regarding \u201ccontraband\u201d); <em>Williams, </em>181 F.3d at 953 (\u201cis there anything we need to be aware of\u2019); <em>Fleming, </em>954 F.2d at 1111 (\u201c[w]ho shot you,\u201d \u201c[w]ho was with you,\u201d \u201c[w]here is the gun\u201d); <em>United States v. Knox, </em>950 F.2d 516, 517 (8th Cir.1991) (\u201cwhere [is] the gun\u201d); <em>United States v. Padilla, </em>819 F.2d 952, 960 (10th Cir.1987) (\u201cwhether defendant was okay\u201d and \u201chow about inside the house\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Third, Astbury\u2019s question was in no way investigatory. As soon as Duncan answered the one question posed, Astbury stopped his questioning immediately. He did not ask why Duncan had the gun; he did not ask whether Duncan had a permit for the gun; he did not ask whether Duncan owned the gun; he did not ask whether Duncan had been previously convicted of a crime; he did not ask anything else. In <em>Quarles, </em>\u201cOfficer Kraft asked only the question necessary to locate the missing gun before advising [Quarles] of his rights,\u201d which demonstrated to the Court that the question was necessary to secure the public safety, and not to further the investigation. 467 U.S. at 659, 104 S.Ct. 2626. Similarly, Astbury\u2019s \u201cdisinclination to exploit the situation suggests that his question was a reasonable attempt to \u2018insure his personal safety in the midst of a search.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reyes, </em>353 F.3d at 154-55 (quoting <em>Carrillo, </em>16 F.3d at 1050). The narrow scope of Astbury\u2019s single question, which he did not follow with any other inquiries, indicates an attempt to dispel an immediate threat, not an effort to obtain incriminating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>For these reasons, the first factor used to assess the public safety doctrine weighs strongly in favor of applying it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The second factor is what the police knew about the defendant at the time of the encounter. A court\u2019s analysis of this factor compels consideration of two subsidiary questions: (1) whether the defendant is suspected of inherently violent crimes; and (2) whether the police have reason to think that the particular defendant is potentially dangerous. If the answers to either of these questions are in the affirmative, then this factor favors employing the public safety exception. In other words, if the police have such knowledge, the exception permits them \u201cto follow their legitimate instincts when confronting situations presenting a danger to the public safety.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S. at 659, 104 S.Ct. 2626.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">First, the type of crime attributed to the suspect impacts our analysis of whether the public safety exception applies. Specifically, when an individual is suspected of a crime that typically involves weapons or violence \u2014 such as illegal gun possession, murder, rape, robbery, assault, or bank robbery \u2014 such potential dangerousness can factor into the objective reasonableness of questions asked before provision of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and it is more likely that the public safety exception will permit admission of answers to an officer\u2019s questions regarding the presence of any weapons. <em>See, e.g., Williams, </em>483 F.3d at 429 (\u201cit may be objectively reasonable to believe that Williams had a weapon in his apartment based solely on the violent crimes that he allegedly had committed, aggravated rape and aggravated robbery\u201d); <em>Estrada, </em>430 F.3d at 613 (observing that where arresting officers knew that defendant had convictions for assault, they \u201chad an objectively reasonable need to protect themselves from immediate danger\u201d because \u201cconsidering [defendant\u2019s] assault convictions, the officers had reason to believe that [he] was capable of violence\u201d); <em>United States v. Shea, </em>150 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir.1998) (affirming admissibility of defendant\u2019s answer to question \u201cwhether he had any weapons\u201d in part because \u201cthe agent had just apprehended an individual suspected of attempting to commit a violent crime, armed bank robbery\u201d) <em>(recognized as abrogated on other grounds </em>by <em>United States v. Mojica-Baez, </em>229 F.3d 292, 310 (1st Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Thus, the police may generalize about individuals suspected of certain <em>kinds </em>of crimes, and the public safety threats that those types of individuals typically present, because of the presumption that individu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>ais suspected of violent crimes may well present a danger to public safety.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Second, if the police know of a <em>specific </em>threat posed by a <em>particular </em>suspect, that knowledge can make a police officer\u2019s decision to ask questions without warnings more objectively reasonable. In <em>Quarles </em>itself, the victim told the police that she had just been raped \u2014 an inherently violent crime \u2014 and that the defendant was carrying a gun, and so was potentially dangerous. <em>See </em>467 U.S. at 651-52, 104 S.Ct. 2626. This knowledge permitted the police to \u201cneutralize the volatile situation\u201d they confronted by asking the defendant non-Mirandized questions. <em>Id. </em>at 658, 104 S.Ct. 2626.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\"><em>Newton </em>is another good example of a case where officers\u2019 knowledge of a specific defendant\u2019s potential dangerousness factored into the court\u2019s public safety analysis. Newton lived with his mother after being paroled. Newton\u2019s mother contacted the authorities, claiming that Newton had threatened to kill her and her husband, and that Newton kept a gun in a shoe box by the door. Six officers went to the residence, and when Newton answered the door in his underwear, the officers told him to step into the hallway. They handcuffed him. An officer asked Newton whether he had any contraband, and Newton replied, \u201conly what is in the [shoe] box.\u201d <em>Newton, </em>369 F.3d at 664. The officer asked what was in the box, and Newton replied \u201ca two and two.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the public safety exception applied, in large part because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agi-dedup-0\">the officers who went to the apartment to perform the search knew that [Newton\u2019s mother] had recently reported both her son\u2019s possession of a firearm in their home and his threats to kill her and her husband. This information supported an objectively reasonable belief that Newton was dangerous, that he and his family were involved in a volatile domestic dispute, and that, until the gun was found, there was a serious and immediate risk of harm to anyone in the apartment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 678; <em>see also Newsome, </em>475 F.3d at 1223, 1225 (applying <em>Quarles </em>exception where police, knowing that Newsome was suspected of a shooting, handcuffed him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>and asked if there was \u201canything or anyone in the room that [he] should know about,\u201d because \u201cthe officers knew that they were dealing with a possibly armed, violent felon,\u201d and so \u201c[t]he officers reasonably believed that they were in danger, and they acted accordingly to protect themselves ... in making the arrest\u201d); <em>Martinez, </em>406 F.3d at 1162, 1165-66 (applying exception when officer, answering a domestic violence call complaining of an \u201cout of control\u201d man at the house, recognized the address as one to which he had previously been sent on a domestic violence incident); <em>Reyes, </em>353 F.3d at 154 (finding important that officers knew defendant was often armed in reversing District Court\u2019s suppression of defendant\u2019s response that he had a gun, as \u201cthe arresting officer here had an objectively reasonable belief that Reyes ... [had] a firearm on his person\u201d because \u201c[t]he officers [had] a solid basis for the belief that Reyes was armed and that the concealed weapon posed a danger to the police and to the public\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In <em>Quarles </em>and other cases, third parties provided the police with knowledge of a possible public safety threat. But perhaps even more relevant is a police officer\u2019s suspicion concerning a particular suspect based on the officer\u2019s personal observations. For example, in <em>Kelly, </em>an officer stopped Kelly for speeding, and noticed alcohol bottles and drug paraphernalia in Kelly\u2019s car. <em>See </em>991 F.2d at 1310-11. When the officer asked to search him, Kelly reached into his pocket and \u201cpulled out a fistful of change which contained several .22 caliber cartridges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1311. This display concerned the officer, and so he \u201casked Kelly if he had a gun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When Kelly did not answer, the officer \u201casked if the gun was in the trunk,\u201d to which Kelly replied that the gun was \u201con me.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit disposed of the case by holding that Kelly was not in custody for Fifth Amendment purposes, it observed that \u201conce Kelly produced the .22 cartridges in response to Dixon\u2019s query about drugs, Dixon was permitted to pursue the question of the location of the gun under the public safety exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Similarly, in <em>Knox, </em>the police knew from their interactions with the suspect that he was potentially dangerous. <em>See </em>950 F.2d at 517. There, the police noticed an empty car with its engine running, with footprints in the snow leading to a nearby building. They saw Knox and a woman exit the building and questioned Knox, who acted nervously. One officer \u201cconducted a pat search, felt something resembling a knife in a jacket pocket, and reached inside where he found a loaded magazine for a .38-caliber pistol\u201d and drugs. <em>Id. </em>After arresting Knox, \u201c[t]he officers asked him where the gun was, and he told them it was under the front seat of his car, where they retrieved it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s refusal to suppress the gun, holding that \u201cpublic safety concerns were present here. Knox was carrying cocaine and a loaded magazine but no gun. The police were justified in making an immediate attempt to locate the gun to eliminate this danger to themselves and to others in the area.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>On our facts, Astbury knew more about Duncan\u2019s potential dangerousness than did the police in many cases that have applied the public safety exception based at least in part on the police\u2019s knowledge of potential dangerousness. First, of course, Ast-bury had greater reason to fear Duncan than did the police in any of the cases cited above that permitted answers to public safety questions based solely on the fact that the defendant was suspected of a crime involving guns or violence. In such cases, the police do not know that the specific person they confront is dangerous \u2014 that there will in fact be a public safety threat \u2014 but only that a certain <em>category </em>of suspect is often dangerous. <em>See e.g., Williams, </em>483 F.3d 425, 429; <em>Estrada, </em>430 F.3d at 613; <em>Luker, </em>395 F.3d at 833-34; <em>Shea, </em>150 F.3d at 48; <em>Carrillo, </em>16 F.3d at 1049; <em>Edwards, </em>885 F.2d at 384. Here, by contrast, Astbury knew that Duncan, specifically, could be dangerous because Astbury personally observed Duncan with a silver object that might have been a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Further, Astbury had more direct knowledge that Duncan could pose a threat to him and his partner than the cases cited above where the police\u2019s information regarding dangerousness came from third parties. <em>See Quarles, </em>467 U.S. at 651-52, 104 S.Ct. 2626; <em>Newsome, </em>475 F.3d at 1222-23; <em>Martinez, </em>406 F.3d at 1165; <em>Newton, </em>369 F.3d at 678; <em>Reyes, </em>353 F.3d at 150. But all of these decisions, too, permitted admission of answers to public safety questions due, in part, to the police\u2019s second-hand knowledge that the defendant could be dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Here, however, Astbury relied upon his own personal observations of Duncan, as did the police in <em>Knox </em>and <em>Kelly. </em>The courts in both of those cases held that the public safety exception applied, in part because when officers learn of the defendants\u2019 dangerousness from their own observations, this favors application of the public safety exception. In <em>Kelly, </em>once the officer saw the .22 caliber cartridges among a handful of change, he \u201cwas permitted to pursue the question of the location of the gun under the public safety exception.\u201d 991 F.2d at 1313. In <em>Knox, </em>once the officer first felt and then retrieved the magazine, \u201cthe police questioning was lawful under the public safety exception.\u201d 950 F.2d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Just as in <em>Knox </em>and <em>Kelly, </em>Detective Astbury had an objectively reasonable basis to fear Duncan based on what Astbury observed personally during the fast-moving encounter. Astbury had come upon a man drinking alcohol who, when spotted by the police, began moving \u201cfrantically\u201d around inside his car. JA 120. From less than seven feet away, Astbury saw Duncan \u201cattempting to conceal a silver object in his right front pocket.\u201d JA 30. Ast-bury believed the object was a gun. His pat-frisk of Duncan\u2019s right pocket, revealing a hard, heavy object, strengthened his suspicions \u2014 but did not confirm them. <em>See </em>JA 50 (Astbury \u201cwasn\u2019t 100 percent sure\u201d that Duncan\u2019s silver object was a gun). To eliminate the uncertainty in this brief and volatile confrontation, Astbury asked if the object in the pocket was a gun. In this situation, the second factor\u2014 what Astbury knew of Duncan\u2019s potential dangerousness \u2014 strongly supports admitting in evidence Duncan\u2019s answer to Ash-bury's question pursuant to the public safety exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The third factor is the characteristics of the encounter between the police and the suspect. As the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has observed, \u201cthe public safety exception should be virtually intuitively comprehensible to police officers. When the danger inherent in a confrontation has passed, so has the basis for the exception.\u201d <em>Fleming, </em>954 F.2d at 1114. Accordingly, relevant inquiries include whether the suspect was handcuffed or otherwise secured; whether the suspect made furtive, irregular, or disconcerting movements; and the general dangerousness of the atmosphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Duncan was not handcuffed but rather was only being held by Astbury. Numerous courts have held that the answers of far more subdued defendants were properly admitted pursuant to the public safety exception. Indeed, many courts have held that even where a defendant is handcuffed, the public safety exception can apply. Remember that in <em>Quarles </em>itself, the defendant was handcuffed when questioned. <em>See </em>467 U.S. at 655, 104 S.Ct. 2626. The Court decided, however, that the danger to unsuspecting civilians sufficed to apply the exception. <em>Id. </em>at 657, 104 S.Ct. 2626; <em>see also United States v. Liddell, </em>517 F.3d 1007, 1008 (8th Cir.2008) (applying exception when after defendant was removed from his car, arrested, handcuffed, and put in back of police car, police found an unloaded gun under front seat and then asked whether there was \u201canything else in [the car] we need to know about\u201d); <em>New-some, </em>475 F.3d at 1225 (determining that exception applied where defendant was handcuffed on floor because \u201cofficers reasonably believed that they were in danger\u201d); <em>Luker, </em>395 F.3d at 835 (applying exception where defendant had already been arrested, handcuffed, and patted down); <em>Newton, </em>369 F.3d at 678 (holding that public safety issue remained notwithstanding that Newton was handcuffed and in hallway outside his apartment because \u201cthe unlocated gun presented a deadly risk to everyone on the premises\u201d); <em>Lackey, </em>334 F.3d at 1225-27 (finding \u201ca real and substantial risk to the safety of the officers and Defendant\u201d after defendant was handcuffed and led away from his car); <em>Williams, </em>181 F.3d at 948, 950, 953-54 (permitting answer to question posed to a \u201cfrail and elderly looking\u201d defendant handcuffed and lying in bed).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">As even a handcuffed defendant can pose a threat to an officer\u2019s safety, an uncuffed defendant poses a particularly acute danger. For example, in <em>Reyes, </em>the police had apprehended, but not yet handcuffed, Reyes when they asked him questions before reciting the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>See </em>353 F.3d at 154. The police knew that Reyes was often armed, and therefore \u201cthere was a risk that Reyes was carrying a loaded gun that could accidentally be discharged during a search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Combined with the fact that Reyes \u201cwas not yet handcuffed\u201d and so \u201cstill could have reached for a concealed weapon,\u201d the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that \u201c[t]he officers had a solid basis for the belief that ... the concealed weapon posed a danger to the police and to the public.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>The situation posed by <em>Reyes </em>is exactly the situation here. Just as in <em>Reyes, </em>Duncan was not yet handcuffed. Just as in <em>Reyes, </em>Astbury had a \u201csolid basis for the belief\u2019 that Duncan well might be armed. Just as in <em>Reyes, </em>Duncan \u201cstill could have reached for a concealed weapon,\u201d and indeed Duncan twice made movements towards exactly the area where the weapon was later found. Accordingly, just as in <em>Reyes, </em>Astbury \u201chad a solid basis for the belief that ... the concealed weapon posed a danger to the police and to the public.\u201d 353 F.3d at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The next inquiry examines a defendant\u2019s furtive, irregular, or disconcerting movements, which can heighten the safety threat to officers and strengthen the applicability of the <em>Quarles </em>exception. The situation in <em>Fox </em>was similar to our own. 393 F.3d 52. After stopping Fox\u2019s car for a traffic violation, the officer activated his car\u2019s spotlight and \u201cobserved that Fox, the vehicle\u2019s sole occupant, \u201cwas moving around ... more than ... normal for an average traffic stop.\u2019 He also saw Fox make a ducking motion, as if \u2018reaching for something under the seat or placing something under the seat.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fox, </em>393 F.3d at 56 (ellipses in original). The officer exited his vehicle and recognized Fox as someone he had previously arrested for firearm possession. The officer \u201cthen noticed a large bulge in Fox\u2019s left inside jacket pocket,\u201d and ordered Fox to exit the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>A frisk revealed brass knuckles and an unused shotgun shell on Fox\u2019s person. The officer then asked Fox, without providing <em>Miranda </em>warnings, to locate the gun that went with the shell. This questioning led to the discovery of a shotgun in Fox\u2019s car. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld the district court\u2019s denial of Fox\u2019s suppression motion because \u201c[ujnder the circumstances, [the officer] was permitted to ask Fox whether he possessed any weapons.... Having found the live shell and realized that he had previously arrested Fox for possessing a firearm, [the officer] had ample reason to fear for his own safety and that of the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">In <em>Reilly, </em>too, the defendant\u2019s furtive movements factored into the court\u2019s decision to apply the public safety exception. <em>See </em>224 F.3d 986. The police learned that Reilly, a suspect in dozens of bank robberies and an armed carjacking, was staying in a motel room. Five officers burst into the room, three .with guns drawn, and ordered Reilly to he face-down on the floor. Reilly complied, but as one agent approached to handcuff him, Reilly \u201cbegan to bring his arms to his front waistband, and the agents told him to reposition his arms, which he did.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 990. One agent then asked Reilly, \u201cWhere is the gun?\u201d to which Reilly replied that it was in a black bag in the bedroom. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of Reilly\u2019s motion to suppress. The officer asked about the gun \u201conly after Reilly started to bring his hands to his waistband, a place where weapons are frequently concealed. The officers had no idea whether Reilly was armed or not, and this suspicious move reasonably caused Agent Johnson to fear that Reilly might be reaching for a weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 993. The Court concluded that \u201c[t]here was an objectively reasonable need on the part of the officers to protect themselves given the volatility of the situation with which they were faced.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Williams, </em>483 F.3d at 428 (holding that public safety exception applies \u201cif and only if\u2019 two conditions are satisfied: \u201c(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>that the defendant might have (or recently have had) a weapon, and (2) that someone other than police might gain access to that weapon and inflict harm with it,\u201d and that while second prong would not apply, for instance, if the police entered a defendant\u2019s room, handcuffed him, and placed him on a chair in the hallway outside his room, it might apply if defendant was \u201cunrestrained and had turned back into his room to retrieve his identification\u201d when questioned by the police).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Comparing <em>Fox </em>and <em>Reilly </em>to our case leads to the inescapable conclusion that the third factor favors applying the public safety exception to Duncan\u2019s answer to Astbury\u2019s question. Exactly as in <em>Fox, </em>when Astbury\u2019s spotlight first hit him Duncan began \u201c \u2018moving around ... more than ... normal for an average traffic stop,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cducking [down], as if \u2018reaching for something under the seat or placing something under the seat.\u2019 \u201d 393 F.3d at 56 (ellipses in original). Duncan then exited his car against Astbury\u2019s instructions. Once out of the car, he twice wrestled his arms down from the roof of the car and moved for his right jacket pocket, the area that Astbury believed contained a gun. All of this took place within the span of \u201cless than two minutes.\u201d JA136.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Accordingly, as in <em>Fox </em>and <em>Reilly, </em>Duncan made fast and worrisome movements both while inside and after exiting his car. And as in <em>Reilly, </em>Astbury asked his question only after Duncan reached twice for his pocket, \u201ca place where weapons are frequently concealed,\u201d and the place where Astbury in fact had reason to think that Duncan had a weapon concealed. 224 F.3d at 993. Thus, \u201cthis suspicious move reasonably caused [Astbury] to fear that [Duncan] might be reaching for a weapon.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">For all these reasons, I believe that the characteristics of the encounter between Astbury and Duncan favor admitting Duncan\u2019s answer pursuant to the public safety exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">The majority is absolutely correct when they note that <em>Quarles </em>created only a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the rule of <em>Miranda. </em>467 U.S. at 658, 104 S.Ct. 2626. Nonetheless, I believe Duncan\u2019s statement should not be suppressed because the totality of the facts and circumstances here clearly caused Astbury to have an objectively reasonable fear for his safety. Again, I believe that the following factors may be considered in examining the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the public safety exception should apply: first, what questions the police ask, including the number, scope, and purpose (investigatory or safety-related); second, what the police knew about the defendant at the time of the encounter, including whether the defendant was suspected of a crime involving weapons or violence and whether the police had information that the defendant was potentially dangerous; and third, the characteristics of the encounter: whether the defendant was handcuffed or otherwise secured, whether the defendant made furtive, irregular, or disconcerting movements, and how dangerous the atmosphere appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">For the reasons set forth above, I respectfully concur with the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\">. He used a code, instead of simply saying \"gun,\u201d because often \"if you say gun, some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>body who has a gun, it may startle them, may think that we\u2019re trying to get that gun off of them, make them more nervous and make the situation even worse.\" JA 130. On the other hand, \u201cif somebody who has a gun knows that the police know [they] have a gun ... it makes the situation a little bit easier.\u201d JA 129. In addition, \"if I know it\u2019s a gun, I can go inside of his pocket more carefully and get it out rather than just going in there and not knowing what it is.\u201d JA 129-30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\">. Warnings pursuant to <em>Miranda </em>are required only if a suspect is both in custody <em>and </em>subject to interrogation. Here, the parties agree that Duncan was subject to custodial interrogation. Duncan was in custody for Fifth Amendment purposes because Astbury was attempting to restrain Duncan while frisking him. <em>See California v. Beheler, </em>463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S.Ct. 3517, 77 L.Ed.2d 1275 (1983) (holding that Fifth Amendment custody is a \"restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). Astbury's question was interrogation because, if answered in the affirmative, it was likely to elicit an incriminating response. <em>See Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b634-5\">. Duncan attempts to distinguish this case from <em>Quarles </em>on the theory that \u201cthere could have been no legitimate concern for the public\u2019s safety in general because no members of the public were present.\u201d (Duncan Br. at 27.) Although the majority does not address this point, it need not detain us long because <em>Quarles </em>itself rejects Duncan\u2019s contention. <em>See </em>467 U.S. at 658-59, 104 S.Ct. 2626 (describing scope of the public safety exception as encompassing \"questions necessary <em>to secure their own safety or </em>the safety of the public\u201d) (emphasis added). This, of course, makes perfect sense \u2014 police officers\u2019 lives are not to be sacrificed at the altar of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Several courts of appeals have come to the identical conclusion, reinforcing the settled point that the public safety exception covers questions designed to secure the safety of police officers. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Estrada, </em>430 F.3d 606, 612 (2d Cir.2005) (noting that \u201cthe public safety exception clearly encompasses questions necessary to secure the safety of police officers\u201d); <em>United States v.

The exception undoubtedly extends to officers\u2019 questions necessary to secure their own safety.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted); <em>United States v. Carrillo, </em>16 F.3d 1046, 1050 (9th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>885 F.2d 377, 384 n. 4 (7th Cir. 1989); <em>United States v. DeSantis, </em>870 F.2d 536, 539 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\">. Our Court has never dealt squarely with the public safety exception. Only <em>United States v. DeSumma, </em>272 F.3d 176 (3d Cir.2001), discusses the doctrine in any detail, and does so only in dicta.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\">. It follows that, generally, the more questions asked by the police, and the broader their scope, the less likely the public safety exception should apply. This is not to say, however, that only the narrowest possible question will be permitted, as courts have recognized universally that \"public safety questions are framed spontaneously in dangerous situations. Precision crafting cannot be expected in such circumstances.\u201d <em>Newton, </em>369 F.3d at 678 (finding permissible question inquiring whether there was any \"contraband\u201d \u2014 not simply a firearm \u2014 in defendant's home). Thus, questions \"need not be posed as narrowly as possible ... in the circumstances of a tense and dangerous arrest.\u201d <em>Estrada, </em>430 F.3d at 612. Accordingly, \"a question that plainly encompasses safety concerns, but is broad enough to elicit other information, does not necessarily prevent application of the public safety exception when safety is at issue and context makes clear that the question primarily involves safety.\u201d <em>Id.; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number><em>see also United States v. Newsome, </em>475 F.3d 1221, 1223, 1225 (11th Cir.2007) (permitting question with \"broad phrasing\u201d \u2014 whether there was \"anything or anyone in the room that [police] should know about\u201d \u2014 because \"[t]he officer asked what was necessary to secure the scene....

We must also recognize why this inquiry does not run afoul of the <em>Quarles </em>Court\u2019s admonishment that the officer\u2019s subjective intent is irrelevant. As the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">[t]hough evidence of pretext[ual questioning asked only to obtain testimonial evidence] goes most directly to the officer's subjective beliefs (rather than the objective reasonableness of those beliefs), we consider such evidence to the extent that it informs our understanding of the objective circumstances. Generally, the fact that an officer was willing to manipulate the scene of an arrest in order to gather evidence makes it unlikely that he could have formed an objectively reasonable belief that he was in danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-12\"><em>United States v. Williams, </em>483 F.3d 425, 429-30 (6th Cir.2007). Thus, courts may consider an officer's questions not to determine the subjective intent of the officer, but rather to examine the objective reasonableness of the officer\u2019s belief that he or she confronted an imminently dangerous situation. If an officer has the time to ask questions that seek to solve a crime, and not just to eliminate a safety threat, then this fact may tend to demonstrate that there was no \"objectively reasonable need to protect the police or the public.\u201d <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S. at 659 n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 2626.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b639-8\">. It is true that the public safety exception is applied using a standard of objective reasonableness. <em>See Quarles, </em>467 U.S. at 656, 104 S.Ct. 2626. This is because in fast-moving, dangerous situations, \"spontaneity rather than adherence to a police manual is necessarily the order of the day,\u201d and therefore \"the application of the exception ... should not be made to depend on post hoc findings at a suppression hearing concerning the subjective motivation of the arresting officer.\u201d <em>Id.-, see also United States v. Holt, </em>264 F.3d 1215, 1225-26 (10th Cir.2001) (\"That one officer is braver (or more foolhardy) than another, and therefore not subjectively concerned for his or her safety, should not deprive that particular officer of a right to protect his or her safety. Even the brave officer should be allowed to minimize the ever-present risk of being attacked or killed.\u201d). Accordingly, courts are not to enter the mind of the arresting officer and assess the officer's intention when asking the challenged questions. But we must distinguish this prohibition from a related inquiry that is wholly proper: what the officers knew about the defendant when they confronted one another. What the police officers knew is essential to determining whether their actions were objectively reasonable, and does not overlap with their subjective reasons for asking their questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b640-6\">. Indeed, at least four courts of appeals have held admissible, pursuant to the public safety exception, answers to questions commonly posed to suspected drug users and dealers\u2014 such as whether they possess guns or needles \u2014 even without any specific, articulable fear of the particular suspect. <em>See Estrada, </em>430 F.3d at 613 (determining that police\u2019s knowledge that suspect kept drugs in apartment \"gave rise to a reasonable belief that he also kept a gun there. We have often recognized that firearms are tools of the drug trade that are commonly kept on the premises of major narcotics dealers.\u201d); <em>Luker, </em>395 F.3d at 833-34 (permitting defendant\u2019s admission that a shotgun was in his car because officers \"were aware of Luker's history of methamphetamine use\u201d); <em>Carrillo, </em>16 F.3d at 1049 (concluding that public safety exception permitted admission of answer to question whether suspect had any needles or drugs on him because officer\u2019s question \"stemmed from an objectively reasonable need to protect himself from immediate danger,\u201d and even though \"[t]he risk [of avoiding contact with syringes and toxic substances] differs from that presented by a gun, [] the danger of transmission of disease or contact with harmful substances is real and serious enough; a pressing need for haste is not essential\u201d); <em>Edwards, </em>885 F.2d at 380, 384, 384 n. 4 (affirming admission of answers to several questions, including presence of gun, posed to handcuffed suspected drug dealer, because \"drug dealers are known to arm themselves, particularly when making a sale,\u201d and thus officer had \"an objectively reasonable need to protect himself, his partner, and the public [] from the immediate danger that a weapon would pose\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Webster, </em>162 F.3d 308, 332 (5th Cir.1998) (affirming admission of incriminating answer to question whether defendant had any needles in his pockets).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b641-6\">. None of the above discussion is intended to imply that evidence of a defendant\u2019s dangerousness is required to apply the exception. At least two courts have held that even where the police have no knowledge that a weapon might be present \u2014 from any source \u2014 the exception can nevertheless apply. <em>See United States v. DeSantis, </em>870 F.2d 536, 539 (9th Cir. 1989) (affirming under <em>Quarles </em>admission that gun was in closet where defendant, served with arrest warrant at home, asked if he could go to the bedroom to change his clothes, and officer asked him \"whether there were any weapons in the bedroom.\u201d The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that it was \"of no consequence\u201d that \"the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>inspectors had no reason to suspect that a gun might be present and had no reason to fear DeSantis.\u201d); <em>Brady, </em>819 F.2d at 888 (where a potentially unstable crowd had gathered at the arrest scene, exception applied notwithstanding that police had no \u201creason to believe that Brady had disposed of a gun in a place where it posed an immediate public danger,\u201d and that in fact \"[tjhere was no [] indication that Brady possessed a weapon\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b643-7\">. Indeed, when the defendant is not yet handcuffed, even when the situation is seemingly very secure, courts have applied the public safety exception. <em>See, e.g., Padilla, </em>819 F.2d at 960 (applying exception where, after receiving report of a man firing shots, police confronted defendant, ordered him to drop his weapon, made him lie on his stomach spread-eagle, and then asked him questions); <em>Estrada, </em>430 F.3d at 608-09, 613-14 (applying exception where defendant was lying face-down on the floor, with one officer standing over and attempting to handcuff him, when another officer asked about weapons in the apartment); <em>Reilly, </em>224 F.3d at 993 (upholding question \"where is the gun\u201d posed to suspect who was subdued and surrounded by police with weapons drawn, in part because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>defendant \"was not yet handcuffed and still had the capacity to reach and grab any nearby objects\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b645-12\">POLLAK, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Auc\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">I join Judge Rendell\u2019s opinion for the court without reservation. The opinion places in exact focus the facts yielding an answer to the question whether this is an instance in which the familiar directive of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), that a person in custody must be \u201cMirandized\u201d before any questioning is permissible is subject to the <em>New York v. Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 658, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>\u201cnarrow exception to the <em>Miranda </em>rule,\u201d authorizing the police to ask one who has not yet been Mirandized \u201cquestions necessary to secure their own [the police officers\u2019] safety or the safety of the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659,104 S.Ct. 2626. Judge Rendell\u2019s opinion for the court concludes that under the facts of record in the case at bar the challenged police question was justified by <em>Quarles, </em>but characterizes this as \u201ca close case given the narrowness of the exception.\u201d I agree with Judge Rendell.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Judge Chagares joins the court\u2019s judgment upholding appellant\u2019s conviction but, as he explains, \u201cI write separately because I do not believe that the application of <em>Quarles </em>here presents a \u2018close case.\u2019 \u201d In aid of his differing view Judge Chagares argues that, in cases posing the <em>Quarles </em>question, \u201cthree factors are useful in determining whether or not the public safety exception applies. The first factor is the questions the police ask.... The second factor is what the police knew about the defendant at the time of the encounter.... The third factor examines the characteristics of the encounter....\u201d Of course one or more of these factors, as adumbrated by Judge Chagares, may be of analytic assistance in a particular case. So may other factors. I would, however, think it would be unhelpful for this court to draw a standard <em>Quarles </em>blueprint against which trial judges would be expected to measure the manifold fact-patterns of arrest and resultant custody. In <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>353 F.3d 148 (2d Cir.2003), the Second Circuit cogently warned against pursuing generalizations that may obscure the particularized question that must be addressed in every case \u2014 namely, was this a situation in which, objectively assessed, the safety of the police or the public warranted postponement of the <em>Miranda </em>warning? \u201cThe public safety exception,\u201d said the court, \u201cpermits questions \u2018reasonably prompted by a concern\u2019 for safety and in each case \u201cwill be circumscribed by the exigency which justifies it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152 <em>(quoting Quarles, </em>467 U.S. at 656, 658,104 S.Ct. 2626). \u201cLike the reasonableness standard itself,\u201d the court continued, \u201cthe public safety exception is \u2018a function of the facts of cases so various that no template is likely to produce sounder results than examining the totality of circumstances in a given case.\u2019 \u201d 353 F.3d at 152 <em>(quoting United States v. Banks, </em>540 U.S. 31, 36, 124 S.Ct. 521, 157 L.Ed.2d 343 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In <em>Reyes, </em>the Second Circuit ruled, as we do here, that the challenged police questioning, which elicited inculpatory response, was warranted by <em>Quarles. </em>The court was, however, at pains to point out that its ruling was specific to the facts before it: \u201cWe emphasize that it cannot become a matter of course to precede every <em>Miranda </em>warning with the questions that were put to Reyes. We remain vigilant that \u2018a right enshrined in the words of the Constitution is not lost in the reality of the street.\u2019 \u201d 353 F.3d at 155 <em>(quoting United States v. Anderson, </em>929 F.2d 96, 99 (2d Cir.1991)).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
