We review for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-24\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum because, even taking Singh\u2019s testimony as true, he failed to establish that his abuse by the Indian police was motivated, even in part, on account of a protected ground. <em>See Dinu v. Ashcroft, </em>372 F.3d 1041, 1044-15 (9th Cir. 2004). Because Singh\u2019s fear of future persecution is based on his past encounters with the Indian police, he has failed to show a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 961-62 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-25\">Because Singh did not establish asylum eligibility, it necessarily follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>We deny the petition as to Singh\u2019s CAT claim because the record does not compel the conclusion that it is more likely than not he will be tortured if returned to India. <em>See Hasan v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 1114, 1123 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b159-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
