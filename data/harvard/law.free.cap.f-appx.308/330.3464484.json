She alleges that, if she returns to China, she will be persecuted because she practices Falun Gong. The IJ expressly found that Yan\u2019s testimony was incredible, and Yan challenges this finding on appeal. In general, she argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was groundless and a result of his misunderstanding of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-18\">The IJ also found that Yan\u2019s daughter\u2014 who testified on her behalf \u2014 was not credible, and that, even if Yan\u2019s testimony was accepted as true, it did not establish persecution. Because we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Yan was not credible, and that this finding was dispositive, we decline to address the propriety of the IJ\u2019s other findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-19\">Because the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Factual findings, including credibility determinations, are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817-18 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c[W]e cannot engage in fact-finding on appeal, nor may we weigh evidence that was not previously considered below.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 at 1278. Therefore, a finding of fact will be reversed \u201conly when the record compels reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc); see also </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-20\">\u201cThe trier of fact must determine credibility, and [we] may not substitute [our] judgment for that of the [IJ] with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818. \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>stantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he IJ\u2019s extremely detailed adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the IJ\u2019s denial of\u2019 an asylum application. <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819. However, \u201can adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by the asylum applicant.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. The \u201cIJ must still consider <em>all </em>evidence introduced by the applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). The INA, as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, directs the IJ to base credibility determinations on the totality of the circumstances, which may include \u201cthe demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s account, the consistency between the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s written and oral statements ..., [and] the internal consistency of each such statement.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(Hi), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The record here demonstrates that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Yan was not credible. The testimony she gave at the administrative hearing did not match the account she gave with her application or to the asylum officer. Also, she looked to her attorney before answering simple questions, so her demeanor was not that of a credible witness. Therefore, the IJ had specific, cogent reasons-which are supported by the record-to find that Yan was not credible. The IJ\u2019s decision reveals that he considered the record as a whole, so there was a sufficient basis to deny Yan\u2019s application for asylum. Accordingly, we deny Yan\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
