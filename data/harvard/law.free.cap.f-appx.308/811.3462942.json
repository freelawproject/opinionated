Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), and dismissing Foster\u2019s claim with prejudice. Foster does not challenge the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>court\u2019s choice to abstain, but instead, appeals its ruling dismissing his claims with prejudice. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Foster operates an adult entertainment club in El Paso. The City has an ordinance prohibiting certain conduct in sexually oriented businesses and regulating their hours of operation. In June 2007, Foster sued in Texas court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and alleging that the ordinance violates his rights of speech, equal protection, and substantive due process under the Texas Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In December 2007, three of Foster\u2019s employees were cited for violating the ordinance. In February 2008, Foster brought a federal suit seeking injunctive relief and damages for violations of his federal constitutional rights to equal protection and substantive due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The district court granted the city\u2019s motion to abstain from exercising jurisdiction under <em>Younger </em>and dismissed Foster\u2019s claim with prejudice. Foster now appeals. Apparently resigned to bringing both his federal and state claims in state court, he only appeals the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss with prejudice. He fears that a Texas court will consider a federal court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice, by itself, as a final decision on the merits foreclosing relief at the state level for his federal, and perhaps state, constitutional claims. This fear is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">A Texas court will apply the federal law of claim preclusion to a decision rendered in federal court. <em>San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. McKinney, </em>936 S.W.2d 279, 281 (Tex.1996). The proceedings below very clearly do not meet this court\u2019s four-element test for claim preclusion. <em>See, e.g., Test Masters Educ. Servs., Inc. v. Singh, </em>428 F.3d 559, 571 (5th Cir.2005). Specifically, Foster\u2019s claims were not decided \u201con the merits.\u201d The district court\u2019s express purpose in applying <em>Younger </em>abstention was to avoid reaching the merits, which would likely interfere with pending state judicial proceedings. Accordingly, federal law does not preclude Foster from litigating his claims in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">Further, the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Semtek International, Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. </em>held that a dismissal with prejudice, without more, is not claim-pre-clusive. 531 U.S. 497, 505-06, 121 S.Ct. 1021, 1027, 149 L.Ed.2d 32 (2001). The opinion contained an extended discussion of what a dismissal with and without prejudice means in the context of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 41(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-10\">The primary meaning of dismissal without prejudice, we think, is dismissal without barring plaintiff from returning later, to the same court, with the same underlying claim. That will also ordinarily (though not always) have the consequence of not barring the claim from <em>other </em>courts, but its primary meaning relates to the dismissing court itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-11\">We think, then, that the effect of the \u201cadjudication upon the merits\u201d default provision in Rule 41(b) ... is simply that, unlike a dismissal \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d the dismissal in the present case barred refiling of the same claim in the [same federal district court].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">Although <em>Semtek, </em>dealt with diversity jurisdiction, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding and its related discussion make clear that dismissals \u201cwith prejudice\u201d or \u201con the merits,\u201d or both, are governed by federal common law, not Fed R. Civ. Pro. 41(b). <em>Semtek, </em>531 U.S. at 508, 121 S.Ct. at 1028. The Court went on to note that other courts may view a dismissal with prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>in federal court as having claim preclusive effect, but that such a holding might violate the Rules Enabling Act and could be better addressed on direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 506 n. 2, 121 S.Ct. at 1027 n. 2; <em>see also Vasquez v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., </em>325 F.3d 665, 679 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201c[Pjermitting a rule of civil procedure to control the effect given a federal judgment by a state court arguably violates the jurisdictional limitation of the Rules Enabling Act.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">A Texas court may erroneously choose to disregard <em>Semtek </em>and this court\u2019s claim-preclusion law by concluding that all dismissals with prejudice have claim-preclu-sive effect, but this court will not alter the lower court\u2019s judgment on the premise that a Texas court will commit such an error. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Semtek, </em>Foster may address this issue, if it arises, in a Texas court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b835-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
