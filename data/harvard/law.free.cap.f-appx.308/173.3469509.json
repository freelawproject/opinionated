We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 816 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">The district court properly dismissed Funderburk\u2019s due process claim because he did not show that he had a protected liberty interest in being free from confinement in administrative segregation. <em>See Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447-48 (9th Cir.2000) (dismissing due process claim where the plaintiff failed to allege any material difference between the conditions in administrative segregation and the conditions in the general population).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">The district court properly dismissed Funderburk\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim because his allegations were insufficient to state a claim for failure to protect. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 835-39, 843, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (explaining that a prison official is not liable for failing to protect one inmate from another unless the prisoner shows that he was housed under conditions that posed a substantial risk of serious harm, and that the prison official acted with deliberate indifference to the prisoner\u2019s safety).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">The district court properly dismissed Funderburk\u2019s claims against the warden defendants to the extent they were based on respondeat superior liability. <em>See Palmer v. Sanderson, </em>9 F.3d 1433, 1437-38 (9th Cir.1993) (explaining that there is no respondeat superior liability under \u00a7 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b198-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
