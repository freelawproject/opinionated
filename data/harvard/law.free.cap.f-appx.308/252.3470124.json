Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Plaintiff Joseph Lyons, a state inmate appearing pro se, appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to reconsider the district court\u2019s prior order of dismissal. Mr. Lyons is in the custody of the Colorado Department of Corrections (CDOC) at the North Fork Correctional Facility at Sayre, Oklahoma. Mr. Lyons\u2019 primary complaint is that his transfer from a CDOC facility in Colorado to a private prison in Oklahoma violates various Colorado statutes, and that, as a result, the CDOC has effectively released him from custody and the private prison is now detaining him illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Mr. Lyons initiated these proceedings by filing pro se a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 on December 11, 2007. 1 R. Doc. 3. He then amended his complaint on January 4, 2008. 1 R. Doc. 5. In its order of dismissal, the district court construed the complaint liberally and concluded that the relief Mr. Lyons sought was release from custody; accordingly, it treated the complaint as asserting habeas claims under \u00a7 2254. <em>Lyons v. Zavaras, </em>No. 07-cv-02569, 2008 WL 357030, at *1 (D.Colo. Feb.8, 2008). Without requiring exhaustion of the federal constitutional claims, the court then dismissed the complaint because Mr. Lyons\u2019 state law claims were not cognizable in a federal habeas action and his constitutional claims lacked any arguable merit. <em>Id. </em>(relying upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2)). Then, on March 13, 2008, Mr. Lyons filed a \u201cMotion to Proceed With the Plaintiffs Original 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 Filing, and Objection to Order.\u201d 1 R. Doc. 14. The district court treated this as a motion to reconsider pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) because it was filed more than ten days after the order of dismissal. <em>Lyons v. Zavaras, </em>No. 07-cv-02569, 2008 WL 852657, at *1 (D.Colo. Mar. 28, 2008). The district court then denied the motion because Mr. Lyons could not pursue release from custody in a \u00a7 1983 action. Furthermore, the court noted that Mr. Lyons\u2019 state law claims could not be asserted in a \u00a7 1983 action and his constitutional claims lacked merit. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, Mr. Lyons argues that the district court erred in re-characterizing his \u00a7 1983 claims as arising under habeas, and that he is entitled to relief under Colorado, Oklahoma, and federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">The district court properly treated Mr. Lyons\u2019 March 13 motion as falling under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) because motions for reconsideration that are served more than ten days after the final judgment are construed to be motions pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) rather than Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). <em>See Manco v. Werholtz, </em>528 F.3d 760, 761 (10th Cir.2008). Relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) \u201cis extraordinary and may only be granted in exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Davis v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>507 F.3d 1246, 1248 (10th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Amoco Oil Co. v. U.S. Env\u2019t Prot. Agency, </em>231 F.3d 694, 697 (10th Cir.2000)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Where the motion to reconsider was filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>more than ten days after the entry of final judgment and the notice of appeal was filed more than thirty days after entry of final judgment, this court can \u201creview only the district court\u2019s order of denial and not the underlying judgment itself.\u201d <em>Van Skiver v. United States, </em>952 F.2d 1241, 1243 (10th Cir.1991); <em>see Carpenter v. Williams, </em>86 F.3d 1015, 1016 (10th Cir. 1996). Therefore, we review only the denial of Rule 60(b) relief, and will reverse only if the district court abused its discretion. <em>See Butler v. Kempthorne, </em>532 F.3d 1108, 1110 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mr. Lyons\u2019 motion for reconsideration. While Mr. Lyons seeks to bring this action on behalf of all prisoners who were transferred to the private prison, a pro se litigant may not represent other pro se litigants in federal court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654; <em>Fymbo v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., </em>213 F.3d 1320, 1321 (10th Cir.2000). Moreover, this case is governed squarely by <em>Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 864-65 (10th Cir. 2000), and <em>Rael v. Williams, </em>223 F.3d 1153, 1154 (10th Cir.2000). In <em>Montez, </em>we construed a similar claim as one challenging the execution of a state sentence and arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Montez, </em>208 F.3d at 865-66. We determined that no federal constitutional right was implicated by such a transfer and that state-law claims could not be brought in a habeas action under \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In <em>Rael, </em>we reaffirmed that challenges based upon various contractual and state law provisions are state law claims not cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 action challenging a prison transfer. <em>Rael, </em>223 F.3d at 1154. In both cases, we required an inmate to obtain a certificate of appealability (COA) to proceed on appeal. <em>Rael, </em>223 F.3d at 1155; <em>Montez, </em>208 F.3d at 868-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">We acknowledge that Mr. Lyons\u2019 main contention is that he is not actually seeking release from custody; rather, he argues, he has already been released by the CDOC because he was transferred to a private prison which, he alleges, does not have a legal contract with the CDOC to house inmates and is therefore simply detaining him illegally. Given our precedent, however, such a challenge is properly construed to arise under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Montez, </em>208 F.3d at 865 (noting that the inmate challenged the continuing validity of the state sentence given the transfers).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">Accordingly, we construe Mr. Lyon\u2019s notice of appeal as a request for COA. Fed. RApp. P. 22(b)(2); 10th Cir. 22.1(A). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). However, there are no grounds on which to issue a COA because we conclude that Mr. Lyons has faded to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d and the district court\u2019s result is not reasonably debatable based upon our precedent. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">We DENY the request for a COA, DENY IFP status, and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b278-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-6\">. Other circuits have relied upon \u00a7 2254. <em>See White v. Lambert, </em>370 F.3d 1002, 1008-09 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
