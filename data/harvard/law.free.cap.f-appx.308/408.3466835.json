Texido sought re-entry to the United States in February 2005, and his request was denied because the Department of Homeland Security determined his convictions rendered him inadmissible under \u00a7 212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Texido told the IJ he intended to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(c). The IJ gave Texido nearly nine months to file a complete application package, and when Texido failed to comply with this deadline, the IJ deemed his application abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-21\">\u201c[WJhen a party lists an issue for appellate review but does not discuss that question in their argument, they have abandoned it.\u201d <em>Bayro v. Reno, </em>142 F.3d 1377, 1379 (11th Cir.1998). Although Texido\u2019s Statement of Issues identifies the question of whether he abandoned his application as an issue for us to review, he does not present any argument or cite any authority on this issue. Accordingly, we find he has abandoned any challenge to the IJ\u2019s determination he abandoned his application. As this issue is dispositive of Texi-do\u2019s appeal, we deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-22\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
