He previously moved to vacate, set aside, or correct the sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court dismissed that motion with prejudice, and Smith did not seek a certificate of appealability. He then filed a motion for writ of <em>coram nobis </em>in the district court challenging the calculation of his sentence under the sentencing guidelines and claiming ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The district court denied the motion on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-18\">Because the writ of <em>coram nobis </em>is not available while Smith is in custody, <em>see United States v. Castro, </em>26 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir.1994), his <em>pro se </em>motion should have been treated as a motion under \u00a7 2255. Before filing a successive motion pursuant to \u00a7 2255, Smith was required to obtain leave from this court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). This requirement \u201cacts as a jurisdictional bar to the district court\u2019s asserting jurisdiction over any successive habeas petition until this court has granted the petitioner permission to file one.\u201d <em>United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-19\">We must satisfy ourselves of our own jurisdiction and that of the district court. <em>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 95, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998). Because the district court lacked jurisdiction to rule on Smith\u2019s motion, our jurisdiction extends not to the merits of the appeal, but merely for the purpose of correcting the jurisdictional error. <em>See New York Life Ins. Co. v. Deshotel, </em>142 F.3d 873, 883 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, we VACATE the judgment and DISMISS the appeal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b867-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
