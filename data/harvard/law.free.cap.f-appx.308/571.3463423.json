Dee. 19, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 769 285 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 30, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-18\">When the BIA does not adopt the decision of the IJ to any extent, we review only the decision of the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). Here, while the IJ rested her denial of relief on an adverse credibility determination, the BIA assumed Liu\u2019s credibility and made an alternate burden of proof finding. Thus, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-19\">The BIA properly found that Liu was not eligible for asylum based on his wife\u2019s forced abortion. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 314 (2d Cir.2007)(en banc)(holding that the definition of \u201crefugee\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42) does not extend automatically to partners of individuals who have been forcibly sterilized or forced to have an abortion); <em>see also Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 (2d Cir.2007) (noting that, pursuant to <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>\u201ca claim of persecution based solely on a forced abortion\u201d brought by someone other than \u201cthe individual who has undergone the procedure ... is doomed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-20\">We further conclude that the BIA properly found that Liu failed to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>eligibility for relief based on \u201cother resistance\u201d to the family planning policy in China. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). In <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>we found that a petitioner whose \u201capplication for asylum was based upon his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s two forced abortions and threats from family planning officials that they would fine and sterilize [him] if his fianc\u00e9e became pregnant again ... failed to demonstrate that he acted in a manner that could constitute \u2018resistance\u2019 or opposition to a coercive family control program.\u201d 494 F.3d at 314-15. Because Liu\u2019s \u201cother resistance\u201d claim is analogous to the claim we rejected in <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>we find no clear error in the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur, </em>494 F.3d at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Inasmuch as Liu failed to meet the burden of proof for asylum, he also failed to meet the higher burden of proof necessary to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Finally, because Liu rests his CAT claim on his contention that he will more likely than not be tortured for departing China illegally, and he did not make that argument before the agency, we decline to consider any such argument as unexhausted. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007) (describing the issue exhaustion requirement as \u201cmandatory\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
