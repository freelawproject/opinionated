In 2002, the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the United States Small Business Administration against Beaulieu and two other defendants, William Harrison and Sylvia Mouton, in the amount of $307,711.50. On appeal, we reversed the judgment only with respect to Harrison and Mouton because Beaulieu never filed a notice of appeal under Rule 3(c)(1)(A) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and was thus not a party to the appeal. Accordingly, that reversal had no effect on the entry of summary judgment as to Beaulieu.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-15\">The district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment was not void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the claims involved federal statutes and nothing in the record indicates that the court otherwise lacked jurisdiction. Nor has Beaulieu demonstrated any excusable neglect that would entitle him to relief under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-16\">The district court correctly decided all issues presented to it, and those issues brought for the first time on appeal have been waived.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Beaulieu\u2019s motions for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b779-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
