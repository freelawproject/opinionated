Little, </em>No. 07-6225 (6th Cir. filed Oct. 5, 2007), which presents a similar challenge to the constitutionality of Tennessee\u2019s three-drug lethal injection protocol. The district court dismissed Henley\u2019s case as barred by the applicable statute of limitations. We agree, decline to stay Henley\u2019s execution, and dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-16\">The district court correctly held that <em>Cooey v. Strickland, </em>479 F.3d 412 (6th Cir.2007) is the law of this Circuit. Under <em>Cooey, </em>an inmate\u2019s \u00a7 1983 cause of action accrues upon the conclusion of direct review in state court or at the expiration of time for seeking such review. <em>Id. </em>at 421-22. Henley petitioned for Supreme Court review, which was denied in June 1990. Under <em>Cooey, </em>however, the accrual date must be adjusted if an inmate could not have discovered the \u201cinjury\u201d \u2014 here, the method of execution \u2014 until a later date. <em>Id. </em>at 422. Tennessee adopted lethal injection as its presumptive method of execution on March 30, 2000 and the district court viewed March 30, 2001 as the date Henley\u2019s right to bring this action expired. Henley clearly missed this deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-18\">Alternatively, construing all the relevant dates in the way most favorable to Henley, the very latest his cause of action could have accrued was June 2007, when Tennessee revised its lethal injection protocol. But Henley did not file suit until November 26, 2008. Thus, he missed even this June 2008 expiration date by several months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-19\">The cause of action being stale when brought, the district court correctly dismissed it, and we affirm that dismissal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
