Speck pled guilty to the Count Two offense, and stood trial before the district court on the remaining counts of the superceding indictment. The court found Speck guilty on all counts and sentenced him to concurrent prison terms of 121 months on the first five counts, and a consecutive 60 months\u2019 term on Count Six. He now appeals his Count Six conviction, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to establish the Count Six offense because there was no nexus between the firearm that he possessed and his drug transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u201cWe review the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial <em>de novo. </em>The evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the government, with all inferences and credibility choices drawn in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Le-Croy, </em>441 F.3d 914, 924 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cIt is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt, provided a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>906 F.2d 615, 618 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), the government must show that a defendant knowingly possessed a firearm in furtherance of any federal drug trafficking crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A); <em>United States v. Woodard, </em>531 F.3d 1352, 1362 (11th Cir. 2008). \u201cThe \u2018in furtherance\u2019 element requires proof that the firearm helped, furthered, promoted, or advanced the drug trafficking.\u201d <em>Woodard, </em>531 F.3d at 1362 (quotation omitted). \u201cThere must be a showing of some nexus between the firearm and the drug selling operation.\u201d <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1253 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">After reviewing the evidence presented to the district court, we conclude that it was sufficient to prove that Speck possessed his shotgun in furtherance of his drug trafficking activities. Speck was storing, cutting, manufacturing, and distributing drugs from his apartment. He kept within easy access \u2014 to protect his operations \u2014 a loaded Mossberg 12 gauge shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
