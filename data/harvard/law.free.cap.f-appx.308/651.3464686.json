We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-18\">The procedural history of this case and the details of Snyder\u2019s claims are well known to the parties and need not be discussed at length. Briefly, the government filed a complaint to foreclose on a lien against Snyder\u2019s property in order to fulfill a judgment against her for unpaid taxes. The District Court entered an order of sale and later amended the order to require any occupants to vacate or be evicted. Snyder filed a motion for reconsideration of the amended order. After the District Court denied the motion, she filed a timely notice of appeal. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-20\">Snyder argues on appeal that she discharged her tax debt before the complaint was filed by tendering a \u201cpublic office money certificate,\u201d which the District Court noted correctly was her personal note. For the reasons given by the District Court as to this and Snyder\u2019s other arguments, we conclude they are without merit. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
