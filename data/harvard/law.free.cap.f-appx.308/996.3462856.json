On March 14, 2002, this Court affirmed Johnson\u2019s conviction and sentence. A few years later, the defendant filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in light of the Sentencing Commission\u2019s retroactive amendments to the crack cocaine guidelines. In his motion, Johnson claimed that the district court had authority to reduce his sentence below the two offense-level reduction authorized by the Sentencing Commission. The district court rejected defendant\u2019s contention in this regard, reducing Johnson\u2019s sentence only by the two levels allowed in the retroactive amendments. Johnson now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">Our recent opinion in <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>554 F.3d 703 (7th Cir.2009) dealt with this same issue. In that case, we concluded that, with an exception not relevant here, district courts do not have authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to a sentence lower than the retroactive Guideline amendment range. We adopt the reasoning and holding of that case, and therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
