He appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment granting summary judgment for the defendants and dismissing his claims, some with prejudice and some without prejudice. He also appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for relief from judgment, filed pursuant to Fed.R.CivP. 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-25\">Webb argues that the district court erred by denying his request for declaratory relief stating that he was entitled to an independent polygraph examiner of his own choosing to comply with the conditions of his parole. Citing <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 79-80, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005), Webb asserts that, contrary to the district court\u2019s holding that this claim was barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), <em>Heck </em>authorizes the grant of declaratory relief for 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims. However, <em>Wilkinson </em>does not support Webb\u2019s argument. The district court properly held that Webb\u2019s claim that he was denied his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>to choose his own polygraph examiner was barred under <em>Heck. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Webb\u2019s request for declaratory relief on this issue. <em>See Gates v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Protective and Regulatory Servs., </em>537 F.3d 404, 438 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Webb also contends that the district court erred by dismissing his price-fixing claims against Richard Wood and Ezio Leite. Those claims were premised on Webb\u2019s assertion that Wood\u2019s polygraph examination fee was excessive. Because the uncontested summary judgment evidence indicated that there was no genuine issue of material fact that Wood\u2019s polygraph examination fee was within the range of fees from other polygraph examiners in the area, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for Leite and Wood regarding the price-fixing claims. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CivP. 56(c); <em>Cousin v. Small, </em>325 F.3d 627, 637 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Webb next argues that the district court erred by dismissing his claims against Ris-sie Owens for failure to train her staff, gross negligence, and for failing to prevent Leite, Swan, Wood, and Neill from conspiring against him in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(2). Webb\u2019s claim alleging Owens\u2019s failure to prevent a \u00a7 1985(2) conspiracy arose under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1986. In his reply brief, Webb abandoned his \u00a7 1985(2) conspiracy claim. Because a \u00a7 1986 claim is dependent upon the existence of a \u00a7 1985 claim, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Webb\u2019s \u00a7 1986 claim is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Webb\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against Owens alleging failure to train and gross negligence are based upon alleged deficiencies in the process leading to the revocation of Webb\u2019s parole and confinement. If <em>Heck </em>bars a challenge to the underlying constitutional violation, it also bars a challenge against a supervisor based upon that underlying constitutional violation. <em>See Connors v. Graves, </em>538 F.3d 373, 377-78 (5th Cir.2008). Because <em>Heck </em>bars Webb\u2019s challenge to those alleged deficiencies in the parole revocation process, the district court properly granted summary judgment for Owens as to Webb\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims. <em>See Cousin, </em>325 F.3d at 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">In his Rule 60(b) motion, Webb argued that: (1) although he was unable to show during the pendency of his lawsuit how he had been prejudiced by the denial of law library access during his term of parole, he subsequently learned that he should not have been subjected to many of his parole conditions, including the denial of law library access; and (2) he subsequently learned that the polygraph examinations he was ordered to take while on parole and some other aspects of his parole were in violation of official parole policy, thereby invalidating the basis for his parole revocation and supporting his claim of retaliation by the defendants. Both of these arguments relied, at least in part, upon Webb\u2019s assertion that the transcript of his parole revocation hearing and his learning of various official parole policies constituted newly discovered evidence. Webb has failed to show that either the parole revocation transcript or the various official parole policies constitute newly discovered evidence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CivP. 60(b)(2); <em>Hesling v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>396 F.3d 632, 639 (5th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Webb\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Goel, </em>274 F.3d 984, 997 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">The judgments of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b799-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
