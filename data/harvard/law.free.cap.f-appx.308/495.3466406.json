We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\"><em>\u201cWe </em>review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), construing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002). \u201c[Hjowever inartfully pleaded, a <em>pro se </em>complaint may not be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of [her] claim which would entitle [her] to relief.\u201d <em>Posr v. Court Officer Shield No. 207, </em>180 F.3d 409, 413-14 (2d Cir.1999) (alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). <em>\u201cWe </em>may consider all papers and exhibits appended to the complaint, as well as any matters of which judicial notice may be taken.\u201d <em>Hirsch v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., </em>72 F.3d 1085, 1092 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-16\">The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\u201cADEA\u201d) prohibits employers from discriminating against their employees because of age, but its coverage does not extend to independent contractors. <em>See Robinson v. Overseas Military Sales Corp., </em>21 F.3d 502, 509 (2d Cir.1994). Whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor is determined under common law agency principles. <em>See Frankel v. Bally, Inc., </em>987 F.2d 86, 90 (2d Cir.1993). Those principles require a court to consider a non-exhaustive list of various factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b520-17\">the hiring party\u2019s right to control the manner and means by which the product is accomplished ... [;][2] the skill required; [3] the source of the instrumentalities and tools; [4] the location of the work; [5] the duration of the relationship between the parties; [6] whether the hiring party has the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>assign additional projects to the hired party; [7] the extent of the hired party\u2019s discretion over when and how long to work; [8] the method of payment; [9] the hired party\u2019s role in hiring and paying assistants; [10] whether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring party; [11] whether the hiring party is in business; [12] the provision of employee benefits; and [13] the tax treatment of the hired party.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><em>Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, </em>490 U.S. 730, 751-52, 109 S.Ct. 2166, 104 L.Ed.2d 811 (1989) (footnotes omitted); <em>accord Eisenberg v. Advance Relocation &amp; Storage, Inc., </em>237 F.3d 111, 113-14 (2d Cir.2000). Although no one factor is dis-positive, <em>see Reid, </em>490 U.S. at 752, 109 S.Ct. 2166, \u201cthe \u2018greatest emphasis\u2019 should be placed on the first factor \u2014 that is, on the extent to which the hiring party controls the \u2018manner and means\u2019 by which the worker completes his or her assigned tasks,\u201d <em>Eisenberg, </em>237 F.3d at 114 (citation omitted). We review a district court\u2019s factual determination as to whether each <em>Reid </em>factor is present for clear error, although the ultimate legal determination as to whether an individual is an employee or independent contractor is reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Here, Legeno alleged that she applied for two positions with the Corcoran Group, an off-site real estate agent position and an on-site real estate salesperson position. However, the district court appears to have considered only the off-site position, and dismissed the complaint in partial reliance on the Independent Contractors Agreement, which set forth the details of the broker-agent relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The terms of the Independent Contractors Agreement appear to apply to the off-site position, but contradict the description given by Legeno of the on-site position in several respects. In particular, the Agreement provided that an agent shall not receive any remuneration other than commissions, while Legeno alleged that the on-site position paid $15 per hour plus a commission of $200 per apartment sold. We recognize that a salary component, standing alone, does not necessarily resolve the issue in Legeno\u2019s favor. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 117 (\u201c[I]n anti-discrimination cases such as this one, courts <em>should not </em>ordinarily place extra weight on the benefits and tax treatment factors enumerated in <em>Reid, </em>and <em>should </em>instead place special weight on the extent to which the hiring party controls the \u2018manner and means\u2019 by which the worker completes her assigned tasks.\u201d). The duties of an on-site sales agent presumably require the agent to work at a specific location and during fixed hours, and these factors, combined with a set salary, may be indicative, under <em>Reid, </em>of an employee relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">In light of the scant factual record before this Court regarding the \u201cmanner and means\u201d by which the on-site salesperson would complete his or her tasks, it cannot be determined whether the on-site sales position is that of an employee or independent contractor. Resolution of this issue requires further fact-finding. Accordingly, we conclude that it was premature to grant the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Furthermore, we respectfully disagree with the magistrate judge\u2019s alternative recommendation that Legeno failed to allege facts that would create a reasonable inference of age discrimination, as Legeno alleged that her interviewer \u201crepeatedly intimated that [she] was too old for the position,\u201d in addition to referencing the year of her college graduation. Such allegations by a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff are sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. <em>See Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., </em>534 U.S. 506, 508, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is VACATED and the matter is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
