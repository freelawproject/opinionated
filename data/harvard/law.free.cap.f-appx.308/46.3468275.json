The complaint, which alleged violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692-1692p, arose out of a collection letter Grant <em>&amp; </em>Weber sent to Van, stating: \u201cThe Rosen-thal Act, California Civil Code Section 1788.21, also requires that you notify your creditor of your change of name, address, or employment for any existing consumer credit.\u201d Van argues that this statement is misleading because California Civil Code \u00a7 1788.21(b) requires such notification only in the event the creditor clearly discloses that requirement in writing in the original agreement. Consequently, Van argues that the allegedly misleading statement violated several provisions of the FDCPA. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-17\">Grant <em>&amp; </em>Weber\u2019s letter did not misstate California Civil Code \u00a7 1788.21. Under California law, with respect to \u201cany consumer credit <em>existing </em>or requested to be extended,\u201d a debtor \u201cshall within a reasonable time notify the creditor ... of any change in [the debtor\u2019s] name, address, or employment,\u201d Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1788.21(a) (emphasis added), but \u201conly if and after the creditor clearly and conspicuously in writing discloses such responsibility,\u201d Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1788.21(b). On its face, the requirement to notify creditors of specified changes applies to previously-existing credit, as is the situation in the case at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>issue. The law contains no requirement that the notification be in the original agreement extending credit, and we decline to interpret the statute to include such language. <em>See Doe v. City of Los Angeles, </em>42 Cal.4th 531, 67 Cal.Rptr.3d 330, 169 P.3d 559, 567 (2007) (holding courts construing California statutes \u201cmay not broaden or narrow the scope of the provision by reading into it language that does not appear in it or reading out of it language that does.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Moreover, because the letter did no more than explain the obligations California Civil Code \u00a7 1788.21(a) imposed upon Van, without misconstruing the meaning of the section, Grant &amp; Weber did not use any \u201cfalse, deceptive, or misleading representation[s],\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e, or any \u201cunfair or unconscionable means to collect ... any debt,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f. Nor did the letter violate 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g, prohibiting creditors from communicating with debtors in a way that \u201covershadows\u201d or is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with a debtor\u2019s right to dispute a debt. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">There is likewise no merit to Van\u2019s preemption argument. The FDCPA preempts state laws \u201cwith respect to debt collection practices ... only to the extent of [their] inconsistency\u201d with the FDCPA. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692n. There is no inconsistency here. Requiring debtors to provide new contact information, while warning debtors that the information will be used for purposes of debt collection, does not conflict with the FDCPA, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(ll).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b71-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
