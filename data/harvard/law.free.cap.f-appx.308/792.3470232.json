He argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial based on improper comments by two witnesses concerning his criminal history of drug offenses and pending sexual assault charges. If improper evidence is introduced to the jury, and the district court denies the defendant\u2019s subsequent motion for mistrial, this court re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>views the denial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Lucas, </em>516 F.3d 316, 345 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 116, 172 L.Ed.2d 36 (2008). If there is error, this court employs the harmless error standard of review, requiring a new trial \u201conly when, after a review of the entire record, it appears that there is a significant possibility that the prejudicial evidence had a substantial impact on the jury verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court\u2019s assessment of the prejudicial effect of the improper evidence is given great weight, and its giving of a curative instruction may render the prejudicial effect harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Cook has not shown that \u201cthere is a significant possibility that the prejudicial evidence had a substantial impact on the jury verdict.\u201d <em>See Lucas, </em>516 F.3d at 345. The district court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objections to the improper statements and immediately instructed the jury to disregard those statements. The district court again instructed the jury at the end of the trial to disregard the stricken testimony and to consider only \u201clegally admissible evidence and testimony.\u201d The jury is presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions. <em>See Zafiro v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 534, 540, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993). The district court\u2019s instructions rendered the prejudicial effect of the comments harmless. <em>See Lucas, </em>516 F.3d at 345; <em>see also United States v. Valles, </em>484 F.3d 745, 757 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 3025, 168 L.Ed.2d 745 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">Further, the improper statements were harmless in view of the overwhelming evidence of Cook\u2019s guilt. <em>See United States v. Millsaps, </em>157 F.3d 989, 993 (5th Cir. 1998). Based on information obtained from a confidential informant, Lieutenant Paul Pothen obtained a search warrant for Cook\u2019s business, which was also his residence, to locate a safe which officers believed contained firearms. When executing the search warrant, Lieutenant Pothen saw a safe through the window in an adjacent property. Lieutenant Pothen spoke to Melvin Anderson, the owner of the adjacent property, and asked who owned the safe and what it contained. Anderson told Lieutenant Pothen that the safe belonged to Cook. Detective Bristow read Cook his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights, and Agent Tarango questioned Cook about the safe and its contents. Cook admitted that he knew about the safe, that the safe held rifles, and that the rifles belonged to him. Agent Tarango asked for and received Cook\u2019s written permission to search the safe. At the request of Agent Tarango, Cook opened the safe. Agents found numerous firearms in the safe. Agent Tarango testified that one of the firearms was traced directly to Cook. The parties stipulated that Cook was a felon. Special Agent Daniel Kaase testified that each of the firearms was manufactured outside of Texas and had traveled in interstate commerce to Texas. In view of the overwhelming evidence of Cook\u2019s guilt, there is not a significant possibility that the improper statements concerning Cook\u2019s criminal history and pending charges had a substantial impact on the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Lucas, </em>516 F.3d at 345; <em>United States v. Le, </em>512 F.3d 128, 133-34 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\">Cook argues that evidence that the firearms at issue had previously traveled in interstate commerce was insufficient to establish the interstate commerce element of the offense. Cook concedes that this argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">For the first time on appeal, Cook argues that the Government was required and failed to prove that he knew: that he was a felon, that he possessed a firearm, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>and that the possession of the firearm affected interstate commerce. He argues that <em>United States v. Dancy, </em>861 F.2d 77, 81-82 (5th Cir.1988), was rendered invalid by <em>Staples v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 600, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 128 L.Ed.2d 608 (1994), and <em>Bryan v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 184, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998). This court rejected the same argument in <em>United States v. Schmidt, </em>487 F.3d 253, 254-55 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">At sentencing, the district court orally pronounced a sentence of 51 months of imprisonment. The written judgment provides for a sentence of 63 months of imprisonment. \u201cIn this Circuit, it is well settled law that where there is any variation between the oral and written pronouncements of sentence, the oral sentence prevails.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>250 F.3d 941, 942 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Because the written judgment in this case conflicts with the oral pronouncement of judgment, the oral pronouncement controls. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, we remand the case for the district court to amend its written judgment to conform to its oral sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">AFFIRMED; REMANDED FOR DISTRICT COURT TO AMEND WRITTEN JUDGMENT TO CONFORM TO ORAL SENTENCE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b816-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
