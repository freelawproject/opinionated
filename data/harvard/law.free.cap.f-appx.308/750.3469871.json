The district court dismissed the petition. Lawson moves for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) on appeal to question the denial of IFP status and the certification that his appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Lawson was released from prison in October 2008, while his IFP motion was pending in this court. He asserts that the case is not moot, however, because he is still serving a term of supervised release. Although the government does not address the question, this court is obligated to examine whether it has jurisdiction. <em>See Dailey v. Vought Aircraft Co., </em>141 F.3d 224, 227 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The possibility that a district court may alter a period of supervised release\u2014 \u201cif it determines that [the defendant] has served excess prison time\u201d \u2014 may keep a \u00a7 2241 petition from becoming moot. <em>Johnson v. Pettiford, </em>442 F.3d 917, 918 (5th Cir.2006) (addressing a federal prisoner\u2019s challenge to the denial of a sentence credit). Unlike the situation in <em>Pettiford, </em>however, the circumstance here is that the district court that denied Lawson\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is without jurisdiction to determine, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583, whether he served excess prison time; that determination is to be made by the sentencing court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(e)(2); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605 (authorizing a court to exercise jurisdiction over a person on supervised release if such jurisdiction has been transferred by the sentencing court). Lawson was sentenced by a different district court from the court <em>a quo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">A pronouncement by this court concerning Lawson\u2019s \u00a7 2241 allegations would not result in \u201cspecific relief through a decree of a conclusive character\u201d with regard to modification of the sentence. <em>North Carolina v. Rice, </em>404 U.S. 244, 246, 92 S.Ct. 402, 30 L.Ed.2d 413 (1971) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). And \u201c[b]ecause federal courts may only hear cases or controversies under Article III, it is unconstitutional for the Court to issue mere advisory opinions.\u201d <em>Carpenter v. Wichita Falls Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>44 F.3d 362, 368 n. 5 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Lawson\u2019s motion would fail even if there were jurisdiction. A movant for leave to proceed IFP on appeal must show that he is a pauper and that the appeal is taken in good faith, i.e., that it presents a nonfrivo-lous issue. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). \u201cFrivolous\u201d is defined as \u201clacking] an arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001). A district court, by providing written reasons certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith, may deny a motion for leave to appeal IFP. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). The appellant may challenge the district court\u2019s certification decision by filing an IFP motion in this court. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">Lawson had no liberty interest in early release. <em>See Richardson v. Joslin, </em>501 F.3d 415, 419-20 (5th Cir.2007) (stating that the grant of discretion to the BOP to shorten by a period of up to one year the prison term of a prisoner who has successfully completed a drug abuse program \u201cindicates that no entitlement and, hence, no liberty interest, was created\u201d). Nor does Lawson have an arguable equal protection claim. His allegation that he was treated differently from other prisoners because of BOP authorities\u2019 discriminatory intent is purely conclusional and does not suffice to raise a nonfrivolous appellate issue. <em>Mowbray v. Cameron County, Tex., </em>274 F.3d 269, 278 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">To the extent that Lawson persists in a contract claim, his appeal on that issue is also frivolous. The agreement that he signed provided that, if he were found eligible for early release under \u00a7 3621(e), such eligibility was provisional and subject to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Lawson has not shown that his appeal presents a nonfrivolous issue. Accordingly, his IFP motion is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Carson, </em>689 F.2d at 586; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">MOTION TO PROCEED IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b775-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
