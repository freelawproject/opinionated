July 5, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 559 943 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 20, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-24\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, i.e., \u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). Here, the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, but did not address the IJ\u2019s finding that Dong\u2019s forced marriage claim was not a ground for asylum. Thus, we review the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination only. <em>See id. </em>at 522. We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Shu Wen Sun v. BIA </em>510 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ found implausible Dong\u2019s testimony that: (1) she was hiding in her boyfriend\u2019s home where she could be easily found by the authorities; and (2) that the authorities did not force her to submit to an IUD insertion, speak to her about other birth control measures, or have any further contact with her after they allegedly forced her to submit to an abortion. An IJ may rely partly or entirely on implausibilities in an applicant\u2019s account to determine that the manner in which her testimony \u201changs together with other evidence\u201d is not credible. <em>Ying Li v. BCIS, </em>529 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Liang Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 106-07 (2d Cir. 2006)). Here, the account that emerges from Dong\u2019s testimony is that she became pregnant before she was permitted to do so under the family planning policy, and feared \u201cmandatory induced abortion\u201d by the family planning cadres. Therefore, she went into hiding in her boyfriend\u2019s home, a place that even she acknowledged was \u201cthe most dangerous spot\u201d for her. While the government forced her to submit to an abortion because she was unmarried and underage, she was not required to submit to an IUD insertion, or informed about other birth control measures, and the government had no further contact with her. The IJ found that such testimony was implausible in light of the background materials in the record. We will not disturb that finding. <em>See Ying Li, </em>529 F.3d at 82-83; <em>see also Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 169 (2d Cir.2007) (finding that an IJ\u2019s inferences will not be rejected if they are \u201cmade available to the factfin-der by record facts, or even a single fact, viewed in the light of common sense and ordinary experience\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The IJ also properly found that while Dong testified that her father was beaten on two occasions by the village chiefs thugs, his letter omitted that assertion. An IJ is entitled to rely on an inconsistency between an applicant\u2019s testimony and a written submission to support an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Surinder Singh v. BIA, </em>438 F.3d 145, 148 (2d Cir. 2006). Moreover, it was reasonable for the IJ to find that Dong was unable to rehabilitate her testimony where she failed to corroborate her claims. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">These findings provide substantial evidence for the IJ\u2019s determination that Dong was not credible and that she was therefore ineligible for asylum. <em>See </em>8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that the IJ may rely on the cumulative effect of discrepancies or evidentiary gaps that concern matters ancillary or collateral to the applicant\u2019s claim). Moreover, the adverse credibility determination necessarily precludes success on her claim for withholding of removal, where both claims were based on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). We are without jurisdiction to consider any challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief, as Dong failed to challenge that denial in her appeal to the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
