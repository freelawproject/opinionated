DeFonzo, which denied her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Zhi Qin Chen, </em>No. A95 673 271 (B.I.A. Jan. 22, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 673 271 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 18, 2005) . We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions \u2014 or more precisely, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir. 2007). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Upon review of the administrative record, we find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The agency properly relied on inconsistencies in the record regarding Chen\u2019s claim that she went into hiding in order to avoid persecution by family planning officials. <em>See Liang Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 106-107 (2d Cir. 2006) . For example, the documentary evidence in the record indicated that Chen and her husband were living at her parents\u2019 house prior to the date that they purportedly began hiding at that house. Additionally, despite repeated questioning, Chen could not provide any information regarding where she lived immediately before going into hiding. Regardless of the centrality of these and other inconsistencies in the record, <em>see Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 288 (2d Cir.2000), the agency did not err in finding that they provided support for its adverse credibility finding when taken cumulatively. <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[E]ven where an IJ relies on discrepancies or lacunae that, if taken separately, concern matters collateral or ancillary to the claim, ... the cumulative effect may nevertheless be deemed consequential by the fact-finder.\u201d (internal citations omitted)). Furthermore, despite Chen\u2019s argument that explained these inconsistencies, she fails to point to any such explanations, and our review of the record reveals no explanations that a reasonable fact-finder would have been compelled to accept. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Ultimately, because a reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to conclude to the contrary, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Shu Wen Sun, </em>510 F.3d at 379-80. Thus, the agency\u2019s denial of Chen\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief was proper where each claim rested on her asserted fear of forced sterilization. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006) (recognizing that withholding of removal and CAT claims necessarily fail if the applicant is unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim and the factual predicate for the claims is the same).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Finally, we find that the record does not support Chen\u2019s argument that the IJ\u2019s decision to deny her application for relief was based on his bias and hostility towards her. Indeed, although the record reveals that the IJ became frustrated with Chen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>because he could not hear her testimony and because she was evasive when responding to his questions, a reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to conclude that the IJ demonstrated bias or hostility towards Chen.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
