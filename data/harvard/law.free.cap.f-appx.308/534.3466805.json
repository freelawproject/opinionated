Mulligan denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Qi Xing Chen, </em>No. A98 998 039 (B.I.A. Jan. 15, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 998 039 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Mar. 27, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">When, as here, the BIA adopts and supplements the decision of the IJ, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>Pas-si v. Mukasey, </em>535 F.3d 98, 101 (2d Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">We conclude that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ properly found that while Chen testified that his wife submitted twice to an IUD insertion, the letter purportedly written by his wife omits any mention of a second IUD insertion. <em>See Surinder Singh v. B.I.A., </em>438 F.3d 145, 148 (2d Cir.2006). The IJ also properly noted that Chen failed to provide any independent evidence to corroborate his wife\u2019s alleged second IUD insertion, thus rendering him unable to rehabilitate his questionable testimony regarding the incident. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">Additionally, we will not disturb the IJ\u2019s finding that the identification number on Chen\u2019s marriage certificate is inconsistent with the number on his resident identification card. <em>See Shu Wen Sun v. B.I.A., </em>510 F.3d 377, 379-80 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">We find it unnecessary to review the IJ\u2019s findings based on Chen\u2019s purported statements to immigration officials when he first came to the United States because we can confidently predict that the IJ would reach the same conclusion as to his credibility absent these findings. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338-39 (2d Cir.2006). As the BIA noted, because this case is governed by the REAL ID Act, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was properly based on the totality of the circumstances, \u201cwithout regard to whether [the inconsistencies and omissions identified by the IJ go] to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 164 (2d Cir.2008). Because Chen has not identified any error in the IJ\u2019s findings that would compel a reasonable factfinder to conclude otherwise, we cannot conclude that the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>erred in finding that Chen was not credible. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Because the only basis for a finding in Chen\u2019s favor as to the asserted threat to his life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief, where all three claims were based on the same set of facts. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
