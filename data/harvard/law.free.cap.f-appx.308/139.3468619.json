We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination because Kaur\u2019s lack of knowledge regarding groups that support Khalistan was a material discrepancy central to her claims. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1139, 1143 (9th Cir. 2004); <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 964 (9th Cir.2004) (adverse credibility determination is supported where at least one of the identified grounds is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart of the claim). Accordingly, Kaur\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Because Kaur filed to satisfy the lower standard of proof for asylum, it necessarily follows that she failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Because Kaur\u2019s CAT claim is based on evidence the BIA found not credible, and she points to no other evidence that shows it is more likely than not she would be tortured if returned to India, her CAT claim fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b163-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
