The district court granted a certificate of appealability on the issue whether Gaytan suffered ineffective assistance of counsel, warranting an out-of-time appeal, because appellate counsel failed to prosecute Gaytan\u2019s appeal and, in this collateral attack, failed to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel due to his own failure to prosecute the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-18\">To obtain relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel, a movant must demonstrate both that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201cThe general rule announced in <em>Strickland ... </em>is modified when the complained of performance results in the actual or constructive denial of any assistance of appellate counsel. In such a case, the petitioner need not demonstrate the typical <em>Strickland-type </em>prejudice, because prejudice is presumed.\u201d <em>Harris v. Day, </em>226 F.3d 361, 364 (5th Cir.2000). The government concedes that because counsel filed no appellate brief after filing a timely notice of appeal, Gaytan was constructively denied any assistance of counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-19\">We have previously stated that \u201c[s]ince the 1960s, our court, pursuant to a \u00a7 2255 motion, has permitted an out-of-time appeal when a defendant was denied assistance of counsel on appeal, through counsel\u2019s failure to perfect an appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. West, </em>240 F.3d 456, 459 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also Mack v. Smith, </em>659 F.2d 23, 25-26 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>We clarified that under this \u201cjudicial remedy,\u201d the district court must dismiss a petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition without prejudice and reinstate the judgment of conviction, which will restart the time for appeal under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1)(A). <em>See West, </em>240 F.3d at 458. The government agrees that this is the proper remedy in this case. Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s \u00a7 2255 ruling and REMAND with instructions to dismiss Gaytan\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion without prejudice, grant an out-of-time appeal, and reinstate the criminal judgment on the docket. <em>See id. </em>at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">To the extent that the district court\u2019s COA grant extends to counsel\u2019s conduct in the \u00a7 2255 proceedings, the denial of habeas relief is affirmed, as there is no constitutional right to counsel in post-conviction proceedings. <em>See Ford v. United States, </em>363 F.2d 437, 437-38 (5th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART: VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b823-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
