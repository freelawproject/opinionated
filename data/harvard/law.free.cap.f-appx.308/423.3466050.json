Kemp argues that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred by (1) finding that his post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) did not constitute a severe impairment; (2) failing to place great weight on the disability percentages that the Veterans\u2019 Administration (\u201cVA\u201d) assigned to Kemp; (3) relying on the reports of non-examining physicians to determine that Kemp had the residual functional capacity to perform medium work; (4) finding that Kemp was Iterate; and (5) discrediting Kemp\u2019s testimony regarding the nature, intensity, and duration of his symptoms solely because the ALJ found that Kemp had testified incredibly regarding his literacy. For the reasons set forth, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">Kemp filed an application for disability benefits, claiming that he was unable to work because of a disabling condition since November 1, 2000. Kemp later amended the date of the onset of his disability to January 1, 2002. Kemp identified back injuries, PTSD, high blood pressure, diabetes, shortness of breath, and a heart condition. After the Commissioner denied his application, Kemp obtained a hearing from an ALJ. The ALJ determined that Kemp\u2019s PTSD was not a severe impairment and that his other conditions did not meet or equal the listed impairments to receive benefits. The ALJ determined that Kemp maintained the residual functional capacity to perform medium work. The ALJ denied benefits. A magistrate judge recommended that Kemp\u2019s case should be remanded for further proceedings; however, the district court was not persuaded and entered judgment affirming the Commissioner and dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b448-15\">We review a social security case <em>de novo </em>when reviewing the legal principles underlying the ALJ\u2019s decision, but review \u201cthe resulting decision only to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cSubstantial evidence is defined as more than a scintilla, i.e., evidence that must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established, and such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support the conclusion.\u201d <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1560 (11th Cir.1995) (citation omitted). We may not reweigh the evidence or substitute our own judgment for that of the ALJ, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>we find that the evidence preponderates against the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir. 1990). Where an ALJ makes a factual error, the error will be considered harmless if it is clear that the error did not affect the ALJ\u2019s ultimate determination. <em>See Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The Social Security regulations set forth the following five-step \u201csequential evaluation\u201d process to determine whether a claimant is disabled: (1) the disability examiner determines whether the claimant is engaged in \u201csubstantial gainful activity\u201d; (2) if not, the examiner decides whether the claimant\u2019s condition or impairment is \u201csevere,\u201d i.e., whether it significantly limits claimant\u2019s physical or mental ability to do basic work activities; (3) if so, the examiner decides whether the claimant\u2019s impairment meets or equals the severity of the specified impairments in the Listing of Impairments (\u201cListing\u201d), thereby precluding any gainful work activity; (4) if the claimant has a severe impairment that does not meet or equal the severity of an impairment in the Listing, the examiner assesses a claimant\u2019s \u201cresidual functional capacity,\u201d which measures whether a claimant can-perform past relevant work despite the impairment; and (5) if the claimant is unable to do past relevant work, the examiner determines whether, in light of residual functioning capacity, age, education, and work experience, the claimant can perform other work. <em>Crayton v. Callahan, </em>120 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir. 1997); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(c)-(f), 416.920(c)-(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">A. <em>Whether the ALJ erred in determining that Kemp\u2019s PTSD did not constitute a severe impairment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Kemp argues that the ALJ erred in finding that his PTSD did not constitute a severe impairment because the ALJ\u2019s determination was not supported by substantial evidence, the ALJ discredited the opinions of the VA and Kemp\u2019s physicians, and the ALJ erroneously asserted that Kemp never reported mental health symptoms to theVA.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">The claimant bears the burden of showing that he has a severe impairment or combination of impairments. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). An impairment is not severe if it does not significantly limit one\u2019s physical or mental ability to do basic work activities. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521(a); see <em>also Davis v. Shalala, </em>985 F.2d 528, 532 (11th Cir.1993) (stating that an impairment is severe if it \u201ccauses more than a minimal limitation on a claimant\u2019s ability to function\u201d). Examples of basic work activities include: (1) physical functions such as walking, standing, sitting, lifting, reaching, and carrying; (2) the capacity to see, hear, and speak; (3) understanding, carrying out, and remembering simple instructions; (4) use of judgment; (5) responding appropriately to supervision, coworkers, and usual work situations; and (6) dealing with changes in a routine work setting. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">In assessing Kemp\u2019s PTSD, the ALJ acknowledged that the VA rated Kemp as 30% disabled. However, the ALJ determined that the available evidence did not support treating Kemp\u2019s PTSD as a severe impairment under the SSA guidelines. The ALJ relied on the report from a treating physician, Jack Gibbs, M.D., stating that Kemp was doing well with his medication to control the symptoms. The physician noted that Kemp was able to follow complex instruction, that his memory was good, and that his intellect appeared normal. These findings were all made with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>the understanding that Kemp had PTSD; however, the reports suggest that the medication kept Kemp\u2019s symptoms manageable. Furthermore, Kemp repeatedly reported that he was not depressed. The ALJ also considered Dr. Acker\u2019s report finding that Kemp could carry out simple instructions, but would have some difficulty getting along with others due to back pain and depression. The ALJ assigned less value to Dr. Acker\u2019s report due to discrepancies in his opinion. The ALJ weighed the evidence and determined that Kemp failed to meet his burden at step two of the evaluation process because Kemp was unable to establish that PTSD was a severe impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The evidence provides a substantial basis to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that Kemp\u2019s PTSD was not a severe impairment, as well as a sufficient basis for the ALJ to give less weight to the opinions of the VA and Kemp\u2019s physicians regarding his PTSD. Additionally, as to whether the ALJ erred in asserting that Kemp never reported mental health symptoms to the VA, any factual mistake the ALJ made is harmless in light of the rest of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">B. <em>Whether the ALJ failed to give great weight to the disability ratings the VA assigned to Kemp</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Kemp asserts that the ALJ failed to give the disability ratings that the VA assigned to Kemp great weight. \u201cA VA rating is certainly not binding on the Secretary, but it is evidence that should be considered and is entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. Schweiker, </em>640 F.2d 682, 686 (5th Cir.1981). The SSA regulations specify that a decision by any non-governmental or governmental agency about whether an individual is disabled is based on its own rules and does not constitute a SSA decision about whether an individual is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1504.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">The ALJ must \u201cstate specifically the weight accorded to each item of evidence and why he reached that decision.\u201d <em>Cowart v. Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 731, 735 (11th Cir.1981). We have recognized, however, that the ALJ may implicitly make a determination. <em>See Hutchison v. Bowen, </em>787 F.2d 1461, 1463 (11th Cir.1986) (recognizing that the ALJ may make an implied finding that a claimant did not meet a listed impairment).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">In this case, the ALJ did not specifically state that he gave great weight to the VA\u2019s disability ratings. However, the ALJ continuously refers to the VA\u2019s evaluations and disability rating throughout the evaluation process. The ALJ gave specific reasons for why the VA\u2019s 30% disability rating based on PTSD did not qualify the condition as a severe impairment under the SSA guidelines. The ALJ relied on the VA\u2019s diabetes determination in finding that the diabetes was a severe impairment. Furthermore, the ALJ relied on VA records to determine that Kemp had cervical spondylosis, that Kemp had mild carpal tunnel syndrome, and that Kemp could walk up to a mile and climb two flights of stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">The ALJ relied on the VA records and referenced the disability ratings, in addition to rest of the relevant evidence, throughout his decision. As a result, he implicitly found that the VA disability ratings were entitled to great weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">C. <em>Whether the ALJ erred in adopting and relying on non-examining physicians in determining Kemp\u2019s residual functional capacity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">Kemp argues that the ALJ erred in adopting and relying on the findings of non-examining physicians in order to determine that Kemp had sufficient residual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>functional capacity to perform medium work. The residual functional capacity determination is based on all of the evidence in the record. <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)(1). The opinion of a non-examining physician is entitled to little weight when it contradicts the opinion of an examining physician. <em>Lamb v. Bowen, </em>847 F.2d 698, 703 (11th Cir.1988). Where a non-examining physician\u2019s report includes information that is not contained in the examining physicians\u2019 reports, but does not contradict the examining physicians\u2019 reports, the ALJ does not err in relying on the non-examining physician\u2019s report to the extent it contains non-contradictory information. <em>See Edwards v. Sullivan, </em>937 F.2d 580, 584-85 (11th Cir.1991). Nevertheless, the opinion of a non-examining physician, standing alone, does not constitute substantial evidence. <em>Lamb, </em>847 F.2d at 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The weight to be given a non-examining physician\u2019s opinion depends, among other things, on the extent to which it is supported by clinical findings and is consistent with other evidence. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(3) \u2014 (4); <em>see also Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158, 1160 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that the ALJ did not err in relying on consulting physician\u2019s opinion where it was consistent with medical evidence and findings of the examining physician). Generally, the more consistent a physician\u2019s opinion is with the record as a whole, the more weight an ALJ will place on that opinion. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The ALJ relied on a non-examining physician\u2019s opinion in determining that Kemp\u2019s residual functional capacity was medium in part because no treating physician ever determined Kemp\u2019s residual functional capacity. Furthermore, Dr. Gertler\u2019s opinion (the non-examining physician) was based on his review of the medical records including reports from one of the examining physicians. Dr. Gertler relied on Dr. Wallace\u2019s opinion (an examining physician) that Kemp had a normal gait, normal reflexes, and a full range of motion in all of his joints with the exception of the cervical and lumbar spine. Dr. Gertler determined that Kemp could lift up to 50 pounds, frequently lift 25 pounds, stand or walk for about 6 hours in a workday, balance, crawl, and occasionally stoop. Evidence from the VA medical records also indicated that Kemp had good strength and range of motion and that many of his symptoms were not severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">In determining that Kemp could perform medium work, the ALJ did not err in relying on the opinions of non-examining physicians because these opinions were consistent with the opinion of examining physicians as well as with the other medical evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">D. <em>Whether the ALJ\u2019s determination that Kemp was literate is supported by substantial evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Kemp argues that the ALJ\u2019s determination that Kemp was literate is not supported by substantial evidence, and that the ALJ erred by discrediting evidence that Kemp was illiterate. The ALJ must state with particularity the weight given to different medical opinions and the reasons therefore. <em>Sharfarz v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 278, 279 (11th Cir.1987). The ALJ should consider a physician\u2019s opinion in accordance with the factors set forth in the guidelines: (1) the examining relationship; (2) the treatment relationship; (3) supportability; (4) consistency; (5) specialization; and (6) other factors. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d). The Commissioner may reject any medical opinion if the evidence supports a contrary finding. <em>Sryock v. Heckler, </em>764 F.2d 834, 835 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Cir.1985). Where an ALJ discredits a claimant\u2019s subjective testimony, he must articulate explicit reasons, supported by substantial evidence, for doing so. <em>See Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225-26 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">There is some dispute as to the level of education attained by Kemp. Some records indicate that Kemp only completed sixth grade while others indicate that he graduated from high school. The ALJ did not solely base his conclusion that Kemp was literate on the reports stating that Kemp graduated high school. The ALJ determined that Kemp\u2019s promotions in the military, his expert rating on operating weapons, and his previous employment as a dry feeder that required him to read and write reports all pointed to Kemp being literate. The ALJ determined that Kemp\u2019s subjective testimony was not credible based on the fact that Kemp\u2019s records had so many discrepancies regarding his educational history and that his employment and military history contradicted his direct testimony that he was illiterate. The ALJ gave specific reasons why Kemp\u2019s testimony lacked credibility and provided specific reasons for the determination that Kemp is literate.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Although there is some evidence in the record suggesting that Kemp might be illiterate, the evidence provided a substantial basis to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that Kemp was literate as well as a sufficient basis for the ALJ to discredit evidence that Kemp was illiterate.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">E. <em>Whether the ALJ erred by determining that Kemp\u2019s testimony regarding his symptoms was not credible</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Kemp argues that the ALJ erred in finding that his testimony regarding the intensity, effect, and duration of his symptoms was not credible solely because he found that Kemp had not credibly testified regarding his literacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Where an ALJ decides not to credit a claimant\u2019s testimony, the ALJ must articulate specific and adequate reasons for doing so. <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1225. A reviewing court should not disturb a clearly articulated credibility finding with substantial supporting evidence in the record. <em>Foote, </em>67 F.3d at 1561-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Despite Kemp\u2019s contention, the ALJ did not solely base his determination that Kemp\u2019s testimony regarding his symptoms was not credible on the ALJ\u2019s determination that Kemp had lied about being illiterate. A reading of the ALJ\u2019s decision reveals that the ALJ relied on objective medical evidence and evidence of Kemp\u2019s daily activities to determine Kemp\u2019s disability status. The ALJ looked at the reports from the VA and examining physicians along with Kemp\u2019s daily activity reports. Furthermore, the ALJ noted that Kemp stopped working because the plant shut down, not due to any physical incapacitation. The medical evidence in the record, together with the ALJ\u2019s finding that Kemp had not credibly testified regarding his literacy, provided a substantial basis to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that Kemp did not credibly testify regarding the nature, intensity, and duration of his symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">Based on the foregoing, the opinion of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
