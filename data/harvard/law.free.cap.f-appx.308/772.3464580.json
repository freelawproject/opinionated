We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">Alarcon\u2019s complaint alleged fifteen causes of action, all of which arose out of Chase\u2019s alleged wrongful foreclosure of community property owned by Alarcon and his wife. In a prior lawsuit, Alarcon\u2019s wife, Nanette Cuauhtli, brought claims against Chase over the same foreclosure. Chase was granted summary judgment in that action, and this court affirmed. <em>See Cuauhtli v. Chase Home Fin. LLC, </em>252 Fed.Appx. 690 (5th Cir.2007). The district court in this case held that, in light of the prior suit, Alarcon\u2019s claims were barred by <em>res judicata. </em>We review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo. Delta &amp; Pine Land Co. v. Nationwide Agribusiness Ins. Co., </em>530 F.3d 395, 399 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-16\">\u201cFederal law applies to the <em>res judicata </em>effect of a prior federal court judgment, and that law requires (1) identical parties, (2) jurisdiction for the prior judgment, (3) a final judgment on the merits, and (4) the same cause of action.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Armstrong Rubber Co., </em>130 F.3d 168, 179 (5th Cir.1997). Because the record demonstrates plainly that the district court in the first suit had jurisdiction and reached a final judgment on the merits, we limit our discussion to the first and fourth requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-17\">The district court correctly concluded that, although Alarcon and his wife are not identical parties, their relationship is sufficient for claim preclusion purposes. The Supreme Court has articulated six exceptions to the identical party rule, one of which applies when preclusion can be justified based on the \u201csubstantive legal relationship\u201d between the nonparties. <em>Taylor v. Sturgell, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 128 S.Ct. 2161, 2172, 171 L.Ed.2d 155 (2008). Though \u201cclose family relationships are not sufficient by themselves to establish privity with the original suit\u2019s party, or to bind a nonparty to that suit by the judgment entered therein,\u201d more is present here. <em>Freeman v. Lester Coggins Trucking, Inc., </em>771 F.2d 860, 863 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-20\">More specifically, Alarcon asserts in the complaint that his wife had \u201ca vested ownership interest in the property since it was community property.\u201d <em>See </em>Tex. Fam.Code Ann. \u00a7 3.003(a) (\u201cProperty possessed by either spouse during or on dissolution of marriage is presumed to be community property.\u201d). Under Texas law, a \u201cfiduciary duty exists between a husband and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>wife regarding the community property controlled by each spouse.\u201d <em>Loaiza v. Loaiza, </em>130 S.W.3d 894, 900 (Tex.App.\u2014 Fort Worth 2004). The district court held that this fiduciary relationship is the type of \u201csubstantive legal relationship\u201d that satisfies the first <em>res judicata </em>requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Alarcon\u2019s argument to the contrary is unpersuasive. He maintains that, because Chase argued in the prior lawsuit that Nanette Cuauhtli lacked standing to bring the suit, Chase may not now assert that Alarcon and his wife are in privity for purposes of <em>res judicata. </em>Alarcon cites no authority to support his position, but we construe his argument as one of judicial estoppel, \u201cwhich prevents a party from asserting a position in a legal proceeding that is contrary to a position previously taken in the same or some earlier proceeding.\u201d <em>Ergo Science, Inc. v. Martin, </em>73 F.3d 595, 598 (5th Cir.1996). Judicial estoppel has two limitations: \u201c(1) it may be applied only where the position of the party to be estopped is clearly inconsistent with its previous one; and (2) that party must have convinced the court to accept that previous position.\u201d <em>Ahrens v. Perot Sys. Corp., </em>205 F.3d 831, 833 (5th Cir. 2000). Here, the second limitation defeats Alarcon\u2019s position because, in the prior suit, the district court rejected Chase\u2019s contention that Alarcon\u2019s wife did not have standing, even though the district court ultimately entered summary judgment in Chase\u2019s favor after determining that the foreclosure sale was proper. The first <em>res judicata </em>factor is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The last <em>res judicata </em>requirement is also satisfied. We apply the transactional test to determine if two suits involve the same cause of action. <em>Test Masters Educ. Serv., Inc. v. Singh, </em>428 F.3d 559, 571 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cUnder the transactional test, a prior judgment\u2019s preclusive effect extends to all rights of the plaintiff with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the original action arose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, as stated above, both Alarcon\u2019s suit and his wife\u2019s suit arose out of the alleged wrongful foreclosure by Chase. Therefore, it is immaterial that some of the legal theories Alarcon relies on differ from those in his wife\u2019s complaint. \u201cThe critical issue is whether the two actions are based on the same \u2018nucleus of operative facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Lastly, we consider Alarcon\u2019s claim that he was not given an opportunity to respond to Chase\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Alarcon\u2019s complaint identified two addresses-one was his Huntsville, Texas prison address, the other was an Arlington, Texas home address. Chase maintains that its summary judgment motion was served at both addresses, but Alarcon asserts that he never received the one sent to the Huntsville prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">We find no support in the record for Alarcon\u2019s claim that he was not given an opportunity to respond to Chase\u2019s motion. Even if we were to accept Alarcon\u2019s contention that he did not receive notice at his prison address, it is unclear how he was harmed. Alarcon admits that his wife notified him of Chase\u2019s motion, presumably after she received the motion Chase sent to the home address listed on the complaint. Thus, we find no merit in Alarcon\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">We also note that Alarcon did not raise the issue in the district court. It is well established that a party may not raise an issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. McPhail, </em>119 F.3d 326, 327 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b797-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
