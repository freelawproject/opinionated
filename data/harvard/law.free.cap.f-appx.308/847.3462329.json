Thomas has previously appealed his convictions, which we affirmed. He has also filed two 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motions in the Eastern District of Texas, where he was convicted and sentenced, which that court has denied. Thomas then filed the instant \u00a7 2241 petition in the Northern District of Texas, the district where he is in custody. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of Thomas\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition <em>de novo,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and conclude that the district court was correct in dismissing the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-19\">A \u00a7 2241 petition is typically used to challenge the execution of a prisoner\u2019s sentence and is properly brought in the district where the petitioner is in custody.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 2255, on the other hand, provides the means of collaterally attacking a federal conviction and sentence and must be brought in the court that sentenced the petitioner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here, after unsuccessful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>\u00a7 2255 motions in the Eastern of District of Texas \u2014 the court where he was sentenced \u2014 Thomas attempts to attack his conviction using a \u00a7 2241 petition in the Northern District of Texas \u2014 the district where he is in custody. Under the general rule, the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear this challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">However, \u201c \u00a7 2241 may be utilized by a federal prisoner to challenge the legality of his or her conviction or sentence if he or she can satisfy the mandates of the so-called \u00a7 2255 \u2018savings clause.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The savings clause \u2014 which asks whether \u201cthe remedy by [\u00a7 2255] motion is inadequate or ineffective\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 requires a petitioner to show that his claim is \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and that his claim was \u201cforeclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thomas cannot make this showing because the Supreme Court case on which he relies, <em>Rutledge v. United </em>States,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was decided before he was tried and should have been raised in his earlier appeal and \u00a7 2255 motions. That a petitioner would face a successive petition bar under \u00a7 2255 does not establish that section\u2019s remedy as \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court was without jurisdiction to consider the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Thomas further argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his Fed. R. Civ. P 59(e) motion because he alleges he never received a copy of the magistrate\u2019s report and had no opportunity to object to its findings. The motion pointed out a clerical error which the district court corrected. It did not disclose Thomas\u2019 objections to the report. The district court also found that the magistrate\u2019s report had been mailed to Thomas and had not been returned. A district court does not abuse its discretion by adopting a magistrate\u2019s report before its receipt of timely-filed objections,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and Thomas failed to state his objections when he had the opportunity. The district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Thomas\u2019 petition for lack of jurisdiction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b872-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
