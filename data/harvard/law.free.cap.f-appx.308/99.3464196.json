We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Ramirez contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea because his sentence greatly exceeded his expectations and because the district court did not permit him to testify before denying the motion. These contentions lack merit. <em>See United States v. Nostratis, </em>321 F.3d 1206, 1211-12 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Ramirez also contends that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to comply with the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), given that he committed his crimes in order to attend college. We conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, and that Ramirez\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 995-96 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b124-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
