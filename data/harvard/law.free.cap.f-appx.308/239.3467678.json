We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Because the BIA conducted its own analysis but also relied in large part on the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review for substantial evidence both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Plasencia-Ayala v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 738, 743 (9th Cir. 2008) (\u201cTo the extent the BIA incorporates the IJ\u2019s decision as its own, we review both the decisions of the BIA and IJ.\u201d). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-19\">Kaur\u2019s admittedly false testimony before the IJ regarding her visa application at the U.S. Embassy in India, and inconsistent testimony regarding when she joined the Shiromani Akali Dal party, provide substantial evidence to support the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003); <em>see also Wang v. INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1259 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cSo long as one of the identified grounds is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart of [petitioner\u2019s] claim of persecution, we are bound to accept the [ ] adverse credibility finding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-20\">Because substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding, we uphold the denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. <em>See Farah, </em>348 F.3d at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-21\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b264-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
