Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, 759 </em>F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">The district court entered its judgment on March 19, 2008. Osorio-Cortez filed the notice of appeal at the latest on April 28, 2008, after the ten-day period expired but within the thirty-day excusable neglect period. Because the notice of appeal was filed within the excusable neglect period, we remand the ease to the district court for the court to determine whether Osorio-Cortez has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the ten-day appeal period. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-13\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
