The District Court sentenced Reyes-Ortiz to 41 months imprisonment and he filed this timely appeal. Counsel for Reyes-Ortiz has moved for permission to withdraw pursuant to <em>An-ders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1968). We will grant counsel\u2019s motion and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-22\">Because we write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the facts and proceedings below, we will not revisit them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-23\">When counsel files a motion pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>as counsel for Reyes-Ortiz has done here, we determine whether: (1) counsel adequately fulfilled the <em>Anders </em>requirements, and (2) an independent review of the record presents any non-frivolous issues. <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-24\">To meet the first prong, appointed counsel must examine the record, conclude that there are no non-frivolous issues for review, and request permission to withdraw. Counsel must accompany a motion to withdraw with a \u201cbrief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u201d <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Reyes-Ortiz\u2019s counsel identified five reasons why an appealable issue does not exist: (1) there are no preserved defense objections; (2) there were no procedural errors in the guilty plea or sentencing proceedings; (3) the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>considered whether a sentence outside the Guidelines range was warranted and determined that there was no factor to justify a non-Guidelines sentence; (4) the sentence imposed was reasonable; and (5) Reyes-Ortiz knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">After Reyes-Ortiz was informed of his counsel\u2019s intention to file an <em>Anders </em>brief, he reiterated his prior request to challenge the sufficiency of the representation he received in the District Court. We generally do not entertain ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal; rather, \u201ca defendant must raise ineffective assistance of counsel in a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in order that the district court may create a sufficient record for appellate review.\u201d <em>Gov\u2019t of Virgin Islands v. Forte, </em>806 F.2d 73, 77 (3d Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">We find that counsel\u2019s discussion of the reasons why no appealable issue exists, as well as Reyes-Ortiz\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, meet the requirements of the first prong of <em>Anders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">As for the second prong of <em>Anders, </em>we have independently reviewed the record and we agree with counsel\u2019s comprehensive analysis as to why no appealable issue exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
