Williams contends that the district court erred by concluding that it lacked the authority to reduce his sentences below the low end of his newly reduced guideline range on the ground that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its authority to reduce a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008). However, we will not reverse if any error is harmless. <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">It remains an open question in the Eleventh Circuit whether <em>Booker\u2019s </em>requirement that sentencing guidelines be treated as advisory rather than mandatory applies once \u00a7 3582(c) allows a resentencing. In fact, there is a circuit split on the issue. <em>Compare United States v. Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d 833 (10th Cir.2008) (holding <em>Booker </em>inapplicable at a \u00a7 3582 resentencing) with <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>472 F.3d 1167, 1168 (9th Cir.2007) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does apply once resentencing is granted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), so that a district court may depart below the new guidelines level). However, although Williams strenuously argues that <em>Booker </em>should have been applied, we need not settle that issue in this case because any error committed by the district court in refusing to apply <em>Booker </em>was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">There are two types of <em>Booker </em>errors\u2014 constitutional and statutory. <em>Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1291-92. When a court erroneously treats the sentencing guidelines as mandatory instead of advisory, it commits <em>Booker </em>statutory error. <em>Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1291 (\u201cStatutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant under a mandatory guidelines scheme ... \u201d) (citations, alteration, and quotation marks omitted). <em>Booker </em>statutory error is harmless if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-14\">viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, \u2018or had but very slight effect.\u2019 If one can say \u201cwith fair assurance ... that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error,\u2019 the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-15\"><em>Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292 (citations and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-16\">In this case, the district court found that <em>Booker </em>did not apply at Williams\u2019 resen-tencing under \u00a7 3582. Therefore, the district court used the reduced offense levels created by Amendment 706 and presumably treated their corresponding sentencing guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory. The amended guidelines range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>applicable to Williams was 168 to 210 months imprisonment. In sentencing Williams to 168 months, the district court stated that \u201ceven if <em>Booker </em>were applied, the Court would in all likelihood impose the same sentence.\u201d The district court added that \u201cThe Court is satisfied that [the sentence reduction afforded Defendant] is sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with all of the factors considered under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In light of these statements by the district court, we can say \u201cwith fair assurance ... that the sentence was not swayed by the error,\u201d if any error occurred. <em>Mathe-nia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292. Instead, it appears that the district court would have imposed the same 168-month sentence even if convinced that it had the authority to impose a sentence below the amended guidelines range. Therefore, any error the district court made in failing to apply <em>Booker </em>had no effect on Williams\u2019 sentence and was harmless under the <em>Mathenia </em>standard. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
