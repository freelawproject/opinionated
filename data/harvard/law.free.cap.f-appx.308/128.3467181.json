Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Because the BIA \u201creviewed the IJ\u2019s decision and incorporated portions of it as its own, we treat the incorporated parts of the IJ\u2019s decision as the BIA\u2019s.\u201d <em>Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). We dismiss in part and deny in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The BIA dismissed Gaspar\u2019s asylum petition as untimely. Though we may exercise jurisdiction over Gaspar\u2019s claim that \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d excused his delay, <em>see Dhital v. Mukasey, </em>532 F.3d 1044, 1049 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Husyev v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir.2008), we reject his contentions. Gas-par\u2019s lack of education, fluency in only his native dialect of Chuj, and ignorance of his right to asylum do not excuse his delay. <em>See Antonio-Martinez v. INS, </em>317 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2003). Moreover, Gas-par intentionally delayed filing his asylum application because he simply did not see why it might benefit him. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(5). We dismiss Gaspar\u2019s asylum petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal. <em>See Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000). Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the single past incident of attempted recruitment by guerillas, after which Gas-par stayed in Guatemala for years without incident, did not rise to the level of persecution and was not based on a protected ground. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Similarly, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that, because country conditions had changed, Gaspar would not be persecuted if he returned to Guatemala. <em>See Molina-Estrada, </em>293 F.3d at 1095-96. We therefore uphold the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Gaspar did not raise his CAT claim before the BIA or this court. It is therefore unexhausted and waived. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
