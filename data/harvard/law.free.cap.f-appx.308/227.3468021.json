We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Casey v. Albertson\u2019s Inc., </em>362 F.3d 1254, 1257 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-23\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Jenkins\u2019 motion for reconsideration because Jenkins failed to present newly discovered evidence or clear and convincing evidence of fraud. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2), (3); <em>see also Coastal Transfer Co. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., </em>833 F.2d 208, 211 (9th Cir.1987) (stating that to prevail on a motion for reconsideration based on newly discovered evidence, the moving party must show the evidence was not previously discoverable through the exercise of due diligence, and is of such magnitude that it would have likely changed the outcome of the case); <em>Casey, </em>362 F.3d at 1260 (explaining that \u201cto prevail on a motion for reconsideration for fraud, the moving party must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the [judgment] was obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>and the conduct complained of prevented the losing party from fully and fairly presenting the defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Jenkins\u2019 remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b251-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
