Dais\u2019 attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although counsel states that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, he challenges the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to compel. Dais advances the same challenge in a supplemental pro se brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-30\">It is well-settled that whether to file a Rule 35(b) motion is a matter left to the government\u2019s discretion. Fed.R.Crim.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>35(b); <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>998 F.2d 228, 230 (4th Cir.1993). However, a court may remedy the government\u2019s refusal to move for a reduction of sentence if: (1) the government has obligated itself in the plea agreement to move for a reduction; or (2) the government\u2019s refusal to move for a reduction was based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). Here, the plea agreement entered into between Dais and the government clearly and unequivocally establishes that the decision whether to file a Rule 35(b) motion rested within the sole discretion of the government. Moreover, there is no evidence that the government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion was based on an unconstitutional motive. Thus, we find no error by the district court in denying Dais\u2019 motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Dais\u2019 motion to compel the government to file a Rule 35(b) motion. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
