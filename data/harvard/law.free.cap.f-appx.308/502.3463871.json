Dec. 18, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 687 587 (Immigr. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 13, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ. <em>Mei Chai Ye v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>489 F.3d 517, 523 (2d Cir.2007). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">We conclude that the BIA did not err in finding on the record before it that Chen failed to establish her eligibility for relief. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Chen did not demonstrate that she suffered past persecution at the hands of the Chinese government because she failed to show that her five-day detention rose to the level of persecution. We have held that while brief periods of detention, on their own, do not necessarily rise to the level of persecution, <em>Ai Feng Yuan v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 192, 198 (2d Cir.2005), <em>overruled on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007)(en banc), a \u201cminor beating, or for that matter, any physical degradation designed to cause pain, humiliation, or other suffering, may rise to the level of persecution if it occurred in the context of an arrest or detention on the basis of a protected ground,\u201d <em>Beskovic v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223, 226 (2d Cir.2006)(internal quotation marks omitted). Chen does not point to evidence that would <em>compel </em>a reasonable fact-finder to conclude that Chen\u2019s one-time, five-day detention with minimal food and water rises to the level of persecution inasmuch as she did not establish that her mistreatment resulted in any serious or lasting harm. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Bejko v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 482, 485-86 (7th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Because Chen was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, she was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Gomez v. INS, </em>947 F.2d 660, 665 (2d Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Finally, because Chen failed to challenge the agency\u2019s denial of her CAT claim, she has waived any such argument. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, we DISMISS the petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
