We deny the petition in part and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the Kims failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v.

We also lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of the Kims\u2019 motion to remand to introduce further evidence of hardship. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 600 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) bars this court from reviewing the denial of a motion to reopen where \u201cthe only question presented is whether [the] new evidence altered the prior, underlying discretionary determination that [the petitioner] had not met the hardship standard\u201d) (internal quotations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the Kims\u2019 motion to remand to pursue Mr. Kim\u2019s withdrawn asylum application because the Kims did not show their prior counsel was ineffective in withdrawing the application or that they were prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance. <em>See Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir.2005) (reviewing for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to remand); <em>Ortiz v.
