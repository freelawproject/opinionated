Strokous is a Ukrainain citizen who arrived in the United States on a K-l fiancee visa in order to marry Boris Begel (\u201cBegel\u201d), a USC whom she later divorced. She filled out an application for adjustment to lawful permanent resident (\u201cLPR\u201d) status before divorcing Begel but did not file the application until after the divorce.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The then-immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) rejected her petition for adjustment of status, and an immigration judge found her deportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">In her appeal before the BIA, Strokous argued that she is entitled to adjust to LPR status based on her marriage to Be-gel despite the fact that the marriage ended before she filed her application for adjustment of status. Central to this claim is the text of section 245(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(d). Under INA \u00a7 245(d), \u201c[t]he Attorney General may not adjust, under subsection (a) of this section, the status of a [K visa recipient] except to that of an alien lawfully admitted ... on a conditional basis ... <em>as a result of </em>the marriage of the nonimmigrant ... to the citizen who filed the petition [for the K visa].\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(d) (emphasis added). The BIA dismissed Strokous\u2019s appeal in an opinion that was not written with particular precision but may have rested on the theory that, for an alien to be adjusting \u201cas a result of\u2019 a marriage under INA \u00a7 245(d), the marriage must still be in existence when the petition for adjust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>ment is adjudicated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following the dismissal of her appeal before the BIA, Stro-kous filed this timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Most aliens applying for adjustment of status do so utilizing the mechanism provided by INA \u00a7 245, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255. INA \u00a7 245 sets forth the general procedures for adjustment of status, but eligibility for adjustment is usually determined by other provisions of law. In her initial briefs, however, Strokous does not argue that she is eligible for adjustment using the mechanism provided by INA \u00a7 245. Instead, she urges that a fiancee visaholder may adjust based on other provisions of the INA. This claim is squarely contradicted by our recent decision in <em>Choin v. Mu-kasey, </em>537 F.3d 1116 (9th Cir.2008), which was decided after the initial briefs were filed in this case. <em>Choin </em>held that the Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendments of 1986 (\u201cIMFA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 99-639, 100 Stat. 3537 (1986), \u201crequired K visaholders, like other nonimmigrants, to adjust their status through [INA] \u00a7 245.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Strokous argues in a supplemental brief that <em>Choin </em>undermines the reasoing of the BIA\u2019s decision and requires remand. We agree. In <em>Choin, </em>we considered the case of a petitioner who married the USC who petitioned for her fiancee visa, filed her application for adjustment and then divorced after filing the application but before the application was adjudicated. <em>Id. </em>at 1117-18. We held that INA \u00a7 245(d)\u2019s requirement that Choin adjust \u201cas a result of\u2019 her marriage did not bar her from adjusting status. <em>See id. </em>at 1120-21. We noted that INA \u00a7 245(d) was created by the IMFA. <em>See id. </em>Among other things, we reasoned that the purpose of the IMFA was to deter marriage fraud, not to impose a durational requirement on a marriage. <em>Id. </em>We held that the IMFA\u2019s \u201cpurpose of rooting out marriage fraud does not support the government\u2019s reading of the statute as a tool to remove immigrants like Choin who marry a U.S. citizen in good faith but have their marriages end in divorce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1120. Accordingly, we held that <em>Choin </em>was not barred from adjusting by INA \u00a7 245(d) even though her marriage had ended. <em>Id. </em>at 1120-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">Strokous differs from <em>Choin </em>in one significant respect: Strokous filed her application for adjustment of status after she divorced her USC husband rather than <em>before </em>divorcing the USC, as Choin did. Though the government argues that Strokous\u2019s case is distinguishable from <em>Choin </em>on this ground, this case must be remanded to the BIA. As noted above, the BIA\u2019s decision may have rested on the rationale that INA \u00a7 245(d) requires that a petitioner\u2019s marriage be in existence when her petition for adjustment is adjudicated. If this was the BIA\u2019s rationale, it was squarely contradicted by <em>Choin</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>How <em>Choin </em>applies to Strokous\u2019s case is a matter for the BIA to decide in the first instance. <em>See Gonzales v. Thomas, </em>547 U.S. 183, 186, 126 S.Ct. 1613, 164 L.Ed.2d 358 (2006) (per curiam); <em>INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b101-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
