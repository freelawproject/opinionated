Feb. 3, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A72 381 543 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 3, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-14\">When, as here, the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">The Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) and its implementing regulations provide that an individual must file a motion to reopen within ninety days of the issuance of a final administrative order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). This limitation, however, does not apply when the motion to reopen is filed in order to apply for asylum or withholding of removal based on changed circumstances arising in her country of nationality, if the evidence submitted is material and was unavailable and undis-coverable at the time of her hearing before the IJ. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (c)(7)(C)(n); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h). Here, it is undisputed that Zhang\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely, as it was filed more than ten years after the IJ\u2019s order granting Zhang voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-16\">Zhang argues that the ninety-day filing deadline for motions to reopen is not applicable to her motion. She asserts that the INA authorizes the filing of successive asylum applications, despite their untimeliness, \u201cbased upon \u2018the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum,\u2019 \u201d including \u201cactivities the applicant becomes involved in outside the country of feared persecution that place the applicant at risk.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(4)(i)(B). She asserts that the birth of her children in the United States constitute such changed circumstances. She contends that she was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>required to demonstrate changed circumstances in China as required by the regulations governing motions to reopen. However, we have accorded <em>Chevron </em>deference to the BIA\u2019s statutory interpretation in <em>Matter of C-W-L-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 346, 347 (BIA 2007), in which it rejected precisely this argument. <em>See Yuen Jin v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 143, 156 (2d Cir.2008). In <em>C-W-L-, </em>the BIA found that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C), which allows the f\u00edhng of an untimely motion to reopen only upon a showing of changed country conditions, \u201capplies to situations like the one at bar, where an alien seeks to reopen proceedings in which he previously was ordered removed from the United States.\u201d 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 349. In <em>Yuen Jin, </em>we agreed with the BIA\u2019s holding in <em>C-W-L-, </em>that an individual \u201cunder a final removal order must file a successive asylum application in conjunction with a motion to reopen and in accordance with those procedural requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156. To permit otherwise would provide persons under final orders of removal with the incentive to ignore those orders and change their own circumstances to enable them to file new asylum applications. <em>Id. </em>at 155. Because Zhang\u2019s case is squarely controlled by <em>Yuen Jin, </em>her failure to establish an exception to the fifing deadline for motions to reopen is fatal to her petition for review. We therefore find it unnecessary to consider her other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, we DISMISS the petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
