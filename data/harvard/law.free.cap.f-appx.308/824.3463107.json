(the \u201cWilson Firm\u201d) under \u00a7 503(b)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code. Appellants contend that the bankruptcy court erred in determining the amount of fees awarded to the Wilson Firm. Appel-lee/Cross-Appellant Mirant Corporation asserts that the Wilson Firm was not entitled to recover any fees as a matter of law under \u00a7 503(b)(4). We affirm the holdings of the district court and bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Appellee Mirant Corporation (\u201cMirant\u201d) and certain of its subsidiaries filed for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Appellants are Frank Smith, Kent Koerper, Bart Engram, Mary Leight, and L. Matt Wilson (\u201cWilson\u201d), each a common shareholder of Mirant during the corporation\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. Mirant\u2019s reorganization plans, which were filed in early 2005, stated that its value was substantially less than its outstanding debt, which would leave existing shareholders with no monetary recovery. To determine Mirant\u2019s value, the bankruptcy court scheduled a valuation hearing. Appellants hired Wilson in his capacity as an attorney with the Wilson Firm to represent all shareholders at the valuation hearing and later proceedings in seeking a higher recovery for existing Mirant shareholders. Appellants\u2019 fee agreement with Wilson provided that Appellants would be responsible to him only for a 1% contingency on profits attributable to the representation that they actually realized in connection with the sale of their Mirant stock. The fee agreement also provided for an hourly fee, but stated that the Wilson Firm did \u201cnot expect any individual client to be responsible for the payment of our hourly fees\u201d and \u201canticipate^ applying to the Bankruptcy Court for approval of and payment of these fees as an expense of the Estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">After the original valuation hearing, the bankruptcy court ordered that a committee be formed to recalculate Mirant\u2019s value. While the revaluation was pending, a new reorganization plan was offered that gave existing shareholders a more favorable recovery. In response to this more favorable reorganization plan, the bankruptcy court suspended the revaluation committee. The bankruptcy court then entered its confirmation order effecting Mirant\u2019s emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 3, 2006. Appellants filed a fee application under \u00a7 503(b)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, seeking payment of fees and expenses totaling $645,146.64.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The bankruptcy court concluded that \u00a7 503(b)(4) allowed the Wilson Firm to apply directly for payment by the estate even though Appellants had not paid any of Wilson\u2019s fees. <em>In re Mirant, </em>354 B.R. 113, 140 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.2006). The bankruptcy court then found that the Wilson Firm had made a substantial contribution, but also concluded that the firm \u201coverestimate[d] the magnitude of the contribution made\u201d and that the contribution \u201cha[d] not been entirely positive.\u201d Thus, the bankruptcy court awarded Wilson partial payment in the amount of $15,000. The bankruptcy court denied Appellants\u2019 motion to reconsider. Appellants appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling on the fee amount awarded to the Wilson Firm to the district court, and Mirant cross-appealed, asserting that the bankruptcy court erred in awarding the Wilson Firm any fees. The district court affirmed the opinion of the bankruptcy court in all respects and denied a motion by the Wilson Firm for rehearing. The instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">This court reviews a bankruptcy court\u2019s determination of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Barron, </em>325 F.3d 690, 692 (5th Cir.2003). This \u201cabuse of discretion standard includes review to determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Consistent with this review, findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and conclusions of law are reviewed de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">In its cross-appeal, Mirant asserts that the bankruptcy court erred, as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>law, in authorizing Wilson to recover any fees when Appellants were not obligated to pay such fees. Section 503(b)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, governing the payment of professional fees out of the bankruptcy estate, provides for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-5\">reasonable compensation for professional services rendered by an attorney or an accountant of an entity whose expense is allowable under paragraph (3) of this subsection, based on the time, the nature, the extent, and the value of such services, and the cost of comparable services other than in a case under this title, and reimbursement for actual, necessary expenses incurred by such attorney or accountant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 503(b)(4). Mirant argues that this section, when read in conjunction with \u00a7 503(b)(3)(D),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> regarding the payment of administrative expenses out of the bankruptcy estate, provides only for reimbursement of attorney\u2019s fees actually \u201cincurred\u201d by the entity employing the attorney, and thus Appellants\u2019 fee agreement\u2014 under which no fees were due to the Wilson Firm<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 prevents the firm from recovering fees from the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Although Mirant asserts that the attorney\u2019s fees recoverable under \u00a7 503(b)(4) must have been \u201cincurred by\u201d the creditor/client, the wording of the statute does not support such an interpretation. <em>See In re W. Asbestos Co., </em>318 B.R. 527, 530 (Bankr.N.D.Cal.2004) (\u201cSection 503(b)(4) does not require that the attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses that form the basis for the administrative claim be incurred by the creditor. It simply requires that the attorney whose fees and expenses form the basis for the administrative claim represent the creditor who made a substantial contribution.\u201d). Section 503(b)(4) requires only that the \u201cattorney or [ ] accountant\u201d whose fees are being reimbursed must have represented \u201can entity whose expense is allowable under paragraph (3).\u201d 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 503(b)(4). An entity whose expenses are allowable under paragraph (3) is defined as a \u201ccreditor, an indenture trustee, an equity security holder, or a committee representing creditors or equity security holders\u201d who made a substantial contribution to the bankruptcy proceedings. 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 503(b)(3). The fact that other administrative expenses com-pensable under paragraph (3), a category which specifically excludes attorneys\u2019 fees compensable under paragraph (4), must have been \u201cincurred by\u201d the creditor does not warrant the same result with regard to paragraph (4). Because the Wilson Firm represented a party specified under the statute and the bankruptcy judge determined that the firm made a \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d to the bankruptcy proceeding, the bankruptcy judge correctly awarded fees under \u00a7 503(b)(4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">In their direct appeal, Appellants contend that the bankruptcy court erred in determining the amount of fees awarded to the Wilson Firm under \u00a7 503(b)(4). The bankruptcy court found that the Wilson Firm had substantially contributed to the bankruptcy case, but reduced the award to $15,000 from Wilson\u2019s request of $645,146.64. The court also refused to enhance Appellants\u2019 fee award on the basis of the contingency fee agreement. Appellants claims that the bankruptcy court failed to follow the procedures this court set out for determining fee awards in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">This Court has stated that \u201cthe bankruptcy court is one of equity and thus has broad equitable \u2014 and hence discretionary \u2014 powers to award attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>In re Anderson, </em>936 F.2d 199, 204 (5th Cir. 1991); <em>see also In re Lawler, </em>807 F.2d 1207, 1211 (5th Cir.1987) (\u201cThe bankruptcy court is more familiar with the actual services performed and \u2018has a far better means of knowing what is just and reasonable than an appellate court can have.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). In determining \u201creasonable compensation,\u201d \u00a7 503(b)(4) directs the court to consider \u201cthe time, the nature, the extent, and the value of such services, and the cost of comparable services....\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">The bankruptcy court found that Wilson\u2019s contributions were not entirely positive and were duplicative of efforts made by other parties in the proceeding. Given the broad discretion of the bankruptcy court to determine the fee award, we do not find that the court abused its discretion in reducing the award given to the Wilson Firm. Furthermore, because there were no outstanding circumstances presented that warranted a fee enhancement, the bankruptcy court\u2019s refusal to approve the bonus fee application was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court, confirming that of the bankruptcy court, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b849-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-8\">. Section 503(b)(3)(D) provides that an expense shall be allowed for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoW\">the actual, necessary expenses, other than compensation and reimbursement specified in paragraph (4) of this subsection, <em>incurred by </em>... a creditor, an indenture trustee, an equity security holder, or a committee representing creditors or equity security holders ... in making a substantial contribution in a case under chapter 9 or 11 of this title. 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 503(b)(3)(D)(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-10\">. The clients of the Wilson Firm were not obligated to pay any fees to the firm under the terms of the agreement because (1) the Wilson Firm did \"not expect any individual client to be responsible for the payment of our hourly fees\u201d and (2) the contingency fee agreement was dependent upon the clients sale of the stock, which had not occurred at the time the fee application was filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b851-14\">. Even if the statute required that attorneys fees be \u201cincurred\u201d in order to be compensa-ble, it is not entirely clear here that there is no obligation to pay fees to the Wilson Firm. The parties appear to agree that the clients of the Wilson Firm have incurred an obligation to pay the contingency fee portion of the fees at the time of the sale of their Mirant stock.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
