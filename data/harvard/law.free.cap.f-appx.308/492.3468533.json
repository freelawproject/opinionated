Burr denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Zhen Liu, </em>No. A 98 593 988 (B.I.A. Dec. 31, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 98 593 988 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 27, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-16\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 59 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>See Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 166 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. For instance, the IJ accurately observed inconsistencies between Liu\u2019s testimony and that of her husband concerning when he first saw Liu after her first abortion and where Liu resided after her second abortion. Likewise, the IJ correctly noted an inconsistency between Liu\u2019s testimony and her written application regarding whether her husband was detained and beaten for confronting family planning officials after her second abortion. In the same vein, the IJ pointed out that Liu\u2019s and her husband\u2019s testimony differed with respect to who had informed the authorities of Liu\u2019s second pregnancy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Liu asserts in her brief to this Court that these inconsistencies cannot support an adverse credibility determination because they are minor or immaterial. However, because the provisions of the REAL ID Act govern Liu\u2019s July 2005 asylum application, the inconsistencies relied upon by the IJ need not have involved the heart of Liu\u2019s asylum claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 166-67 (holding that this Court\u2019s previous holding in <em>Secai-da-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir.2003) \u2014 that an IJ could not base an adverse credibility determination on inconsistencies and omissions that were \u201ccollateral or ancillary\u201d to an applicant\u2019s claim\u2014 had been abrogated by the amendments to the statutory standard imposed by the REAL ID Act). Accordingly, the IJ properly relied on these inconsistencies to find Liu not credible. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was also supported by several omissions in the record. For example, the IJ appropriately pointed out that although Liu testified that her husband was beaten and detained after her second abortion, her husband stated only that he was fined. Liu\u2019s husband explained that he did not mention the detention and beating because he \u201chear[d] wrong.\u201d The IJ reasonably declined to credit that explanation. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80-81. Liu asserts that these omissions do not \u201cimpact the central act of persecution\u201d against her. Again, however, irrespective of the materiality of these omissions, they substantiated the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The IJ further found that Liu\u2019s demean- or undermined her credibility. Because Liu has not challenged the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding, we deem any such challenge to that finding waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005) (emphasizing that, \u201c[i]ssues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Finally, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by Liu\u2019s deficient corroboration. First, the IJ appropriately declined to give weight to U.S. medical records indicating that Liu had informed a physician of her two alleged abortions, where she had obtained the document after she was placed in removal proceedings. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341-42 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that the weight afforded to documentary evidence \u201c \u2018lies largely\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>within the discretion of the IJ\u201d). Likewise, the IJ reasonably elected not to give any weight to Liu\u2019s abortion certificates where a 2005 State Department report indicated that such certificates were only issued after voluntary abortions and that documentation from China was subject to widespread fraud. <em>See also Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.8d 395, 400 (2d Cir.2006). Liu\u2019s deficient corroboration rendered her unable to rehabilitate testimony that had already been called into question. <em>See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir.2007). Moreover, while Liu asserts in her brief to this Court that the IJ failed to review all the evidence in the record, the agency was not required to specifically address each piece of evidence that she presented. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 336, n. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Under these circumstances, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Thus, its denial of Liu\u2019s application for asylum was proper. Because the only evidence of a threat to Liu\u2019s life or freedom depended upon her credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on her claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, 444 </em>F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-5\">. Liu\u2019s husband explained that Liu had told him that her aunt\u2019s neighbors reported the pregnancy, but that he had heard that \"other people\" had reported it. The IJ was not required to credit that explanation. <em>See Ma-jidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
