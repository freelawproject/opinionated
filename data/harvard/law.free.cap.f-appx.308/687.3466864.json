He was sentenced to the mandatory minimum of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment and a five-year term of supervised release.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Jones\u2019 counsel has filed an appeal under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising the issue of whether Jones entered his guilty plea knowingly and voluntarily. Jones specifically challenges the district court\u2019s failure to vacate the plea when Jones stated at sentencing that he did not understand his mandatory minimum sentence. The Government declined to file a brief. Jones has filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-27\">In the absence of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, we review the adequacy of the guilty plea pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>review of the transcript of Jones\u2019 guilty plea hearing reveals that the district court fully complied with the requirements of Rule 11. Jones\u2019 plea was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made, with full knowledge of the consequences attendant to his guilty plea. Specifically, we find the district court informed Jones of the statutory mandatory minimum sentence he faced and Jones acknowledged that he understood. We therefore find no plain error. We further find no merit to Jones\u2019 claim in his pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Jones\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Jones, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Jones requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Jones. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b711-19\"> The district court granted Jones\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2006) motion raising a claim under <em>United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39, 42 (4th Cir. 1993), and reinstated judgment for purposes of allowing Jones to file an appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
