BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">Dalberiste, a native and citizen of Haiti, arrived in the United States at West Palm Beach, Florida on or about 8 May 2002. <em>See </em>Administrative Record (\u201cAR\u201d) at 212. The Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) served Dalberiste with a notice to appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) on 9 May 2002, charging him with removability under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae as an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, or who arrived in the United States at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General. <em>Id. </em>at 212-13. On 23 January 2003, Dalber-iste appeared before an IJ, admitted the allegations contained in the NTA, and conceded removability. <em>Id. </em>at 63, 66. That same day, Dalberiste filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal, alleging persecution on the basis of political opinion because he opposed the Fanmi Lavalas Party and then-president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. <em>Id. </em>at 78, 85-90, 102, 176,180.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-17\">In support of his application, Dalberiste filed a number of articles regarding conditions in Haiti. <em>See id. </em>at 126-175. These articles stated that journalists who opposed the Lavalas Party were subjected to severe harassment, including threatening telephone calls, assaults, beatings, illegal arrests, and even murder. <em>Id. </em>at 129-30. No incidents of direct censorship of journalists by the state were reported, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>er. <em>Id. </em>at 130. The record also included the 2005 U.S. State Department\u2019s Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Haiti (\u201c2005 Country Report\u201d), which noted that there were credible reports of arbitrary killings committed by the Lavalas Party as well as by street gangs, who were suspected of being paid and armed by President Aristide\u2019s supporters. <em>Id. </em>at 111. While Haitian law provided for freedom of speech and of the press, most journalists practiced some form of self-censorship, and there were several reports of high-profile journalists being threatened, attacked, and/or killed by the Haitian National Police, Aristide supporters, and other individuals. <em>Id. </em>at 118-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">At his September 2006 removal hearing, Dalberiste testified that he had worked as an on-air journalist at a radio station in Saint Louis du Nord, Haiti, since 1999. He stopped working at the station following a 22 December 2001 broadcast during which he discussed a recent failed coup d\u2019etat and spoke out against President Ar-istide and the Lavalas regime. <em>Id. </em>at 78, 85-90, 104. After Dalberiste made these remarks, a large crowd of Lavalas supporters, who were known to \u201ccrack down\u201d on anyone who criticized the government, gathered outside the radio station and attempted to enter the station.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 90-93. Fearing that he would be beaten or killed, Dalberiste escaped and fled to an area called Gallon, where he remained for four months.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 92-94. Dalberiste learned from his mother, who visited him several times while he lived in Gallon, that on the night of the broadcast, members of the Lavalas crowd had come looking for him at her house. They \u201cshook\u201d and \u201cjerked\u201d her and threatened to \u201ctake her away\u201d if she did not reveal his whereabouts. On occasion, unidentified persons would throw stones at her house. <em>Id. </em>at 96-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">On cross-examination, Dalberiste stated that although Aristide was no longer in Haiti, Dalberiste would be in danger if he returned to Haiti because the Lavalas Party still existed. <em>Id. </em>at 102. He could not relocate to a different city because Haiti was a small country, and he would not able to hide because he would have to work in public. He had been able to live without incident in Gallon only because he remained in hiding while he lived there. <em>Id. </em>at 102-03. In response to the IJ\u2019s questioning, Dalberiste testified that individuals conducted surveillance on his mother\u2019s house in case he returned, but no one had attempted to enter the house as they had on the night of the radio station incident. <em>Id. </em>at 107. The only other adverse incident relating to his political beliefs that he experienced before the radio station incident occurred in 1995 when he was a student. According to Dalberiste, after he spoke out against the government, an \u201celement\u201d told him that \u201cthey would burn [him] out\u201d if he returned to the country. <em>Id. </em>at 105-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The IJ denied Dalberiste\u2019s application for relief and ordered him removed to Haiti. <em>Id. </em>at 37. The IJ found that Dal-beriste\u2019s testimony was generally credible, but that he had failed to meet the burden for asylum because, even assuming the truth of his testimony, the incident at the radio station, the event in 1995, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>harassment of Dalberiste\u2019s mother did not amount to past persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 49-52. The IJ further found that Dalberiste had not demonstrated a well-founded fear of future persecution because his notoriety as a political activist was not likely to have outlasted his four-year absence from Haiti, Aristide\u2019s regime had ended, and Dalber-iste\u2019s family had remained unharmed. <em>Id. </em>at 53-54. The IJ noted that although Dal-beriste had shown general conditions of political violence, inhumane actions, and lack of security in Haiti, these general conditions did not qualify him for asylum. <em>Id. </em>at 54-55. Because Dalberiste failed to meet the lower burden of proof for asylum eligibility, his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief also failed. <em>Id. </em>at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Dalberiste appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA, arguing that he had established past persecution on account of his political opinion and that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution because conditions for journalists in Haiti were still dangerous and had not changed and because the Lavalas Party remained a viable and violent political force. <em>Id. </em>at 13, 19, 33-34. In any event, he asserted, he was entitled to a presumption of future persecution based on his having established past persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 19-20. The BIA affirmed, and Dalberiste now seeks review of the BIA\u2019s denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we treat the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination and review the IJ\u2019s analysis as if it were the BIA\u2019s. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review <em>de novo </em>the IJ\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>See Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2008) (per cu-riam). Findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, which requires us to affirm the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">On appeal, Dalberiste argues that he showed past persecution because his life was threatened after he criticized President Aristide and the Lavalas regime during the 22 December 2001 radio broadcast. He contends that this entitled him to a presumption of future persecution and that the government has failed to rebut this presumption. He also argues that the 2005 Country Report, which stated that conditions for journalists in Haiti continued to be dangerous, demonstrated that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted if returned to Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1) (2008). The Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien satisfies his burden of establishing that he is a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9u\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">Thus, to establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>dence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Naj-jar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. If the alien establishes past persecution, it is presumed that his life or freedom would be threatened upon return to the country of removal. The government can overcome this presumption by showing that the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would no longer be threatened or that the alien could relocated within the country and it would be reasonable to expect him to do so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b), 208.16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">An alien who has not shown past persecution may still be entitled to asylum if he can demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2). To prevail, the applicant\u2019s fear of persecution must be both \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">We have repeatedly stated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1226 (quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted). The allegedly persecutory events to which Dalberiste testified amounted to no more than a handful of isolated incidents of verbal intimidation. There is no evidence in the record that either Dalberiste or his mother was ever detained or physically injured during their encounters with the Lavalas Party supporters. The harassment Dalberiste suffered thus did not rise to the level of extremity required to show past persecution. <em>See, e.g., Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290-91 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (finding no persecution where asylum petitioner was detained by Chinese government for five days but suffered no injuries); <em>Barreto-Claro v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>275 F.3d 1334, 1340 (11th Cir.2001) (finding no persecution where petitioner lost his job and was forced to take menial work but was never physically harmed, arrested, or detained).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">We further conclude that Dalberiste failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution because the record does not support a finding that Dalberiste was so famous a political activist that his notoriety with the Lavalas Party would survive his four-year absence from Haiti. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231-32 (holding that the petitioner did not demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution where the evidence did not indicate that her notoriety as an activist would outlast her four-year absence from Colombia). Moreover, as Dalberiste noted at his hearing, Aristide was no longer in power in Haiti, and his family continued to live peacefully in Haiti. Dalberiste thus failed to show specific, detailed facts demonstrating that he had a good reason to fear being singled out for future persecution. <em>See Al-Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b)(2), 208.16(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Inasmuch as the record does not compel a finding that Dalberiste suffered past per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>secution or has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a protected ground, he cannot satisfy the more stringent standard applicable to a claim for withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4 (noting that where petitioner fails to establish claim of asylum on merits, his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief necessarily fail).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Dalberiste seeks review of the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal. Because the evidence does not compel a finding that Dalberiste suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion or any other protected ground, we DENY the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-11\">. Dalberiste does not challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief in his petition for review and thus has abandoned this issue. <em>See Se-pulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b425-18\">. According to Country Report, President Ar-istide was ousted from the presidency by an armed rebellion and left Haiti in 2004. <em>Id. </em>at 111, 116.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b426-5\">. Dalberiste testified that he did not actually see the people assembled outside, but was told by another radio station employee that they were Lavalas supporters. <em>See id. </em>at 91-93.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b426-10\">. Although Dalberiste stated in his asylum application that the crowd destroyed the radio station after he had already escaped, <em>see id. </em>at 187, the IJ found that there was no evidence in the record to support this statement, <em>see id. </em>at 48, 51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\">. Dalberiste argues in his petition for review, and argued in his brief to the BIA, that the IJ erred in finding that there was no nexus between his on-air political statements and the arrival of the angry mob at the station. Although the IJ did not explicitly make such a finding, we note that, even assuming a connection between the crowd and Dalberiste\u2019s statements, this incident still did not amount to persecution, especially given the lack of any evidence that anyone was actually injured or physically harmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
