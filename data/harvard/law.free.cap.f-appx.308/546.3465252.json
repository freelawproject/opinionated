Sept. 20, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-28\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>such motions are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322-23, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lin\u2019s motion to reopen. The Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) and its implementing regulations require that a motion to reopen be filed within ninety days of the issuance of a final administrative order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). This time limitation, however, does not apply when the motion to reopen is filed in order to apply for asylum or withholding of removal \u201cbased on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Here, it is indisputable that Lin\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely. Lin argues \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d on the basis of the documents that this Court considered in <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109 (2d Cir. 2006), and contends that the BIA abused its discretion when it failed to consider the <em>Guo </em>documents because they were in its possession \u201cas a result of two reported decisions.\u201d Lin, however, did not submit the <em>Guo </em>documents with her motion; thus, they were not in the record to be considered by the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Lin cites no support for the proposition that the BIA abuses its discretion when it declines to consider evidence that is not in the record merely because it was in the record of a different case. Indeed, it was Lin\u2019s burden to present evidence to support her motion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Nor will this Court remand for the agency to consider extra-record evidence. <em>Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 269-70 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also id. </em>at 262 (noting that the \u201cregulations set forth procedures to reopen a case before the BIA for the taking of additional evidence\u201d). Lin filed her motion to reopen in April 2007, after this Court decided <em>Shou Yung Guo, </em>but she did not submit the so-called <em>Guo </em>documents with her motion to reopen. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the BIA abused its discretion in declining to consider the <em>Guo </em>documents. <em>See id. </em>at 262.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">Finally, Lin\u2019s reliance on <em>Qun Yang v. McElroy, </em>277 F.3d 158 (2d Cir.2002), and <em>Belishta v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 1078 (9th Cir.2004), is misplaced. In <em>Qun Yang, </em>this Court reviewed a BIA decision issued years after the IJ decision and remanded for the limited purpose of allowing the BIA to consider a motion to reopen based on more recent country conditions. 277 F.3d at 163. Similarly, in <em>Belishta, </em>the Ninth Circuit stayed its mandate to allow the petitioner to file a motion to reopen in order to apply for newly available relief. <em>See </em>378 F.3d at 1081. Lin, however, seeks review of the agency\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, a motion in which she had the opportunity to present recent evidence material to her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\"> Lin\u2019s suggestion that remand is appropriate based on the documents we addressed in <em>Zhi Yun Gao v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 86 (2d Cir. 2007), fails for the same reason. <em>See Xiao Xing Ni, </em>494 F.3d at 269-70.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
