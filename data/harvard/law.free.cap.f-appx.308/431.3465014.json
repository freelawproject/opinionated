She worked under both Mary Davis, the operations manager, and Steven Moretti, the store manager. Upon Moretti\u2019s arrival in October 2000, he became increasingly hostile to Birdyshaw and made derogatory remarks about her age and gender. In a November 25, 2000, meeting involving Birdyshaw, Davis, and Moretti, Moretti and Birdyshaw got in a work-related confrontation. Due to the anxiety from the confrontation with Moretti, Birdyshaw\u2019s doctor placed her on medical leave. Following the incident, Birdyshaw complained to Dillard\u2019s management about Moretti\u2019s behavior. While Birdyshaw was out on medical leave, Moretti terminated her salary benefits, but after several weeks, Dillard\u2019s reinstated those benefits. On February 16, 2001, Birdyshaw filed a charge of discrimination against Dillard\u2019s with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Birdyshaw alleged ten causes of actions, but only her two retaliation claims are at issue in this appeal. In the first retaliation claim, Birdyshaw alleged that, as a result of her complaint about Moretti, Dillard\u2019s retaliated against her by suspending her salary benefits while she was on medical leave. In her second retaliation claim, Birdyshaw alleged that Dillard\u2019s retaliated against her by failing to grant her a transfer to a different store, which ultimately led to her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">Dillard\u2019s filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing Birdyshaw could not show an adverse employment action and that it had legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for suspending her salary and not granting her a transfer. With respect to the transfer request, Dillard\u2019s argued that, as a matter of policy, it did not transfer employees who were on leave and, because Birdyshaw requested the transfer to take effect only after she was permitted to return to work \u2014 permission which her doctor first granted only after she was terminated \u2014 her request never became ripe.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">Dillard\u2019s attached a 2003 deposition given by Birdyshaw, as well as numerous exhibits introduced during that deposition, which provided as follows. Birdyshaw testified that, before the incident with Moretti on November 25, 2000, she had previously complained to Davis that Moretti had discriminated against Birdyshaw based on her sex and age. Specifically, after Davis informed Birdyshaw on one occasion that Moretti had fired another employee, Bir-dyshaw responded: \u201cWhat is wrong with him. Is he trying to get rid of all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>older managers, is he trying to clean house. What is going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">On November 25, 2000, Moretti became angry with Birdyshaw for having not filled a particular position in the store. Specifically, Moretti asked her whether she had contacted other managers about the job opening, and Birdyshaw responded that she had done so in a managers\u2019 meeting. Moretti challenged her assertion, screamed at her, called her a liar, and told her not to \u201cbullshit\u201d him. Birdyshaw became terrified, told Moretti that his language was inappropriate, and walked out of the meeting. Birdyshaw made it back to her office, at which point she cried and experienced a headache and chest and arm pains. She proceeded to walk out of the store so that she could go to the doctor. Moretti caught up to her as she was walking out and grabbed her arm. He told Birdyshaw that she needed to return to the store, and Birdyshaw refused, stating that he had been very rude and abusive. Moretti responded that he did not like being lied to and, after Birdyshaw insisted that she had not been lying, Moretti called her a \u201clying bitch.\u201d Ultimately, Birdy-shaw left the mall, called a doctor, and went to the emergency room.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The following day, Birdyshaw5 wrote a letter to Dillard\u2019s management describing the incident with Moretti. Birdyshaw acknowledged in her testimony that nowhere in the letter did she suggest that Moretti was discriminating against her because of her gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Rick Willey, the regional manager, responded to Birdyshaw\u2019s letter and, after characterizing her complaint as one alleging a \u201chostile and harassing work environment,\u201d explained that Birdyshaw\u2019s letter was highly embellished when compared to the account provided by Moretti and Davis. Willey did not mention any allegation of gender discrimination. The letter also informed Birdyshaw that, if she had suffered a job-related injury that made her unable to work, she could continue to receive her full salary as long she provided certification from a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Birdyshaw testified that she became unable to work at that time and began to submit certifications from her doctors so providing. Various doctors placed Birdy-shaw on medical leave from the end of November 2000, until her termination one year later. None of the doctor\u2019s notes informed Dillard\u2019s that Birdyshaw was able to return to work if she was not required to work for Moretti.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">On January 17, 2001, Moretti wrote Bir-dyshaw a letter explaining that he was discontinuing her salary benefits because he had discovered that she had applied for a position at another department store while claiming to be on medical leave. Approximately one month later, Dillard\u2019s reinstated Birdyshaw\u2019s salary and awarded her back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">On March 16, 2001, Birdyshaw wrote a letter to Burt Squires in Dillard\u2019s corporate office requesting a transfer to Yuma, Arizona. This letter provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-12\">Based on my doctor\u2019s recommendation that I not return to Dillard\u2019s Madison Square Mall (under the supervision of Steve Moretti) and due to Steve Moret-ti\u2019s past discrimination and harassment of me (which is the basis of a currently pending EEOC charge) plus Mr. Wil-ley\u2019s failure to adequately investigate or remedy the discrimination and harassment by Steven Moretti, I am requesting a move out of division 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-13\">I am requesting a transfer to Yuma, Arizona (near my family) to be effective when my doctor releases me to return to work....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">Birdyshaw testified that she did not receive a response to the letter, and she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>never returned to work at Dillard\u2019s because they never granted her a transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">On September 17, 2001, upon receipt of a doctor\u2019s note extending Birdyshaw\u2019s medical leave through December 1, 2001, Davis wrote Birdyshaw a letter, informing her that her allotted year-long period of leave would expire on November 26, 2001, and that if she did not return to work by that day, she would be terminated. In response, Birdyshaw informed Davis that her medical leave had been extended through December 1, 2001, and renewed her request for a transfer to Arizona \u201cwhen the doctor says I may return to work.\u201d After her doctor extended her medical leave through February 1, 2002, Birdyshaw again wrote Davis a letter requesting an extension of her allotted leave \u2014 since she could not return to work by November 26, 2001 \u2014 and renewed her \u201cprevious request that when I am able to return to work, that I be transferred to a different division----\u201d Birdyshaw subsequently received written confirmation that she had been terminated on November 24, 2001, although this was two days premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">In addition to Birdyshaw\u2019s deposition, Dillard\u2019s also submitted, <em>inter alia, </em>a 2003 deposition and 2007 declaration given by Davis. Davis explained that employees with less than ten years of service with Dillard\u2019s are entitled to six months of full salary while on medical leave and, if still unable to work after that period, are entitled to another six months of unpaid medical leave. If the employee is unable to return to work after the latter six-month period, then they are automatically terminated. Davis explained that \u201cBirdyshaw never reported back to work after the expiration of her leave of absence and therefore her employment was terminated and she never became eligible for a transfer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Birdyshaw responded to Dillard\u2019s summary judgment motion. She argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that Dillard\u2019s retaliated against her \u201cby terminating her salary benefits while on leave and by denying her a transfer away from Mr. Moretti, effectively terminating her.\u201d Birdyshaw contended that the suspension of her salary constituted an adverse employment action and that Dillard\u2019s reason for suspending it was pretex-tual. With respect to the denial of her transfer, Birdyshaw emphasized that Dillard\u2019s ignored her request, thereby preventing her from returning to work within the 12-month period of allotted leave. Birdyshaw also asserted that Dillard\u2019s reb-anee on an unwritten policy preventing the transfer of inactive employees was pretex-tual.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Birdyshaw also attached an affidavit that she prepared, in which she responded to Dillard\u2019s statement of undisputed facts. Birdyshaw disputed Dillard\u2019s assertion that her November 26, 2000, letter to management did not allege age or gender discrimination. Based on Willey\u2019s response to the letter, it was clear to Birdyshaw that management \u201cunderstood the nature of [her] complaint to be about unlawful harassment and discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">In addition, Birdyshaw disputed Dillard\u2019s policy that inactive employees were ineligible to transfer, emphasizing that management never informed her of this policy, and she had never seen this policy. Birdyshaw also disputed Dillard\u2019s assertion that she was not released to return to work at the time she requested her transfer. In this respect, Birdyshaw disputed Dillard\u2019s assertion that the earliest she could return to work was February 2002, asserting that she could have returned immediately if permitted to work for someone other than Moretti.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">Dillard\u2019s replied to Birdyshaw\u2019s response to its summary judgment motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>repeating its arguments. Dillard\u2019s then supplemented its summary judgment motion and attached a deposition given by Squires. Squires testified that he took no action on Birdyshaw\u2019s transfer request because she was ineligible due to the fact that she was on leave at the time. Dillard\u2019s also could not process the request because Birdyshaw sought a transfer in the future, and there was no way for Dillard\u2019s to know if an open position would be available at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The district court granted Dillard\u2019s summary judgment motions on all of Birdy-shaw\u2019s claims. With respect to Birdy-shaw\u2019s retaliation claims, the district court first found that the temporary suspension of Birdyshaw\u2019s salary benefits was not an adverse employment action because Dillard\u2019s rescinded its decision and retroactively paid her the salary she lost. With respect to Dillard\u2019s failure to grant her a transfer, the district court found that this did constitute an adverse employment action because Dillard\u2019s effectively required her to work with Moretti \u2014 the man who had allegedly harassed her \u2014 in order to avoid being terminated. However, the district court found that Birdyshaw could not show that Dillard\u2019s reasons for denying the transfer were pretextual. Specifically, the court explained that the fact that Dillard\u2019s transfer policy was unwritten, without more, was insufficient to show pretext. The court also found that it was undisputed that Birdyshaw was terminated because she exceeded her allotted leave of absence and, therefore, Dillard\u2019s reason for terminating her was legitimate. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Rioux v. City of Atlanta, Ga., </em>520 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cSummary judgment is rendered \u2018if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). \u201cIn making this assessment, the Court must view all the evidence and all factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and must resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-mov-ant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">On appeal, Birdyshaw challenges the grant of summary judgment on her two retaliation claims, each consisting of a distinct alleged adverse employment action. First, Birdyshaw alleged that Dillard\u2019s retaliated against her by temporarily suspending her salary benefits while she was on medical leave. Second, Birdyshaw alleged that Dillard\u2019s retaliated against her by not granting her request for a transfer, thus leading to her termination. We address these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">A. <em>The Temporary Suspension of Bir-dyshaw\u2019s Salary Benef\u00edts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">\u201cA <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under Title VII requires the plaintiff to show that: (1) she engaged in an activity protected under Title VII; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">In this case, the district court concluded that Birdyshaw\u2019s retaliation claim in connection with the temporary suspension of her salary failed because she could not show an adverse employment action. However, the district court\u2019s conclusion\u2014 that the suspension of Birdyshaw\u2019s salary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>was not an adverse employment action because Dillard\u2019s subsequently reinstated it \u2014 is suspect in light of our recent decision in <em>Crawford. See id. </em>at 972 (\u201c[W]e too decline to hold as a matter of law that a retroactive pay raise can \u2018undo\u2019 the harm caused by a discriminatory or retaliatory act because such a decision could permit employers to elude liability for conduct that otherwise is actionable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Therefore, as discussed below, we affirm on an alternative ground, namely that Bir-dyshaw was not engaged in any protected activity before the suspension of her salary. While Dillard\u2019s did not raise this argument in the district court, we may affirm on any ground that is supported by the record, even where a party fails to raise an argument below. <em>See American United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 1043, 1059 (11th Cir.) (\u201c[W]e may, nevertheless, affirm a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for any reason, regardless of whether it was raised below.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 491, 169 L.Ed.2d 339 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">1. Birdyshaw\u2019s EEOC Charge</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Title VII's Participation Clause prohibits retaliation where an employee \u201chas made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Filing an EEOC charge is statutorily protected activity in this regard. <em>See, e.g., Hairston v. Gainesville Sun Pub. Co., </em>9 F.3d 913, 920 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">In this case, it is undisputed that Dillard\u2019s suspended Birdyshaw\u2019s salary on January 17, 2001, nearly one month before Birdyshaw filed her first EEOC charge on February 15, 2001. Thus, there could not have been any causal connection between the suspension of Birdyshaw\u2019s salary and her subsequent EEOC charge. <em>See Griffin v. GTE Florida, Inc., </em>182 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cAt a minimum, Griffin must show that the adverse act followed the protected conduct.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">2. Birdyshaw\u2019s Internal Complaints</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">Title VU\u2019s Opposition Clause prohibits retaliation where an employee \u201chas opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). In this respect, Birdyshaw suggests that her verbal complaint to Davis, and her November 26, 2000, letter to management constituted protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">With respect to Birdyshaw\u2019s complaint to Davis, and according to Birdyshaw\u2019s deposition testimony, she merely asked Davis whether Moretti was trying to \u201cclean house\u201d by getting rid of all of the \u201colder managers.\u201d Even if this inquiry constituted a form of \u201copposition,\u201d Birdy-shaw was not opposing any employment practice made unlawful under Title VII because she referred only to age, which is not a protected ground under the statute. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a) (prohibiting discrimination because of an employee\u2019s \u201crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin\u201d). In this respect, it is worth reiterating that Birdyshaw has abandoned on appeal any claim under the ADEA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(d) (providing a cause of action for retaliation under the ADEA).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-14\">In Birdyshaw\u2019s November 26, 2000, letter to Dillard\u2019s management, she described the November 25 incident with Moretti. Significantly, however, nowhere in the letter did she accuse Moretti of discriminating against her on account of a protected ground. In <em>Coutu v. Martin County Bd. of County Com\u2019rs, </em>we held that an employee\u2019s internal grievance \u201cdid not constitute statutorily protected activity\u201d because \u201c[ujnfair treatment, absent discrimination based on race, sex, or national origin, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>not </em>an unlawful employment practice under Title VII.\u201d 47 F.3d 1068, 1074 (11th Cir.1995). In this case, Birdyshaw\u2019s letter simply described Moretti\u2019s harsh treatment of Birdyshaw in connection with a work-related dispute; it did not allege that Moretti was discriminating against her on account of a protected ground. Indeed, Birdyshaw acknowledged at her deposition that the letter did not inform Dillard\u2019s that Moretti was engaged in gender discrimination. <em>See Sitar v. Indiana Dept. of Transp., </em>344 F.3d 720, 727-28 (7th Cir. 2003) (\u201cSitar conceded that she never told Pedigo that sex discrimination was her real problem. That is enough to doom her claim of a retaliatory transfer.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Birdyshaw points out that Willey, in his response to her letter, characterized her complaint as one alleging a \u201chostile and harassing work environment.\u201d However, the substance of Willey\u2019s response focused entirely on the merits of the work-related dispute between Birdyshaw and Moretti. Contrary to Birdyshaw\u2019s contention, nowhere in Willey\u2019s response did he mention any allegation of gender discrimination, as such an allegation was not contained in Birdyshaw\u2019s letter. Thus, Willey\u2019s response confirms that, under <em>Coutu, </em>Birdy-shaw\u2019s letter was not a form of statutorily protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In sum, Birdyshaw was not engaged in any statutorily protected activity before Dillard\u2019s temporarily suspended her salary. Thus, Birdyshaw has not made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, and we affirm the grant of summary judgment on Birdyshaw\u2019s first retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">B. <em>Birdyshaw\u2019s Transfer Request</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The district court first found that Birdyshaw established a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation in connection with her transfer request and termination. However, we do not address this finding because, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Birdyshaw has made out a <em>prima facie </em>case, she is still not entitled to relief because, as discussed below and as discussed by the district court, she cannot show that one of Dillard\u2019s proffered reasons was pretextual. <em>See Rojas v. Florida, </em>285 F.3d 1339, 1342 (11th Cir.2002) (assuming, without deciding, that the plaintiff could establish a <em>prima facie </em>case because she could not show pretext).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Assuming that Birdyshaw has established her <em>prima facie </em>case, and because the parties agree that her retaliation claim relies on circumstantial evidence, \u201cthe burden shifts to the employer to \u2018articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u2019 for the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>529 F.3d at 976 (quoting <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)). \u201cIf the employer offers such legitimate reasons for the employment action, the plaintiff must then demonstrate that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is a pretext for retaliation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">At the summary judgment stage, Dillard\u2019s gave two reasons why it did not grant Birdyshaw a transfer. <em>See Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1030 n. 19 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201c[W]e take the reason proffered by the employer at the time of summary judgment, the reason presented to the district court, and examine it.\u201d). First, Dillard\u2019s explained that Birdyshaw was ineligible for a transfer because, as a matter of company policy, it did not transfer inactive employees; and second, Dillard\u2019s explained that it did not grant her request because she asked to be transferred only after she was released to work by her doctor, but her doctor did not release her until after she was terminated. By articulating these legitimate and nondiscriminatory reasons for failing to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Birdyshaw a transfer, Dillard\u2019s has met its burden of production. <em>See Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir.2004) (describing the employer\u2019s burden in this respect as one of production, not persuasion).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Because Dillard\u2019s articulated legitimate, nondiseriminatory reasons for not granting Birdyshaw a transfer, the burden shifts to Birdyshaw to demonstrate that these reasons were a pretext for discrimination. <em>Crawford, </em>529 F.3d at 976. \u201cA reason is not [a] pretext for discrimination unless it is shown both that the reason was false, <em>and </em>that discrimination was the real reason.\u201d <em>Brooks v. County Com\u2019n of Jefferson County, Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). A plaintiff\u2019s evidence of pretext \u201cmust reveal such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its actions that a reasonable fact-finder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Vessels v. Atlanta Independent School System, </em>408 F.3d 763, 771 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). \u201cProvided that the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, an employee must meet that reason head on and rebut it----\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The district court in this case only addressed Dillard\u2019s first proffered reason and found that Birdyshaw could not show that Dillard\u2019s unwritten transfer policy was a pretext for discrimination. We do not address this finding, however, because the record more clearly establishes that Birdyshaw has not met her burden to show pretext with respect to Dillard\u2019s second reason, namely, that her transfer request was conditioned on her being released to work and she was never so released. <em>See Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1037 (\u201cIn order to avoid summary judgment, a plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that <em>each </em>of the employer\u2019s proffered nondiseriminatory reasons is pretextual.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Birdyshaw requested a transfer on three occasions, and each time she requested that the transfer take effect when her doctor released her to return to work. On March 16, 2001, she requested a transfer \u201cto be effective when my doctor releases me to return to work....\u201d On September 26, 2001, she renewed her request for a transfer \u201cwhen the doctor says I may return to work.\u201d And on October 19, 2001, she requested that Dillard\u2019s respond to her \u201cprevious request that when I am able to return to work, that I be transferred to a different division.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">These requests make clear that Birdy-shaw conditioned her transfer request upon her doctor releasing her to return to work. However, Dillard\u2019s is correct that Birdyshaw was placed on uninterrupted medical leave from November 2000 through the date that she was terminated one year later. Because Birdyshaw never fulfilled her own pre-condition, Dillard\u2019s had no occasion to rule on her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Birdyshaw emphasizes that Squires took no action on her transfer request and did not check to see whether she had been released to work. This argument does not undermine Dillard\u2019s proffered reason because, while Squires testified that he took no action on the request, he explained that he did so because he knew that Birdyshaw was on leave at the time. Furthermore, the transfer request itself made clear that her doctor was prohibiting her from returning to work at that time. Thus, Squires\u2019 failure to act on the initial request was grounded in Birdyshaw\u2019s own condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">In asserting that Dillard\u2019s knew that she would be able to return to work shortly after her making her initial transfer re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>quest, Birdyshaw also appears to attack Dillard\u2019s proffered reason on the ground that Dillard\u2019s could have immediately granted her a transfer, but allowed it to take effect prospectively when her doctor released her. While Dillard\u2019s could have theoretically granted her request in this manner, \u201ca plaintiff is not allowed to ... substitute [her] business judgment for that of the employer.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030; <em>see also Alexander v. Fulton County, Ga., </em>207 F.3d 1303, 1341 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201c[I]t is not the court\u2019s role to second-guess the wisdom of an employer\u2019s decisions as long as the decisions are not racially motivated.\u201d). In any event, we conclude that Dillard\u2019s decision to wait until Birdyshaw was released before granting her a transfer was reasonable under the circumstances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Finally, and while not specifically directed at Dillard\u2019s proffered reason above, Bir-dyshaw contends that by not granting her a transfer while on medical leave, Dillard\u2019s intentionally created a situation that effectively prevented her from returning to work. The argument is that Dillard\u2019s knew that she was medically unable to return to work for Moretti but, at the same time, would also not grant her a transfer while she was on leave. Thus, because she could not return to work for Moretti or obtain a transfer while on leave, Dillard\u2019s prevented her from returning to work, thus creating grounds for automatic termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The fatal flaw in this argument is that nothing in the record indicates that Dillard\u2019s knew or should have known that Birdyshaw was capable of returning to work at a different location. Despite Bir-dyshaw\u2019s argument to the contrary, none of the doctors\u2019 notes granting and extending her medical leave provided that she was able to work for a manager other than Moretti; rather, they all indicated that she was completely unable to work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Furthermore, despite Birdyshaw\u2019s numerous communications with Dillard\u2019s, she never once informed it that she could return to work at another location. The only time that Birdyshaw arguably did so was in her initial transfer request, when she stated that her doctor recommended that she not return to work for Moretti. However, this statement did not explain that she was medically capable of working elsewhere. Indeed, any such an interpretation would have conflicted with the conditional nature of the transfer request, as she would have requested an immediate transfer if working for Moretti was the only reason that she could not return to work. Thus, because Dillard\u2019s had no reason to believe that Birdyshaw was capable of returning to work for a different manager, there is nothing to suggest that, by failing to rule on her transfer request while she was on leave, Dillard\u2019s intentionally created the Catch-22 situation that Birdyshaw describes.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Thus, Birdyshaw has not shown that Dillard\u2019s proffered reason for failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>grant her a transfer was a pretext for retaliation. Accordingly, we affirm the grant of summary judgment on Birdy-shaw\u2019s second retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In sum, we conclude that the district court correctly granted summary judgment in Dillard\u2019s favor on Birdyshaw\u2019s two retaliation claims. First, Birdyshaw was not engaged in any statutorily protected activity before the temporary suspension of her salary benefits. Second, Birdyshaw has not shown pretext with respect to Bir-dyshaw\u2019s proffered reason for not granting her a transfer request. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-9\">. On appeal, Birdyshaw has abandoned any argument in connection with the other claims alleged in her complaint. <em>See Rioux v. City of Atlanta, Ga., </em>520 F.3d 1269, 1274 n. 4 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-6\">. We also note that, even if Dillard\u2019s had granted her a prospective transfer, a doctor did not ultimately release Birdyshaw before her termination and, therefore, she still would not have been able to return to work. <em>See Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1023 (\"The mere existence of some factual dispute will not defeat summary judgment unless that factual dispute is material to an issue affecting the outcome of the case.\u201d) (quotation omitted)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b463-11\">. The only documents in the record suggesting that Birdyshaw was employable for someone other than Moretti are two letters written to Birdyshaw by her insurance company. The first letter was dated one week before her termination, but there is no indication that this letter was ever sent to Dillard's. The second letter was dated January 2002 and, therefore, could not have been transmitted to Dillard's before Birdyshaw\u2019s termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
