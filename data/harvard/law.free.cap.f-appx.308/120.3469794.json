R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b145-12\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">Allen Wisdom appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing for failure to state a claim his federal claims brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985(2), 1985(3), 1986, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-64 (the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d)). Wisdom also appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of his various state law claims. We review de novo. <em>Decker v. Advantage Fund Ltd., </em>362 F.3d 593, 595-96 (9th Cir.2004). We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-16\">Construing Wisdom\u2019s pro se complaint liberally,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he has failed to state a federal claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6); <em>Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dept., </em>901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir.1990). In his \u00a7 1983 claim, Wisdom, in effect, asserts that his attorneys and the opposing parties who prevailed in state court proceedings conspired with the judge against him, as shown by the success of the opposing parties in the litigation. But mere victory or conclusory allegations that a judge conspired with law firms or individuals does not show conspiracy. <em>See Schucker v. Rockwood, </em>846 F.2d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir.1988); <em>see also Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (a complaint must contain \u201cmore than labels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d). When given an opportunity to amend his complaint, Wisdom chose not to. Dismissal was proper. <em>See Edwards v. Marin Park, Inc., </em>356 F.3d 1058, 1064-65 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-17\">For similar reasons, the district court did not err in dismissing Wisdom\u2019s conclusory conspiracy claims under section 1985. <em>See Karim-Panahi v. Los Angeles Police Dept., </em>839 F.2d 621, 626 (9th Cir.1988). Nor did the district court err in dismissing his section 1986 claim. <em>Id. </em>Likewise, Wisdom fails to state a violation under RICO. <em>See Baumer v. Pachl, 8 </em>F.3d 1341, 1343-47 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>We also conclude that the district court did not err in declining to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over Wisdom\u2019s related state law claims. Although it could exercise supplemental jurisdiction,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it was not required to do so once it dismissed the federal claims. <em>McKinney v. Carey, </em>311 F.3d 1198, 1201 n. 2 (9th Cir.2002); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The district court erred, however, in concluding that, to a legal certainty, Wisdom\u2019s complaint failed to allege an amount in controversy sufficient to sustain the district court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction. <em>Crum v. Circus Circus Enter., </em>231 F.3d 1129, 1131 (9th Cir.2000) (when a complaint sufficiently alleges the jurisdictional amount in controversy, the requirement is presumptively satisfied, unless it appears to a \u201clegal certainty\u201d that the plaintiff cannot recover that amount). There is no dispute that Wisdom\u2019s complaint itself states that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. In assessing whether the amount claimed was controlling, the district court added up the actual damage figures specified throughout Wisdom\u2019s complaint, and found that Wisdom claimed damages in the amount of $43,778.65. In so doing, the district court overlooked Wisdom\u2019s additional claims for punitive and consequential damages. We cannot conclude that the amount pled was deficient to a legal certainty. If on remand, the district court determines it has diversity jurisdiction, it should proceed to evaluate Wisdom\u2019s state law claims on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED for further proceedings.
