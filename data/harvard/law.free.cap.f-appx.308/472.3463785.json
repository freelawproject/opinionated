Nelson denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Rong Lin Chen, </em>No. A 77 000 183 (B.I.A. Jan. 25, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 77 000 183 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 22, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-19\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>Passi v. Mukasey, </em>535 F.3d 98, 101 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-20\">Because Chen fails to raise in his brief before this Court any challenge to the denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal, we deem any such claims waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Before this Court, Chen argues that the IJ applied the improper standard in denying CAT relief because the IJ relied, in part, on his failure to establish past persecution and the discretionary determination that he did not have \u201cclean hands.\u201d Chen\u2019s argument misconstrues the IJ\u2019s decision. The IJ\u2019s findings regarding past persecution and \u201cclean hands\u201d were plainly made to support the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum. The IJ separately evaluated Chen\u2019s application for CAT re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>lief, relying on neither of those findings as support for her denial of that relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Additionally, Chen argues that the record does not contain \u201ca remote reference\u201d supporting the IJ\u2019s findings that: (1) the background evidence indicated that China\u2019s official policy towards individuals who departed China illegally is to treat them as victims and not punish them when they are returned; and (2) such individuals are detained upon return to China only for health and identity checks. Contrary to Chen\u2019s argument, the INS Resource Information Center report in the record contains direct support for the IJ\u2019s findings. Accordingly, the IJ did not err in finding that Chen failed to establish that he would more likely than not be tortured where he presented only general evidence indicating that illegal emigrants returned to China are subject to administrative detention and failed to submit any particularized evidence that he would likely be tortured. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir.2005) (finding insufficient to support a CAT claim State Department reports and letters from family members indicating that Chinese returnees may be detained and that some Chinese prisoners have been tortured without particularized evidence indicating that the petitioner would be tortured); <em>see also Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-14 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
