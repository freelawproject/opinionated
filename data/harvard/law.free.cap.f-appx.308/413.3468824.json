He now appeals his sentence, challenging only the fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) concluded that, based on appellant\u2019s financial condition, the specifics of which it discussed, it did not appear that appellant would be able to pay a fine within the applicable range of the Sentencing Guidelines, which was $2,000 to $20,000. At sentencing, however, the district court imposed a fine of $2,000, ordering Macedo to make payments from any wages that he might earn in prison \u201cin accordance with the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 [\u201cBOP\u201d] financial program,\u201d and stating that the payment of any remaining portion of the fine upon his release from imprisonment would become a condition of supervision to be paid at a monthly rate of $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Appellant contends that the district court erred by failing to consider his lack of income, his earning capacity, which was non-existent in the United States and would be \u201cgreatly diminished\u201d upon his deportation to Mexico, the fact that he had no assets other than a house in foreclosure and a car needed for his family\u2019s transportation, and the burden the fine and monthly installments would impose on his six dependents, his wife and five children between the ages of two and eleven. He contends that the district court erred in finding that he, as an alien criminal, could participate in the BOP\u2019s fiscal responsibility program. He asserts that he met his burden of demonstrating the inability to pay a fine, and, as he argued in the district court, he could not work in the prison industry, and that providing for six dependents in Mexico \u201cwould be all he could handle financially.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">We review a district court\u2019s decision that the defendant is able to pay a fine for clear error. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>541 F.3d 1250, 1255 (11th Cir.2008). The defendant bears the burden of proving inability to pay. <em>Id. </em>In determining whether to impose a fine, the district court considers, in relevant part, and in addition to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s income, earning capacity, and financial resources; ... the burden that the fine will impose upon the defendant, any person who is financially dependent on the defendant, or any other person (including a government) that would be responsible for the welfare of any person financially dependent on the defendant, relative to the burden that alternative punishments would impose.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">The Guidelines require the district court to \u201cimpose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(a). If the court concludes that a fine is appropriate, it should consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the following in determining the amount of the fine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">(1) the need for the combined sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense (including the harm or loss to the victim and the gain to the defendant), to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment and to afford adequate deterrence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-10\">(2) any evidence presented as to the defendant\u2019s ability to pay the fine (including the ability to pay over a period of time) in light of his earning capacity and financial resources;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">(3) the burden that the fine places on the defendant and his dependents relative to alternative punishments; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-12\">(8) any other pertinent equitable considerations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-13\">The amount of the fine should always be sufficient to ensure that the fine, taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>together with other sanctions imposed, is punitive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(d). The court may impose a lesser f\u00edne or waive a fine if the defendant establishes \u201cthat (1) he is not able and, even with the use of a reasonable schedule, is not likely to become able to pay all or part of the fine required by [application of \u00a7 5E1.2], or (2) imposition of a fine would unduly burden the defendant\u2019s dependents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5E1.2(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">We do \u201cnot require the sentencing court to make specific findings of fact with respect to the Sentencing Guideline factors as long as the record reflects the district court\u2019s consideration of the pertinent factors prior to imposing the fine.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>541 F.3d at 1256 (quotation omitted). \u201cIf the record does not reflect the district court\u2019s reasoned basis for imposing a fine, we must remand the case so that the necessary factual findings can be made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). In <em>Gonzalez, </em>we vacated the court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case for resentencing, where the PSI provided detailed financial analysis of the defendant\u2019s assets and concluded that the defendant lacked the ability to pay a fine in addition to mandatory restitution, the court gave no explanation for an above-guideline fine that it imposed, and the defendant objected to the fine. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Here, because the district court\u2019s bases for finding appellant able to pay a fine and for setting the fine rate were unclear, inconsistent, and inadequate, we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
