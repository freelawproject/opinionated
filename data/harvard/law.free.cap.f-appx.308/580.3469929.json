Because the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">In August 2004, Gibson filed a complaint, which he later amended, under the Federal Torts Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), alleging that Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) staff lost or destroyed various items of his personal property while he was incarcerated at FCI-McKean. The amended complaint named as defendants the United States of America and Henry J. Sadowski, Northeast Regional Counsel of the BOP. Gibson sought $237.52 in monetary damages, plus $20,000 in compensatory damages for \u201ccruel and unusual punishment.\u201d The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment. The matter was referred to a Magistrate Judge, who recommended granting the defendants\u2019 motion. The United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania ultimately agreed, holding (1) that Gibson had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to certain claims; (2) that it lacked jurisdiction over Gibson\u2019s request for compensatory damages because it exceeded the amount of the claim presented to the BOP; (3) that Defendant Sadowski was not a proper party under the FTCA; and (4) that the BOP officers who allegedly lost his property qualify as \u201cother law enforcement officers\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c), thereby exempting them from the FTCA\u2019s general waiver of sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gibson appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">Appellate jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we may affirm on any basis supported by the record. <em>See Fairview Township v. EPA, </em>773 F.2d 517, 525 n. 15 (3d Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-16\">The FTCA waives the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity for claims arising out of torts committed by federal employees \u201cunder circumstances where ... a private person ... would be liable\u201d under applicable state tort law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). But the FTCA exempts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>from this waiver certain claims, including \u201c[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\u201d \u00a7 2680(c). When the District Court considered Gibson\u2019s claims, there was disagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to whether this provision applied only to officers performing customs or excise functions, or if it applied to all law enforcement officers. <em>See ABC v. DEF, </em>500 F.3d 103, 106 (2d Cir.2007) (noting split of authority on the issue). Since then, however, the United States Supreme Court has held that claims against corrections officers who are accused of mishandling an inmate\u2019s property fall with the FTCA\u2019s exception to the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign immunity. <em>See Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 831, 840-41, 169 L.Ed.2d 680 (2008). Therefore, because Gibson\u2019s claims are barred by the exception to tort liability found in \u00a7 2680(c), the District Court properly dismissed the lawsuit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See id.; see also Kosak v. United States, </em>465 U.S. 848, 854, 104 S.Ct. 1519, 79 L.Ed.2d 860 (1984) (holding that phrase \u201cany claim arising in respect of\u2019 the detention of goods means any claim \u201carising out of\u2019 the detention of goods, and includes a claim resulting from negligent handling or storage of detained property.).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">We will summarily affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-13\">. Initially, the District Court did not adopt the Magistrate Judge's broad interpretation of the phrase \"other law enforcement officers.\u201d The United States filed a motion for reconsideration, which the District Court granted, essentially holding that a 2000 amendment to \u00a7 2680(c) demonstrated that it applied to BOP corrections officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
