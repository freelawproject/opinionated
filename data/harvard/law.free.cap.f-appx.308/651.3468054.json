We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-17\">Because we write solely for the benefit of the parties, we will briefly summarize only the essential facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-18\">The Vorums owned Vorum\u2019s Stables, LLC, a company that operates a horse-racing track in Pennsylvania\u2019s Canton Township. In February 2002, they received authorization from the relevant state and local authorities to hold a one-day charity race on the property. However, they angered Emil Stanish and Chad Smith, two members of the Canton BOS, who believed that certain structures built on the property specifically for that race\u2014 namely, a judges\u2019 tower and a photo-finish booth \u2014 violated Canton zoning laws. In July 2002, Stanish sent an e-mail to Smith and Township Manager Samuel Stockton complaining about Daniel Vorum and calling him a \u201csnake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-19\">But the Vorums decided to enlarge, rather than shrink, the scope of their horse-racing activities. In particular, they sought a license, to conduct horse-racing and parimutual wagering at their racetrack on a regular basis. Canton zoning law, however, prohibited these activities in the part of the township where the property was located. So, in September 2002, the Vorums challenged the local zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>ordinance and petitioned the BOS for permission to use their property for regular horse-racing. The BOS sat as a three-member panel composed of Stanish, Smith, and George Vitteck, and convened several public hearings before beginning its deliberations. In November 2002, while the Vorums\u2019 petition was pending, Smith sent an e-mail to Stanish and Stockton stating that they could thwart the Vorums\u2019 plans if they planted historical artifacts, like arrowheads, throughout the Vorums\u2019 property-</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In April 2003, the BOS issued a unanimous opinion denying the Vorums\u2019 request. Because he owned land adjoining the Vorums\u2019 property, Stanish did not participate in the decision or cast a vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The plaintiffs filed a complaint against Canton Township and against Smith and Stanish personally under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the defendants denied them substantive due process because the e-mails revealed that BOS members made their decisions based upon personal bias. The District Court granted summary judgment against the plaintiffs, and they appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(a), and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Lawrence v. City of Philadelphia, </em>527 F.3d 299, 310 (3d Cir.2008). That is, we will view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Vorums and draw all justifiable, reasonable inferences in their favor. <em>Id. </em>We will affirm only if there is no genuine issue of material fact with respect to one or more elements of the Vorums\u2019 claim and if the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.; </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">Federal courts do not sit as super zoning tribunals, passing on local land-use decisions that have already been subjected to state-court appellate review. <em>United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. v. Twp. of Warrington, </em>316 F.3d 392, 402 (3d Cir. 2003). Accordingly, in this case, we are called upon not to determine whether the BOS\u2019s decision was wise or correct, but to examine whether the municipality violated plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. A zoning decision does not implicate the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s substantive due process protections merely because the decisionmaker had an improper motive. <em>Id. </em>Rather, the zoning body\u2019s conduct must \u201cshock the conscience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401 (adopting test announced in <em>County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 846, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">This standard is a demanding one: only \u201cthe most egregious official conduct\u201d qualifies. <em>Lewis, </em>523 U.S. at 846, 118 S.Ct. 1708. Particularly relevant for the purposes of this appeal, a state actor\u2019s decision is not conscience-shocking if it is related to a legitimate governmental objective. Har<em>len Assocs. v. Inc. Vill. of Mineola, </em>273 F.3d 494, 505 (2d Cir.2001) (holding that zoning board\u2019s \u201clegitimate interests which could rationally be furthered through the denial of [plaintiffs] application\u201d for a permit precluded substantive due process violation); <em>see Lewis, </em>523 U.S. at 849, 118 S.Ct. 1708 (\u201c[Conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest is the sort of official action most likely to rise to the conscience-shocking level.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">Here, no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the BOS\u2019s decision to deny the Vorums\u2019 request was related to a legitimate governmental objective. The Vorums never contested the BOS\u2019s factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>finding that use of their property as a regular racetrack would unacceptably interfere with traffic flow at several nearby intersections. <em>See </em>Appendix (App.) 265 (BOS Findings of Fact H1\u00cd 60-62), 814 (Notice of Land Use Appeal H 9(m)) (indicating that those findings are not contested). Further, the Vorums never contested the BOS\u2019s legal conclusion that, regardless of the validity of the local zoning ordinance, the state municipal planning code allowed the BOS to consider traffic-flow concerns in deciding whether to grant a zoning request. <em>See </em>App. 273 (BOS Conclusions of Law 1137(a)) (citing 53 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 10609.1), 314 (Notice of Land Use Appeal If 9(n)) (indicating that conclusion is not contested). That is, the Vorums do not appear to contest that the BOS\u2019s decision may be justified by reference to settled principles of state and local law.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Although they do not cast their argument this way, the Vorums appear to contend that, notwithstanding this legitimate justification, the BOS in fact denied the request in order to vindicate its members\u2019 personal grudges. That is, notwithstanding the legitimate governmental objective, the BOS acted out of an improper motive in reaching its decision. However, in <em>United, Artists, </em>we adopted the \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d test for land-use decisions and expressly rejected the less-demanding \u201cimproper motive\u201d test. <em>See </em>316 F.3d at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Because there is no genuine issue of material fact, and because the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-7\">. We recognize that the District Court reached its conclusion on somewhat different grounds. Namely, without determining whether the BOS had a legitimate land-use reason for denying the Vorums' application, the District Court held that, while the \"emails [sent among BOS members] fall short of the standard of excellence in public service, to say the least,\u201d they simply do not shock the conscience. App. 17. We agree with the District Court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
