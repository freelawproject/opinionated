He argues that the district court erred by denying an acceptance of responsibility reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\">As Mandujano did not object on this basis in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). Mandujano must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 962, - L.Ed.2d-(2009). We will only correct such an error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-18\">Section 3El.l(a) provides for a two-level offense level decrease \u201c[i]f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d \u00a7 3El.l(a). An additional point is given if, among other things, the defendant assists the government and the government files a motion indicating that an additional point reduction is warranted. \u00a7 3El.l(b). When determining whether a defendant qualifies for the reduction, one consideration is whether the defendant truthfully admits or does not falsely deny any additional relevant conduct. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n.l(a). Except in \u201crare situations,\u201d the acceptance of responsibility reduction \u201cis not intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse.\u201d \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The district court conducted a jury trial at which the Government called witnesses and offered exhibits. The jury considered evidence regarding the offense elements of both indictment counts and returned a verdict regarding both counts. Mandujano has failed to establish that his case presents one of the \u201crare situations\u201d where a defendant who has put the government through its proof at trial may still qualify for the reduction. <em>See id. </em>Also, this court will defer to the district court\u2019s assessment that the reduction was not warranted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 5. Mandujano has not established error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b834-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
