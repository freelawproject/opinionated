He contends that his fear of future perse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>cution is reasonable based on an imputed political opinion that the Bolivarian Circles possess, believing he opposes Chavez. Further, he asserts the IJ applied a heightened standard in reviewing his application, thus violating <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). A passing reference to an issue in a brief is insufficient to properly raise that issue. <em>Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Although Avila-Reyes mentions in his \u201cstatement of the case\u201d that he lived in Colombia, and he generally argues the IJ erred in finding that he was not eligible for asylum, he does not explain how he suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of persecution in Colombia. Furthermore, Avila-Reyes does not sufficiently challenge the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s denial of relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c), because he mentions it in passing in his brief, but does not offer an argument on the issue. By not raising this issue in his initial brief, he has abandoned any argument that the BIA erred by denying the request for asylum from Colombia or CAT relief. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision when the BIA issues a separate decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that [the BIA] expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). \u201cInsofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). In this case, the BIA wrote a separate decision and adopted the IJ\u2019s opinion. Therefore, we review both decisions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">We review legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>and factual findings under the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir. 2005) (factual determinations); <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2001) (legal conclusions). Under the substantial evidence test, we should \u201caffirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286 (quotations and alteration omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and does not allow \u201cre-weigh[ing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (quotations omitted). To reverse factual findings, \u201cwe must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">An alien who arrives in, or is present in, the United States may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined in the INA as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">To establish asylum eligibility based on political opinion or any other protected ground, the alien must, with specific credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a political opinion or any other protected ground, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). \u201cThe testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Past persecution is established when the applicant shows that (1) he was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground. <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). We recognize that \u201c \u2018persecution\u2019 is an \u2018extreme concept,\u2019 requiring \u2018more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u2019 and that \u2018[m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (citation omitted). We have held menacing telephone calls and threats to the alien and family members do not rise to the level of past persecution that would compel reversal of an IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>Further, even though an attack may permit the conclusion that it was directed on account of the alien\u2019s political activity, if the evidence does not compel such a conclusion, then we will not reverse the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">An alien who has not shown past persecution may still be entitled to asylum or withholding of removal if he can demonstrate a future threat in his country to his life or freedom on a protected ground in his country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2). To establish a well-founded fear, an applicant must demonstrate that his fear of future persecution is \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1236. \u201cThe subjective component is generally satisfied by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. \u201c[T]he objective prong can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a \u2018good reason to fear future persecution.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Cardozar-Fonse-ca, </em>held that, in order to show a well-founded fear of persecution, a petitioner need not prove that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be persecuted in his country. <em>Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>107 S.Ct. at 1213. The Supreme Court noted that \u201cCongress did not intend to restrict eligibility for [asylum only] to those who could prove that it is more likely than not that they will be persecuted if deported.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1222.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that if he returned to his country, the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). \u201cAn alien bears the burden of demonstrating that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. Generally, when an alien fails to meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for establishing asylum eligibility, the alien cannot establish the higher burden for withholding of removal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">Avila-Reyes relied on the following to establish past persecution in Venezuela: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>(1) threats to him and his son; (2) an attempted attack on his son; (3) his office being vandalized; (4) an attack on him; and (5) the murder of a political activist. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s conclusion that Avila-Reyes failed to meet his burden of proof for asylum from Venezuela. First, verbal harassment and intimidation do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Although the evidence may permit a conclusion that the 2002 attack on him was directed on account of his political activity, it does not compel such a conclusion sufficient to overturn the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions, as his assailants were never identified. <em>See id. </em>Additionally, there was no evidence connecting the political opinions of Avila-Reyes and Quidigwa (an acquaintance who was murdered allegedly for his political activities), as Avila-Reyes admitted that he was not a political \u201cactivist,\u201d and the record does not indicate that Qui-digwa was a member of the Democratic Action Party.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Additionally, even if Avila-Reyes subjectively feared returning to Venezuela, his fear was not objectively reasonable based on the record evidence because he did not show a \u201cgood reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232; <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. Avila-Reyes returned to Venezuela from the United States in 2001 after receiving threatening telephone calls and his son being almost attacked. Nothing in the record indicates the Bolivarian Circles knew, or had any interest in, his political beliefs, except Avila-Reyes\u2019s own speculation. Thus, the evidence does not compel the finding that Avila-Reyes suffered past persecution on account of his political opinion or had a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">As to Avila-Reyes\u2019s argument the IJ violated <em>Cardoza-Fonseca </em>by applying a heightened standard in reviewing his asylum application, the record does not support that the BIA or IJ applied an incorrect standard in adjudicating Avila-Reyes\u2019s claim. Finally, because Avila-Reyes failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion or any other protected grounds to support his asylum claim, there are no grounds for reversing the determination that he is not entitled to withholding of removal under the INA. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Accordingly, we deny Avila-Reyes\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-16\">. Because Avila-Reyes listed his wife, Flor Maria Anzola, as a derivative applicant, and the facts supporting her claim to asylum are the same as his, this opinion refers to only Avila-Reyes with respect to the asylum claim. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(3)(A); see <em>also Delgado </em>v. <em>United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 862 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that, unlike the asylum statute, the withholding of removal statute does not create derivative rights for the spouse of a petitioner).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
