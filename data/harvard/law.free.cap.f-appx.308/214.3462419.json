We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">Franklin contends that the district court procedurally erred by failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and his mitigation arguments. The record, however, establishes that the district court considered both, and therefore Franklin\u2019s procedural argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. Perez-Perez, </em>512 F.3d 514, 516 (9th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 992 (9th Cir.2008) (noting that a sentencing court need not \u201ctick off each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to show that it has considered them\u201d); <em>United States v. Daniels, </em>541 F.3d 915, 922 (9th Cir.2008) (no lengthy explanation for sentence required where record indicates sentencing judge considered the evidence and arguments).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">The 252 month sentence was the lowest possible within-Guideline sentence available to the district court, and in light of Franklin\u2019s criminal history, the sentence was reasonable and not an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 994 (noting that a within-Guideline sentence will usually be reasonable). The district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Franklin\u2019s argument that he be sentenced as if he was not a \u201ccareer offender.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 (Nov.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b239-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
