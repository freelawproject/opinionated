Defonzo, denying her application for relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>In re Yunwei Wang, </em>No. A98 350 537 (B.I.A. Dec. 26, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 350 537 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 30, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-22\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Mei Chai Ye v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>489 F.3d 517, 523 (2d Cir.2007). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law, including what quantum of evidence will suffice to discharge an applicant\u2019s burden of proof. <em>See, e.g., Islami v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 396 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision that Wang failed to meet her burden of establishing eligibility for CAT relief. To meet the burden of proof, Wang must present particularized evidence that suggests that, if repatriated, she will \u201cmore likely than not be subjected to torture.\u201d <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 157-158 (2d Cir. 2005). Here, the agency found that \u201c[t]he record contains insufficient evidence to demonstrate that Chinese authorities routinely torture people who illegally departed China ...\u201d Indeed, the record indicated that some repatriates are subject only to fines or temporary detention until travel arrangements can be made for the emigrant to return home. Wang argues that the background evidence in the record demonstrates that it is more likely than not that she will be tortured by Chinese government officials on account of her illegal departure from that country. We have held that an applicant cannot demonstrate that she is more likely than not to be tortured \u201cbased solely on the fact that [she] is part of the large class of persons who have illegally departed China\u201d and on generalized evidence indicating that torture occurs in Chinese prisons. <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Pierre v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 109, 118-19 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that, beyond evidence of inhumane prison conditions, a CAT claimant must provide some evidence that the authorities act with the specific intent to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering on those detained). Here, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Wang\u2019s CAT claim, as Wang provided no basis for the agency to conclude that she, or someone in her \u201cparticular alleged circumstances,\u201d faces an elevated risk of torture. <em>See Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 144 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-23\">. The IJ also denied Wang\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal. However, Wang has abandoned those claims. <em>See Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 n. 6 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
