He challenges the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines. We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>480 F.3d 309, 317 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-21\">The district court denied Amlee credit for acceptance of responsibility pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>suant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 because he was arrested and convicted for being a felon in possession of a firearm after he had already pleaded guilty in this case. Amlee argues that he nevertheless should have received this credit because he cooperated fully and in a timely manner. He maintains that he should not be penalized for that subsequent criminal behavior because, at the time of the offense, he was unaware that he was prohibited from possessing firearms and was selling the weapon at issue in an attempt to comply with his bond conditions in this case. The district court found Amlee\u2019s assertion of ignorance to be not credible and we will not disturb that determination. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 208-09 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2452, 171 L.Ed.2d 248 (2008). Moreover, the district court\u2019s denial of credit under \u00a7 3E1.1 was based on its finding that Am-lee\u2019s post-plea criminal conduct outweighed the evidence of his acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.3). Amlee has not shown error in this regard. <em>See Washington, </em>480 F.3d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Amlee contends that the district court erred in increasing his offense level by two pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 based on his obstruction of justice. Amlee does not suggest that \u00a7 3C1.1 is not applicable to his offense conduct. Instead, he argues that his cooperation with the Government should offset his obstructive behavior and that it was unfair to apply this adjustment when the Government had agreed to recommend a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. A reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility and an increase in offense level for obstruction of justice are not mutually exclusive. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4). Amlee\u2019s arguments in this regard are insufficient to show that the district court clearly erred in applying the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement. <em>See</em></p>\n<p id=\"AEl\"><em>United States v. Storm, </em>36 F.3d 1289, 1295 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Amlee contends that the district court erred in increasing his offense level by two pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.5(b)(4) because Amlee committed the instant offense for pecuniary gain. Among the items that Amlee stole were various antique weapons, ammunition, and military memorabilia. Amlee contends that he stole those items merely to add to his collection of such items and had no intention of selling them. However, Amlee had described his collection as an investment and conceded that he sometimes sold guns to upgrade his collection. The district court found Amlee to be not credible on this point. We afford that finding deference. <em>See Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d at 208-09. The district court did not clearly err in finding that Amlee committed the crime for pecuniary gain, and it properly applied \u00a7 2B1.5(b)(4). <em>See Washington, </em>480 F.3d at 317; <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Amlee contends that his offense level should not have been increased pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 based on the finding that the ammunition he stole was possessed in connection with another felony offense. He acknowledges our decision in <em>United States v. Armstead, </em>114 F.3d 504, 512 (5th Cir.1997), wherein we held that the enhancement was applicable where two men who broke into a pawn shop stole firearms. We determined that the \u201cother felony\u201d in <em>Armstead </em>was the state law crime of burglary committed when the two men broke into the pawn shop. <em>Id. </em>at 513. Amlee argues that <em>Armstead </em>is distinguishable because there is no evidence that he was ever charged with burglary in state court. This distinction, however, is irrelevant. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.l4(C)). Amlee has not shown error regarding the application of \u00a7 2K2.1. <em>See Washington, </em>480 F.3d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>Amlee contends that the district court erred in calculating the loss amount for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(D). He incorrectly asserts that he testified as an expert witness as to the values of the stolen items, and he complains that the district court accepted some, but not all, of the valuations he offered. We note that the district court reduced most of the valuations of the stolen items set forth in the presentence report and discounted some of them altogether. Nevertheless, the district court\u2019s final calculation did not sufficiently reduce the loss amount to lower Amlee\u2019s offense level. On appeal, Amlee speaks only to the district court\u2019s estimation of the value of the stolen goods. He does not take into account the district court\u2019s calculation of the costs to repair the buildings that Amlee broke into or to restore the antique items. The district court\u2019s estimation of the loss amount for purposes of \u00a7 2B1.1 was reasonable and does not constitute clear error. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(C)); <em>United States v. Messervey, </em>317 F.3d 457, 464 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Amlee argues that he was improperly penalized by the grouping of two of his convictions under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2. The probation officer explained that due to the effect of multi-count grouping under \u00a7 3D1.4, Amlee actually had a lower offense level when Counts One and Three were grouped for purposes of \u00a7 3D1.2. After much discussion, the district court adopted the probation officer\u2019s grouping calculations. Amlee\u2019s argument in this regard does not take into account the effect of the multiple-count-adjustment grouping required under \u00a7 3D1.4. Amlee has not shown that the district court improperly applied the grouping guidelines. <em>See Washington, </em>480 F.3d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Finally, Amlee contends that the district court erred in finding that his May 2006 arrest for being a felon in possession of a firearm and his October 2006 arrest for that same offense were to be counted separately. The district court determined that the offenses occurred on different dates and involved separate arrests, indictments, and different weapons. Amlee\u2019s disagreement with the finding that the offenses were separate is insufficient to show that the district court erred in calculating his criminal history points. <em>See Washington, </em>480 F.3d at 317; <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b887-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
