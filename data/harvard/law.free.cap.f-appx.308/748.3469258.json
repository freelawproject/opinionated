Stewart, Texas prisoner # 476867, appeals from the dismissal of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). Stewart alleges that the district court erred in concluding that he was ineligible for mandatory supervision because he is serving a sentence of life imprisonment. Stewart asserts that the plain language of the Texas statute governing mandatory supervision does not exclude life-sentenced inmates from early release, and he argues that the district court erred in concluding that it is mathematically impossible to determine a mandatory supervision release date for a life sentence; he specifically asserts that a life sentence is equal to 60 years of imprisonment under Texas state law. Stewart further contends that the defendants have improperly deprived him of his previously accrued good-time credits by failing to calculate the date upon which his good-time credits would render him eligible for release to mandatory supervision. Stewart also alleges that the defendants\u2019 determination that he is ineligible for release to mandatory supervision is a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The district court is directed to dismiss a complaint filed by a prisoner if the complaint is frivolous or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). Because the district court dismissed Stewart\u2019s claims pursuant to \u00a7 1915A, our review is de novo. <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). A complaint is frivolous \u201c \u2018if it lacks an arguable basis in fact or law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Talib v. Gilley, </em>138 F.3d 211, 213 (5th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">At the time of Stewart\u2019s offense, the Texas statute governing eligibility for release to mandatory supervision provided that an inmate not under sentence for death \u201cshall be released to mandatory supervision\u201d when the calendar time he has served plus any accrued good conduct time equal the maximum term to which he was sentenced.\u201d Tex.Crim. Proc.Code Ann. art. 42.12, \u00a7 15(c) (Vernon 1981). In <em>Ex Parte Franks, </em>71 S.W.3d 327, 327-28 (Tex.Crim. App.2001) the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) determined that the Texas mandatory supervision statute at issue in the present case does not permit a life-sentenced inmate to be eligible for release to mandatory supervision. The state court construed the plain language of the mandatory supervision statute and explained that \u201cit is mathematically impossible to determine a mandatory supervision release date on a life sentence because the calendar time served plus any accrued good conduct time will never add up to life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">In <em>Arnold v. Cockrell, </em>306 F.3d 277, 279 (5th Cir.2002), we held that a life-sentenced inmate is not eligible for release to mandatory supervision under the 1977 version of the Texas mandatory supervision statute. We determined that the TCCA\u2019s reasoning in <em>Franks </em>was determinative because the 1977 version of the mandatory supervision statute was substantively identical to the version of the law at issue in <em>Franks. See Arnold, </em>306 F.3d at 279. We particularly noted that it was not our function to review a state\u2019s interpretation of its own law, and we therefore deferred to the TCCA\u2019s reading of the statute. <em>Id. </em>Stewart\u2019s assertions concerning his eligibility for mandatory supervision therefore are foreclosed by our decision in <em>Arnold.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Stewart\u2019s contention that the defendants improperly deprived him of his previously accrued good-time credits is equally unavailing. As discussed above, this court has held that a life-sentenced inmate is not eligible for release to mandatory supervision. <em>See Arnold,, </em>306 F.3d at 279. Accordingly, in light of his ineligibility for early release, Stewart has not demonstrated that the defendants erred by failing to calculate the date upon which his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>good-time credits would render him eligible for release to mandatory supervision. <em>See id. </em>Furthermore, to the extent that Stewart argues that the defendants\u2019 actions were tantamount to a due process violation, he also has not shown that he is entitled to relief. Because Stewart is ineligible for early release under the Texas mandatory supervision scheme, he has no constitutionally protected interest in previously earned good-time credits. <em>See Teague v. Quarterman, </em>482 F.3d 769, 773-77 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Malchi v. Thaler, </em>211 F.3d 953, 956 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Finally, Stewart did not raise his Ex Post Facto claims in the district court. Thus, the arguments represent issues that Stewart is asserting for the first time on appeal. This court is prohibited from considering new theories of relief on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Stewart\u2019s appeal lacks an arguable basis in law or fact. Thus, it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. For purposes of the three-strikes provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), the district court\u2019s dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A counts as a strike, and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, Stewart is warned that if he accumulates three strikes he may not thereafter proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b772-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
