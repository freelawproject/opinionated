Conant filed this civil suit seeking, among other things, an injunction against enforcement of the cease and desist order. Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court entered judgment against Conant. Because the district court did not err in concluding that Conant was required by the Clean Water Act (Act) to obtain a permit before discharging dredge or fill materials into navigable waters, that the wetlands in question were \u201cnavigable waters\u201d as defined in the Act and federal regulations, and that none of the exceptions to the permit requirements apply in this case, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-10\">The order in question applies to only one of the nine fish ponds which Conant began to construct on his land in Alachua County, Florida, in 1980. The Corps determined that the northern end of the pond lies in a wetlands area of the Santa Fe River. The vegetation in this area included bald cypress, a species indigenous to wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-12\">Plaintiff places undue reliance on the phrase \u201cnavigable water,\u201d in section 404 of the Clean Water Act of 1977, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1344, without examining its definition in the federal regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-13\">The Act itself defines \u201cnavigable waters\u201d as \u201cthe waters of the United States.\u201d \u201c[T]he Act\u2019s definition of \u2018navigable waters\u2019 as \u2018the waters of the United States\u2019 makes it clear that the term \u2018navigable\u2019 as used in the Act is of limited import.\u201d <em>United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 455, 461, 88 L.Ed.2d 419 (1985). Although wetlands are not specifically mentioned in the Act itself, under the authority of the Act, the Corps has promulgated regulations defining \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d to include wetlands adjacent to tributaries to navigable waters. 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 323.2(a)(3) (1985). \u201cWetlands\u201d means \u201cthose areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.\u201d 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 323.2(c) (1985). \u201cWetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAdjacent\u201d means \u201cbordering, contiguous, or neighboring.\u201d 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 323.2(d) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-14\">The uncontradicted testimony before the district court indicated that the area in question was an \u201cadjacent wetland.\u201d The district court\u2019s finding to this effect was not clearly erroneous. One witness noted that the wetlands area trapped undesirable pollutants and sediments before they reached the open areas of the Santa Fe River. When the United States Supreme Court recently upheld the broad scope and remedial purposes of the Clean Water Act, the Court specifically noted that one reason wetlands are protected under the Act is because they \u201cserve to filter and purify water draining into adjacent bodies of water.\u201d <em>United States v. River</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number><em>side Bayview Homes, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 106 S.Ct. at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">The district court properly held that Mr. Conant did not qualify for any of the exceptions to the permit requirement. To fall within the exemption in 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1344(f)(1)(A), the activity \u201cmust be part of an established (i.e., on-going) farming, silviculture, or ranching operation____ Activities which bring an area into farming, silviculture, or ranching use are not part of an established operation.\u201d 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 323.4(a)(l)(ii) (1985). Because the activity here involved construction of a fish farming operation, it does not come within this exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">Similarly, the reach of the exception in 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1344(f)(1)(C) \u201cfor the purpose of construction or maintenance of farm or stock ponds\u201d is limited by section 1344(f)(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-7\">Any discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters incidental \u25a0to any activity having as its purpose bringing an area of the navigable waters into a use to which it was not previously subject, where the flow or circulation of navigable waters may be impaired or the reach of such waters be reduced, shall be required to have a permit under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">Conant\u2019s activity here involves a new. use which will affect the flow of circulation within the wetlands. The plain purpose of the statute and regulations is to allow people to build ponds in connection with a previously established farming operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">Although plaintiff argues that he is exempt from the requirement of a section 402 permit because the ponds produce less than 100,000 pounds of fish per year, this does not exempt him from the permit requirements of section 404 since the pond in question is located on wetlands. The district court opinion adequately points out the different purposes and enforcement procedures of sections 402 and 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-10\">The Corps\u2019 action in this case falls within its broad authority under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
