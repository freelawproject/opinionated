The state courts denied this claim on alternative grounds of procedural bar and of waiver by the defendant of the trial judge\u2019s presence. In these circumstances the federal habeas corpus must abide by the state court\u2019s decision on procedural default, even though waiver arguably goes to the merits. <em>Dobbert v. Strickland, </em>718 F.2d 1518, 1524 (11th Cir.1983). Petitioner cannot escape this procedural default ruling on the basis that, under <em>Reed v. Ross, </em>468 U.S. 1, 104 S.Ct. 2901, 82 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984), there was \u201ccause\u201d for failing to raise the issue of the absence of the judge on direct appeal because the grounds in support of the claim allegedly did not develop under state law until after this appeal. In fact Florida did rule after petitioner\u2019s conviction and appeal that a trial judge's presence is required during voir dire, <em>Peri v. State, </em>426 So.2d 1021 (Fla. 3d D.C.A.1983). But even if the claim was not procedurally barred the presence of the judge is waiveable, <em>Peri, </em>and the petitioner did waive it. His suggestion that his waiver was not knowing and voluntary has no factual support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-18\">We have examined the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court did not err in rejecting this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-19\">There is no merit to the contention that the evidence of premeditated murder was insufficient under <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). The trial judge commented that the evidence of premeditation was thin but that it was sufficient to be submitted to the jury. Under Florida law premeditation can be shown by circumstantial evidence and may be inferred from evidence such as the nature of the weapon used, the presence or absence of provocation, previous difficulties between the parties, the manner in which the homicide was committed, and the nature and manner of the wound inflicted. Sir<em>eci v. State, </em>399 So.2d 964, 967 (Fla.1981). Way did not deny killing the victim but rather relied upon alleged provocation consisting of alleged threats to his family by the victim and Way\u2019s statement that he considered the victim and the vie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>tim\u2019s family dangerous and that they carried firearms. The victim\u2019s family denied the threats. Way left his home, where the alleged threats were said to have been made, and armed with the rifle went to a store nearby where he found the victim. He threatened to kill the victim, then shot and killed him, exchanged gunfire with other people in the store, then fled to his home where he was arrested. Witnesses testified that the victim was not armed. This was sufficient evidence under <em>Jackson </em>to establish premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-4\">An evidentiary hearing was not required. The claim relating to absence of the judge was, as we have noted, either procedurally barred or waived, and the waiver was apparent on the face of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
