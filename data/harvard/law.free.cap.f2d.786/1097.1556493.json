He pleaded guilty, and the trial court accepted and entered an order \u201cwithholding adjudication.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-28\">After his indictment on the federal charge and before trial the state court vacated Cabrera\u2019s underlying felony conviction. At the federal trial Cabrera sought to introduce evidence of this vacation, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>the court sustained the government\u2019s objection to the evidence as immaterial since the state court conviction, and the order withholding adjudication, were in effect when Cabrera purchased the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">Whether one is convicted within the language of the Act is a question of federal law even if the underlying offense and punishment are defined by state law. <em>Dickerson v. New Banner Institute Inc., 460 U.S. 103, 103 </em>S.Ct. 986, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">The district court was correct. The cases make clear that one who is or has been a convicted felon must clear his status, if it is unclear, before buying a firearm. <em>Lewis v. U.S., </em>445 U.S. 55, 100 S.Ct. 915, 63 L.Ed.2d 198 (1980). <em>Lewis </em>was a conviction under 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a). <em>U.S. v. Davis, </em>773 F.2d 1180 (11th Cir.1985) applied <em>Lewis </em>to a conviction under \u00a7 922(h). More recently the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether expunging a state conviction can release a felon from the possibility of conviction under \u00a7 922(h)(1). <em>Dickerson v. New Banner Institute Inc., supra. </em>Although <em>Dickerson </em>had his conviction expunged pursuant to state law, the expunction did not alter the \u201chistorical fact of the conviction.\u201d And he had not followed available federal procedures for removing the federal firearms disability. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">What Cabrera did, and all he did, was, after indictment and arrest, secure an order of the state court vacating the predicate offense. This is not enough.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-7\">Cabrera contends that <em>Lewis </em>and <em>Dickerson </em>should be extended to a conviction vacated after the firearm was received or possessed. The plain language of the Act and the principles laid out in <em>Lewis, Dickerson </em>and <em>Davis </em>show that expunction of the underlying conviction after the purchase of the firearm has no effect on a conviction for \u00a7 922(h) purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1203-14\">. This constitutes a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922, and Cabrera does not contend otherwise. <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>New Banner Institute Inc., </em>460 U.S. 103, 103 S.Ct. 986, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983); <em>U.S. v. Garcia, </em>727 F.2d 1028 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1204-9\">. Vacation or reversal on a direct appeal of the conviction does eliminate the conviction as a predicate offense. <em>Lewis, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
