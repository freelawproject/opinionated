No legal questions or principles are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>involved. The plaintiff claimed his injuries were caused by his being struck by a truck of the defendant while he was crossing a city street. The defendant claimed the plaintiff was not struck by the truck, but that he fell while crossing the street and his injuries were caused by such fall. The plaintiff moved the court to give binding instructions in his favor, and the question involved is whether the plaintiff\u2019s proofs necessitated the submission of the case to the jury. We think it would have been error in court had it given binding instructions in favor of the defendant. In support of that view, we need only quote the testimony of the plaintiff, which was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">\u201cA. The semaphore was elosed against traffic on Thirteenth Street, and I started across Thirteenth Street, got almost to the rail, and I heard a woman scream, and this truck struck me on the side, knocked me down, and that is all that I know about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">\u201cQ. Now, before you started to go across the Street did you look down Thirteenth Street? A. Oh, yes, and saw the semaphore elosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">\u201cQ. And was there any traffic going north on Thirteenth Street? A. No, not a thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">\u201cQ. Do you know where this truck came from that hit you? A. Came around the comer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">\u201cQ. And how do you know that? A. I don\u2019t know that; I saw the semaphore elosed. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">\u201cBy the Court: Q. As far as you saw it, you didn\u2019t see the truck? A. Not until it hit me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">While the defendant produced several witnesses to the contrary, it is dear that it was for the jury to decide on which side the truth lay. Finding no error, the judgment entered on such verdict is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
