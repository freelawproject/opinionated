It took no appeal. At the same time Allshouse and Przeklasa were indicted, tried, and convicted of selling whisky to the elub. They appealed. There was proof they had for a long time sold large quantities of whisky to the club at $145 a case, and that the club sold whisky to its' members at 50 cents a portion. Before sentence, they raised the question that there was no proof that whisky was intoxicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>and therefore the verdict could not be sustained. The court below held \u201cthis was not necessary, as the court will take judicial notice that whisky is intoxicating.\u201d This ruling involves the only question in the ease. We are of opinion the court was right. The word \u201cwhisky\u201d is synonymous with an intoxicant. The dictionary definition of whisky is \u201can intoxicating liquor distilled from grain, etc.\u201d That whisky is intoxicating has been held in several cases. See Albert v. U. S. (C. C. A.) 281 F. 511, 513, where it is said \u201cwhisky is\u2018a well-known, distilled, spirituous, and intoxicating liquor.\u201d It is a matter of common knowledge, of which we may properly take judicial cognizance, that whisky, properly so called, contains many times one-half of one per cent, of alcohol. Also Hensberg v. U. S. (C. C. A.) 288 F. 370, 371, followed in U. S. v. Golden (D. C.) 1 F.(2d) 543, 547, where, in the earlier case, it is said: \u201cThe word whisky connotes intoxicating liquor.\u201d Also Williams v. U. S. (C. C. A.) 3 F.(2d) 933, 935, where the court, speaking of whisky, says: \u201cWhich we take judicial cognizance is both a distilled and intoxicating liquor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Finding no error, the judgment sentence below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
