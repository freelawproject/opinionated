This motion must be allowed. There is no merit in appellants\u2019 contentions that if unsuccessful in their attempted denial of appellee\u2019s plain right to examine the books of the Fajardo Company, appellee would so use the information as to damage the company in excess of $5,000. The value of a stockholder\u2019s right to inspect the books of a corporation \u2014 whatever his purpose \u2014 is (at least under such circumstances as are here shown) purely speculative; certainly there is no showing of any such \u201cvalue in controversy\u201d as $5,000, either in damage or in benefit to the corporation. Fajardo Sugar Company v. Holcomb (C. C. A.) 16 F.(2d) 92, 94, is not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-22\">In each case the appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction, no costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
