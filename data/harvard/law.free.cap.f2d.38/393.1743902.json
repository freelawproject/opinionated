The Moore policy, together with the receipt for the first premium, was, according to the custom of appellant, sent to Orr. Because further examination was re&lt;quired of Roewe, bis policy was delayed. Orr says that, because of the request in the application that draft he drawn for the premiums, he assumed that he was not to collect any premiums, and therefore delivered the policy to Moore without requiring payment of the first premium. However, he told Moore then, and again a few days before Moore\u2019s death, that the premium should be paid to put the policy in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-31\">The only contradiction in the evidence is in this:. Orr testified that shortly after Moore\u2019s death appellee told him that the rea-son why the Moore premium had not been paid was that he (Roewe) intended waiting until the Roewe .policy was also delivered; Roewe admits a conversation with Orr at that time, but denies using the language as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>related by Orr. However, Roewe, after testifying that lie bad made no arrangement with the bank about paying drafts to be drawn for premiums, further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">\u201cI hadn\u2019t made the definite arrangements with the bank on account of waiting until my policy would also come through, so I would know the amount we should charge every three months against the joint account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">That is very close to what Orr said Roewe had told him, and seems to show the reason why the Moore premium was not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The Illinois statute relied upon provides (paragraph 346, e. 73, Cahill\u2019s Illinois Rev. Stats.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\"><em>\u201cWho Agent of Foreign Company. </em>\u00a7 23. Whoever solicits insurance on behalf of any life company not chartered by and not established within this State, or transmits, for any person other than himself, an application for life insurance, or a policy of life insurance, to or from such company, or advertises that he will 'receive or transmit the same, shall be held to be an agent of such company to all intents and purposes, and subject to all the duties, requisitions, liabilities and penalties set forth in the laws of this State relating to life insurance companies not incorporated by the Legislature thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">That statute simply means that a foreign corporation, which accepts applications from any solicitor, must also accept him as its agent. Nothing is said in the statute as to whether such agency is a special or a general one, or what powers such an- agent has. Those are matters to be determined from the facts in each case under the general law relating to agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">It is not denied that Orr was the agent of the company, but it is denied that it was within his power to waive any conditions of the policy. The case of Hancock Life Ins. Co. v. Schlink, 175 Ill. 284, 51 N. E. 795, 796, relied upon by appellee, is very different, upon the facts from this case, and the holding of the court there was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">\u201cIf Ballanee was the agent of appellant, as we think he was, with power to solicit insurance of Sehlink, receive the application, forward it to appellant, receive the policy when issued, collect the premium, and deliver the policy, then he had power to waive a condition of the policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">That is an opinion of the court upon the general law of agency, and is not the construction of any statute. It is not binding upon this court, and is not in harmony with the law in the federal courts. \u00c6tna Ins. Co. v. Moore, 231 U. S. 543, 34 S. Ct. 186, 58 L. Ed. 356; MacKelvie v. Mutual Benefit Co., 287 F. (2nd <em>C. </em>C. A.) 660, 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">Upon its face, the Moore policy provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-14\">\u201cThis policy is issued and accepted subject to all of the conditions, benefits and privileges described on the following pages, which are hereby made a part of this contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-15\">A rider attached to the policy reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-16\">\u201cThis policy and the application here-for, a' copy of which application is attached hereto and made a part hereof, constitute the entire contract between the parties hereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-17\">On the back of the policy is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-18\">\u201cThis policy shall not become effective until the first premium upon it is paid during the good health of the insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-19\">Another provision is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-20\">\u201cAll agreements made by the Company are signed by its President, Vice President, Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Treasurer, or Assistant Treasurer. No other person can alter or waive any of the conditions of this policy, extend the time for paying a premium or make any agreement which shall be binding upon the Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-21\">The application contains the following question and answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-22\">\u201cWhere are premium notices to be sent?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-23\">\u201cSouthern Ill. National Bank, E. St. Louis, Ill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-24\">Question 7 of the application, as it appeared as a part of the policy of insurance when delivered to Moore, is as follows (The part in italics was in writing, and all other parts were printed; \u201cSee H. O. End\u201d refers to what appears under \u201cHome Office Endorsements Only\u201d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-25\">\u201c7. Has any payment of premium been made and binding receipt given on form 257-D detached herefrom. <em>See H. O.

If not given, it is agreed, that no insurance hereon shall be effective until a policy is issued, and the entire first premium has been paid during the good health of the proposed insured and within sixty days from date of medical examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u201cHome Office Endorsements Only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">\n<em>\u201cQues. 7 should be answered \u2018No.\u2019</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">\u201cEnter Here any Special Features Pertaining to Application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">\n<em>\u2018\u2018The applicant requests that the Peoria General Agency draw a draft on the account of the Moore Boewe Audit Co. for a Quarterly premium as they come due.

St. Louis, III. </em>this <em>15th </em>day of <em>Feb. 1928.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">\u201c(If premiums are to be paid from the funds of a corporation or person other than the proposed insured, such a corporation or person should sign below). <em>The premiums are to be paid from the funds of the undersigned.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">\u201cMoore-Roewe Audit Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">\u201cH. D. Moore No. 318159.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-13\">\u201cHarold Douglas Moore Proposed Insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-14\">\u201cMust sign full name</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-15\">\u201cR. E. Orr Witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-16\">The foregoing told Moore plainly that he took the policy subject to all of its terms and conditions. One of its terms was that his application was to- be a part of the policy. Another was that only specified officers, and Orr was not one of them, could extend the time for paying a premium. Moore was twice- told, once by the language upon the back of the policy, and again under question 7, immediately following the statement \u201cDraft to be drawn by General Agent,\u201d that no insurance should become effective until the entire first premium had been paid. In the MaeKelvie Case, above cited, the court said that, where such provisions are contained in a contract of insurance, they are to be taken as meaning exactly what they say; that is, that an agent, such as Orr, had no authority to wlaive them. Several Supreme Court eases and many cases in the Circuit Courts of Appeals are there cited in support of that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-18\">We do not find from the facts that Orr had either the power or the intent to waive payment of the first premium. What Orr told Moore, as above related, shows a contrary intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-19\">There remains to- be considered the effect of the provision in the policy of appellant\u2019s assent to the request in the application that a draft be drawn by the general agent. There is no inconsistency between that provision and the provision that the policy should not become effective until the first premium was paid. If Moore had intended that the payment of the first premium was to be waived or delayed until a draft was drawn therefor, it is not conceivable that a man of his experience and intelligence would have left in the application the words immediately following his request that a draft be drawn for the premiums by the general agent, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-20\">\u201cIf given the terms of the binding receipt are hereby agreed to. If not given, it is agreed that no insurance hereon shall be effective until a policy is issued, and the entire first premium has been paid,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-21\">Had Moore or Roewe (Roewe being charged by Moore with making the financial arrangements at the bank) desired to do so-, either could have paid the premium, without waiting for a draft to be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-22\">It does not appear that any one representing appellant, other than Orr, knew of the delivery of the policy without the payment of the first premium. Moo-re knew that he must pay the first premium to put the policy into effect, and he was not misled or prejudiced because of the delivery to him of the policy without payment of the premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-23\">The District Court should have instructed the jury to find the issues for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-24\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
