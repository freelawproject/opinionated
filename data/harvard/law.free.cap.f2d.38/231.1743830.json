On her arrest for deportation, she was gpven a fair hearing, with counsel present. On credible evidence, the finding was made that she had told various police officers that she had had promiscuous sexual intercourse with men at the Plaza Hotel in Lawrence, for money, and divided the proceeds with one Dyer, who sent the men to her. She admitted telling this to the officers; but claimed she then lied. If the evidence was legally admissible to show the nature of her alleged lewdness, of course all questions of credibility were for the immigration officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">We need not decide whether the evidence of the nature of this alien\u2019s lewdness was competent; United States v. Uhl (C. C. A.) 210 F. 861, 863; Tillinghast v. Edmead (C. C. A.) 31 F.(2d) 81; Ex parte Edmead (D. C.) 27 F.(2d) 438; for we are of opinion that under the statute, G. L. Mass. c. 272, \u00a7 53, lewdness connotes moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">In Commonwealth v. Wardell, 128 Mass. 52, 54, 35 Am. Rep. 357, the court said: \u201cThe word \u2018lewdness\u2019 at common law means open and public indecency; but as used and qualified in the statute it has a broader sense. It was held to mean, as used in other criminal statutes (Gen. Sts. e. 165, \u00a7 13; e.-87, \u00a7 6), \u2018the irregular indulgence of lust, whether publie or private.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">Bouvier says: \u201cLewdness. \u2014 That form of immorality which has relation to sexual impurity.\u201d Bouv. Law Dict., vol. 2, p. 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">Compare Swearingen v. United States, 161 U. S. 446, 451, 16 S. Ct. 562, 40 L. Ed. 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">The deeree of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
