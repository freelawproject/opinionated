The letter O is circular in shape and is printed somewhat larger than, the letters L and M adjacent to it. In registration 182,208 the notation alone comprises the mark, but in registration 182,209 the notation is surrounded by an outline of fanciful design. '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-26\">\u201cThe mark of the applicant, on the other hand, consists of the notation, \u2018Seal O Meteri in which the letter O is. printed largest with the letters of the words Seal and Meter tapering away from it so that the end letters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>S and R are which smaller than the middle letter O. The letter 0 is more or less oval in shape and -within it appears the representation of a sealed envelope. The notation is inclosed within a field diamond in shape and colored black and yellow. Over the letter 0 appear the letters \u2018I. P. S. Co.\u2019 and below it the notation, \u2018Trade Mark.\u2019 The words \u2018Meter* and \u2018Trade-mark\u2019 are disclaimed apart from the mark illustrated in the drawing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">\u201cFrom the foregoing it is seen that the marks of both parties are compound words, or notations, consisting of two words with the letter 0 between them. The word Meter is common to each and appears at the end of each notation. The first word of eaeh notation consists of four letters of which two of the letters, A and L, are common to both, and the letter L terminates eaeh word. Also the letters forming eaeh of the marks taper, or slope, but in opposite direction; those of the opposer tapering from the ends towards the middle letter 0 while those of applicant taper away from the middle letter 0 towards the ends. Opposer\u2019s mark of registration, 182,-209, is also inclosed within a field described by a line which is more or less concentric with the outline of the lettering while applicant\u2019s mark is placed within a diamond shaped field. The principal difference between the two marks resides in the first words, one being \u2018Seal\u2019 and the other \u2018Mail.\u2019 Another difference appears in the shape or contour of the two marks; the lettering forming applicant\u2019s mark is shaped so as to be more or less concentric with the diamond shaped field which is of a characteristic color, black and yellow, while the lettering of op-poser\u2019s mark, is shaped so as to be concentrically placed within a field described by an outline of more or less artistie design. This design however is quite different in outline from applicant\u2019s diamond field.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The degree of resemblance between the respective marks is shown from the above-quoted description, and we agree with the Examiner that the words \u201cMail-O-Meter\u201d and \u201cSeal 0 Meter,\u201d respectively, comprise the dominant and essential characteristics of the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The question is, therefore, whether, in view of such resemblance as exists in the marks themselves, the goods to which they are applied are of the same descriptive properties, so that as a result there would be likelihood of their causing confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or deceiving purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"AuE\">In passing upon the question, the Examiner of Interferences said: \u201cIt is not disputed that the goods on which the marts are used possess the same descriptive properties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Applicant, in stating the grounds of its appeal to the Commissioner, insisted that the Examiner was in error in so finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Upon the issue, the Commissioner of Patents found: \u201cIt is quite clear the applicant company is now using its mark upon substantially the same kind of machines as those upon which the opposer has continuously used its mark from a date long prior to that established by the applicant. Under these conditions, the question here to be considered is restricted to the similarity of the marks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">In the appeal to this court, error is assigned upon this finding of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">In our study of this question, as of the other matters constituting the issue, we have made careful examination of the record, including the evidence taken and the numerous exhibits filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">It is the insistence of appellant (applicant) that the only items of merchandise possessing the same descriptive properties are certain machines of opposer which are being sold under the trade name of \u201cMetered-Mail,\u201d and that the \u201cMail-O-Meter\u201d machines of opposer, which seal and affix stamps, are not machines of the same descriptive properties as the \u201cstamp-canceling\u201d machines of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">The \u201cMetered-Mail\u201d trade-marks of op-poser appear to be registered marks, but they are not immediately involved in the instant case; opposer insisting that \u2022 there is competition between the articles marked \u201cSeal 0 Meter\u201d and those marked \u201cMail-O-Meter,\u201d as well as between the \u201cMetered-Mail\u201d and \u201cSeal 0 Meter\u201d devices, which should cause appellant\u2019s application for registry to be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-14\">From the whole record in the ease, we feel constrained to agree with the finding of the Commissioner of Patents on this question. Both the \u201cMail-O-Meter\u201d and \u201cSeal 0 Meter\u201d machines are used to seal and stamp envelopes and are sold to private owners for that purpose. They are likewise equipped with devices to count the number of pieces of mail stamped by the machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-15\">Appellant\u2019s device is evidently more than merely a postage canceling machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-16\">In its Exhibit No. 18, which seems to be an advertising pamphlet, the statement is made that \u201cSeal 0 Meter No. 2 * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>automatically feeds, separates, seals, metres, post-marks and stamps.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">In Exhibit No. 1 of appellee, which also seems to be advertising matter, the claim is made that \u201cMail-O-Meter\u201d is the \u201cfirst mechanism for simultaneously sealing letters, affixing the postage stamps and rendering an account of the postage used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">It is quite apparent, we think, that the respective devices are, in a number of essential features, identical in purpose and quite similar in function. The record does not sustain appellant\u2019s contention as to there being no similarity in the devices which are actually in competition under the respective marks, \u201cMail-O-Meter\u201d and \u201cSeal 0 Meter,\u201d and we find no error in the decision of the Commissioner on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">There is a strong resemblance between the marks themselves, and we think the distinctive similarities between the machines to which the marks are applied bring them within the phrase \u201cof the same descriptive properties,\u201d and that the record justifies the conclusion that the application of the marks would likely cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">It was stipulated by counsel for the respective parties to the eases \u201cthat the appeals 6876 and 6877 be consolidated and treated as one appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">We have accordingly so treated them here, and in both eases the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
