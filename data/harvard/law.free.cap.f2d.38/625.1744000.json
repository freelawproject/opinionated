Appellees'then filed an injunction bill in the federal District Court. The injunction was granted, and at final hearing a decree was given for complainants with a first lien for defendants for certain charges and expenses. From this decree an appeal was taken, and but one question is raised, viz. that the federal court has no jurisdiction for the reason that this is a suit against the state of Michigan and is forbidden by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">This is not a suit against the state of Michigan. It is a suit against the men who constitute the board of escheats for the state of Michigan, who are holding certain property as trustees. To this property the complainant appellees have a legal title under the inheritance laws of the state of Michigan. If this legal title is disregarded, the property, or the proceeds of the property, goes to that state. To that extent the state of Michigan has a claim to the proceeds of the property, but in no other sense is it a party to this suit. As said by the Supreme Court in Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U. S. 222, 17 S. Ct. 770, 777, 42 L. Ed. 137: \u201cThe Eleventh Amendment gives no immunity to officers or agents of a state in withholding the property of a citizen without authority of law.\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">It is,not disputed that under the inheritance law of the state of Michigan the appellees herein are the legal heirs of the late George Klump. It is not disputed that, under the provisions of the Michigan statute, the appellees have filed their claims and proofs and have done everything possible to recover their property from the state board of escheats. The officers holding this property hold it as trustees. It is their duty to restore that property, or the proceeds thereof, to its rightful owners, or, if there are no heirs, to turn it in to the treasury of the state of Michigan. In no way is the state of Michigan a party to this suit. In no way is it, in the language of Cunningham v. Macon R. R. Co., 109 U. S. 446, 3 S. Ct. 292, 296, 27 L. Ed. 992, \u201can indispensable party to enable the court * * * to grant the relief sought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
