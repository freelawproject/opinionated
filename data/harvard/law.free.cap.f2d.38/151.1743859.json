Flagler fortune.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-23\">\u201cOn a passport obtained in New York, five years ago, she gave her name as Rosalie Cecelia Kelly, of Garrison, Md., and said that she was bom August 13, 1895-.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-24\">\u201cLater, the police learned she apparently lived at 1341 East Capitol Street, Washington, as Rose C. Kelly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-25\">\u201cThe \u2018woman in black\u2019 who said that the name \u2018Jane Doe\u2019 would do, when questioned by Magistrate Levine, was arrested Thursday night in her apartment, after police had traced a package through several nearby towns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-26\">\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-27\">\u201cA woman who said she was Miss Rose C. Kelly, residing in the Norwood Apartment house at 1341 East Capitol Street, yesterday denied any knowledge of Millicent Fay, or Rosalie Cecelia Kelly, of Garrison, Md. Neither did she know Mrs. Louise Wise Lewis, she said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-29\">\u201cShe had been bothered by reporters about the same kind of story last September, and had then declared her ignorance of any part of it. She could not explain how the name and address had come into the possession of the New York Police, she said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-30\">\u201cThe woman who said she was Miss Rose Kelly said she had lived in the same apartment house for the last four years, and demanded the statement of the New York police not be published.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-31\">All the assignments of error necessary to be noticed, to quote from appellant\u2019s brief, \"raise substantially the same questions, namely, whether or not the article complained of on its face shows that any part of it, which might be considered libelous, was published of and concerning plaintiff, <em>or </em>could be so understood by average readers of The Post.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-32\">For several years prior to the publication of this article, appellee, an unmarried woman, had lived at the Norwood apartment house, 1341 East Capitol street, Washington, D. C., with two of her unmarried sisters. She had been an employee of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing for many years, and had been in no way connected with the incident referred to in the article; all of which would have appeared had any real attempt been made to develop the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-34\">In view of what follows, the caption of the article is significant: \u201c\u2018Woman in Black\u2019 Held; Residence Here Denied.\u201d After stating that the woman in black had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>arraigned and held in default of $5,000 hail, to await hearing on charges of obtaining money through a fraudulent device, and that five years previously the woman had given her name as Rosalie Cecelia Kelly, the article continues: <em>\u201cLater, the police learned she apparently limed at 1341 East Capitol Street, Washington, as Bose C. Kelly.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.) After stating that the \u201cwoman in black\u201d had given an alias when questioned by the magistrate at the time of her arrest, the article continues: \u201cA woman who <em>said </em>she was Miss Rose C. Kelly, residing in the Norwood Apartment house, at 1341 East Capitol Street, yesterday denied any knowledge of Millicent Pay, or Rosalie Cecelia Kelly; of Garrison, Md. Neither did she know Mrs. Louise Wise Lewis, <em>she said. * * * She could not explain how the name and address had come into the possession of the New York Police, she said. </em>The woman who <em>said' </em>she was Miss Rose Kelly <em>said </em>she had lived in the same apartment house for the last four years, and demanded the statement of the New York police not be published.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The article .must, of course, be read as a whole. And when so read, we think its obvious tendency was to convey to the publie, or at least a substantial portion of the publie, the impression that notwithstanding appellee denied any knowledge of the \u201cwoman in black\u201d and her arrest in New York, there was a question whether she was telling the truth. In other words, the general purport of the article was to convey to the publie the impression that appellee was the \u201cwoman in black.\u201d If that was not the intent and purpose of the writer of the article, it is difficult to perceive why it was published at all. Local readers of the paper would not be interested in the arrest of a woman in New York for obtaining a comparatively small sum of money through a fraudulent device unless the woman had some local connection. The writer! of the article, knowing this, sought to give the article local color by creating the impression that appellee and the \u201cwoman in black\u201d were one and the same person. The libelous character of the article was not changed by the somewhat equivocal suggestions that its truth was denied by appellee. Bishop v. Journal Newspaper Co., 168 Mass. 327, 47 N. E. 119; Doan v. Kelley, 121 Ind. 413, 23 N. E. 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">In Peck v. Tribune Company, 214 U. S. 185, 29 S. Ct. 554, 555, 53 L. Ed. 960,16 Ann. Cas. 1075, it was held - that publication of the portrait of one person with statements thereunder as of another, by mistake, and without knowledge of whom the portrait really is, is not an excuse. Said the court: \u201cA libel is harmful on its face. If a man sees fit to publish manifestly hurtful statements concerning an individual, without other justification than exists for an advertisement or a piece of news, the usual principles of tort will make him liable if the statements are false, or are true only of someone else.\u201d See also Washington Post Co. v.
