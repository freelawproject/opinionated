W. Taggart, President. \u201cThe Western Auto Travel Agency, Inc.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\">\u201cBy R. W. Taggart, President. (Parties of the First Part.) \u201cCarl Sehaek, [Seal]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-10\">(Party of the Second Part.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">January 3, 1928, in Boone county, Mo., on state highway No. 40, a 29-passenger Mack Six bus, the property of said Carl Sehaek, and operated under the terms of the foregoing contract, with one W. C. Shelton as driver, ran into a wagon being driven by appellee, as a result of which, one of appellee\u2019s horses was instantly killed, his wagon totally demolished,, and appellee himself severely injured. Appellee brought suit against appellant in the circuit court of Boone county, Mo., alleging negligent operation of the bus on the part of appellant, and praying damages in the sum of $25,375. The ease was removed to the District Court for the Western District of Missouri because of diversity of citizenship. Thereafter, appellee filed his first amended petition in which he made Sehaek also a defendant. Still later a second amended petition was filed, to which appellant filed a separate answer denying the allegations in appellee\u2019s petition, and interposing a defense of contributory negligence. The case came on for trial before a jury, at which time appellee entered a dismissal as to the defendant Schack. The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellee, assessing his damages at the sum of $5,000. Judgment was entered accordingly and this appeal followed. At the close of the testimony, counsel for appellant requested the court to direct the jury to return a verdict for the defendant and to declare, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover damages under the pleadings and evidence. This request was refused and an exception preserved. Appellant assigns but two errors. The first, because of the refusal of the court to direct a verdict as requested. The ground relied upon, as stated in this assignment, was that, as contended by appellant, the bus at the time of the injury was not the property of the defendant, but was the property of Sehaek; that it was not under the control or management of Yelloway, Inc., hut under that of Sehaek through the driver W. C. Shelton; that, therefore, appellant was not liable for the damages claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">The second assignment was that the court erred in permitting one Bueseher, a chiropractor, to testify as to the nature and extent of appellee\u2019s injuries and to give an opinion as to the probable duration thereof, on the ground that the witness was not shown to be qualified to give such testimony as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">With respect to this second assignment the record discloses that Dr. Bueseher was a chiropractor, a graduate of a School of Chiropractic, and licensed to practice under the laws of the state of Missouri; that the special parts of the body with which the profession of chiropractic deals are the spinal column, spine, and the nerves. Four other physicians testified fully with respect to the injuries, their nature and probable duration. The testimony of Bueseher was largely cumulative and was restricted substantially to the parts of the body with which his profession deals, and to the effect of injuries to such parts upon the general health of the injured person. We think the qualifications of the witness were sufficiently shown, and that his testimony did not exceed the limits of his professional knowledge as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-15\">The ground upon which a master is held liable for the negligent acts of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>servant is because the servant is engaged in tbe master\u2019s affairs, for tbe proper conduct of which the master is responsible. \u201cThe mere fact that a servant is sent to do work pointed out to him by a person who has made a bargain with his master does not make him that person\u2019s servant.\u201d Driscoll v. Towle, 181 Mass. 416, 63 1ST. E. 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The test is whether the servant is engaged in the work of the new master, who has particular \u201cpower to direct and control the manner of performing the very work in which the carelessness occurred.\u201d Charlock v. Freel, 125 N. Y. 357, 26 N. E. 262, 263; Atlantic Transport Co. v. Coneys (C. C. A. 2) 82 F. 177; Byrne v. Kansas City, Ft. S. &amp; M. R. Co. (C. C. A. 6) 61 F. 605, 24 L. R. A. 693; Delory v. Blodgett, 185 Mass. 126, 69 N. E. 1078, 64 L. R. A. 114, 102 Am, St. Rep, 328; Johnson v. City of Boston, 118 Mass. 114; Kimball v. Cushman, 103 Mass. 194, 4 Am. Rep. 528; Grace &amp; Hyde Co. v. Probst, 208 Ill. 147, 70 N. E. 12; Consolidated Fireworks Co. v. Koehl, 190 Ill. 145, 60 N. E. 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The decision of this court in Philadelphia &amp; R. Coal &amp; Iron Co. v. Barrie, 179 F. 50, 54, clearly states the applicable rule. In that case the defendant was a coal dealer. It hired from another dealer a team and a driver in the latter\u2019s general employ, for the purpose of delivering coal from its yards to its customers. The hirer paid a stipulated sum per hour for the services of team and driver and had full control and direction of the work and the method of its performance. The driver in that| ease not only received from the hirer direction from which of its yards the coal should be taken, the quantity and place of delivery, but also, upon arrival, unloaded the coal by shoveling it from the wagon into coal holes in the sidewalk, or otherwise placed it in the receptacle provided by the consumer. In short, the defendant company issued all orders to the driver in connection with the delivery of coal to purchasers in various parts of the city. The employment was of a continuous nature and involved the performance 'of every kind of service incidental to the delivery of coal in the business of the hirer. In doing this work, the driver apparently had left 'uncovered and unguarded a coal hole in the sidewalk through which he had been delivering coal. A customer of the store, to which the coal was being delivered, on leaving the store fell into this hole and was injured. Because of the negligence of the driver the Pennsylvania &amp; R. Coal <em>&amp; </em>Iron Company, which had hired him, was held responsible. In his concurring opinion Judge Sanborn says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArHZ\">\u201cIf, therefore, the proof in this ease stopped with testimony that the Coal <em>&amp; </em>Iron Company under its hiring had and exercised the power to direct\u2018the driver what amount of coal to take, and where and when to take and to deliver it, this evidence, in my opinion, would not have 'overcome the legal presumption that his general employer, Martin, was liable for his negligence in his method of doing his work, and that the Coal Company was free from liability. But the local manager of the Coal Company testified, regarding this driver and others, that these men were instructed to deliver the coal under the Coal Company\u2019s orders:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-10\">\u201c \u2018Q. And the method of delivery is under your orders? A. Yes, sir, Q. Place, the time, the amount, and all, is under your orders? A. I have said so two or three times.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-11\">\u201cBecause this testimony indicates that the control of the method of the performance of the work of protecting the coal hole while the driver was unloading the coal had been transferred by some agreement between his <em>general </em>employer and the <em>Goal </em>Company from the former to the latter, this case seems to me to be taken out from the general rule and presumption which have been stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">See, also, Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Rahn, 132 U. S. 518, 10 S. Ct. 175, 33 L. Ed. 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">In appellant\u2019s application to the Public Service Commission of the state of Missouri for a certificate of convenience and necessity, authorizing it to operate over 'the highways of the state between St. Louis and Kansas City, in its capacity as a motor carrier, it gave detailed information concerning the ownership and condition of the physical property used or to be used by it in the conduct of its business in the state of Missouri. We quote: \u201cLeased Bus Equipment. This equipment is withdrawn from time to time from other Divisions of Yelloway, Inc., and used on this route. It is to be replaced by the new equipment on order: 1 29 passenger Mack Six, property of Carl Schack; 1 29 passenger Mack Six, property of A. L. Mulholland; 1 29 passenger Fageol and 1 29 passenger A. C. F., property of L. M. Schack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-14\">The vehicle involved in this accident was the Schack '29 passenger Mack Six thus described. It will be noted that paragraph five of the contract contemplates the addition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>equipment, when needed, to that specially described. From the foregoing quotation it appears that, at the time this certificate was applied for, Schack had three busses employed in the service of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In general, by various paragraphs of the contract it was provided: That appellant was engaged in the business of a motor car-' rier over various routes, including that between St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri; that it supplied the necessary equipment by means of contracts, which it construed as leases; that it reserved to itself and exercised absolute control over schedules and the designation of the points between which runs should he made, maintaining offices, agencies, and depots, for the sale of tickets and the accommodation of passengers, and officers to supervise and direct all operations of busses in its service. It has authority to transfer this equipment to such other run or runs as, in its \u2018opinion, will prove more profitable; and may discontinue routes when such action becomes necessary or desirable. All busses in its service are to he colored and lettered as it may designate, and, in fact, '\u00e1re so lettered and colored to indicate the operative control of Yelloway, Incorporated. Paragraphs seven and twenty-six of the contract give appellant practical control over the hiring and discharge of drivers, although this is not a decisive test of the point at issue. Standard Oil Co. v. Anderson, 212 U. S. 215, 225, 29 S. Ct. 252, 53 L. Ed. 480. The contract'is to remain in force for a period of two years unless sooner canceled for breach. There is here presented no isolated case of the hiring of a public vehicle for purposes of hauling or carriage. The contract, in form, and in the nature of many of its provisions, is not a technical lease; but the parties have expressly stipulated that it should be so construed. And appellant reported the bus in question among others, to the'Publie Service Commission as \u201cleased bus equipment.\u201d It is unnecessary, however, that the strict relationship of lessor and lessee should be held to exist. The contract, as a whole, discloses that appellant is engaged in the general business of a motor carrier for hire, and that the bus equipment employed is incorporated into that business, for the purposes of this litigation, as fully as though it were the absolute property of appellant. The oral testimony tends to confirm this conclusion. The witness Cook introduced by appellee testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">\u201cQ. On the 3rd day of January, of last .year, did you have any relations with the Yelloway, Incorporated, the defendant in this . case? A. Yes, I was running the Missouri Transit Company at that time, and the Yelloway, \u2014 our busses was stopping at my garage, and the Yelloway made arrangements with us about three years before that to handle their tickets, our office to sell tickets for them, to make their office with our office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-10\">\u201cQ. So on the 3rd day of January you were maintaining an office for the Yelloway in Columbia? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-11\">\u201cQ. Was this accident or collision reported to you? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-12\">\u201cQ. How. did you receive the report? A. Somebody called up the office and said there was a Mr. Hawkins killed \u2014 I didn\u2019^t know Mr. Hawkins, but they said somebody was wrecked out there and to send out some man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-13\">\u201cQ. Did you send out? A. Mr. Kelly was there, and I reported to him and Mr. Kelly \u2022 went out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-14\">\u201cQ. Who was Mr. Kelly? A. He was a traffic manager for the Yelloway from Kansas City to St. Louis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-15\">\u201cQ. Just what are the duties of the road manager?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-16\">\u201cMr. Clark: I object to any testimony as to what Mr. Kelly did after the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-17\">\u201cMr. Hulen: I am not asking what he did after the accident. I want to know who Mr. Kelly is and what his duties are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-18\">\u201cMr. Clark: I object to that. If Mr. Cook knows independently of what Mr. Kelly told him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-19\">\u201cThe Court: Temporarily the objection may be overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-20\">\u201cA. Mr. Kelly looked after the drivers; also cheeked the stations, and gave orders, issued tickets \u2014 in other words he was the same as a railroad traffie manager. \u00b0 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-21\">\u201cQ.

For nearly six months Schack\u2019s busses had been running in the service of appellant, the one in question regularly between St. Louis and Chicago, but transferred on this occasion, under'the terms of the contract, to the route between St. Louis and Kansas City. At all times the busses, with their drivers, were engaged in the business of appellant and were under appellant\u2019s direction and control as to the manner and method of doing its work. The facts that, as stipulated, the bus broke down at a point near Columbia, Mo., that repairs were there made which were paid for by Sehaek, and that pursuant to appellant\u2019s orders, it was returning to St. Louis without passengers when the accident occurred, in nowise affects the conclusion we have reached that, at the time of the accident, the driver of the bus was the servant of appellant, and that the latter was liable for his negligent acts. It would be unfortunate if, by this device of operating by means of hired or leased equipment, appellant could escape responsibility for the negligent conduct of its business. We have preferred to consider this assigned error upon the merits. It is doubtful, however, whether the point is properly before us. The first assignment now under consideration is based expressly and solely upon the contention that the bus, at the time of the accident, was not under the control or management of appellant. The contention was not sharply called to the attention of the court and a ruling sought thereon. No request was made for an instruction to that effect. The court in its charge assumed that the driver of the bus was the servant of appellant. At the close of the charge, counsel for appellant not only took no exception thereto, but expressly announced that the defendant had no further request to make. Under these circumstances the law of the ease was established, unless it clearly appears that the record wholly fails to disclose a cause of action. Schmidt v. Carpenter, 27 S. D. 412, 131 N. W. 723, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 296 and note; Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. James (C. C. A. 8) 56 F. 1001, 1006; 14 Ruling Case Law, par. 78, p. 822; Nichols &amp; Shepard Co. v. Marshall, 28 S. D. 182, 132 N.

W. 946.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">We think the evidence amply justifies the charge of the court, and supports the verdict and judgment. It follows that that judgment should be, and is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b763-6\">MUNGER, District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Asf\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Under the facts in this ease, I think the appellant was not responsible for the act of the driver of the bus, because the driver was not subject to the direction or control of appellant in the mode of his performance of his work, and that the responsibility for the driver\u2019s act ,was imposed upon Sehack as an independent contractor. Casement v. Brown, 148 U. S. 615, 13 S. Ct. 672, 37 L. Ed. 582; Byrne v. Kansas City, Ft. S. &amp; M. R. Co. (C. C. A.) 61 F. 605, 24 L. R. A. 693; Bellatty v. Barrett Mfg. Co. (C. C. A.) 196 P. 493. the question was properly presented by a request at the close of the evidence, that the court should direct a verdict in favor of the defendant. I think that a new trial should be awarded, because of the error in overruling that request.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
