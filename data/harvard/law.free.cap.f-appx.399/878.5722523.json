It therefore does not constitute an aggravated felony for purposes of federal immigration law. The 1996 conviction does not render him ineligible to be considered for cancellation of removal. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 2580, 2589, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010). Salazar-Rodriguez\u2019s petition for review is GRANTED. The order of the BIA is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to allow Salazar-Rodriguez to pursue cancellation of removal in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Carachuri-Rosen-do.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"ANg\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
