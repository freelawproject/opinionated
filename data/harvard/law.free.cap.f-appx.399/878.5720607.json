Her central argument is that an in absentia order was improper because she did not receive notice of the hearing and she did not have an address required by \u00a7 239(a)(1)(F)\u00ae of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1)(F)\u00ae, to provide to authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-19\">The BIA\u2019s finding that Gomez-Diaz failed to provide authorities with a current mailing address is supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir. 2006). The Board\u2019s determination that her failure to provide a current address precluded her from receiving notice of her removal hearing is correct. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229(a); <em>Gomez-Palados, </em>560 F.3d 354, 359 (5th Cir.2009). Likewise, her failure to provide an address precludes her from obtaining rescission of the in absentia order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii); <em>Gomez-Palacios, </em>560 F.3d at 360-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-20\">Gomez-Diaz\u2019s remaining arguments, creative though unsupported by controlling authority, do not overcome the highly deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>See Maknojiya v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 588, 588-89 (5th Cir.2005). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b906-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
