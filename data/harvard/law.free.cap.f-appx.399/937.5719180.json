Lopez Ayala contends that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 improperly results in the use of his prior aggravated assault conviction to determine both his offense level and his criminal history score, resulting in double counting. He contends further that the sentence imposed was greater than necessary in light of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and was therefore unreasonable. He maintains that his offense was nothing more than an international trespass and that his sentence was too severe for the offense of conviction in light of his personal history and characteristics. Lopez Ayala also argues that the lack of an empirical basis for \u00a7 2L1.2 precludes an appellate presumption that his sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">This court reviews sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In conducting the reasonableness review, this court reviews the sentence for both procedural error and substantive reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Because Lopez Ayala raises his double-counting claim, a procedural claim, for the first time on appeal, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009); <em>United States v. Klein, </em>543 F.3d 206, 213 (2008). We have previously rejected the argument that the double counting of a defendant\u2019s criminal history necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.6). Thus, the district court did not commit procedural error, plain or otherwise, when it used Lopez Ayala\u2019s aggravated assault conviction to determine both his offense level and his criminal history score.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">To the extent that Lopez Ayala preserved his substantive reasonableness arguments, review of the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines is de novo and its findings of fact is for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Otherwise, review is for plain error. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 361. Lopez Ayala\u2019s arguments fail under both standards. The district court considered Lopez Ayala\u2019s arguments for a below-guidelines sentence but determined that a sentence at the low end of that range was appropriate. Because his sentence is \u201cwithin a properly calculated Guideline range,\u201d it carries a presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Lopez Ayala advances no persuasive reason for this court to question the application of the presumption or to disturb the district court\u2019s choice of sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586 (stating that \u201cthe fact that the appellate court might reasonably [conclude] that a different sentence [is] appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006) (implicitly rejecting the contention that the defendant\u2019s illegal reentry was \u201c \u2018at bottom\u2019 \u201d merely \u201can international trespass\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">Finally, Lopez Ayala concedes that his argument that the lack of an empirical basis for \u00a7 2L1.2 precludes an appellate presumption that his sentence is reasonable is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>He raises the claim, however, to preserve it for future review.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b965-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
