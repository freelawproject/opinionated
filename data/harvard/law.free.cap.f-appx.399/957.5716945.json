Sagun argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and that a sentence below the guidelines range would have provided adequate deterrence. He contends that his prior alien smuggling conviction was double counted by its use in adjusting his offense level and in determining his criminal history score. Thus, he argues that the prior conviction overstates the seriousness of his offense and renders his sentence unreasonable. Sagun, citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), further contends that the presumption of reasonableness should not be applied to his sentence because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not based on empirical data.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-23\">Sagun\u2019s argument that this court should not accord his within-guidelines sentence a presumption of reasonableness because the applicable guideline is not supported by empirical data is foreclosed. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number><em>States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Sagun acknowledges this argument is foreclosed but raises the issue to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">The substantive reasonableness of Sa-gun\u2019s sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for consideration of a prior conviction for both criminal history and the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.6). Additionally, this court has rejected the argument that double-counting of prior convictions necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">The record shows that the district court listened to Sagun\u2019s arguments but ultimately determined that a sentence within the guidelines range was appropriate. Sa-gun advances no persuasive reason for this court to disturb the district court\u2019s choice of sentence. <em>See United States v. Armstrong, </em>550 F.3d 382, 405 (5th Cir. 2008) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, and noting that the fact that an appellate court \u201c \u2018might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate\u2019 \u201d is insufficient to justify reversal), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S -, 130 S.Ct. 54, 175 L.Ed.2d 44 (2009), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Balleza, </em>613 F.3d 432, 433 n. 1 (5th Cir. 2010). Sagun has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b985-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
