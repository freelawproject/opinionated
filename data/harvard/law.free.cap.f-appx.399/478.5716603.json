Gomes argues that his sentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court placed undue weight on the need to avoid sentencing disparities among defendants, one of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. After review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a 70-month sentence and by denying Gomes\u2019s request for a downward variance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the district court emphasized the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, it did not do so \u201csingle-mindedly\u201d to the detriment of the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that a district court\u2019s \u201csingle-minded[ ]\u201d focus on one sentencing factor to the exclusion of the others resulted in an unreasonable sentence). Instead, the district court imposed a sentence that was supported by the record and that met the goals set forth by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). That the district court emphasized one particular sentencing factor does not indicate that it failed to consider the others. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d (quotations and alteration omitted).); <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[W]hen the district court considers the factors of section 3553(a), it need not discuss each of them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Gomes has not carried his burden of demonstrating that his sentence was either proeedurally or substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\">. We review the reasonableness of a district court's sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-19\">. \"[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v.
