Maldonado contends his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court: (1) erroneously based his sentence on finding there was no proof he illegally reentered the United States as a result of his father\u2019s alleged murder, and (2) failed to adequately explain his sentence in the light of his assertions in favor of a lower sentence. He further maintains his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court improperly weighed the sentencing factors, set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), by discounting his mitigation claim that he feared for his life after the murder of his father. Maldonado contends that, even if a presumption of reasonableness applies to his within-Guidelines sentence, he rebutted the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-13\">Arguably, Maldonado\u2019s procedural objections should be reviewed only for plain error because he arguably failed to raise a specific procedural objection in district court. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). Along that line, in district court, Maldonado raised two objections: the court failed to adequately explain the sentence, and it was greater than necessary under \u00a7 3553(a). Maldonado objected on various grounds; but, arguably, his objections were <em>not </em>based on any procedural grounds. <em>See id. </em>For plain-error review, Maldonado must show, <em>inter alia, </em>a clear or obvious error affecting his substantial rights. <em>E.g., Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-17\">This claim fails under either the ordinary or plain-error standard of review. Under the former, it was <em>not </em>clear error for the court to discount Maldonado\u2019s claim regarding why he illegally reentered the United States, because there was <em>no </em>proof his father was killed by a gang in Mexico or that this was Maldonado\u2019s reason for entry. Under the latter, such questions of fact \u201ccan never constitute plain error\u201d. <em>United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 119 (5th Cir.1995) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Even assuming the district court erred by failing to adequately explain the sentence, Maldonado has <em>not </em>shown reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-18\">Maldonado\u2019s substantive-unreasonableness claim is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 360. Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, the district court must still properly calculate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). When, as here, the district court imposes a sentence within a properly-calculated guidelines range, we accord great deference to the sentence and apply a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">The district court did <em>not </em>abuse its discretion in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Rather, the record reflects the court heard and considered Maldonado\u2019s contentions in favor of a lesser sentence but implicitly found they did <em>not </em>warrant a lesser sentence in the light of his criminal history, and given the lack of evidence that he fled Mexico because he feared for his life after his father\u2019s alleged murder. Moreover, the district court expressly stated it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determined a within-Guidelines sentence satisfied those factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Based on the district court\u2019s stated reasons, we are satisfied it considered the assertions presented and had \u201ca reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decision making authority\u201d. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The district court considered the totality of the circumstances in the light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing the sentence. In any event, Maldonado\u2019s disagreement with his sentence does <em>not </em>suffice to show error in connection with the sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, he has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-Guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">Maldonado contends the presumption of reasonableness should <em>not </em>apply to sentences under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 because the Guideline is \u201cpenalogically flawed\u201d. Conceding this argument is foreclosed by our precedent, he raises it in order to preserve it for possible further review. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b987-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
