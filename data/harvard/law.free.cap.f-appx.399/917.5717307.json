Gayle, federal prisoner # 30212-034, pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack cocaine, and he was sentenced to the mandatory minimum of 120 months in prison. Gayle appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence, which primarily was based on recent amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for crack cocaine. The Assistant Federal Public Defender representing Gayle on appeal has filed an unopposed motion to substitute counsel. Counsel avers that he was a member of the review panel charged with determining Gayle\u2019s eligibility for a reduction under the amendments to the Guidelines for crack cocaine. Counsel contends that his participation in the review panel creates a potential conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-23\">Because Gayle was subjected to the mandatory minimum penalty, he was not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief under the recent crack cocaine guidelines amendments. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 851; <em>United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.1994). Nor has Gayle alleged or identified any basis upon which the district court could have imposed a sentence below the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>Gayle\u2019s appeal is entirely without merit. Therefore, counsel\u2019s motion to substitute counsel is denied, the appeal is dismissed, and counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">MOTION TO SUBSTITUTE COUNSEL DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b945-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
