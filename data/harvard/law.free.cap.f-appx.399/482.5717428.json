We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The facts in this case are undisputed. Schweizer purchased a 820-acre parcel of land in 2003 and lived on the property. In 2005, two creditors \u2014 NC Two, L.P., and Capitol Indemnity Corporation \u2014 obtained separate judgments against Schweizer and recorded them in the two counties which the property straddles. Later that same year, NC Two filed an action in state court to foreclose its lien. Capitol was a party to the action and sought to enforce its subordinate lien. Under Florida law, a person who owns and resides on property located outside a municipality may claim a homestead exemption on up to 160 acres of contiguous land. Fla. Const, art. X, \u00a7 10. NC Two, Capitol, and Schweizer disagreed on which 160 contiguous acres of the 820-acre parcel should be deemed homestead property. The parties briefed and argued the issue. The state court resolved the dispute in the creditors\u2019 favor, specifically describing the property that was exempt and scheduling a foreclosure sale on the remainder of the property. Schweizer did not appeal the decision and does not now take the position that the state court\u2019s decision was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">After the deadline for any appeal had passed, but before the scheduled foreclosure sale, Schweizer filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. The filing stayed the foreclosure sale. In his amended schedule C, Schweizer claimed a homestead exemption on 160 acres of property within the 320-acre parcel different from the 160 acres that the state court had decreed constituted his homestead. NC Two, Capitol, and the bankruptcy trustee objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Schweizer moved under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f) to eliminate NC Two\u2019s and Capitol\u2019s liens from the 160 acres he claimed as exempt. The bankruptcy court denied the motion, holding that under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it could not reexamine the state court\u2019s determination, and that only the land identified by the state court was exempt. Schweizer appealed, and the district court affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court. Schweizer appeals; he argues that the court erred in concluding that the bankruptcy court could not reexamine the issue of his homestead exemption under a lien avoidance motion pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">Schweizer argues that the state court\u2019s judgment regarding his homestead exemption may be avoided as the fixing of a judicial lien on an interest in his property. In support of his contention, Schweizer relies on cases that examine the scope of Section 522(f). What Schweizer fails to recognize, however, is that the key to this case is not \u00a7 522(f), but rather \u00a7 522(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">After a debtor files for bankruptcy, he is entitled to retain certain assets as exempt from the bankruptcy estate. Although the bankruptcy code provides exemptions, a state may opt-out of those exemptions and provide alternative exemptions. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b). In an opt-out state, debtors may exempt \u201cany property that is exempt un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>der ... State or local law that is applicable on the date of the filing of the petition.\u201d <em>Id. \u00a7 </em>522(b)(3)(A). Florida elected to opt-out and has enacted its own exemptions. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code defines property of the estate as \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\u201d We have previously held that state law defines the scope and existence of the property interest. <em>In re Sinnreich, </em>391 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Butner v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 48, 55, 99 S.Ct. 914, 918, 59 L.Ed.2d 136 (1979)). Therefore, Florida law governs the scope and existence of the debtor\u2019s interest in homestead property. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 222.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In this case, when the state court entered judgment delineating the extent of Schweizer\u2019s homestead exemption, it defined the scope and existence of Schweizer\u2019s \u00a7 522(b) property interest. Thus, at the time of Schweizer\u2019s bankruptcy filing, the 160-acre parcel determined by the state court, and not any other division of Schweizer\u2019s 320 acres, was subject to the lien avoidance protections of \u00a7 522(f). Section 522(f) provides that \u201cthe debtor may avoid the fixing of a lien on an interest of the debtor in property to the extent that such lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled under subsection (b) of this section.... \u201d Consequently, \u00a7 522(f) protections are only available if a lien impairs a debtor\u2019s \u00a7 522(b) exempt property. Here, the state court defined what property Schweizer was allowed to claim as exempt, but Schweizer disregarded the state court\u2019s definition, claimed that other land was exempt, and sought to avoid liens to portions of his 320-acre property that are not covered by \u00a7 522(b). This, clearly, is not allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">We agree with the district court\u2019s well-reasoned analysis concluding that the bankruptcy court correctly held that it was bound by the state court\u2019s identification of the 160 acres covered by the homestead exemption. (R.l-21 at 3-9.) Therefore, we hold that the district court did not err in affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-8\">. <em>See Rooker v.
