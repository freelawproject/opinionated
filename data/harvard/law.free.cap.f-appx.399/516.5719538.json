(Pacific), against plaintiff/appellant, Cabana Club Apartments Associates, Ltd. (Cabana Club).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Cabana Club is a low-income elderly housing project consisting of a West Building and an East Building in Miami, Florida. Pacific insured the two buildings for property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">In 2005, Hurricane Wilma struck South Florida and both Cabana Club buildings suffered significant damage as a result. There is no dispute between the parties that damage incurred by the hurricane was a covered loss under the Pacific policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">A dispute arose when both parties could not agree on the dollar amount of damage caused by the hurricane and proceeded to appraisal. Included in the appraisal amount determined was $95,000 for elevator repairs. It was awarded to Cabana Club and Pacific paid the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Thereafter, Cabana Club filed a second claim with Pacific for supplemental monies alleged to be needed to bring its elevators up to code standards. Pacific denied Cabana Club\u2019s claim. Cabana Club then filed a one-count breach of contract action for Pacific\u2019s failure to consider its supplemental claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The district court found that the Florida Elevator Safety Code provides that an elevator may be altered after a qualified elevator contractor secures a permit from the Department of Business and Regulation. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 399.03(1). However, it determined that, in this case, a permit is not required to make repairs because these are not new elevators being \u201cerected, constructed or installed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">The statute expressly excludes repairs (of old elevators) from the definition of alterations (to new elevators). Fla. Stat. \u00a7 399.01(1). In addition, as Cabana Club did not show that any permit request had been rejected, the district court concluded that it was not plausible that Cabana Club was or would be denied a permit to repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">The district court dismissed Cabana Club\u2019s complaint with prejudice. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">We have reviewed the record, the briefs and the arguments of counsel. We find no error. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
