He also moves for appointment of counsel; his motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Stewart gives no indication of the issues he will raise on appeal apart from his conclusional assertion that the district court dismissed his action before he could present evidence. Stewart has failed to brief any issues for his challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is taken in bad faith. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). His IFP motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">This court may sua sponte dismiss an appeal pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 42.2 if \u201cthe merits are so intertwined with the certification decision as to constitute the same issue\u201d and it is apparent that the appeal would lack merit. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1997). The district court\u2019s certification was based on the merits of Stewart\u2019s claim against a particular physician, and therefore is intertwined with the merits of the case. Because Stewart has failed to brief his challenge to the certification, his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Stewart that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b909-7\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
