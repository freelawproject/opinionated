He argues that, notwithstanding his status as a career offender, the district court should have the authority pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), in this <em>post-United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), era of advisory Guidelines, to reduce his sentence based on its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Flakes also argues that his career offender status did not preclude the district court from reducing his sentence because his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 was a necessary starting point in the calculation of his guidelines range, and the career offender Guideline requires a comparison between it and the offense level provided by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-22\">As Flakes acknowledges, his arguments are foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009); <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,---, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b38-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
