On appeal, the Jaffes contend the district court\u2019s order was erroneous because: (1) the Jaffes did not assent to the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs provision of the Application and Agreement governing the Letter of Credit, and (2) the Jaffes were not liable for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 675.111.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">In 2004, the Jaffes executed Bank of America\u2019s Application and Agreement for Standby Letter of Credit (Application and Agreement). On page two, the Application and Agreement included a provision stating the Jaffes would:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-14\">[Ijndemnify and hold Bank of America harmless from and against ... all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees ... and legal expenses) of all claims or legal proceedings arising out of the issuance by Bank of America of the Letter of Credit ... including, without limitation, legal proceedings related to any court order, injunction, or other process or decree seeking to restrain Bank of America from paying any amount under the Letter of Credit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-15\">On appeal, the Jaffes contend they did not assent to this provision on page two of the three-page Application and Agreement. The Jaffes also contend any recovery under this provision should be limited to BOA\u2019s counterclaim for indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-16\">The district court\u2019s finding that the Jaffes executed the Application and Agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>ment, including the page containing the attorney\u2019s fees provision, was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-75, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (stating under the clear error standard, a district court\u2019s factual findings must be upheld if its interpretation of the evidence is plausible). In making this finding, the district court relied upon the parties\u2019 Revised Joint Pretrial Stipulation stating the Jaffes \u201cexecuted an Application and Agreement for Standby Letter of Credit, and are bound by its terms.\u201d The district court also relied on the fact that the Application and Agreement \u2014 including page two \u2014 was marked and admitted into evidence at trial, without objection from the Jaffes. Moreover, \u201cMr. Jaffe himself identified the exhibit as the application while on the stand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The district court also did not err in concluding all of the Jaffes\u2019 claims against BOA fell within the scope of the Application and Agreement\u2019s provision for attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses. The provision is broadly worded, encompassing \u201call costs and expenses ... of all claims or legal proceedings arising out of the issuance by Bank of America of the Letter of Credit....\u201d Here, all of the claims asserted against BOA \u2014 which included an injunction to restrain BOA\u2019s payment of the Letter of Credit, an alleged breach of fiduciary duty, equitable estoppel, and negligent misrepresentation \u2014 purported to arise from the issuance of the Letter of Credit or constituted legal proceedings relating to the Jaffes\u2019 attempt to enjoin BOA from paying the Letter of Credit. Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding BOA was entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under the Application and Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">The district court also concluded BOA was entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation expenses under a separate source, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 675.111(5). On appeal, the Jaffes contend this finding was erroneous because they did not seek injunctive relief against BOA under the Florida Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">Florida Statute \u00a7 675.111(5) states: \u201cReasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses of litigation must be awarded to the prevailing party in an action in which a remedy is sought under this chapter.\u201d There is no dispute BOA was the prevailing party. In both their original and amended complaints, the Jaffes expressly sought an injunction against BOA pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 675.109(2). Under the plain language of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 675.111(5), reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the expenses of litigation <em>must </em>be awarded to BOA, as the prevailing party, because the Jaffes\u2019 suit was an action in which a remedy was sought under chapter 675. Thus, the district court did not err in awarding reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation expenses to BOA, the prevailing party, under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 675.111(5).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-10\">. The Jaffes do not raise any substantive argument regarding the district court's conclusion that Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) is entitled to the proceeds of the posted injunction bond of $150,000. This issue is deemed waived. <em>See United States v. Flores, </em>572 F.3d 1254, 1265 n. 3 (11th Cir.2009). The Jaffes also do not contest the reasonableness of the attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses awarded to BOA. They did not contest reasonableness of BOA\u2019s fees and costs in the district court, either, despite numerous opportunities to do so. This issue is also deemed waived. <em>See Eagle Hosp. Physicians, LLC v. SRG Consulting, Inc., </em>561 F.3d 1298, 1303-04 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-18\">. We review a district court\u2019s order of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for abuse of discretion, reviewing questions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Atlanta Journal &amp; Constitution v. City of Atlanta Dep't of Aviation, </em>442 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b565-6\">. The Jaffes also contend any recovery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 675.111 would be limited to their claim for injunctive relief. We need not consider this issue, as BOA is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees on the Jaffes\u2019 other claims under the Application and Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
