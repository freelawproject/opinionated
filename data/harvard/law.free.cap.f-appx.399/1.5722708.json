For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-27\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b29-28\">Randy Argo sued Brazoria County, Sheriff Charles Wagner, and Officers Jerry Fortenberry and Herman Woods for excessive force and wrongful arrest under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that he was deprived of \u201clife, liberty, or property, without due process of law and or equal protection of the laws [sic] as guaranteed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d Argo also alleged that \u201cdefendants deprived him of his rights, privileges and immunities provided by the First Amendment.\u201d More specifically, Argo claimed that Fortenberry and Woods, who were dispatched to his residence to investigate a nuisance complaint grabbed him by the throat, threw him off his porch and arrested him without probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">The defendants filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or alternatively, for a more definite statement. The district court converted their motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. It granted summary judgment in favor of all the defendants as to Argo\u2019s First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment claims and dismissed Wagner and Brazoria County from the lawsuit. Although Argo specifically pleaded \u201cunlawful arrest, unlawful restraint, official oppression, and/ or outrageous police misconduct\u201d under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, the district court denied summary judgment to Fortenberry and Woods as to Argo\u2019s excessive use of force and false arrest claims holding that \u201cwhen malicious force is used by officers for no apparent law enforcement related purpose, it may form the basis of a Fourth Amendment violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Almost three months after the deadline for filing dispositive motions and five days before trial, Fortenberry and Woods moved for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). In their Rule 12(c) motion they argued that because Argo never alleged a Fourth Amendment cause of action nor alleged excessive force, he pleaded no constitutional violation and his case should be dismissed. The district court denied the motion as untimely. The claims against Fortenberry and Woods were tried before a jury. At the close of evidence, Forten-berry and Woods moved for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b). The court denied the motion. After the parties rested, the district court judge instructed the jury. This included an instruction on whether the defendants met the two-part test for qualified immunity. The jury rendered a verdict exonerating Fortenberry, but found that Woods had used excessive force and awarded Argo $500 in damages. Woods then filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b), arguing that the evidence at trial did not support the jury\u2019s finding that Woods used excessive force against Argo and that he was entitled to qualified immunity. The district court denied Woods\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">On appeal, Woods argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his Rule 12(c) motion as untimely. <em>See Jones v. Coleman Co., Inc., </em>39 F.3d 749, 753-54 (7th Cir.1994) (holding that magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion by permitting summary judgment motion after deadline for good cause, despite district court\u2019s prior denial of motion as untimely under Rule 16(b)); <em>see also </em>5A Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1367, at 514 (1990) (stating that judge has discretion to deny Rule 12(c) motion filed after excessive delay).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">To assist in the speedy and efficient resolution of cases, Rule 16(b) requires the court to enter a scheduling order that limits the time litigants may file motions. Once set, the scheduling order may only be modified by leave of court upon a showing of good cause. Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b). The broader language of Rule 12(c), however, appears to conflict with Rule 16 in that \u201c[ajfter the pleadings are closed but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). We have not directly addressed this apparent conflict, but the court finds <em>Riggins v. Walter, </em>279 F.3d 422 (7th Cir.1995), to be instructive regarding its resolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">Rule 12(c) does not restrict the court\u2019s discretion under Rule 16(b). Just as we have applied Rule 16(b) to a motion pursuant to Rule 56, which states that the motion may be brought \u201cat any time\u201d after certain criteria are met, ... a Rule 12(e) motion may be brought after the dispositive motions deadline if the moving party complies with the requirements of Rule 16(b) and if it will not delay trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 427-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Here, Woods never requested leave to amend the scheduling order deadlines for dispositive motions. Even if we were to construe his Rule 12(c) motion as one requesting leave to amend the scheduling order, Woods fails to give any reason how he meets Rule 16\u2019s fairly stringent \u201cgood cause\u201d standard which requires him to give a persuasive reason why the dates originally set by the scheduling order for the filing of dispositive motions could not \u201creasonably be met despite the diligence of the party seeking the extension.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b) advisory committee\u2019s note (1983); <em>see also Sear-Land Services, Inc. v. D.I.C., Inc., </em>102 F.R.D. 252, 253-54 (S.D.Tex.1984) (denying defendant\u2019s Rule 12(c) motion filed seven months after motion cut-off date because \u201c[t]he Defendant offers the court no explanation or showing of \u2018good cause\u2019 why on the eve of trial the motion should be considered.\u201d). Since Woods has failed to offer any reason why he could not have filed his motion before the deadline, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Next, Woods contends that the district court erred by failing to grant his motion for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b) because the evidence at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that Woods used excessive force against Argo. In considering a Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law following a jury verdict, the court must be \u201cespecially deferential\u201d to the jury\u2019s findings. <em>Brown v. Bryan County, OK, </em>219 F.3d 450, 456 (5th Cir.2000). This court\u2019s standard for evaluating a Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law following a jury verdict is whether \u201cthe state of proof is such that reasonable and impartial minds could reach the conclusion the jury expressed in its verdict.\u201d <em>Am. Home Assur. Co. v. United Space Alliance, </em>378 F.3d 482, 487 (5th Cir.2004). A jury verdict must stand unless there is lack of substantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the successful party, to support the jury\u2019s factual findings, or the legal conclusions implied from the jury\u2019s verdict cannot, in law, be supported by those findings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">To establish an excessive use of force claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate \u201c(1) an injury (2) which resulted directly and only from the use of force that was excessive to the need and (3) the force used was objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Glenn v. City of Tyler, </em>242 F.3d 307, 314 (5th Cir.2001). Further, the \u201cinjury must be more than a de minimis injury and must be evaluated in the context in which the force was deployed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">Our review of the trial transcript indicates that during the trial there was evidence presented to the jury that Woods caused physical injury to Argo that required a doctor\u2019s visit; that the force Woods\u2019s applied to Argo was clearly excessive as applied to the need Argo\u2019s actions presented; and that Woods\u2019s actions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>clearly unreasonable. This evidence was more than sufficient to support the jury\u2019s $500 excessive force verdict against Woods and as a result the district court did not err when it denied Woods\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b29-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
