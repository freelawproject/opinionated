Nardelli argues that the district court erred in denying his motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial. After review, we hold that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support his convictions. We also hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Nardelli\u2019s motion for new trial because the evidence did not preponderate heavily against the jury\u2019s verdicts. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-16\">Nardelli argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal. He claims that because two bank officers testified that they did not believe that Nardelli defrauded them and because they could not point to any particular fraudulent actions Nardelli had taken, there was no \u201ccause and effect\u201d relationship between Nardelli\u2019s conduct and their lending decisions. Thus, Nardelli argues, no reasonable jury could have found him guilty of conspiracy, making false statements, bank fraud, and money laundering. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to support a jury\u2019s verdict in a criminal trial, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. </em>Max<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>well, </em>579 F.3d 1282, 1299 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cAccordingly, we are obliged to resolve any conflicts in favor of the Government, draw all reasonable inferences that tend to support the prosecution\u2019s case, and assume that the jury made all credibility choices in support of the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe will not overturn a conviction on the grounds of insufficient evidence unless no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). It is therefore \u201cnot enough for a defendant to put forth a reasonable hypothesis of innocence, because the issue is not whether a jury reasonably could have acquitted but whether it reasonably could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>473 F.3d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cBecause the jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence, the evidence may be sufficient even if it is not entirely inconsistent with conclusions other than guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d 1270, 1294 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">\u201cTo obtain a conspiracy conviction under \u00a7 371, \u2018the Government must prove (1) that an agreement existed between two or more persons to commit a crime; (2) that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily joined or participated in the conspiracy; and (3) a conspirator performed an overt act in furtherance of the agreement.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Ternus, </em>598 F.3d 1251, 1255 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d at 1294). \u201c[T]he existence of the agreement and a defendant\u2019s participation in the conspiracy may be proven entirely from circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. McNair, </em>605 F.3d 1152, 1195 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">Section 1014 makes it illegal to knowingly make a false statement or report to a federally insured bank. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014. The focus of \u00a7 1014 \u201cis on the defendant\u2019s intent rather than on the victim.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>585 F.2d 119, 124 (5th Cir.1978).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The bank need not be aware that the statement was false, nor does it need to be influenced by the false statement. <em>Id. </em>For these reasons, a defendant may be found guilty of violating \u00a7 1014 if he merely had \u201ca reasonable expectation that the [false] statement would reach [the bank],\u201d and a defendant cannot shield himself from criminal liability by having a third party present the false statement to the bank. <em>United States v. Lentz, </em>524 F.2d 69, 71 (5th Cir.1975). In order to sustain a conviction for bank fraud under \u00a7 1344, the government must show that the defendant knowingly participated in a \u201cscheme or artifice ... to defraud\u201d a federally insured bank of money or property. <em>United States v. McCarrick, </em>294 F.3d 1286, 1290 (11th Cir.2002). As with conspiracy, the government may prove a defendant\u2019s knowledge and participation in the scheme through circumstantial evidence. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>390 F.3d 1319, 1325 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that \u201ccircumstantial evidence may prove knowledge and intent\u201d). \u201cMoney laundering occurs when one \u2018knowingly engages or attempts to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Nolan, 223 </em>F.3d 1311, 1315 (11th Cir.2000) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>(quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957). To prove that a defendant aided and abetted any of these offenses, the government must show \u201cthat [the] substantive offense was committed, that the defendant associated himself with the criminal venture, and that he committed some act which furthered the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Hamblin, </em>911 F.2d 551, 557 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support Nardelli\u2019s convictions. As the district court found, there was ample evidence that Nardelli was a knowing participant in the conspiracy and was guilty of money laundering. There was also sufficient evidence that Nardelli, at a minimum, aided and abetted the making of false statements and bank fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Viewed in a light most favorable to the government, two of his co-conspirators, Tringali and Yanchek, testified and implicated him in the fraudulent scheme. Trin-gali specifically testified that Nardelli was \u201con our team,\u201d and that Nardelli and his co-conspirators were concerned about criminal liability resulting from their frauds. The evidence at trial showed that Nardelli proposed that the co-conspirators enter into sham contracts with entities he controlled, which were then submitted to the lenders for the purpose of falsely demonstrating that his co-conspirators had sufficient capital to meet the banks\u2019 lending requirements. The evidence further showed that Nardelli requested that another individual, Robert Perkins, execute one of these contracts to conceal his involvement in the transaction, which strongly supports Nardelli\u2019s knowledge of the fraudulent activity. There was also evidence that Nardelli was present when statements he knew to be false were made to lenders in an effort to secure financing, and that Nardelli actually submitted financial statements to at least one lender that he knew to be falsified. This evidence is more than sufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that Nardelli knowingly participated in the conspiracy, and that he at least aided and abetted the making of false statements and bank fraud. Given the evidence that Nardelli knowingly participated in the conspiracy and actively furthered the commission of the offenses, there was also sufficient evidence to establish that Nardelli knew that the proceeds he received from the Mercantile Bank loan were derived from the illegal activities. This evidence therefore supports his money laundering conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Nardelli\u2019s argument regarding the bank officers\u2019 testimony is unpersuasive. Nar-delli\u2019s guilt or innocence does not turn on the bank\u2019s understanding, or lack thereof, regarding the nature of the fraud or Nar-delli\u2019s role in it. <em>See, e.g., Johnson, </em>585 F.2d at 124 (\u201cThe [bank\u2019s] awareness of the fraud is not relevant\u201d to whether a violation of \u00a7 1014 occurred). In any event, the other evidence presented at trial was more than sufficient to sustain Nar-delli\u2019s convictions. The district court did not err in denying Nardelli\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">Nardelli argues that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for new trial. He claims that the district court relied too heavily on testimony from codefendants who had pleaded guilty and were seeking a reduced sentence, to the exclusion of bank officers who testified that Nardelli did not induce them to make the loans in question. Relying on our decision in <em>United States v. Hands, </em>184 F.3d 1322 (11th Cir.1999), he says that he is entitled to a new trial because the testimony of the codefendants was the \u201cbackbone\u201d of the government\u2019s case, and that it would be \u201ca miscarriage of justice\u201d if the bank officers\u2019 testimony received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>\u201cless respect than the jaded testimony of cooperating witnesses seeking a reduced sentence from the prosecutor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Tokars, </em>95 F.3d 1520, 1531 (11th Cir.1996). A motion for a new trial on the ground that the verdict is contrary to the weight of the evidence raises issues different from those involved in a motion for a judgment of acquittal based on the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>763 F.2d 1297, 1312 (11th Cir.1985). \u201c \u2018On a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence, the court need not view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. It may weigh the evidence and consider the credibility of the witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>433 F.3d 1328, 1335 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Martinez, </em>763 F.2d at 1312). \u201cIf the court concludes that, despite the abstract sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict, the evidence preponderates sufficiently heavily against the verdict that a serious miscarriage of justice may have occurred, it may set aside the verdict, grant a new trial, and submit the issues for determination by another jury.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted). That said, the district court \u201c \u2018may not reweigh the evidence and set aside the verdict simply because it feels some other result would be more reasonable. The evidence must preponderate heavily against the verdict, such that it would be a miscarriage of justice to let the verdict stand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Butcher v. United States, </em>368 F.3d 1290, 1297 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Martinez, </em>763 F.2d at 1312-13). \u201cMotions for new trials based on weight of the evidence are not favored\u201d and should be granted \u201csparingly and with caution,\u201d and only in \u201cexceptional cases.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>763 F.2d at 1313 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the evidence did not preponderate heavily against the jury\u2019s verdicts. As explained above, there was significant evidence establishing Nardelli\u2019s guilt on the counts of conviction. Although some of that evidence consisted of co-conspirator testimony, the district court found their testimony credible and it was sufficiently corroborated by other evidence presented at trial. Against this evidence, Nardelli relies only on the \u201cfavorable\u201d testimony of the two bank officers. But those individuals had no knowledge of Nardelli\u2019s role in the conspiracy or the commission of the frauds. Their testimony was therefore of minimal value and it does not outweigh, much less heavily so, the evidence of Nar-delli\u2019s guilt. Accordingly, this is not an \u201cexceptional\u201d case in which the evidence heavily preponderates against the jury\u2019s verdicts, such that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow the verdicts to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Nardelli\u2019s reliance on our decision in <em>Hands </em>is misplaced. In that case, we held that the district court erred by admitting irrelevant evidence that the defendant abused his wife. <em>Hands, </em>184 F.3d at 1326-29. In evaluating whether the error was harmless, we considered the potential prejudice that might have resulted against the record as a whole. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-33. We noted that the evidence against Hands consisted almost entirely of \u201chighly questionable\u201d and uncorroborated testimony from alleged co-conspirators. <em>Id. </em>at 1330-32. Because the jury was required to make its decision based on the conflicting testimony of the defendant and his alleged co-conspirators \u2014 in essence, to decide \u201cwhich biased witnesses [it] chose to believe\u201d \u2014 Hands\u2019s credibility was central to his defense. <em>Id. </em>at 1332. We concluded, therefore, that \u201c[ejvidence that tended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>erode Hands\u2019s credibility and to prejudice the jury against him ... could have had a substantial-perhaps overpowering-impact on the jury\u2019s deliberations,\u201d and thus introduction of the evidence of spousal abuse, which the government highlighted, was not harmless.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1332-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">To the extent <em>Hands, </em>which was a harmless error decision, is relevant to the district court\u2019s evaluation of Nardelli\u2019s motion for new trial, it does not support a finding of error. In contrast to the case in <em>Hands, </em>the government\u2019s case against Nardelli did not rest solely on the uncorroborated and \u201chighly questionable\u201d testimony of co-conspirators. To the contrary, Tringali\u2019s and Yanchek\u2019s testimony was consistent, each corroborated the other\u2019s version of events, and the district court found that they testified credibly. Furthermore, their testimony was corroborated by substantial documentary evidence, which supported the jury\u2019s conclusion that Nardelli committed the charged offenses. And finally, as explained above, the evidence Nardelli relies upon is of minimal value. Thus, the district court did not err in denying Nardelli\u2019s motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-13\">. We note that the basis for Nardelli's motion to the district court appears to differ substantially from the argument he now makes. Where a defendant raises a sufficiency of the evidence challenge on appeal, but presents different arguments than were raised before the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hunerlach, </em>197 F.3d 1059, 1068 (11th Cir.1999). We need not decide whether the arguments Nardelli <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>now makes were sufficiently preserved, however, because we find the evidence sufficient even under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-7\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this Court adopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b603-8\">.
