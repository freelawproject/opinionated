He was sentenced to 72 months of imprisonment. The calculation of his guidelines sentencing range of 70 to 87 months included a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 because his prior deportation followed a Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation. Guillen Garcia\u2019s first four arguments are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391 n. 1 (5th Cir.2007). Nonetheless, Guillen Garcia has identified no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-20\">Guillen Garcia asserts that his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment. A 72-month sentence for a first illegal reentry offense by a defendant with a pri- or felony conviction for burglary of a habitation is not grossly disproportionate to the crime. <em>See Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 284-85, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980); <em>United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, </em>987 F.2d 1129, 1134 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-21\">Next, Guillen Garcia contends that his sentence violates the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection, arguing that there is a wide disparity of sentences between those who receive the 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2 and similar offenders who lack a prior aggravated felony conviction. Guillen Garcia fails to show how an alien who was previously deported following conviction for an aggravated felony is situated similarly to an alien without a prior aggravated felony conviction or to any other offender who has committed an offense that has a lower offense level. <em>See Cardenas-Alvarez, </em>987 F.2d at 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-22\">There is no merit to Guillen Garcia\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis; this issue is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009); <em>see also United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>Similarly without merit is Guillen Garcia\u2019s argument that his burglary-of-a-habitation conviction was impermissibly double-counted because it was counted in both his offense level and his criminal history score. <em>See, e.g., Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31. The Guidelines do not prohibit \u201cdouble counting\u201d in this case. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.6); <em>see United States v. Hernandez-Hernandez, </em>356 Fed.Appx. 717, 718-19 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2135, 176 L.Ed.2d 753 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Guillen Garcia challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence and the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness for a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). He asserts that his offense was nothing more than an international trespass. Guil-len Garcia advances no persuasive reason to question the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness or to disturb the district court\u2019s choice of sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006) (implicitly rejecting the contention that the defendant\u2019s illegal reentry was \u201c \u2018at bottom\u2019 \u201d merely \u201can international trespass\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">There is no merit to the argument that Guillen Garcia\u2019s sentence should be shorter because he will serve \u201charder time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b889-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
