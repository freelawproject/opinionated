On appeal, Hammonds alleges that the defendants violated his Fourth Amendment and due process rights by improperly confiscating and retaining his personal property following a forfeiture hearing in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-16\">Federal courts look to state law to determine the applicable statute of limitations for actions brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Rozar v. Mullis, </em>85 F.3d 556, 561 (11th Cir.1996). In Georgia, the applicable statute of limitations for personal injury actions is two years. O.C.G.A, \u00a7 9-3-33. To determine when the cause of action accrues, we look to when the plaintiff knew or should have known of his injury and its cause. <em>Rozar, </em>85 F.3d at 561-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-18\">Upon careful review of the record and consideration of Hammonds\u2019s brief, we affirm, finding no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Hammonds\u2019s claims were barred by the 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions. Thus, Ham-monds\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, a district court must dismiss the complaint of a prisoner if the complaint \u201cis frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Hammond\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
