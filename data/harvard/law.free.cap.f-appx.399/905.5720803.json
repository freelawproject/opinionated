Lab.Code Ann. \u00a7 451.001, <em>et seq., </em>and race, sex, age, and disability discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq.; </em>the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621, <em>et seq.; </em>and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-22\">Matthews complains that the district court disregarded her evidence and instead made credibility determinations. She asserts that she provided evidence to support her claims of discrimination. An initial and dispositive problem is that Matthews fails to provide citations to portions of the record to support her assertions. The summary judgment ruling and assertions Matthews raises on appeal involve record-intensive inquiries. By failing to cite to the record, Matthews has waived consideration of her claims and failed to show that the district court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Cf. </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-23\">Even if we consider Matthews\u2019 claims, the pleadings and evidence do not raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Doddy v. Oxy USA, Inc., </em>101 F.3d 448, 464 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-49, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Largely for the reasons stated in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s thorough Memorandum and Recommendation, which was adopted by the district court, we conclude that all of Matthews\u2019 claims are time-barred, un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>supported by a <em>prima facie </em>case, or lack evidence of a necessary element.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Matthews\u2019 appeal is without arguable merit and, thus, is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. In light of the foregoing, her motion for the production of transcripts at government expense is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b933-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
