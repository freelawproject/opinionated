He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine and was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 to 300 months of imprisonment. By moving to proceed IFP, Sherman is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">On appeal, Sherman argues that he is entitled to resentencing under Amendment 706 to the Guidelines because as a career offender, his offense level was based on the quantity of crack cocaine for which he was held responsible. His guidelines imprisonment range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense but rather from his status as a career offender. Therefore, the district court was correct in concluding that a sentencing reduction was not permitted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">He also challenges his status as a career offender. A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion may not be used to challenge a district court\u2019s calculation of an original sentence or to contest the appropriateness of the sentence. <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). Thus, Sherman\u2019s challenges to his status as a career offender are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-15\">Sherman further argues that he is entitled to a full resentencing under the holding of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and contends that his sentence is unreasonable. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>does not apply to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because such proceedings are not full resentencings. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009); <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, ---, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings). Additionally, the <em>Booker </em>reasonableness standard does not apply in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-23\">Sherman has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b939-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
