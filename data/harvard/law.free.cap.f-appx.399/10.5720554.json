Jackson, federal prisoner #04484-095, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on the recent amendments to the crack cocaine guidelines provision. The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment or, in the alternative, for an extension of time to file a brief on the merits. Although Jackson argues that he was eligible for such a reduction, when a defendant such as Jackson is \u201csubject to a statutory minimum sentence above the upper end of his guideline range, ... 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides no authority to the district court to later modify the sentence based on amendments to the guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 581 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and its alternative motion for an extension of time is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b39-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
