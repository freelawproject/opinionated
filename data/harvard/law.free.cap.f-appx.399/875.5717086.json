He argues, as he did in the district court, that the district court erred when it increased his offense level by four levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(B) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>based on its finding that he brandished a firearm during the offense and when it increased his offense level by six levels pursuant to \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(2)(B) based on its finding that he was accountable for transporting or harboring at least 25, but not more than 99, illegal aliens in the United States. He also argues, for the first time, that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Sentences are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard for procedural error, such as failing to calculate the proper guidelines range, and substantive reasonableness in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Generally, the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo, and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). However, if the defendant fails to object in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">In the instant case, the PSR indicated that (1) three firearms were seized from the stash house during the security sweep; (2) one of the smuggled aliens identified Gonzalez-Mendoza as a guard who carried a semi-automatic handgun; (3) several of the smuggled aliens saw other firearms in the smugglers\u2019 possession; (4) Gonzalez-Mendoza admitted that he found a firearm hidden in the sofa, that he inspected it, and that he returned it to where he had found it; (5) 22 illegal aliens were present at the stash house, including Gonzalez-Mendoza and his four co-defendants; (6) Gonzalez-Mendoza arrived in the United States about 20 days prior to the raid and that he had lived in the stash house since that time; and (7) beginning in February 2009, \u201cat least one to two loads [of aliens]\u201d comprised of two to ten aliens each arrived at the stash house every week.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">Gonzalez-Mendoza\u2019s objections to the PSR with respect to the firearms issue were insufficient to rebut the information contained therein. <em>See United States v. Lowder, </em>148 F.3d 548, 552 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.1995). Given the PSR, the trial court did not clearly err in finding that Gonzalez-Mendoza brandished a firearm for purposes of \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(B) or that he harbored or transported at least 25, but fewer than 99, illegal aliens, for purposes of \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(2). <em>See Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d at 764; <em>United States v. Williams, </em>610 F.3d 271, 292 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Gonzalez-Mendoza\u2019s argument regarding the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, which we also review for plain error, is also without merit. <em>See Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392. The record reflects that the district court considered Gonzalez-Mendoza\u2019s arguments for a below-guidelines sentence but ultimately determined that a sentence at the bottom end of that range was appropriate in light of the circumstances of the case and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Gonzalez-Mendoza essentially seeks to have his sentence vacated based on a reweighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by this court. However, the fact that we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Gonzalez-Mendoza has also failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness afforded his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Accordingly, Gonzalez-Mendoza has failed to show that the district court plainly erred in sentencing him to 37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>months in prison. <em>See Peltier, </em>505 F.3d. at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b903-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
