The district court determined that Robles\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition was premature because his claims were directed to his criminal proceeding, which was active. We note that the district court appears to have treated Robles\u2019 pleading as arising under \u00a7 2241, not \u00a7 2255. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). Robles\u2019 brief is entirely devoted to the merits of his claims for relief. Although he asserts that he properly sought habeas relief pursuant to \u00a7 2241 because he filed his petition prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>to being sentenced, Robles provides no explanation for his conclusory assertion. By failing to address the basis for the district court\u2019s dismissal, Robles has abandoned the threshold issue in this appeal. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b972-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
