After briefing in this case was complete, the Respondent filed an unopposed motion requesting remand of this case in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010). Because the legal basis for the BIA\u2019s determination that Castro-Rodriguez was removable and ineligible for cancellation of removal was invalidated by the Supreme Court in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>we GRANT his petition for review and REMAND this case to the BIA for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b934-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
