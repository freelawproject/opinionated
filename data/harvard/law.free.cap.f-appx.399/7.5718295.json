His motion was based on the amended sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine offenses. His first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, which was based on the same grounds, was denied in 2008, because his sentencing range remained unchanged under the amended guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The district court denied the instant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for the same reasons and denied the IFP motion because Davis had failed to present a good faith issue for appeal. By moving to proceed IFP on appeal, Davis is challenging the district court\u2019s determination. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Davis has failed to brief any issues challenging the certification that his appeal is taken in bad faith, <em>see Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987), and he has not demonstrated that his appeal involves legal points arguable on the merits, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the IFP motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">This court may <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss an appeal pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 42.2 if \u201cthe merits are so intertwined with the certification decision as to constitute the same issue\u201d and it is apparent that the appeal would lack merit. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24. Because Davis has failed to brief his challenge to the certification, and it is apparent that an appeal would lack merit, the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b36-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
