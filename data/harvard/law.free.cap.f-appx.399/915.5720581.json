He was convicted of conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine within 1000 feet of a park and was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 to 188 months of imprisonment. By moving to proceed IFP, Terry is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-21\">On appeal, Terry argues that he was entitled to a sentence reduction despite the fact that he was sentenced as a career offender. He asserts that the district court should have considered his prison disciplinary record and reduced his sentence on this basis. He also contends that the holding of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applies to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-22\">Terry\u2019s guidelines imprisonment range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense but rather from his status as a career offender. Therefore, the district court was correct in concluding that a sentencing reduction was not permitted. See \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir.2009). The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>does not apply to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because such proceedings are not full resentencings. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009); see <em>also Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-27\">Terry has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. His motion for the appointment of counsel is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b943-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
