Segovia had argued that he suffered persecution in El Salvador because of his refusal to join a gang. The BIA concluded that Segovia had not shown that he was targeted for persecution in the past, or would be targeted in the future, because of his membership in a particular social group or for his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-20\">We review the decision of the BIA and will consider the IJ\u2019s decision only to the extent it influenced the BIA. <em>Shaikh v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 861, 863 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cFactual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence, which requires only that the BIA\u2019s decisions be supported by record evidence and be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-21\">\u201c[Withholding of removal is a mandatory form of relief if an alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Shaikh, </em>588 F.3d at 864. An alien must show that one of these protected grounds \u201cwas or will be at least <em>one central reason for persecuting </em>the applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The determination that Segovia has not shown membership in a particular social group or political opinion is supported by the record and is substantially reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 863. Because he has not demonstrated that any protected ground was a central <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>reason for the alleged persecution, Segovia has not demonstrated that the BIA erred in denying withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b968-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
