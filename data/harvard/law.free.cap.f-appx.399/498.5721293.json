Soto appeals his convictions and total sentence of 140 months\u2019 imprisonment imposed after a jury found him guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and seven counts of health care fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1347 and 1349 (Counts 1-8), and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and four counts of money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(l)(B)(i) and (h) (Counts 9-12 and 14). In general, the Government initiated charges against Soto, Eliades Diaz, Leonardo Lozada, and Jose Claro for their involvement in operating Med-Pro Miami (\u201cMed-Pro\u201d), a company established to provide health care products and services but defrauded Medicare by accepting payments without providing such products and services. Soto challenges his convictions on three grounds, and his sentences as unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-17\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-18\">First, Soto argues that the district court erred by denying his motions for judgment of acquittal. He contends that the Government failed to present sufficient evidence to support his convictions because it did not introduce evidence that he came to an agreement with at least one other individual to commit an illegal act. In this respect, he asserts that his mere presence and participation in various meetings and telephone conversations was insufficient, even if he knew of the criminal conduct. Instead, he claims that the evidence only established an agreement between Diaz and the individual who allegedly submitted the fraudulent claims to Medicare.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-19\">We review the denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal <em>de novo. United States v. Evans, </em>473 F.3d 1115, 1118 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cWhen the motion raises a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cTo affirm the denial, we need determine only that a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>factfinder could conclude that the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and ellipsis omitted). Finally, in the context of a motion for acquittal, all \u201ccredibility choices are made in favor of the jury verdict,\u201d and the government\u2019s \u201cevidence need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramsdale, </em>61 <em>F.3d 825, 828-29 (11th </em>Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In general, \u201c[a] conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to accomplish an unlawful plan.\u201d <em>United States v. Chandler, </em>388 F.3d 796, 805 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cWhat distinguishes the offense of conspiracy from a substantive offense, is that agreement is the essential evil at which the crime of conspiracy is directed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 806 (quotation omitted). \u201cThus the government must prove the existence of an <em>agreement </em>to achieve an unlawful objective and the defendant\u2019s <em>knowing </em>participation in that agreement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u201cBecause the essential nature of conspiracy is secrecy, a conspiracy conviction may be proved by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, \u201c[sjince no one can be said to have agreed to a conspiracy that they do not know exists, proof of <em>knowledge </em>of the overall scheme is critical to a finding of conspiratorial intent.\u201d \u201cThe government, therefore, must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy existed, that the defendant <em>knew </em>about it and that he voluntarily agreed to join it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, \u201c[a] defendant may be found guilty of conspiracy if the evidence demonstrates that he knew the \u2018essential objective\u2019 of the conspiracy, even if he did not know all its details or played only a minor role in the overall scheme.\u201d <em>United States v. Guerra, </em>298 F.3d 1279, 1285 (11th Cir.2002). Finally, where a defendant is a member of a conspiracy, the defendant is criminally liable for his co-conspirator\u2019s reasonably foreseeable crimes committed during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. <em>Pinkerton v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 640, 645-48, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 1183-84, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946); <em>United States v. Broadwell, </em>870 F.2d 594, 602 n. 18 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">A. Counts 1-8</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Section 1347 of Title 18 of the U.S.Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">(a) Whoever knowingly and willfully executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">(1) to defraud any health care benefit program; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\">(2) to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any health care benefit program,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-12\">in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347. Furthermore, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349 punishes any person who attempts or conspires to commit a violation of \u00a7 1347, and it subjects any violations \u201cto the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">Drawing all inferences in the Government\u2019s favor and making all credibility determinations in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Soto both conspired to commit health care fraud and committed health care fraud as a result of his participation in the conspiracy. The testimony of Lozada, Diaz, and Claro, who appeared as prosecution witness, was particularly damaging. Claro was the nominal owner and president of Med-Pro; the real owners of the company were Diaz, and Soto (and an unindicted co-conspirator). Med-Pro never provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>any patients with medical equipment and no physician ever ordered any; yet, between the Fall of 2005 and the Spring of 2006, it submitted $5.4 million of false claims to Medicare. In response, Medicare paid Med-Pro approximately $1.35 million. The evidence that Soto was aware of the fraudulent claims and a co-conspirator with the others was overwhelming. We therefore hold that the district court did not err in denying Soto\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal on Counts 1-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">B. Counts 9-12,14</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In order to convict a defendant for money laundering in violation of \u00a7 1956(a)(l)(B)(i), the government must show that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">(1) the defendant conducted or attempted to conduct a financial transaction; (2) the transaction involved the proceeds of a statutorily specified unlawful activity; (3) the defendant knew the proceeds were from some form of illegal activity; and (4) the defendant knew a purpose of the transaction was to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-8\"><em>United States v. Miles, </em>290 F.3d 1341, 1354-55 (11th Cir.2002). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h), \u201c[a]ny person who conspires to commit any offense defined in [section 1956] ... shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.\u201d Where a conspiracy is charged, the government also \u201chas the burden of showing that ... [the defendant] conspired to launder or engage in a monetary transaction involving the \u2018proceeds of specified unlawful activity....\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Khanani, </em>502 F.3d 1281, 1295 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Drawing all inferences in the Government\u2019s favor and making all credibility determinations in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Soto both conspired to commit money laundering and committed money laundering as charged in the indictment. At trial, the Government presented evidence that, after Soto and Diaz agreed that they needed to conceal their involvement in Med-Pro and the fraud, they recruited several individuals to cash Med-Pro checks. The checks allowed the conspirators to obtain the money paid by Medicare to Med-Pro and they were written by Soto and Diaz to appear as though they were for legitimate business purposes. We find no basis for holding that the district court erred in denying Soto\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal on Counts 9-12 and 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">Soto challenges several evidentiary rulings as contrary to the Federal Rules of Evidence. He contends, among other things, that the district court admitted hearsay evidence and rejected his requests for curative instructions. In particular, the court permitted the prosecutor to elicit irrelevant, prejudicial testimony. The courts erroneous rulings, he says, considered both individually and cumulatively, denied him a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1202 (11th Cir.2005). In addition, \u201c[w]e review preserved evidentiary objections for harmless error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Non-constitutional errors are considered harmless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-14\">if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the verdict, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, judgment is due to be affirmed even though there was error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>United States v. Jones, </em>601 F.3d 1247, 1264 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted). Where a defendant alleges cumulative error, \u201c[t]he harmlessness of cumulative error is determined by conducting the same inquiry as for individual error \u2014 courts look to see whether the defendant\u2019s substantial rights were affected.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1223 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In general, Rule 602 provides that, subject to the rules governing opinion testimony and expert witnesses, \u201c[a] witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.\u201d Moreover, Rule 701 provides that, for opinion witnesses not testifying as experts,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">the witness\u2019 testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (e) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Finally, under Rule 704(a), testimony in the form of an opinion or inference, that is otherwise admissible, is not objectionable merely \u201cbecause it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d In terms of hearsay, Rule 802 states that \u201c[hjearsay is not admissible except as provided by these rules or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority or by Act of Congress.\u201d Hearsay is defined as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 801(c). A statement is not hearsay if the statement is offered against a party, and the statement is the party\u2019s own statement or the statement is made by the party\u2019s co-conspirator during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(A) and (E).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">\u201c[T]he cumulative effect of several errors that are harmless by themselves could so prejudice the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial that a new trial might be necessary.\u201d <em>United States v. Preciado-Cordobas, </em>981 F.2d 1206, 1215 n. 8 (11th Cir.1993). \u201cIn addressing a claim of cumulative error, we must examine the trial as a whole to determine whether the appellant was afforded a fundamentally fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1333 (11th Cir.1997). Nevertheless, when a defendant cannot demonstrate any individual errors, \u201cno cumulative errors can exist.\u201d <em>United States v. Waldon, </em>363 F.3d 1103, 1110 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">We have examined each of the evidentia-ry rulings Soto challenges in his brief and conclude that none of the rulings constituted an abuse of discretion. We therefore find no cause for setting aside his convictions and granting him a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">Soto argues that the prosecutor improperly shifted the burden of proof to him during its closing argument to the jury; hence, the court should have declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to grant a mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>475 F.3d 1221, 1227 (11th Cir.2007). A defendant must show substantial prejudice in order to be granted a mistrial. <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1352 (11th Cir.1999). Substantial prejudice \u201coccurs when there is a reasonable probability that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>Newsome, </em>475 F.3d at 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>In general, it is prosecutorial misconduct for a prosecutor to make comments that prejudicially shift the burden of proof to the defendant. <em>United States v. Simon, </em>964 F.2d 1082, 1086 (11th Cir.1992). \u201cSuch prosecutorial misconduct, if so pronounced and persistent that it permeates the entire atmosphere of the trial, requires reversal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Consequently, \u201cprosecutors must refrain from making burden-shifting arguments which suggest that the defendant has an obligation to produce any evidence or to prove innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, even if a prosecutor makes statements that could have resulted in shifting the burden of proof to the defendant, the errors can be cured by a court\u2019s instructions regarding the burden of proof since the jury is presumed to follow jury instructions. <em>Id. </em>at 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Soto cites two of the prosecutor\u2019s statements in support of his argument that the prosecutor shifted the burden of proof to him. He refers first to the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of his defense as an effort to \u201cdistract\u201d the jury from properly considering the Government\u2019s evidence. We fail to understand how this statement somehow shifted the burden of proof. Next, he refers to the prosecutor\u2019s response to his attack on the credibility of Diaz, Claro, and Lozada. All the prosecutor did was to say that Soto\u2019s attorney failed to show where any of these witnesses told the jury a \u201clie.\u201d Again, we fail to find any impropriety in the comment. Nevertheless, even if we were to assume that the prosecutor did attempt to shift the burden, the court instructed the jury that the Government had the burden to prove Soto guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, that Soto was presumed innocent, and that Soto was not required to prove his innocence or produce any evidence at all. In sum, we find no merit in Soto\u2019s burden-shifting argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Soto argues that his total sentence is proeedurally and substantively unreasonable. First, he contends that his sentence is proeedurally unreasonable because the court erred in calculating his applicable Guidelines sentencing range in several respects. Second, he asserts that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because he was entitled to a total sentence below the sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Although the Sentencing Guidelines are now advisory after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district courts are still required to calculate the advisory guidelines range correctly. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). At sentencing, the government has the burden to both prove the applicability of guidelines that enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence and to establish disputed facts by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Polar, </em>369 F.3d 1248, 1255 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThe district court\u2019s factual findings for purposes of sentencing may be based on, among other things, evidence heard during trial, undisputed statements in the PSI, or evidence presented during the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A defendant challenging his sentence bears the burden of establishing that it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). On appeal, the analysis of the reasonableness of a sentence is a two-step process. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we examine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error. Second, after it has been determined that a sentence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>procedurally sound, we review the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">When reviewing for procedural reasonableness, we ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as: (1) improperly calculating the defendant\u2019s sentencing range; (2) treating the Guidelines as mandatory; (3) failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; (4) selecting the sentence based on clearly erroneous facts; or (5) failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">On the other hand, a sentence is substantively unreasonable \u201cif it does not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (quotation omitted). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-7\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). The weight the district court accords to \u201cany given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court....\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). Moreover, there is an expectation of reasonableness when a district court imposes a sentence within the applicable guidelines range. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">A. Whether Soto\u2019s total sentence is procedurally unreasonable</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">1. Loss amount under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">Soto argues that the court incorrectly calculated his loss amount under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l). In this respect, he contends that the court made insufficient findings as to loss; he says that the proper loss amount was the actual loss of approximately $1.3 million Medicare suffered because nothing in the record indicates that he intended losses of around $4.5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">\u201cA district court\u2019s determination regarding the amount of loss for sentencing purposes is reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Medina, </em>485 F.3d 1291, 1303 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). Overall, the court needs only to \u201cmake a reasonable estimate of the loss amount.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(C)). Moreover, the court\u2019s loss determination is entitled to deference because \u201c[t]he sentencing judge is in a unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the loss based upon the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, a court cannot speculate concerning the existence of a fact that permits a more severe sentence under the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>595 F.3d 1324, 1327 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">\u201cWhen the district court determines the loss calculation under the Guidelines, \u2018the loss is the greater of actual loss or intended loss.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Hoffman-Vaile, </em>568 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A))). \u201c \u2018Actual loss\u2019 means the reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)(i)). On the other hand, \u201cintended loss\u201d is the monetary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>harm \u201cthat was intended to result from the offense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.3(A)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Furthermore, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l) provides that for \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity,\u201d a defendant\u2019s base offense level shall be determined based on \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,\u201d that occurred during the preparation for, commission of, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for the offense of conviction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l). Thus, where losses result from a conspiracy, \u201cthe district court may hold all participants in a conspiracy responsible for the losses resulting from the reasonably foreseeable acts of co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabbs, </em>134 F.3d 1071, 1082 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Soto has not demonstrated that the district court clearly erred by finding that the loss amount for his fraud was $4.3 million. Soto has failed to establish that it was not reasonably foreseeable that Med-Pro would submit $4.3 million in collectible claims to Medicare, which is greater than the amount of the actual loss. Thus, as a member of the conspiracy, he was responsible for Med-Pro\u2019s reasonably foreseeable actions taken in furtherance of the conspiracy and the larger intended loss amount of $4.3 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">2. Sophisticated means enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(9)(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Soto argues that the court improperly applied a two-level enhancement for use of sophisticated means, pursuant to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C). Specifically, he contends that there was nothing especially complex or intricate about the conspirators\u2019 fraud and that it is \u201cdifficult to imagine\u201d a less complex scheme to commit health care fraud. In addition, he claims that nothing in regard to the money-laundering scheme was sophisticated because the conspirators merely used individuals to cash checks and they did not even take precautions to avoid bank security cameras.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">We review a district court\u2019s finding that a defendant utilized sophisticated means for clear error. <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1267 (11th Cir.2010). The Guidelines provide for an enhancement of two levels if the offense in question \u201cinvolved sophisticated means.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C). Application note 8(B) to that Guideline states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-11\">\u201csophisticated means\u201d means especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense. For example, in a telemarketing scheme, locating the main office of the scheme in one jurisdiction but locating soliciting operations in another jurisdiction ordinarily indicates sophisticated means. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts also ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.8(B)). \u201cThere is no requirement that each of a defendant\u2019s individual actions be sophisticated in order to impose the enhancement. Rather, it is sufficient if the totality of the scheme was sophisticated.\u201d <em>Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">Soto has not demonstrated that the district court clearly erred by finding that his offenses involved the use of sophisticated means. At trial, the Government presented evidence that, after Soto invested in Med-Pro, he worked to appoint Claro as Med-Pro\u2019s nominee owner in order to conceal his involvement in the fraud. In addition, Soto recruited several individuals to cash Med-Pro checks so that they could further conceal his involvement. Based on this evidence, the district court did not clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>err in finding that the conspiracy employed sophisticated means.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">3. Soto\u2019s role in the offenses under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3B1.1 and 3B1.2</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Soto contends that the court clearly erred by applying a three-level increase under \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) for being a manager or a supervisor, because the evidence merely indicated that he utilized a few acquaintances to cash checks and nothing suggested that he gave orders or recruited any individuals into the overall conspiracy. Soto asserts that the evidence indicated that others were the managers or organizers, and thus, the court should have granted him a two-level minor-role reduction instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">A district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense is a finding of fact that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), a defendant receives a three-level increase in his offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">A \u201c \u2018participant\u2019 is a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.l). Factors that a court should consider in determining whether an aggravating-role increase applies include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-11\"><em>Id., </em>comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">Conversely, a mitigating-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 is available \u201cfor a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)). Under \u00a7 3B1.2(b), a two-level reduction for playing a minor role is appropriate if the defendant is \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">Soto fails to demonstrate that the court\u2019s finding as to his role in the offense was clear error. At trial, the Government presented evidence that, after Soto invested in Med-Pro, he and Diaz appointed Claro as a nominee owner, directed Claro\u2019s actions, recruited several individuals to cash Med-Pro checks, and directed those individuals in cashing checks. Thus, not only was the three-level increase for being a manager or supervisor appropriate, Soto has failed to demonstrate that the court clearly erred by denying him a two-level minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">4. Obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">Soto argues that he should not have received a two-level increase for obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1. Soto asserts that his statement during an interview with the FBI misidentifying Claro in a picture as someone else, did not amount to obstruction of justice because the evidence indicated that Soto actually believed his identification was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-16\">When a district court imposes an obstruction-of-justice enhancement, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and the application of those facts to the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number><em>United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2006). The Sentencing Guidelines provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">If (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. One example of conduct covered by \u00a7 3C1.1 includes \u201cproviding a materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that significantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(g)). An example of conduct not ordinarily covered by \u00a7 3C1.1 includes \u201cmaking false statements, not under oath, to law enforcement officers, unless Application Note 4(g) ... applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.5(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Soto fails to show that the district court erred by finding that a two-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement applied. The Government presented evidence that he intentionally misidentified a picture of Cla-ro as depicting someone else. After Soto\u2019s misidentification, the FBI investigated and interviewed the person Soto identified to determine whether he had any involvement in the fraud. Because Soto\u2019s mis-identification impeded the investigation of the fraud, the two-level enhancement was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">5. Evidentiary errors</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Soto argues that the court erred by allowing, over his objections, irrelevant evidence, hearsay, and testimony that violated the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. Furthermore, in a footnote, he submits that his sentence violates the Fifth Amendment because the facts supporting his enhancements were not charged in his indictment, and he cites law suggesting that his sentence enhancements violate the Sixth Amendment because they were not found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">In general, at sentencing, a court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhG\">may consider any information, (including hearsay), regardless of its admissibility at trial, in determining whether factors exist that would enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence, provided that the evidence has sufficient indicia of reliability, the court makes explicit findings of fact as to credibility, and the defendant has an opportunity to rebut the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-13\"><em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1253. Furthermore, we have stated that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Crawford<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not address a sentencing court\u2019s use of hearsay and our decision \u201cthat a sentencing court may base sentencing determinations on reliable hearsay is still good law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1254 n. 68; <em>see also United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1146 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe right to confrontation is not a sentencing right.\u201d). Finally, there is no violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments where a district court \u201cfind[s] facts at sentencing so long as the judicial factfinding does not increase the defendant\u2019s sentence beyond the <em>statutory </em>maximum triggered by the facts conceded or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d at 1268 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">Soto has failed to demonstrate that the court committed any evidentiary errors at sentencing. First, because a court can rely on any information at sentencing, provided that the evidence has sufficient indi-cia of reliability, the court makes sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>findings as to credibility, and the defendant has the opportunity to rebut the evidence, Soto\u2019s mere assertion that court erred by allowing irrelevant evidence and hearsay does not establish error. Furthermore, because the right to confrontation does not apply at sentencing, and Soto was not sentenced beyond the statutory maximum, he has not establish a violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">B. Whether Soto\u2019s total sentence is substantively unreasonable</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Soto argues that his total sentence is substantively unreasonable because a downward variance from his applicable sentencing range was appropriate. First, he claims that his \u201cextraordinary family responsibilities\u201d merit a total sentence below the sentencing range. Second, he emphasizes that defendants in other Medicare fraud cases have received lesser sentences, and he notes that Diaz received a 60-month sentence, Lozada received a 46-month sentence, and Claro received a 31-month sentence. Consequently, Soto asserts that a total sentence below the sentencing range was necessary to avoid an unwarranted sentencing disparity. Finally, he contends that his loss amount overstates the seriousness of his culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Soto has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a total sentence of 140 months\u2019 imprisonment. Because he is not similarly situated to the other conspirators or defendants in other health care fraud cases, he cannot establish any unwarranted sentencing disparity. Furthermore, the court determined that the need to punish him and deter others from criminal activity outweighed other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Thus, his mere disagreement with this analysis does not show that the court abused its discretion. Finally, Soto\u2019s sentence falls within the Guidelines sentencing range, a sentence that we normally expect to be reasonable. In sum, he fails to establish that his total sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">For the reasons we have stated, Soto\u2019s convictions and sentences are</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-10\">. <em>Crawford v.
