Mask argues that the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to reduce his sentence was contrary to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 364, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 108-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Spears v. United States, 555 </em>U.S. 261, 129 S.Ct. 840, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009). He argues that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994 does not require courts to impose the statutory maximum sentence. Mask contends that the district court should have recalculated his advisory guidelines range in accord with <em>Booker </em>and without the two-level firearm enhancement; that the district court was free to disagree with the crack cocaine guidelines provision; and that the district court erred in not considering his postsentence rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-24\">Contrary to Mask\u2019s argument, this court\u2019s precedent forecloses his assertion that the career offender Guideline does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>preclude a reduction of his sentence. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790 &amp; n. 4, 791 &amp; n. 8 (5th Cir.2009). His arguments based on <em>Booker </em>and its progeny are foreclosed by <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010), and <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Further, <em>Spears </em>is distinguishable because it did not involve a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Spears, </em>129 S.Ct. at 841-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">Mask\u2019s argument that the district court should have resentenced him without the two-level firearm enhancement is incorrect. A motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cis not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the sentencing judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). Therefore, this claim is not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582 motion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b974-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
