Alaven sells its DrNatu-ra-branded products directly to consumers over the internet. Appellee DrFloras, LLC manufactures and sells non-prescription herbal supplements and intestinal cleanser products under the mark DrFlo-ras. DrFloras sells its products directly to consumers over the internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-20\">Alaven sued DrFloras, alleging trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114, federal unfair competition and false designation of origin under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), trademark dilution, and various state law claims. Alaven\u2019s trademark infringement and unfair competition claims were based on its allegations that defendant\u2019s \u201cDrFloras\u201d mark could likely cause confusion among consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-21\">The district court granted DrFloras\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment, finding that Alaven\u2019s \u201cDrNatura\u201d mark and \u201cDrFloras\u201d were insufficiently similar to create triable issues of either trademark infringement or unfair competition. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>district court dismissed Counts I, II, V, VI, VII, and IX of Alaven\u2019s Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The parties jointly moved to have the district court\u2019s summary judgment order certified for immediate appellate review pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). In their motion, the parties stated that they wanted an immediate appeal to avoid the possibility of \u201ctwo disjointed trials,\u201d and that the outcome of this appeal would affect their desire to proceed with the pending false advertising claims. The district court granted the motion and certified this case under Rule 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Before us on appeal is the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Count I (federal trademark infringement) and Count II (federal unfair competition and false designation of origin). Alaven argues that the district court erred 1) in determining the strength of Alaven\u2019s mark and in assessing the similarities between the marks; 2) in determining that \u201cactual confusion\u201d was a \u201cmost important\u201d factor in assessing a competing mark\u2019s likelihood of confusion; 3) in determining that an inference of bad faith should not be drawn from DrFloras\u2019 actions; 4) by evaluating Alaven\u2019s count for federal unfair competition under the same rubric as the count for federal trademark infringement; and 5) in refusing to grant Alaven\u2019s request for Rule 56(f) discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Trademark law only prohibits the use of a mark or name if, when used in connection with a third party\u2019s goods or services, the mark is likely to cause consumer confusion regarding the source, sponsorship, or origin of those services. <em>Frehling Enters., Inc. v. Int\u2019l Select Group, Inc., </em>192 F.3d 1330, 1335 (11th Cir.1999). In our circuit, \u201c[ajlthough likelihood of confusion is a question of fact, it may be decided as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Tana v. Dantanna\u2019s, </em>611 F.3d 767, 775 n. 7 (11th Cir.2010) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Alaven challenges the district judge\u2019s analysis. We do not vacate and remand an order granting summary judgment merely for an error in analysis, however. We will affirm if the result is correct. <em>See, e.g., Allen v. Bd. of Pub. Educ. of Bibb Cnty., </em>495 F.3d 1306, 1311 (11th Cir.2007) (disagreeing with the district court\u2019s analysis, but affirming its grant of summary judgment). After a review of the record, we agree with the district court\u2019s disposition of Alaven\u2019s claims because there is insufficient evidence of likelihood of confusion between the two marks to warrant trial. And, Alaven\u2019s argument that the district court should have evaluated Alaven\u2019s count for federal unfair competition under a different rubric than the count for federal trademark infringement is an issue that Alaven failed to raise in the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe law in our circuit is clear that \u2018arguments not presented in the district court will not be considered for the first time on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sterling Fin. Inv. Grp., Inc. v. Hammer, </em>393 F.3d 1223, 1226 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Mills v. Singletary, </em>63 F.3d 999, 1008 n. 11 (11th Cir.1995)). Further, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Alaven\u2019s motion for leave to conduct discovery under Rule 56(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-8\">. In its memorandum in support of its motion for partial summary judgment, DrFloras argued that the analyses were the same for trademark infringement and federal unfair competition. (R. 2-9, Ex. 1, Memorandum of Law lat 10 n. 5). Alaven failed to contend otherwise in its Response in Opposition to DrFloras' Motion (R. 3-20), in its Supplement to Its Response in Opposition (R. 4-21, Supplement), or in its Sur-Reply Brief (R. 4-28, Sur-Reply Brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
