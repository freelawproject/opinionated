He pleaded guilty to one count of distribution of crack cocaine, and he received an amended sentence of 180 months of imprisonment. By moving to proceed IFP, Blackmon is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-20\">The district court denied Blackmon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in its exercise of discretion. In this court, Blackmon merely asserts that the guideline amendment is applicable to his sentence, and he requests that this court reduce his sentence accordingly. He does not challenge the reasons given by the district court for its denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and he has therefore abandoned the issue. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-21\">Blackmon also maintains that trial and appellate counsel should have raised objections and arguments regarding drug quantity based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Blackmon\u2019s claim regarding the validity of his original sentence is not properly presented in this \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. White-bird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-22\">Blackmon has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b931-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
