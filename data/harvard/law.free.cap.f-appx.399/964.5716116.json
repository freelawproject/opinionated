Lane\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file a reply brief is GRANTED. His motions to strike the appellee\u2019s brief and to order the unserved defendants to file a brief are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Cousin v. Small, </em>325 F.3d 627, 637 (5th Cir.2003). Lane was required under \u00a7 1997e(a) to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 202, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007); <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 515 (5th Cir.2004). Proper exhaustion is required, meaning that the prisoner must not only pursue all available avenues of relief; he must also comply with all administrative deadlines and procedural rules. <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 89-95, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006). Because exhaustion is an affirmative defense, Jair Santana, the party moving for summary judgment, had the burden to demonstrate that Lane failed to exhaust available administrative remedies and was required to establish \u201cbeyond peradventure all of the essential elements of the defense of exhaustion to warrant summary judgment\u201d in his favor. <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-15\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Lane, the summary judgment evidence reveals no genuine issue of material fact on the issue whether Lane failed to complete the required steps of the Harris County Jail grievance procedure with respect to his November 30, 2004, grievance, which alleged excessive force by Joseph G. Hejl III. Lane\u2019s grievance raised no allegations involving Santana, Sergeant John Doe, or Captain John Doe and did not allege delayed medical care or retaliation. Because Lane failed to complete the administrative review process, the district court did not err in dismissing Lane\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See Ngo, </em>548 U.S. at 93, 126 S.Ct. 2378. We find no error in the decision to award summary judgment to the unserved defendants. <em>See NL Indus., Inc. v. GHR Energy Corp., </em>940 F.2d 957, 965 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b993-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
