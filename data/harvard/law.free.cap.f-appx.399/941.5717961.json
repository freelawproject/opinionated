He contends that his sentence is unreasonable and that the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 by failing to allow him or his counsel to provide information relevant to the mitigation of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-22\">Diaz has completed his sentence, has been released from custody, and has been removed to Mexico. The appeal of his sentence is therefore moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b969-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
