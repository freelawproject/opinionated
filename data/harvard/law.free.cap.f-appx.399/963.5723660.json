The Government has moved for summary affirmance or, in the alternative, for an extension of time to \u00f1le a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Russell argues that the district court abused its discretion in failing to reduce his sentence by two levels under the November 1, 2007, crack cocaine amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, including Amendment 706. However, Russell was sentenced pursuant to Amendments 706 and 711, both of which became effective on November 1, 2007, before his sentencing. Additionally, to the extent that Russell\u2019s argument is liberally construed to contend that his sentence should be reduced under Amendment 715, which became effective on November 1, 2008, the application of the amendment would not have affected his guidelines range, and thus he is not entitled to a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) on this basis. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Liberally construed, Russell\u2019s brief also argues that the drug quantity for which he was held accountable and the two-level increase in his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) were erroneously based on charges that were later dismissed and were calculated in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), based on facts that were not charged in the indictment. However, a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cis not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the sentencing judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir. 1995). Furthermore, this court has recognized that <em>Booker </em>did not alter the mandatory character of \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s limitations on sentence reductions. <em>See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238. Therefore, these claims are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1011; <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-13\">In light of the foregoing, Russell has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672. The motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, and the Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b991-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
