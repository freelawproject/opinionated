His convictions resulted from an investigation of the activities of a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>enterprise that smuggled cocaine into the United States through female couriers who transported the drugs from the Bahamas aboard day cruises originating in Port Everglades, Florida. On appeal, Larose argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for a mistrial because its curative instruction was insufficient to remedy the unfair prejudice that resulted from a co-conspirator\u2019s comment at La-rose\u2019s trial that another district was handling her case because of safety concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">When properly preserved, we review a district court\u2019s decision not to grant a mistrial for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>565 F.3d 1324, 1334 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1032, 175 L.Ed.2d 632 (2009). \u201cThe decision to grant a mistrial is -within the discretion of the trial judge since he is in the best position to evaluate the prejudicial effect of a statement or evidence on the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Saget, </em>991 F.2d 702, 707-08 (11th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>United States v. Blakey, </em>960 F.2d 996, 1000 (11th Cir.1992)). To establish entitlement to a mistrial, a defendant \u201cmust show that his substantial rights are prejudicially affected;\u201d that is, there is a reasonable probability that, but for the statement, the outcome of the trial would have been different. <em>Emmanuel, </em>565 F.3d at 1334 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe make th[at] determination in the context of the entire trial and in light of any curative instruction.\u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>475 F.3d 1221, 1227 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"Ap7\">\u201cWhen a court gives a direct and explicit curative instruction regarding improper testimony, it supports the court\u2019s decision not to grant a mistrial by decreasing the possibility of undue prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>30 F.3d 1407, 1411 (11th Cir.1994). Moreover, when a curative instruction has been given, \u201cwe will reverse only if the evidence is so highly prejudicial as to be incurable by the trial court\u2019s admonition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1410 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe voicing of potentially prejudicial remarks by a witness is common, and any prejudice is generally cured efficiently by cautionary instructions from the bench.\u201d <em>United States v. Evers, </em>569 F.2d 876, 879 (5th Cir.1978). This is so because \u201c[a] jury is presumed to follow the instructions given to it by the district judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Mock, </em>523 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1352 (11th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">In light of the overwhelming evidence of Larose\u2019s guilt and the district court\u2019s curative instruction, we conclude from the record that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Larose\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Accordingly, we affirm his convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\">. We also DENY Larose's motion to relieve counsel and to request appointment of new counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
