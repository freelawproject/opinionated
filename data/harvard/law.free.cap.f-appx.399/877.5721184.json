He appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court improperly determined that his second state conviction for simple drug possession was an aggravated felony for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C)\u2019s eight-level offense-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-22\">In his opening brief, Perez Paniagua correctly conceded that this argument was foreclosed by our then-current precedent. Shortly after Perez Paniagua filed his brief, however, the Supreme Court decided <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010), holding that a second state offense for simple drug possession is not an aggravated felony where that conviction \u201chas not been enhanced based on the fact of a prior conviction.\u201d <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2589. In its brief, the Government acknowledges that the record does not establish that Perez-Paniagua\u2019s second simple drug-possession conviction was based on his prior simple possession offense. The Government thus concedes that the case should be remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-25\">Accordingly, Perez Paniagua\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b905-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
