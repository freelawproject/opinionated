Bricker appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint, brought <em>in forma pauperis, </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). A district court must dismiss an action brought <em>in forma pauperis </em>upon determining that the action: (1) is frivolous or malicious; (2) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; or (3) seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). The district court dismissed Bricker\u2019s complaint for multiple reasons, concluding that (1) the complaint was barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata; </em>(2) the complaint was barred by the applicable statute of limitations; (3) the complaint failed to establish federal question or diversity jurisdiction; (4) the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>failed to establish venue in the Northern District of Georgia; and (5) the complaint asserted claims against Defendants who are immune from suit or not subject to the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction. We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2), taking the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">We need not address all of the district court\u2019s bases for dismissal, as \u201c[tjhis court may affirm on any ground supported by the record.\u201d <em>Welding Servs., Inc. v. Forman, </em>509 F.3d 1351, 1356 (11th Cir.2007). We agree with the district court that Brieker\u2019s complaint is barred by the applicable statute of limitations. All of Brick-er\u2019s allegations stem from her 1987 divorce proceedings in Cobb County, Georgia. Specifically, she claims that various attorneys, bank officials, and local, state, and federal officials and judges conspired to alter documents related to a real property mortgage without her knowledge in 1987 and that the Veterans Administration illegally foreclosed on her property in Largo, Florida, in 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Bricker\u2019s complaint alleges a federal claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, as she argues on appeal, \u201c[a]ll constitutional claims brought under \u00a7 1983 are tort actions, subject to the statute of limitations governing personal injury actions in the state where the \u00a7 1983 action has been brought.\u201d <em>McNair v. Allen, </em>515 F.3d 1168, 1173 (11th Cir.2008). Bricker brought her claims in Georgia, where the governing limitations period is two years. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-3-33; <em>Porter v. Ray, </em>461 F.3d 1315, 1323 (11th Cir.2006). A cause of action under \u00a7 1983 accrues, and thereby sets the limitations clock running, when the plaintiff knows or should know (1) that she has suffered the injury that forms the basis of her complaint and (2) who has inflicted the injury. <em>Chappell v. Rich, </em>340 F.3d 1279, 1283 (11th Cir.2003). Based on the facts alleged in Bricker\u2019s complaint, it is apparent that the statute of limitations would have expired well over a decade before she filed this federal action in the district court. <em>See Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng\u2019rs and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment CSX Transp. N. Lines v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>522 F.3d 1190, 1194 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cA Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal on statute of limitations grounds is appropriate only if it is apparent from the face of the complaint that the claim is time-barred.\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding that Bricker\u2019s complaint was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
