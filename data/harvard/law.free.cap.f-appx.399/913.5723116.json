He pleaded guilty to distribution of crack cocaine and was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 to 151 months in prison. By moving to proceed IFP, Hart is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">On appeal, Hart argues that he is entitled to resentencing under Amendment 706 to the Guidelines. His guidelines imprisonment range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense but rather from his status as a career offender. Therefore, the district court was correct in concluding that a sentencing reduction was not permitted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">Additionally, Hart challenges his status as a career offender. A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion may not be used to challenge a district court\u2019s calculation of an original sentence or to contest the appropriateness of the sentence. <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). Thus, Hart\u2019s challenges to his status as a career offender are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-15\">Next, Hart argues that because the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the sentencing judge was entitled to disagree with the career offender provisions and could have imposed a lower sentence. He maintains that the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and failed to provide reasons for the sentence imposed. <em>Booker </em>does not apply to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because such proceedings are not full resentencings. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 - U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009); <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-20\">Hart has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir. 1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Hart\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b942-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
