The Riparian act of 18G9, which gives the riparian commissioners power to make grants of lands of the state under tide-waters to other persons than riparian owners, applies only to the tide-waters of the Hudson river, New York bay aDd Kill von Kull, lying between Engard\u2019s dock on the Kill von Kull and the New York State line. Provision for grants of the state\u2019s lands under tide-water by the commissioners elsewhere than within the territory designated in the act of 1869, is made by the act of March 21st, 1871, which authorizes grants to riparian owners only.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-12\">2. W., the owner of a farm situate on the tide-waters of the Delaware river, in 1808 conveyed to F., his heirs and assigns, \u201cthe sole right, use and enjoyment for all purposes of fishing whatsoever, and for no other purpose, <em>\u201c </em>of a strip of land, the boundaries of which were along the middle of an artificial bank four feet wide on top, which had been constructed to prevent the flow of tides over the lowland, until the line strikes the natural bank, thence to a stone near the Delaware river, and from thence into the river to,low-water mark, thence, &amp;c.; with a covenant of warranty against all persons claiming under the grantor or his heirs. In 1819 W. conveyed the farm to N., with an exception and reservation of the fishery, and privileges granted to F. by the deed of 1818. In 1876 the plaintiff, who acquired title under N., obtained from the riparian commissioners a grant of the state\u2019s land\u2019under tide-water in front of the premises. In an action of trespass against persons who had succeeded to the fishery and rights granted by W. to F. by the deed of <em>1818\u2014Held, </em>that the deed to F. conveyed an actual estate in the strip of land next to the river, and he became thereby riparian owner; and that if the estate granted to F. and his heirs and assigns was so qualified, as to use, that neither he nor they could make a grant from the state available, the intervention of it between the upland and the river would make the plaintiff's grant from the riparian commissioners inoperative as against the estate and rights granted and conveyed by W. to F. by the deed of 1818.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-13\">On error to the Gloucester Circuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-14\">This suit is an action of trespass to recover damages for an unlawful entry upon lands of the plaintiff, situate in the township of West Deptford, in the county of Gloucester, consisting in part of upland and in part of land under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>waters of the Delaware river.

William F. Newbold afterwards, by a deed dated December 29th, 1874, conveyed one hundred and sixty-five and twenty-nine hundredths acres, part of the lands he had acquired under his father\u2019s will, and by releases from his co-devisees, to Robert K. Matlock, and Matlock conveyed the same premises to William Fitzgerald, the plaintiff, by a deed dated January 27th, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-9\">Fitzgerald, the plaintiff, on the 10th of March, 1877, obtained from the riparian commissioners a grant of. a lease of lands flowed by the tide-waters of the Delaware, and extending out twelve hundred feet to the exterior wharf line established by the riparian commissioners. The grant of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>riparian commissioners embraces all the land under water lying between high-water mark and the exterior line in front \u25a0of the last two lots described in the deed from Whitall to Christian Faunce of December 4th, 1818. The trespasses complained of were upon the first of these two tracts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-4\">The fishery had been worked before 1818. The Faunces had been taxed for it as <em>a </em>fishery from 1818 or 1819. In 1820 Christian Faunce filed a description of the fishing place in the clerk\u2019s office pursuant to the statute. <em>Rev., p. </em>428, \u00a7 18. In April, 1881, a description of it was again filed by the then owners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-5\">Daniel Faunce, Jr., the defendant, succeeded to the rights and estate granted and conveyed to Christian Faunce by Whitall, and in virtue of this privity of estate justified the acts coniplained of as trespasses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-6\">This cause was tried before Justice Parker in the Gloucester county Circuit Court, in which the action was brought, and was removed into this court by writ \u00f3f error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-7\">Upon submitting the cause to the jury, the court charged as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-8\">Gentlemen of the Jury\u2014This suit is in the form of trespass. The plaintiff in his declaration complains that on the 1st day of April, 1881, and on other days afterwards, up to the time of the commencement of this suit, the defendant, with his workmen, broke and entered the close of the plaintiff, situated in the township of West Deptford, in this county, and committed various acts of trespass thereon as set forth in the declaration, by means of which the plaintiff suffered damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-9\">The suit is brought to recover damages for a series of alleged trespasses occurring in the months of April and May, in the year 1881. The premises on which the trespasses are charged to have been committed are described in the declaration as part upland, and part land under the tide-waters of the river Delaware, and lie contiguous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-10\">To prove title to the upland, several deeds are put in evidence. It appears that a little before the beginning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>present century, the farm of plaintiff was part of a larger tract owned by Trent Francis, and that after his death it was conveyed by his widow and executrix to one Samuel Whitall, who subsequently conveyed to one William Newbold. After the death of William Newbold, his devisees quit-claimed to his son, William F. Newbold; he conveyed to Robert K. Matlock, from whom the plaintiff received his deed on the 27th of January, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-5\">Although the description in these deeds calls for low-water mark, in law they conveyed only to high water, for a reason which will hereafter appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-6\">The other part of the premises, adjoining the upland along high-water mark and running out in the river in front of his farm, the plaintiff claims under what is called a perpetual lease, with the privilege of obtaining an absolute grant at a fixed price. This lease -was given to plaintiff by the riparian commissioners on the part of the State of New Jersey, or rather by the state through the commissioners and governor for the time being on the 10th of March, 1877. The description in the lease includes the land flowed by the tide-waters of the Delaware river and Great Mantua creek, beginning at a point in high-water mark of the river in the centre of the road leading from the Crown Point road to the river; thence north, twenty-eight degrees and twenty minutes west, twelve hundred feet, to the exterior wharf line established in the river by the riparian commissioners, and thence down the river, following the exterior wharf line as far as plaintiff\u2019s farm extends, and being all the land under the tide-waters of the river in front of plaintiff\u2019s farm from high-water mark to said exterior line, excepting only land under water in front of the small upper cabin lot of the Faunces, because plaintiff was not riparian owner of that lot. \u2022 This lease was made by the state to the plaintiff as riparian proprietor, under and by virtue of the statutes of the state on that subject. The papers in the cause show that at the time of the lease he was riparian owner. The deeds before mentioned and this lease included the <em>loeus in quo </em>as described in the declaration, and embrace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>all the premises both above and below high-water mark, on which the several trespasses were alleged to have been committed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-4\">That the defendant and his workmen did the acts which the plaintiff charges as trespasses at the time and places alleged within the description of these conveyances and lease, is not denied. The defendant admits that he took down the fence, or directed it done; that he led the horses through on the land inside the bank, and on the bank, whenever it was necessary for the purposes of a fishery to take them to and from the windlasses; that the windlasses were placed permanently in the soil, part on outside and part inside or on the bank, and were kept there year after year, and used by him in 1881; that he and his men used the bank in the prosecution of their business of fishing throughout the season of 1881; that at high water they made hauls and took out the fish near the foot of the bank, and at low water just outside the flats, and occupied the flats included in the plaintiff\u2019s lease so far as was necessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-5\">Now, if defendant had no legal right to do the acts complained of, if neither he nor the persons under whom he was acting had a right of several fishery there, these acts were trespasses for which the true owner of the land should recover damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-6\">My instructions to you, gentlemen, are, that upon the evidence produced by the plaintiff, and thus far stated by mej the plaintiff was the owner of the <em>loous in quo, </em>whether above or below high-water mark, and you will so find unless the defendant has proved a better title or has made out a legal justification of'his acts by virtue of a right in himself or those under whom he acted to a several fishery there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-7\">The defendant claims that he had such right and that he has shown it, and is therefore.justified in what he did. If this be so, if he has shown such right, he is entitled to your verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-8\">If the defendant, in the fishing season of 1881, had the legal right to fish there with as many men as was necessary to operate the fishery to advantage, he was not a trespasser, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>\u2022unless, in the prosecution of the work, he or those under him,' with his command or knowledge, did unnecessary damage or transcended any privilege given them by conveyances from the owner of the upland from whom the alleged fishery came.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-5\">Is there proof that defendant or his employes did anything more on the lands of plaintiff than was actually necessary to carry on the business of fishing at the place, or anything more than was authorized by the rights and privileges in conducting the business of fishing there, contained and granted in the deeds from the former owners of the farm ? If, in the prosecution of the work there, defendant, either negligently or carelessly or intentionally, damaged the plaintiff unnecessarily and beyond the privileges alleged to have been granted by Whitall on the upland, the jury should find for plaintiff the amount of such damages, whatever may be the law as to the right of the defendant within the bounds of the lease from the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-6\">Of course if defendant had no right of several fishery at all he is liable for all his acts of trespass. If he had a right of several fishery he is only responsible for unnecessary damage or damages committed in excess of the rights granted to Christian Faunce by Whitall on the upland. This is a question for the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-7\">The real question in this cause is, Had the defendant, or those under whom he was operating a fishery there in 1881, a right of several fishery in that pool? If they had not, defendant is liable for all damages proved; if they had such right of several fishery he would be liable only for damages from unnecessary acts, if any, as are proved; and if none such appear then defendant is entitled to a verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-8\">The defendant claims that the persons under whom he operated the fishery had a legal right thereto through deeds from prior owners of the farm, claiming also to be owner of the fishery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-9\">Two conveyances are produced which purport to convey the fishery. The first is dated December 4th, 1818, from Samuel Whitall (who at that time was the owner of plaintiff's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>farm) to Christian Faunce. This conveyance, after granting the cabin lot, purported to convey whatever right, privilege, use and enjoyment Whitall had for purposes of fishing, and no other purposes, of premises along on middle of the bank in part lying between Little Mantua creek and the cabin lot,, then out in the river to low-water mark, and down the river at low-water mark, with the right and privilege of laying off the nets used on said ground at the flood fishing, and also of' laying nets on certain meadow land of Whitall. I may not give the precise language of the deed but its substance. This deed purported to convey a right of several fishery on that shore from the then shore-owner, which subsequently was sought to be perfected by a conveyance from William F. Newbold, a subsequent owner, in 1834, to the Faunces, of the next lower fishery, and a certain right of fishing in this which Whitall had reserved in his deed to Christian Faunce.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-4\">To make these deeds from Whitall and from Newbold of any avail to defendant, it should appear that at the time of the execution of the papers these grantors, or one of them, owned a several fishery at the place in question. They could not give title unless they were themselves owners of the right, and the deeds offered by defendant for the fishing right will not justify him unless it shall appear that such right existed in them, or one of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-5\">By the common law the land-owner had no right beyond, high-water mark, and therefore could not, under such law,, derive title to a several fishery by deed from the proprietors. It has been decided in this state by the court of last resort,, that at common law the State of New Jersey is the absolute owner of land in all navigable waters where the tide ebbs and flows within the territorial limits of the state, and that the state can grant such land to any one to be for his exclusive use. Where, then, did Whitall or Newbold get a right of several fishery, if they had it?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-6\">Did the right of several fishery come by prescription to-them ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-7\">My charge to you is, gentlemen, that neither the Faunces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>nor their grantors had title to this alleged several fishery by prescription, use or adverse possession, adverse to the state.. It could not be adverse, if, as defendant claims, the right has been continually protected by the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-5\">But the defendant interposed another ground of defence, which may be thus briefly stated: Admitting that by the common law the riparian owner holds only to high-water mark, and that by the same law the state is the owner absolutely of all the lands under the waters below high-water mark, and may sell her right to whom she pleases, yet that there is a local custom, or local common law in New Jersey, applicable to shore fisheries along the river Delaware, which recognizes the right of property in several fishery, and that this right has been acknowledged and maintained by the legislature and the courts. Consequently it is argued that whatever right the state passed to plaintiff must be subject to this right of several fishery, if there was a fishery there before the giving of the lease. Now this is the important question of this case, in the presence of which all others must sink into insignificance. Very valuable interests depend upon the solution of this question. The shore fisheries on the Jersey side of the Delaware river below the falls at Trenton are of immense value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-6\">There is no question that the legislature of the state has, by repeated acts, intended for the protection of shore fisheries, recognized them as property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-7\">These acts began at a very early day and continued at least in each decade, by new acts or supplements, almost from the time of the acknowledged independence of the state in 1783 to the present time. In and by these acts the claimants of these several fisheries are called owners, and penalties are fixed for invading the pools which they claim in front of their shores, provided they file descriptions thereof, with a bond, in the clerk\u2019s office of the county. These fisheries were thought of such importance that in 1783 they entered largely into a treaty between New Jersey and a sister state, on the the other shore, in respect to jurisdiction over the Delaware river, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>the right of guarding the fisheries on the river annexed to the \u25a0respective shores was thereby guaranteed. In 1799 an act was passed subjecting persons having command of ships and other vessels and craft anchoring on fishing grounds, to a penalty, unless they were removed immediately upon request of the owner or occupier of such fishery, the penalty to be recovered by the owner or occupier.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-4\">Acts have been passed almost annually for the last hundred years, providing for the taxing of fisheries. At first the designation in the act was <em>\u201c </em>accustomed fisheries, the property of private persons,\u201d and afterwards the word \u201c fisheries \u201d alone was used. Under these acts shore fisheries in the tidewaters of the Delaware have been taxed. This very Faunce fishery, we are told by a witness, has paid tax for over sixty years. Shore fisheries on the Delaware have been conveyed and devised as real estate, and been the subject of partition in our courts from a very early period. Sometimes they passed with the shore, at other times they were detached, but whether united or severed from the shore they were regarded and treated as real property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-5\">The evidence shows this to have been the case from the early part of ihe eighteenth century.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-6\">Having very hastily noticed the current of legislation on the subject of fisheries in the Delaware, and called attention as briefly as possible to the common understanding, not only of the owners but the public and the courts, granting partition or sale of such property upon which the idea of local custom or local common law seems to have been drawn, I will inquire if a local common law in New Jersey in regard to rights of riparian owners on tide waters, differing from the common law of England, has been recognized and affirmed by the courts in this state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-7\">The celebrated case of Gough <em>v. </em>Bell, decided that there was such a thing as local common law in New Jersey. It is true the controversy there was not in reference to fisheries, but in reference to the right to dock out and improve by riparian owner in front of his lands between high and low water. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>The common law of England gave the land to the state below high water, but the court held that a local common law authorized the riparian owner to improve in front of his lands below high water, and he could hold them after the improvement, if made before the state, or her grantees, asserted her rights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-5\">In the discussion of counsel, and in the opinions of the judges in that case, it was taken for granted that a local custom or local common law existed in respect to the right of several fishery on the river Delaware, which was used by some of the judges as an evidence that there were changes in this state, in some respects, of the common law, as to rights of riparian owners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-6\">In order to make this subject plainer it will be well to quote some extracts from the opinions of the judges in the case of Gough <em>v. </em>Bell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-7\">Chief Justice Green presided in the Supreme Court when that case was argued, and read an elaborate and carefully prepared opinion. He was one of the ablest jurists this state or the country has produced, and coming from him the extracts I quote have great significance. He says: <em>\u201c </em>Notwithstanding the acknowledged title of the state in her sovereign capacity to the soil of navigable rivers below high-water mark, there has undoubtedly existed from a very early period, rights of the riparian proprietors which have been recognized by the legislature, inconsistent with the idea of that exclusive property in the state, sanctioned by the rule of the common law.\u201d Then the Chief Justice mentions several acts of the legislature, to which I have alluded, which recognize the right of property in shore fisheries on the Delaware river, and he then added : \u201c Such repeated and unequivocal legislative recognition of a right furnishes proof of its existence which cannot be disregarded.\u201d Chief Justice Green quotes Mr. Griffith (a very able lawyer, residing at Burlington, familiar with titles in West Jersey,) as saying: \u201cThis species of property [referring to fisheries] from the earliest times has been the subject of exclusive enjoyment and aliena<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>tion like any other.\u201d The Chief Justice then further adds r \u201c This claim, it is clear, is totally irreconcilable with the rules of the ancient common law'touching property in the soil on shores of navigable rivers, and if the claim rested only on the principle of the common law in England it cannot be sustained. The right of the riparian proprietors to an exclusive-right of fishery in the tide waters in front of their lauds must rest, it is apprehended, on custom or local usage variant from the common law. There is, then, I conceive, unquestionably a local common law affecting the title of riparian proprietors-upon tide-waters, and conferring upon them rights and privileges unknown to the common law of England.\u201d In the Court of Errors and Appeals the decision of the Supreme Court in Gough <em>v. </em>Bell was affirmed, and the opinion of Chief Justice Green approved. In the opinion of Judge Ogden, who was known in East Jersey as a sound lawyer, the following occurs: <em>\u201c </em>By the common law of England the proprietors of lands bordering on navigable tide-waters had title to ordinary high-water mark, and the soil beyond that line was vested exclusively in the crown. Proprietors of such lands in New Jersey, from a very early period in her history, have enjoyed for their individual benefit and in private ownership privileges upon the shore adverse to. the exercise of the sovereignty of the supreme power, excepting when employed for the protection of the rights of navigation and eminent domain. The origin of such infringement upon the rules of the common law of England has not been satisfactorily traced, but its existence has been repeatedly recognized in legislative enactments and its enjoyment has been uninterruptedly claimed. One exercise of such right, not supported by the doctrines of the common law of England, regards exclusive fishery in front of his land.\u201d I come now to give some extracts from the opinion of Judge Elmer, a most remarkable man, and an extremely able judge, whose ripe experience, great learning and excellent judgment have been of much value to New Jersey, in shaping the jurisprudence of the state on many vital questions. He was a resident of West Jersey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>\u25a0during the whole of his long and honorable career, and he knew what he was writing about when he wrote his opinion in the case of Gough <em>v. </em>Bell, in the Court of Errors and Appeals. He said: \u201c The question is not what was the common law of England, but what is the common law of this state. That some of the doctrines of the common law have never been considered applicable to our circumstances and never have been adopted here, and that others have been materially changed by our local usages, is not disputed. We are now to consider whether the rules of the common law, in regard to the ownership of property adjoining the sea or our navigable waters, have been adopted in this state, or whether there is \u25a0evidence that they never have been in force here, or have been materially changed. An excellency of the system of common law derived originally from the general custom of the country is that it is not so inflexible as a statute, but may be modified from time to time as circumstances require. It is conceded,\u201d he says, <em>\u201c </em>as well by those who contend for the application of the strict rule of the English common law to the shores of navigable waters in this state, as by those who think we have a local common law on the subject different from that of England, that the owners of the adjoining land in this state have the exclusive right of fishery on such shore.\u201d It was the opinion of Judge Elmer that the right of several fishery in the shore-owner had its origin in the uniform practice of the holder of the upland to extend his exclusive right to the soil beyond high-water mark. But it matters not how the right originated. The question which concerns us is, whether the right to several fishery in the shore-owner on the Delaware river existed and does exist. In the Circuit Court of the United States, Judge Baldwin, a man of acknowledged ability, held the same view, and said in Bennett <em>v. </em>Boggs: \u201c It is admitted that from a very early period of the history of the state shore fisheries have been considered private property, capable of being devised and alienated with or separate from the land to which they are annexed, subject to taxation and taxed as other real estate.\u201d This doctrine so ably set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>forth by Chief Justice Green in Gough <em>v. </em>Bell has as late as-1870 been approved by the acute and logical mind of the present Chief Justice of this state, so that it may be and must be now considered as established law that there is a right of fishery, a right of property in fisheries in the shore-owners, and their assigns, on the Delaware river on the Jersey . side, and that such right of property has been recognized by the courts. Had Whitall such property in the fishery in question in 1818 when he made the deed thereof to ChristianFaunce; or had Newbold a property in the rights and privileges of fishing he granted to the Faunces in 1834; was this fishery one that has been recognized as private property? Was it of the class referred to by those learned judges? It is an ancient fishery going back of the year 1800\u2014how far back of that time is not proved. The description of the pool of this fishery, and accompanying bond, have been filed in the-clerk\u2019s office almost every year for over sixty years, commencing almost immediately after the law on that subject was passed, and for over sixty years taxes have been annually paid by the owners on this fishery. It has been operated, as a fishery every year. Guided by the opinions of the eminent jurists I have named, and adopting their views, I charge you, as matter of law, that under the evidence the defendant, in the spring of 1881, when the trespasses are alleged to have been committed by him, had a right, or those under whom he claimed had a right, of fishery there; that plaintiff held his lease subject to such right of fishery, and the defendant is entitled to your verdict, unless, as I before said, you find he did acts which did damage to the plaintiff that were not necessary to his operating the fishery, or which were outside of and beyond the rights and privileges of fishing granted to Christian Faunce in 1818 and 1834 by the then land-owners. And if he did commit acts in excess of these rights and privileges, your verdict should be for plaintiff in such amount of damages as you find resulted therefrom.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>For the plaintiff in error, <em>D. J. Pancoast </em>and <em>P. L. Voorhees.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-5\">The plaintiff in this case is the owner of a very valuable farm on the banks of the Delaware river in West Deptford township, Gloucester.county, in this state, and as the grantee of the state he is also the owner of a large extent of flats or lands flowed by tide-water in front of his upland, between which and the flats is a bank which keeps off the tide. The plaintiff below brought an action of trespass against the defendant for occupying and using the plaintiff\u2019s river front, including his upland bank and flats, for the purpose of a fishery, in the spring of 1881, which the defendant attempts to justify under a claim of a several fishery entitling him to make such use of plaintiff\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-6\">The main question in this case is, whether a several fishery in the navigable tide-waters of the Delaware river can exist without a direct grant from the state j)y the sanction of the legislature. Our position is that it cannot.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-7\">A several fishery implies the exclusive right to catch and take fish in certain waters and must have its origin in the ownership of the soil covered by the waters in which it exists. <em>Angell on Water-courses, (7th ed.,) </em>\u00a7 73; <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>3 <em>Vroom </em>384.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-8\">The defendant in this ease pleaded title to a several fishery in the Delaware river, covering a part of the <em>locus in quo, </em>by private grant from a former shore-owner, by prescription or user beyond the memory of man and by adverse possession for more than twenty years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-9\">The court at the trial below held that the title under and by virtue of the grant from the former shore-owner, under which the defendant attempted to justify, was insufficient in law to create the several fishery claimed; that the defendant had no right or title to the same by prescription or user beyond the memory of man; that the defendant had n.o right or title to the same by adverse possession. But after overruling these principal grounds of title the court below declared that the defendant, and those under whom he claimed, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>title to the several fishery pleaded, by a common law peculiar to the State of New Jersey.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-4\">This declaration of law we challenge as erroneous: first, because it is something entirely new and unknown to the English common law; second, because it is unsound in principle ; third, because it is unsupported by authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-5\">The several fishery which the court held belonged to the defendant, and those under whom he claimed, is wholly within the tide-waters of the Delaware river and partly in front of the plaintiff\u2019s land. Its extent in the river neither the witnesses of the defendant nor the court attempted to state or define. A six-hundred-fathom net is used'to fish it, and at high water the net is drawn up to plaintiff\u2019s bank, and at low water it is drawn to the water\u2019s edge, some nine hundred feet from the bank, so that the actual sweep of the net embraces a large area of the great river in front of plaintiff\u2019s land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-6\">The State of New Jersey extends to the middle of the Delaware river, and the land under it belongs to the state, which succeeded to it as one of the royalties of the Crown of England upon achieving its independence as a state. <em>Tinicum Fishing Co. </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>61 <em>Penna. St, </em>35; <em>McCready </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>94 <em>U. S. </em>391.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-7\">The right and title of the state to all the lands under tidewaters within its boundaries has been too long decided and acquiesced in to be disputed or disturbed at this time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-8\">Nor is it a doctrine peculiar to this state. It is the doctrine of the common law of England and has received the sanction of the Supreme Court of the United States and many of the courts of individual states wherein the principles of the common law of England are recognized and applied to the settlement of public and private rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-9\">The sale and disposition of these riparian lands of the state to the shore-owners through the riparian commissioners, under and by virtue of the several acts of our legislature on the subject, has resulted in the enlargement of our public school fund to several millions of dollars, and in view of these facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>it seems to be a bold declaration at this time to say that any person may have or acquire title to any part of the state\u2019s land under water without the knowledge or consent of its. sovereign owner and contrary to the rules of the English common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-5\">What is to become of the state\u2019s title to these lands if this court sanctions this new doctrine, that they may be taken and held by private individuals under and by virtue of a new \u2022common law peculiar to New Jersey ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-6\">And this brings us to the inquiry, What is this new common Jaw? What evidence is there of its origin, growth, development and present existence, and how does it get its power to vest'a part of the state\u2019s land in a private individual without the application of any of the rules or principles of the old common law ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-7\">The court at the trial opened wide the door for the defendants to prove the existence of this new common law, and .admitted one of the honorable judges of this high court as a witness to testify as an antiquary what he had read and heard about titles to other fisheries on the Delaware river, and what he had heard and read of the traditions relating to the Delaware fisheries, to lay a foundation upon which to rest the new common law, but the court chose finally to rest its judgment of its existence upon the authority of some judicial declarations or <em>dieta </em>that are too feeble to support it, as I shall proceed to show in the light of adjudged cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-8\">But I will first remark that <em>prima, faoie </em>in all matters of property rights the common law of England is the common law of New Jersey, and any innovation or change in the same, whether by positive enactment or other 1'ess certain way, must appear in clear and definite form\u2014any doubt or uncertainty must be fatal to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-9\">In 1812, in <em>Yard </em>v. Carman, 2 <em>Penn. </em>493, Judge Pennington, in a fishery case, expressed himself strongly to the effect 'that a several fishery could not exist in the waters of the Delaware river. He used this language: \u201cI am disposed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>however, to take broader ground, lest I may be understood to acquiesce in an authority assumed by certain persons of appropriating to their exclusive use the privilege of taking fish in certain portions of this important river. The exercise of this exclusive right of fishery in the arms of the sea and great rivers was thought by our English ancestors a restraint on their natural rights as odious and more injurious than the game laws.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-4\">In 1820, in <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Mundy, 1 Halst. </em>1, in relation to the right to an oyster-bed under tide-water, it was held that a several right of fishery cannot exist in a public river without a grant from the sovereign power of the people in whom the title to lands under navigable waters is vested. See the latter part of the opinion of the Chief Justice, in which he sums up his conclusions, pages 77 and 78.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-5\">In 1830, in <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Boggs, </em>1 <em>Baldw. </em>60, Judge Baldwin dissented somewhat from the doctrine of Arnold <em>v. </em>Mundy and inclined to the opinion that several fisheries existed in the Delaware river independent of any grant from the sovereign.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-6\">That case was disapproved in 1842 by <em>Martin et al. </em>v. <em>Waddell, </em>16 <em>Pet. </em>367, which involved the title to an oyster-bed under tide-water in this state. The Supreme Court fully considered and approved the doctrine of Arnold <em>v. </em>Mundy, not as a binding authority, but solely upon principle, and held \u201cthat at least since the <em>magna charla </em>the King of England has had no power to grant to a subject a portion of the soil covered by navigable waters so as to give him an immediate and exclusive right of fishery, either for shell fish or floating fish within the limits of the grant. Page 410.' And that the land under the navigable waters of New Jersey passed from King Charles to his brother, the Duke of York, the grantee, as one of the royalties incident to the powers of government, and were to be held by him in the same manner and for the same purposes that the navigable waters of England and the soils under them are held by the crown; and that when the people of New Jersey took possession of the reins of government and took into their own hands the powers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>sovereignty the prerogative and royalties which before belonged either to the crown or the parliament became immediately and rightfully vested in the state.\u201d Page 416.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-5\">The unqualified doctrine of this case is that a several right of fishery cannot exist in a public river like the Delaware without a grant from the sovereign power in whom the title to the land under navigable water ds vested as trustee for the public. ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-6\">Mr. Justice Thompson dissented from this conclusion, and expressed his view \u201c that by the law of England the king did not hold the lands under navigable waters as trustee in a way that precluded him from granting a several right of fishery in a public river ; that <em>prima fade </em>navigable waters are open to all to fish in common; that a several fishery and a common fishery are utterly incompatible with each other. The former is grounded upon and annexed to the right of the soil, and when that right of soil is acquired by an individual the several fishery begins and the common fishery ends.\u201d Page 430.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-7\">This case has been followed and approved by the recent case of <em>MaCready </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>in the same court, 94 <em>U. S. </em>391, which lays down the doctrine \u201cthat a state owns all the land under the navigable waters within its jurisdiction and the waters themselves, with the fish in them, so far as they are capable of ownership, and can exclude the citizens of other states from all use of such lands and waters and allow them to be used in common by its own citizens, or may grant the exclusive right to use them to any individual the same as if they were dry, arable land, so long as the rights of navigation are not interfered with.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-8\">The next case in New Jersey is <em>Gough </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>1 <em>Zab. </em>160, decided in 1847, which held that the legislature might grant away its lands under public waters to private owners. Page 165. And that a grant of the soil under the waters of a fishery is its destruction. Page 160.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-9\">This case, came before the same court again in 1850 (2 <em>Zab. </em>441), and the doctrine was then laid down that while the state was the owner of all lands under tide-water below high water, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>yet where it had suffered the riparian owner in good faith to reclaim parts of it by filling up and wharfing out, he acquired a good title to the land so improved as against the state which permitted it to be done. Judge Randolph, in his opinion, speaking of the rights of the shore-owner, said (page. 491): \u201cBut if his boundary be on the sea or navigable waters, his rights extend only to high-water mark\u2014his privileges as far as his senses can perceive or appreciate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-4\">\u201cWhat right has he beyond his boundary? All beyond belongs to the state, and although that may be slow to deprive him of any privilege, yet can it be disputed that the state would have a right to fill up in front of any riparian owner to high-water mark, and erect thereon a fortification or light-house or any other necessary object? And if no land was taken above high water, would any private property be taken for public use, any that the riparian owner must be paid for under the constitution? What is lawful for the \u2022state is lawful for its grantee, though it might seem very inexpedient and very unkind for either thus to interfere with valued privileges,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-5\">It was <em>queried </em>in this case whether the state could, by a grant of the land under water fronting the shor\u00e9-owner, destroy his adjacency to the water without compensation, and the judges seem to have greatly differed in their views as to just what a shore-owner\u2019s rights or privileges to the water were.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-6\">This same case came up before the Court of Errors and Appeals in 1852 (3 <em>Zab. </em>624), when the decision of the Supreme Court was affirmed, and three of the judges took occasion to give their sanction to the doctrine that riparian owners on tide-waters have rights and benefits arising from their adjacency to the water, of which they cannot be deprived without compensation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-7\">In <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>4 <em>Zab. </em>85, 86, Chief Justice Green stated, in very strong terms, that there could be no ownership in lands under water below low-water mark, without a legislative grant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>1 <em>Dutcher </em>527, the absolute property of the state in lands between high and low-water mark was affirmed, and it was held that the state could convey such lands without regard to the shore-owner\u2019s privileges;. and in 1864 the legislature, considering the law to be settled that the state was the owner of all lands under tide-waters within the state, and could dispose of them by grant or lease to private individuals without interfering with the superior rights of navigation, passed the first of a series of acts for the ascertainment and disposition of the rights of the state to lands under water, entitled \u201c An act to ascertain the rights of the state and of riparian owners in the lands lying under the waters of the bay of New York and elsewhere in this-state,\u201d approved April 11th, 1864; to which there has been added a number of supplements, one of which <em>(Rev., pi </em>985,. \u00b6* 20,) provides that a conveyance or lease by the riparian commissioners \u201c shall vest all the rights of the state in said lands in the lessee or grantee.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-5\">And the respective rights of the state and riparian owners for all purposes have been entirely settled and put to rest in this state by our Court of Errors and Appeals in 1870, in the case of <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Paterson and Newark R. R. Co., 5 Vroom </em>532, in which it rejected the <em>dicta </em>in Gough <em>v. </em>Bell, and affirmed the absolute title of the state to lands under tidewaters free from all restriction as to its right to convey it to anyone without any compensation to the shore-owner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-6\">There are numerous cases in other states affirming the doctrine and principles herein set forth, and I will simply refer to a few of them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-7\"><em>Trustees of Brookhaven et al. </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>60 <em>N.

These authorities abundantly establish the propositions of law upon which the plaintiff relies to overthrow the charge of the court below, to the effect that the defendant had aright or title to a several fishery in the Delaware river that was superior to the right or title of the plaintiff to the <em>locus in quo </em>under tide-water, derived from the state under and by virtue of his riparian lease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-5\">And briefly stated these propositions are as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-6\"><em>First. </em>A several fishery must have its origin in the ownership of the soil. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-7\"><em>Second. </em>The soil under the tide-water of the Delaware river became vested in the state when it achieved its independence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-8\"><em>Third. </em>That no title to lands under the water of the Delaware river in this state can be derived, except from a grant by the state under legislative sanction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-9\"><em>Fourth. </em>That a right of a several fishery in the waters of that river cannot exist without the same legislative sanction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-10\">And from these four positions necessarily flows the conclusion that the plaintiff, as the state\u2019s grantee under and by virtue of his lease, is entitled to the use of the land under water therein described, without being subject to any limitation by a private right of several fishery in the defendant, or those under whom he claims.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-11\">Against this conclusion, resulting from the well-settled principles above enumerated, I have now to consider the grounds of the doctrine of the court below. But first I must simply call the attention of the court to the manifest error of the court below in admitting the most uncertain hearsay testimony in relation to other fisheries, to settle and fix the defendant\u2019s right to his, and leave the plaintiff to justify it as best he can.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-12\">The court below did not pretend that the evidence of the defendant, allowed with such unusual liberality, established the existence of the new common law invoked to give title to the defendant in the several fishery claimed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>It was put upon the statements and reasonings of several of the judges in Gough <em>v. </em>Bell, wherein the point to be decided did not relate to a fishery, but was whether the universal custom of riparian owners in this state, ever since the earliest colonial times, to fill up, reclaim and improve lands under water in front of their lands, for wharves and other necessary purposes, without let, hindrance or objection on the part of the state, should be held to operate to give them title to the land so reclaimed and improved for such a necessary purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-5\">The universality of such a custom, beginning in the earliest times, and the extent to which it had everywhere been practiced, and the unexpected and disastrous results that would otherwise occur to the many owners of such reclaimed and improved lands, manifestly led the court to stretch, if not absolutely break, the law in order to uphold the titles founded upon such a meritorious and equitable claim; but while the judges concurred in the result, yet they differed radically in the premises and reasoning that led to it, some of them putting their opinions upon the ground that the riparian owner in that case got his title by virtue of a new common law raised up to meet the exigencies of such eases, while others denied the existence of such ground. For instance, Judge Potts, in his opinion, said (3 <em>Zab. </em>674): \u201c It is argued that there is a common custom or usage on the subject established of sufficient duration and universality to amount to a local common law. I am unable to reach this conclusion. The weight of authority is against it. It has been distinctly held that in this state the rule of the common law remains unaltered.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-6\">Much was said in that celebrated case, but the only point decided was that a riparian owner, who had reclaimed land under water by filling in and improving the same as a wharf, without objection from the state, acquired a good title to it, and much of the reasoning by which the different judges reached their respective conclusions, has since been rejected as unsound, and every word that was said in that case in relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>to the existence of several fisheries in the Delaware river was the merest <em>dictum, </em>as it seems to me.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-5\">Chief Justice Green, in <em>Gough </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>2 <em>Zab. </em>463, in his diligent search for tenable ground upon which to support the wharf-owner\u2019s title to the land under water which he had reclaimed and improved, introduced the subject of the right of several fisheries in the Delaware to prove the existence of a new flexible local common law in New Jersey affecting the rights of riparian owners, and said (page 463): \u201c This right of fishery, so fa-r at least as it regards the river Delaware, cannot rest upon any actual or supposed proprietary grant. The title of the proprietors of New Jersey never extended beyond low-water mark upon the Delaware. The title of the state previous to the Revolution was limited by that boundary. Nor does it depend upon any statute law of the state conferring the right. The earliest legislation upon the subject of the fisheries in the Delaware recognizes the title of the riparian proprietor as an existing right; nor can the claim rest on prescription.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-6\">\u201cIf a title by prescription can exist at all in this state, many of these fisheries are of modern origin and cannot be prescribed for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-7\">\u201c This claim, it is clear, is totally irreconcilable with the rules of the ancient common law touching the property in the soil and shores of navigable rivers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-8\">\u201cIn <em>Yard </em>v. <em>Carman, </em>2 <em>Penn. </em>934, Justice Pennington expressed himself strongly against the existence of an exclusive fishery in the river Delaware as a violation of the\"principles of the common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-9\">\u201c If the claim rested for its support alone upon the principles of the common law of England it cannot be sustained. The right of the riparian proprietors to an exclusive right of fishery in the tide-waters of New Jersey in front of their land must rest, it is apprehended, in custom or local usage variant from the common law. There is, then, I conceive, unquestionably, in New Jersey a local common law affecting the title of riparian proprietors upon tide-waters and conferring upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>them rights and privileges unknown to the common law of England.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-5\">The Chief Justice proceeded in a very summary way to declare, or rather assume, that several fisheries existed in the Delaware by virtue of a local common law, and then extended the operation of this elastic law to cover the point before him for decision, and what he and the other judges who concurred with his view assumed and said in relation to the existence of several fisheries ought to have little weight with this court, unless their reasoning is satisfactory, and I submit that it is not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-6\">Gough <em>v. </em>Bell properly decided and settled only this point, that a riparian owner who had been suffered to reclaim land under tide-water in front of his land by filling it in and erecting a wharf on it was entitled to hold it as against the state and its grantee. The court in that case was not called upon to consider or decide anything in relation to the existence of several fisheries.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-7\">Afterwards the Supreme Court, in State <em>v. </em>Jersey City, rejected the loose <em>dicta </em>on riparian rights thrown out by several of the judges in Gough <em>v. </em>Bell, to the effect that the shore-owner had rights to the lands under water which the state could not take or divest without compensation, and Judge Elmer, who delivered the opinion, said (page 527): \u201c It must now be accepted as the established law in New Jersey that the right of the owner of lands bounding on a navigable river extends only to the actual high-water mark, and that all below that mark belongs to the state. The inchoate right, if such it may be called, which the proprietor of the upland has either with or without a license to acquire an exclusive right to the property by wharfing out or otherwise improving the same, gives him no property in the land while \u2022 it remains under the water.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-8\">\u201c It may be granted to a stranger at any time before it is actually reclaimed and annexed to the upland. Such is unquestionably the common law, and I am aware of no alteration of it in this respect in New Jersey. Some of the judges seem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>to have expressed a different opinion in the case of Bell <em>v. </em>Gough before the Court of Errors, but no case has been decided which establishes a different doctrine. In that manner I concur myself with the opinion expressed by Judge Randolph.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-4\">And it is manifest that the remarks of the different judges in that case, as to the existence of several fisheries in the Delaware, were entirely unnecessary and can have no force as authority, and whether several fisheries do exist in the Delaware river remains to be decided upon authority and principle, both of which it seems to me are greatly against the contention that they do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-5\">IIow far is this new doctrine of title by custom to be extended to establish titles commencing in mistake or error? It is clear that there must be some limit to it. If a long-continued and universal custom is to be extended as a lawful means of acquiring title to the state\u2019s property I think her property is in great jeopardy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-6\">Private individuals are quick to perceive and defend any invasions of their own rights, but they are slow to defend encroachments on the rights of the state, and while our courts may be willing to sanction and validate such innocent encroachments as the actual reclamation of the state\u2019s land under water without objection, yet,they may well hesitate to apply the same rule to unreclaimed waters, and say that because it has been the long-continued custom of shore fishermen to claim to own certain portions of the Delaware river as a fishery, they shall have and enjoy it to the exclusion of all other citizens of the state. The logical result of the extension of this doctrine must be to declare that the state has no property rights in or under the waters of the Delaware, because it has been the general custom of riparian owners in this state to consider and treat the lands in front of them to low-water mark as their own property, until lately undeceived by the decisions of our courts, ratified by the acts of our legislature on this subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-7\">Judge Randolph, in <em>Gough </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>2 <em>Zab. </em>490, said \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>prior to the decision of Arnold <em>v. </em>Munday it was the impression that the entire bed of the river Delaware was private property.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-5\">In <em>Wooley </em>v. Campbell, 8 <em>Vroom </em>164, the Supreme Court affirmed the absolute right of the state to dispose of its lands under water as against the common right of fishery in waters covering the land. And if the right of common fishery in all the people, universally exercised from time imniemorial, may be taken away by a grant by the state, upon what just principle can the private right of one man or a few men, exercised for a shorter period of time, be upheld against the grant of the state ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-6\">If a usage of one man or a few men to fish in a particular place in a public river is to give him or them a vested right, ought not the same rule to give the whole people in common a vested right to do the same or a similar thing?</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-7\">I quite agree with the views of Judge Pennington, that the existence of the right of a several fishery in the arms of the sea and in our great navigable rivers is contrary to public policy and the genius of our free institutions. Ought not such waters to be as open to the public to fish as to navigate? <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Blazer, 2 Binn. </em>476, 485, &amp;c., held that the owner of lands on the banks of the Susquehanna has no exclusive right of fishery immediately in front of his lands, but that the right to fisheries in that river is vested in the state and open to all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-8\">The Supreme Court of North Carolina has denied the existence of several fisheries in the Albemarle sound, and held upon common law principles that they could only be created \u25a0by express legislative grant, and that from mere user no such grant would be implied. <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Benbury, </em>3 <em>Ired. </em>277, 5 <em>Ired. </em>118.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-9\">It is said that the state has for a long time recognized the existence of several fisheries in the Delaware, but I deny that the state has ever granted or attempted to grant or even recognized the existence of a private right of fishery existing wholly within the tide-waters of the Delaware like the one claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>in this case. Shore fisheries have existed along the banks of the Delaware the same as they have existed along the shores-of the sea ever since the first settlement of the country, and they have been recognized and regulated by law, but they have been connected with and depended upon the ownership of the shore, and derived their value not from any exclusive right in the water but from the exclusive right to draw the-nets upon the shore; and to such fisheries I maintain our legislation has always referred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-4\">Judge Baldwin, in <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Boggs, </em>1 <em>Bald. </em>70, in construing the terms of our statutes regulating our fisheries on the Delaware, said : \u201c The words <em>\u2018 </em>fishery, pool or fishing place/ as defined by the act of 1808, can apply only to a place on the shore to which a fishery is annexed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-5\">In <em>Gough </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>2 <em>Zab. </em>490, Judge Randolph, whose views were subsequently approved by Judge Elmer and the. Supreme Court in State <em>v. </em>Jersey City, said: <em>\u201c </em>It has been urged that the right of fishery which exists in the Delaware, and perhaps some other rivers in the state, and the sanction which has been given them by the legislature, and also the legislative acts for the protection of low meadows sometimes covered by the tide, afforded at least a persuasive evidence of the existence of a rule different from that of the common law. After a very full consideration I am unable to give the argument the weight which is claimed for it; so far as it applies to the Delaware it may be embraced in the considerations already stated; in regard to the whole matter, the very fact that the authority of the legislature was constantly invoked,, would seem to raise a doubt of the general or special common law authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-6\">w But although the right of fishery, like the right of way or the right of common, may be severed from the farm or manor, and any appropriate suit or action may be brought respecting it, yet it is dependent on the upland for its existence, and does not in fact exist, in gross or by any common law rule, detached from and independent of the land.\u201d <em>Shrunk </em>v. <em>President, </em>14 <em>Serg. &amp; R. </em>81, held that the fisheries on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Delaware referred to in the statutes are shore fisheries connected with the upland. And in <em>Westfalls </em>v. <em>Van Auker, </em>12 <em>Johns. </em>425, it was assumed there could be no several fishery-in the Delaware disconnected from the shore.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-5\">Contemplate for a moment the significance of the exclusive \u25a0right of the defendant and others claiming several fisheries as against the state and all its inhabitants to fish in the best parts of the Delaware river with nets that at each sweep\u2014at every haul\u2014cover an area of at least one square mile, and then it will be pertinent to inquire if our people, through their representatives in the legislature, have for many years been wittingly sanctioning such monstrous encroachments upon their common rights, and are now fostering such monopolies by the aid of our fish commissioners appointed by law to multiply fish to be caught in such private fisheries.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-6\">There is another view to take of this right of several fishery claimed in this case; the defendant at the trial rested his claim to it under and by virtue of certain private grants that the court declared inoperative and void. Did not his right of fishery fail with the failure of the title under which he held, and is he not in a position with every presumption against any other and better origin to his claim ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alburger, </em>1 <em>Whart. </em>488, Sergeant, J., said, in relation to a claim against common rights: \u201c There is no room for presumption since the grant itself is shown and proves defective.\u201d Courts do not favor presumptions against common right. <em>Collins </em>v. Benbury, 3 <em>Ired. </em>277, 283, 284, 5 <em>Ired. </em>118, 124.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-8\">The grants offered by defendant in support of his claim being defective, and there being no presumptions to favor his title, it must stand or fall upon the proofs showing a user under claim of right of fifty or sixty years without anything to make it adverse to the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-9\">The Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in <em>Lakeman </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>7 <em>Gray </em>440, speaking upon the subject of title by adverse possession against the state of lands under water, said: <em>' </em>Perhaps in the absence of an express legislative grant one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>might be proved by adverse use and enjoyment, but it must amount to that degree of exclusive occupation sufficient to-raise a belief that such act or resolve had actually been passed though not appearing, and in general this can only be-done by showing actual possession of the flats where the tide ebbs and flows by building thereon or inclosing the same so-as to exclude the access of boats and vessels.\u201d <em>Whittaker </em>v.. JBurhaus, 62 <em>Barb. </em>238, was an action similar to this, in which the owner of certain flats flowed by tide-water brought his action of trespass for damages against fishermen accustomed to use them for many years, and succeeded on the strength of his title to the flats, derived from the Crown of Great Britain against their defence, made under a plea of a common right of fishery in the <em>loous in quo </em>exercised for a long period.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-4\">My conclusion is that the state never lost its title to the land under water in which the defendant claims a right of several fishery, and that he acquired no right or title to the same as against the state or the plaintiffs if granted by virtue of any usage or local common law, and that the charge of the court on this point was erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-5\">Having fully discussed the principal question in dispute between the parties I will now very briefly call attention to some of the exceptions to rulings of the court below upon minor points.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-6\">The plaintiff offered to prove that the defendant wantonly-spoiled his fence rails on the <em>loous in quo </em>by putting filth, upon them to render them unfit for future use. In any view of the case such conduct was a wanton and unjustifiable trespass; but the court forbade the plaintiff to show that fact and excluded the evidence he offered of it, and allowed the defendant against the objection of the plaintiff to prove that he removed the rails by the advice of counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-7\">The river bank defended a large part of plaintiff\u2019s farm from overflow and destruction by the water; and this was an. important fact for him to show in order to give the jury to understand what care the defendant should have exercised in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>the use of the bank with his horses and men, in view of the fact that a very little injury or misuse of it would expose defendant\u2019s farm to great damage; but the plaintiff\u2019s offer to show this important fact was overruled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-5\">The court allowed the defendant, against the objection of the plaintiff, to prove what is necessary to be done in the preparation of fishing grounds for operation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-6\">It allowed the defendant, against the objection of the plaintiff, to prove that it was not usual to work a fishery without a windlass.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-7\">It allowed the defendant, against the objection of the plaintiff, to prove that other fisheries along the Delaware were fished by men who claimed to own them without or disconnected from the upland.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-8\">It allowed the defendant, against the objection of the plaintiff, to prove by repute and tradition alleged facts in relation to other fisheries along the Delaware river. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-9\">It allowed the defendant, against the objection of the plaintiff, to offer in evidence a letter from Ann Frances to one Clark.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-10\">\u25a0 It refused to permit the plaintiff on cross-examination to ask Christian E. Faunce, one of the claimants of the several fishery in question, whether his family claimed it under and by virtue of the deeds offered in evidence or otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-11\">It permitted the defendant, against the objection of the plaintiff, to offer in evidence copies of deeds and wills, in no wise connected with the fishery in dispute, for the purpose of showing how other fisheries along- the Delaware shore had been dealt with.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-12\">It seems to me that the court below, in its search for evidence of the existence of a local common law giving title to the defendant in the several fishery claimed, entirely overlooked and transgressed the well-settled rules of evidence and principles of law in the particulars above set forth, and that the judgment below ought to be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>For the defendant in error, <em>M.

The want of it is a defence at law in the proprietor of <em>ripa </em>against the grant.

It is specifically such a grant to them as makes them riparian proprietors under the act, to such-an extent that Fitzgerald, who took his deed subject to their easement, cannot discharge his land of its obligation without the notice to them, because he is not sole and exclusive riparian proprietor.

There may be a several fishery separate from ownership of the shore or soil at common law; strictly speaking, a several fishery has no existence when owned and exercised by the owner of the whole estate; it remains merged in the general use and enjoyment. The road of an owner over his own land would not be called <em>\u201c </em>a right of way.\u201d But when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>it is held by another it becomes for the first time <em>several, </em>a. separate and exclusive right in another, a service imposed on the estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-4\">In <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Courtney, </em>5 <em>Burr. </em>2816, there was a grant of a fishery, with exceptions of right to grantor to take fish for his own table.

Defence that trespass would not lie for injury to several fishery on soil of a third person. Court inclined to think it would lie, but said <em>sole </em>and <em>exclusive </em>fishery was not equivalent to <em>several </em>fishery, and arrested judgment. But on error judgment was reversed; <em>sole </em>and <em>exclusive </em>were considered equivalent to <em>several </em>in respect of the right of fishery, at least after verdict, and the whole court agreed that trespass would lie though no fish were taken. 13 <em>Q.

How much more force must be given to recognitions using the same words, running through an uninterrupted course of more than one hundred years, made by the state as a free and independent sovereignty, entering into a treaty with another state in regard to the protection, as private property, of the Delaware fisheries, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>by legislative action directed in terms to the regulation and protection of these fisheries in the Delaware river in'which private property is recognized.</p>\n<p data-order=\"232\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-4\"><em>d. </em>The decisions of the courts of New Jersey, which recognize ownership, in hands of private persons, of several fisheries-in navigable rivers, are :</p>\n<p data-order=\"233\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-5\"><em>Post </em>v. <em>Munn, </em>1 <em>South. </em>61.

J., says: \u201cMunn was the owner of a fishery, and had a right to fish at a certain place in said river. Same principle is maintained in <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>61 <em>Penna.

Plaintiff owned a farm on the Raritan extending to bank of the river. His grantor had staked off part of the bed when he was in possession twenty years and more before, but his right was disputed by the people. Plaintiff in 1818 located the bed by warrant from East Jersey proprietors. Defendant entered and took oysters. <em>Held, </em>Kirkpatrick, C. J., that the title to land under navigable rivers, where tide ebb's and flows, is in the state; that the sovereign power held this title in trust for the use of the public, and that \u201c the sovereign power itself, therefore, cannot consistently with the principles of the law of nature, and the constitution of a -well-ordered society, make a direct and absolute grant of the waters of the state, divesting all citizens of their common right.\u201d No specific reference is made in the opinion of either Kirkpatrick or Rossell to Delaware river fisheries.

In the brief of George Wood, leading counsel for the plaintiff in error, page 387, (16 <em>Pet.,) </em>he says: \u201cIn all the public waters of the state [New Jersey] they have two kinds of fisheries\u2014common fisheries, and private or shore fisheries, belonging to the riparian owner. The latter is confined to those kinds of fish which were usually taken by hauling the net upon the shore, and are called shore fisheries. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>long usage these kinds of fisheries have grown into private rights belonging to the riparian owner, and have been recognized by repeated legislative acts. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Boggs, </em>1 <em>Baldw. </em>70. Those common fisheries and riparian several fisheries are all incompatible with the claims of the proprietors, who, under such claims, would have had several fisheries in all the rivers and disposed of them to their grantees.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"239\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-4\"><em>Gough </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>2 <em>Zab. </em>440, in Supreme Court, 3 <em>Zab. </em>624, on error, established the existence of a local common law under which a riparian proprietor could and did claim and enjoy an exclusive right of several fishery in the waters and annexed to the shores of Delaware river. All the judges agreed substantially upon this proposition. Green, C. J., in his opinion in Supreme Court, which the majority of Court of Errors affirmed, shows the origin, growth and recognition of this common law by legislative sanction, judicial approval and universal conduct among the people of West Jersey. Read 2 <em>Zab. </em>462-464. The learned Chief Justice clearly shows, by the decisions of the courts and by the laws of the state, that shore fisheries on Delaware river are recognized as and have all the incidents of private property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"240\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-5\">On page 462, in speaking of shore fisheries and the rights of the owners therein, he says: \u201c Such repeated and unequivocal legislative recognitions of a right, furnish proof of its existence which cannot be disregarded.\u201d In support of this he cites <em>Griff. L. R. </em>1290, <em>note </em>1, this note giving a history of the Delaware river tide-water fisheries (Bispham <em>v. </em>Rice), not elsewhere reported, and which was an action of ejectment to recover a shad fishery on the Delaware river just above Camden. This ease was tried soon after Arnold <em>v. </em>Mundy, and most of the counsel in that cause were in this. \u201cNo doubt was intimated by any one of the counsel on either side as to title to fishery in either party by reason of paramount title of the state.\u201d He also cites <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Boggs, Baldw. </em>60. After showing that the property rights of the owners of shore fisheries on Delaware river do not depend upon any statute \u2022conferring the right, because the earliest statutes recognize the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>title of the riparian proprietor as a pre-existing right; and after showing that they could not be maintained by prescription nor reconciled with the principles of the common law of England, he says: <em>\u201c </em>The right of riparian proprietors to an exclusive right of fishery in the tide-waters of New Jersey in front of their land, must rest, it is apprehended, in custom or local usage variant from the common law. There is, then, I think, unquestionably in New Jersey, a local common law affecting title of riparian proprietors upon tide-waters, and conferring upon them rights and privileges unknown to the common law of England. * * * It remains to inquire whether this extension of the right of riparian proprietors in derogation of principles of common law is limited to the right of fishery, or whether it extends beyond it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"241\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-6\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>1 <em>Dutcher </em>527.

The legislative and judicial departments of the government have from an early period recognized a property in the riparian owners in the fisheries adjacent to their lands lying upon the tide-waters of the Delaware, which is exclusive of the common right of fishery which subsists at common law in all public waters. What the nature and quality of this property is, and whether it is superior to, or subordinate to, the title of the state in lands under tide-waters, need not be decided in this case. There are other questions to be disposed of before that question can arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">A preliminary question is presented whether the plaintiff \u2018 has such a grant from the state as will give him a standing to enable him to set up the rights of the state against the right of Christian Faunce under the Whitall deed. He could acquire such a standing only in virtue of a grant by the riparian commissioners, which the commissioners were empowered to make under the statutes authorizing them to grant and convey lands of the state under water.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>The Wharf act of 1851 gave to the boards of chosen freeholders of the several counties the power to license owners of lands situate on or upon tide-waters, to build docks or wharves in front of their lands, or in any other way to improve the same. <em>Rev., p. </em>1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The Riparian act of 1869 conferred on the riparian commissioners a more extensive power over the state\u2019s lands under tide waters than was conferred upon the boards of chosen freeholders by the Wharf act of 1851. It gave the riparian commissioners power to make grants or leases of the state\u2019s lands to persons other than riparian owners. <em>Rev., p. </em>982, \u00a7 8. But the privileges of riparian owners are carefully preserved by the proviso in section 8, \u201c that no grant or license-shall be granted to any other than a riparian proprietor, until six calendar months after the riparian proprietor shall have been personally notified in writing by the applicant for.such grant or license, and shall have neglected to apply for the grant or license, and neglected to pay, or secure to be paid, the price that said commissioners shall have fixed,\u201d with provisions for the mode of service of notice on minors, corporations and non-residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The Riparian act of 1869 applies only to the tide-waters of the Hudson river, New York bay and the Kill von Kull, lying between Enyard\u2019s dock, on the Kill von Kull, and the New York state line. That such is the entire scope of the act is clear from its provisions. The act of April 13 th, 1864, to which the Riparian act of 1869 is a supplement, provided for the appointment of commissioners to cause surveys to be made of the \u201c lands lyjng under the waters of the bay of New York and of the Hudson river, and of the lands adjacent thereto; the Kill von Kull, Newark bay, Arthur\u2019s Kill, Raritan bay, and the lands lying under the water of the Delaware river opposite to the county of Philadelphia, * * * and to fix and establish an exterior line in said bays and rivers beyond which no pier, wharf, bulkhead, erection or permanent obstruction of any kind, should be permitted to be made, and to report to the next legislature, on or before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the 1st day of February then next, * * * and to have prepared, and submit with their report, maps of said land exhibiting the exterior line fixed and established by them in said bays and rivers.\u201d <em>Rev., p. </em>981. The commissioners made their report, dated February 1st, 1865, but no action was taken upon their report u ntil the supplement of 1869 was passed. By the first section of the latter act the bulkhead line, or lines of solid filling, and the pier lines in the tide-waters of the Hudson river, New York bay and Kill von Kull, lying between Enyard\u2019s dock, on the Kill von Kull, and the New York state line, so far as they had been recommended and reported to the legislature by the commissioners, were adopted and declared to be fixed and' established as the exterior bulkhead and pier lines between the points above named. No action was taken by the legislature adopting exterior lines elsewhere. The second section provided that it shall not be lawful to fill in with earth, stones or other solid material in the tide-waters of the Hudson river, New York bay and Kill von Kull beyond the bulkhead line, or lines of solid filling, by this act adopted, fixed and established, laid down and exhibited on the aforesaid maps, and that it should not be lawful to erect or maintain any pier or other structure exterior to the said bulkhead line, or lines of solid filling, in any place or places where no exterior line for piers is reported or indicated by said maps on the Hudson river, New York bay and Kill von Kull. By the third section the Wharf act of 1851 was repealed as to the tide-waters of the Hudson river, New York bay and Kill von Kull. Elsewhere the Wharf act was left in force. The fourth section gave the commissioners authority to give to any person or corporation who, by any legislative act, was a grantee or licensee of lands under water, or had power or authority to acquire such lands, a paper in the name of the State of New Jersey, conveying such lands, capable of being acknowledged and recorded, with a proviso that the commissioners should in no case grant lands under water beyond the exterior lines by said act established, or thereafter to be established by leg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>islative authority. The eighth section, which has already been referred to, and is the only remaining section conferring on the commissioners power to grant lands of the state under water, makes such grants subject to the regulations and provisions of the first and second sections of the act\u2014that is, to the bulkhead line, and lines of solid filling, in the Hudson river, New York bay and Kill von Kull, established by said sections; and in the proviso, with respect to notice to non-resident riparian owners, the notice is required to be published in a daily newspaper published in Hudson county, and also in a daily newspaper published in New York city.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">\u2022 The provisions of the act of 1869 are wholly inapplicable to lands of the state under water elsewhere than within the limits designated in the act. Provision was made for grants of the state\u2019s lands under tide-waters by the riparian commissioners elsewhere than within the territory named in the act of 1869, by an act passed March 21st, 1871, which provided that any riparian-'owner of lands on tide-waters in the state might apply to the riparian commissioners for a lease, grant or conveyance of lands under water in front of his lands, and the commissioners were authorized to make such lease, grant or conveyance, to be executed as directed by the act of 1869, which should vest in the lessee or grantee all the right of the state in such lands, with proviso that nothing in the act should interfere with the prior acts as to the waters of the Hudson river, New York bay or Kill von Kull, easterly to Enyard\u2019s dock. <em>Rev., p. </em>985.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The power of the riparian commissioners to make grants of the state\u2019s lands under water, under the act of 1871, is more restricted than it is under the act of 1869. Under the act of 1871 no one but a riparian owner can apply, and a grant by the commissioners to any one else would be <em>ultra vires. </em>In this respect the act of 1871 is analogous to the Wharf act of 1851. The words, \u201cowner of lands situate along or upon tide-waters,\u201d in the act of 1851, and \u201criparian owner,\u201d in the act of 1871, are identical in meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>3 <em>Dutcher </em>13, a construction of the act of 1851 was made by the Supreme Court, which ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>plies to the act of 1871. The facts in that case were these: Brown\u2019s title, which he acquired from one Merselis, was described as bounded on the New York bay. In his deed certain lands conveyed by Merselis to the Morris Canal and Banking Company were excepted. The conveyance to the canal company described the lands conveyed as lying in the vicinity of, and on the margin of New York bay\u2014terms importing a boundary on the bay\u2014and was to the canal company, their successors and assigns, \u201cas long as used for a canal.\u201d Brown obtained a license from the board of freeholders to wharf out, and the question before the Supreme Court was whether the canal company had such title in the land as deprived Brown of the right to obtain a license for, and build a wharf in front on his farm. The Supreme Court, Chief Justice Green delivering the opinion, held that although the conveyance to the canal company was of a right to use the lands for a particular purpose only, and the grantee was restricted to that use of the estate, the company was the owner in fee of the land while the estate continued, and that although the canal company might have no right to build docks or wharves, the company, under its title, might prevent any other person from building docks and wharves in front of its land.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">State <em>v. </em>Brown was reversed on error in this court, but not with respect to the ground on which it was decided in the Supreme Court. Indeed, Mr. Justice Whelpley, who delivered the reversing opinion, gave expression to substantially the same views, for he said that \u201c the granting of the license to Brown conferred on him no right to dock out, unless he was the owner of the shore, and is of no use to him unless he is; his license is conditional, dependent upon his title; if he should undertake under that license to build the improvement authorized * * * it would be no protection against the legal owner of the shore.\u201d The reversal was on the ground that the question whether Brown was shore-owner or not could be determined only by a trial involving the merits of the case. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Morris Canal, </em>3 <em>Dutcher </em>648.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In the present case the proof is that the Whitall tract con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>sisted in part of meadow land originally subject to the overflow of tides, and in part of upland, extending down to and forming a natural bank along the river, and that before the deed to Faunce was made, in 1818, an embankment had been-constructed between high and low-water mark along the meadow front. This embankment was constructed for the purpose of excluding the overflow of tides from the lowlands^, and consisted of earth, and was faced with stones along the river front, and was such a reclamation as, under G-ough <em>v. </em>Bell, gave the riparian owner title to the extent of the reclamation. The embankment is seven or eight feet high, from twelve to\u2019 sixteen feet wide at the bottom and about four feet wide at the\u2019 top. Ordinary high tides rise to one-third of the height of the embankment, and extraordinary tides within two feet of the top. The embankment is used in fishing as a landing for nets, and one of the capstans for drawing in the nets is-located on the top of the embankment.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The operative words of conveyance in the deed from Whit-all to Christian Faunce are \u201c grant, bargain, sell, release and confirm,\u201d with appropriate words to convey a fee. The premises conveyed are described as <em>\u201c </em>the sole right, privilege, use and enjoyment at all times for all. purposes of fishing whatsoever, and for no other purpose,\u201d followed by a description of the lands embraced in the conveyance by metes and bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The deed gave the grantee the right to occupy the lands, and there is <em>no </em>restriction <em>on </em>the manner in which he should use them, other than generally for' the purpose for which they were conveyed. The use and enjoyment of the lands by the grantee, for the purpose for which they were granted, is exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The deed to Faunce conveyed to him an actual estate, and not a mere license or easement. A grant of the exclusive use of lands, as it excludes the grantor from all benefit in it, is a grant of the soil itself, and not a mere easement. <em>Godd. Easem. </em>5. In <em>Buszard </em>v. Capel, <em>8 B. &amp; C. </em>141, Lord Tenterden said that \u201c it is difficult to understand how the exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>-use could be demised, and the land not;\u201d and in the same case, in the Exchequer Chamber, Alexander, L. C. B., said ^\u2018it is agreed that the finding of the jury\u2014that the exclusive use of the land was demised, but the land itself was not demised\u2014was inconsistent, because a grant of the exclusive use of the land is a grant of the land.\u201d <em>Capel </em>v. <em>Buszard, </em>3 <em>Y. &amp; J. </em>356. The verdict in that case was sustained, it appearing by the indenture, which was' made part of the verdict, that the wharf only was conveyed with free liberty to load and land goods in common with other tenants over the lands in question. Words of license or permission to occupy, or to enjoy, or to use are a demise of an actual estate in the lands. 2 <em>Platt Leas. </em>23; 5 <em>Bac.

A devise of the use of lands is a devise of an estate in lands. <em>Hance </em>v. <em>West, </em>3 <em>Vroom </em>233. Conveyances to railroad, land and water companies, and to mining companies for a special use, as, for instance, for a depot, or for the accommodation and victualing of passengers; for a rail or tramway, for a canal or raceway, and of minerals and ores, are not uncommon. \u25a0Such conveyances are always regarded as conveyances of estates in lands; and if the words of conveyance are adopted to convey a fee, the estate granted will be a fee, though the grantee is restricted in the use of the estate conveyed. <em>Southard </em>v. <em>C. R. R. Co., </em>2 <em>Dutcher </em>13; <em>Cornelius </em>v. <em>Ivins, Id. </em>377; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>3 <em>Id: </em>13; <em>McKelway </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>5 <em>Id. </em>321; <em>Hartwell </em>v. <em>Camman, </em>2 <em>Stockt. </em>128; <em>Zinc Co. </em>v. <em>Franklinite Co., </em>2 <em>Beas. </em>322, 341, 342; <em>S. C., </em>2 <em>McCart. </em>418; <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Fulton, </em>31 <em>Penna. St. </em>475-479.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The description of the premises conveyed to Faunce is \u25a0from a beginning corner to the middle of the meadow bank; thence along the middle of the bank, the several courses and distances designated, until the line strikes the natural bank, which is a high piece of land; thence to a stone near the river, and from thence out into the river to low-water mark. By this description Faunce took an estate in fee in the one-half of the bank, and in the strip of land, next to the river, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>and became riparian owner. If his estate was so qualified as-to the use, that he could not make available to himself a grant under the act of 1871, the intervention of it between the upland and the river front would make the grant of the state to the plaintiff inoperative as against his title. It was so-decided in State <em>v. </em>Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">In addition to the infirmity of the plaintiff\u2019s title under the-state\u2019s grant, arising from the fact that the defendant-, and those under whom he justified, were owners of the strip of land along the river front, there is another consideration which would make the plaintiff\u2019s grant unavailing as against the defendant. The deed of Whitall to Faunce was earlier in time than his conveyance to Newbold, under whom the plaintiff claims. If Newbold is not chargeable with notice of Faunae\u2019s deed by its record, his deed contained an exception and reservation of the rights of Faunce by express reference-to the Faunce deed. Newbold and those claiming under him are bound by this exception and reservation and cannot deny its binding force. <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>3 <em>Green Ch. </em>277. Under the conveyance to him Newbold took only a contingent estate in the premises conveyed to Faunce, to take effect on the determination or forfeiture of the latter\u2019s estate, but neither he nor his grantees could acquire a grant from che state which should work the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Applying these principles to the case in hand, the exception principally relied on was to the judge\u2019s charge, that as a matter of law the defendant had a right o-f fishery at the <em>locus in quo, </em>and was entitled to a verdict unless he did acts which did damage to the plaintiff that were not necessary in operating the fishery, and were outside of and beyond the rights and privileges of fishing granted to Christian Faunce in 1818 and in 1834 by the then land-owners. The judge in his charge had expressly told the jury that if the defendant either negligently or carelessly or intentionally damaged the plaintiff' unnecessarily, and beyond the privileges granted by Whitallon the upland, the jury should find for the plaintiff the amount of such damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>This instruction was substantially correct, for by the law of this state owners of lands upon the Delaware river have a right of fishery adjacent to the shore front in their ownership, which is the subject of exclusive enjoyment and capable of alienation. This right, like other rights of riparian owners on the tide-waters of this state, is good against all persons except the state or its grantee; <em>Stevens </em>v. P. <em>&amp; N. R. </em>P. <em>Co., </em>5 <em>Vroom </em>532, 553, and the plaintiff is not in position to set up against this right, the right of the state, if the state has any right superior to the right of the riparian owner on the Delaware river in such a fishery.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The judge received in evidence, under objection, proof of conveyances and grants of other fisheries elsewhere along the river, and evidence touching the manner in which other fisheries were transferred and conveyed. This evidence, we think, was irrelevant, but the error in admitting it was immaterial, for the case stands upon the force and effect of the defendant\u2019s title.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The other exceptions have been examined, and in them we find no'error.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b627-8\"><em>For </em>affirmance\u2014The Chancellor, Chief Justice, Depue, Dixon, Knapp, Reed, Scudder, Van Syckel, Brown, Cole, Paterson, Whitaker. 12.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b627-9\"><em>For </em>reversal\u2014None.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
