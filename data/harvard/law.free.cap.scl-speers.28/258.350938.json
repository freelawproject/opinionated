The special verdicts in both cases present the question upon which the judgment of the court is demanded. The single question upon which both cases must turn, arises on the construction of two clauses of the will of William Maner, and that is, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Civility Ewing Maner took an absolute estate in the land and negroes devised to her, upon her attaining the age of twenty-one. If I were permitted to look beyond the will, and to take into consideration the situation of the testator and his daughter Civility E., I might come to the conclusion that it was the intention of the testator to divest his daughter of an absolute estate, either upon her dying under age <em>or </em>unmarried; and this would give to the disjunctive conjunction or, its grammatical meaning. But I must confine myself to the construction of the clause itself, and give to it the same construction that has been given by judicial decisions of this State to clauses of similar import. In one contingency, it might have been the intention of testator to give to his daughter an absolute estate, although she should have died under twenty-one. Had she, or any of his minor children, married and died under twenty-one, leaving issue, it could not well be supposed that it was the intention of the testator to divest the issue of the property given to the parent. In relation to his daughter, Civility, perhaps the testator could have had no such event in contemplation ; but her rights are to be determined as those of younger children might have been, and if they would have had an absolute estate, so must she. To effect this, the word <em>or </em>must be construed \u00bfmd \u2014 and in so deciding, I but conform to previous decisions in this State. In this view of the law, the defendants\u2019s title must be held good under the will of Civility E. Maner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-4\">Let the postea, therefore, be delivered to the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-5\">The plaintiffs appealed from the foregoing decision, upon the following ground, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-6\">That by the grammatical and legal interpretation of the will of Captain William Maner, as it is submitted, the estate, real and personal, devised and bequeathed to his daughter, Civility Ewing, was defeasible on her dying <em>unmarried ; </em>that her father's will was intended to create <em>iioo </em>contingencies, upon the happening of either of which, her estate was to be limited over to the plaintiffs in this suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-7\">Martin, for the motion,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADo\">cited and commented on <em>Scanlan vs. </em>Porter, 1 Bailey, 427.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Colcock, contra.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJU\">The first clause gives an absolute estate.

Issue can never take as purchasers by implication.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\n<em>Curia, per</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"ArX\">Butler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANq\">The question in this case cannot, in principle, be distinguished from that decided in the case of <em>Scanlan vs. Porter, </em>1 Bail. 427, and the subsequent cases in the Court of Equity of <em>Adams vs. Chapman, </em>1 Hill, 265, and <em>Barksdale vs. Edwards, </em>2 Hill C. R. 184. The two last recognised and confirmed the authority of the first. These cases rest mainly on the authority of <em>Fairfield vs. Morgan, </em>5 Bos. <em>&amp; </em>Pul. 38. Since the decision of this case, there has been no disposition to agitate the question in the English Courts, and its authority has been uniformly followed in the United States. The words of devise in those cases referred to were very nearly alike. In the case of <em>Scanlan vs. Porter, </em>the devise was to testator\u2019s son, but if he should die before he attains the age of 21, <em>or </em>have issue, then over. The word <em>or </em>was here construed <em>and, </em>because it best comported with the true intention of the testator, to conclude that if his son died under age, and without issue, the property was to go over; but that it never could have been the design of the father to disinherit the issue of his child, should he die under age, leaving issue. And such would have been the effect, if the particle <em>or </em>had received its disjunctive meaning. Might not the same result have followed, in relation to the clause of the will now before the court, if <em>or </em>were not construed <em>and. </em>Suppose any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>testator\u2019s minor children, (and all the children by the second marriage were in their minority at the death of their father,) had married and died in their minority, leaving issue; the husband and issue of such marriage would be divested of the property, if the construction should prevail that is now contended for by the plaintiffs. We think Civility Maner took an absolute estate upon attaining the age of 21. It is said that these words, \u201c die underage, or before marriage,\u201d do not import the same thing as attaining age, or leaving issue, as the testator in this last case might well mean to provide for issue when he would not intend the same for marriage. In the event of issue being the fruit of marriage, there could be no difference. And to give effect to a devise in such case, <em>or </em>must be construed <em>and. </em>In principle, there is no distinction in the two cases; and if it were to be made, it would lead to mischievous confusion. The English Courts do not seem to have noticed the distinction at all. In the case of <em>Thackeny vs. </em>Hampton, 1 Cond. E. C. Cases, 424, the testatrix gave the residue of her property to her two grand daughters, in trust, till they come of age, or marry, but if one of them die <em>before </em>marriage <em>or </em>coming of age, then her share to go to the survivor, or her children. One of the legatees married, and the other attained 21. <em>Held </em>that both acquired absolute vested int\u00e9rests, upon the happening of those events; the Vice Chancellor saying that it was the meaning of the testatrix, that if either died <em>under age and unmarried, </em>her share should go over to the survivor. Of course, this view could not have been taken if <em>or </em>had received its literal disjunctive meaning.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"ARn\">Note. \u2014 In <em>Miles vs. Dyer, </em>7 Cond. E. Ch. Rep. 484\u2014Testator bequeathed his real and personal estate to trustees, in trust to pay an annuity to his wife, and to raise and pay to each of his children \u00a32000, on their attaining twenty-one, and to accumulate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>surplus income of tlie trust property, during the life of his wife, and after her death to sell the property and divide the proceeds amongst his children on their attaining twenty-one ; and in case all his children should die in the life time of his wife, <em>or </em>under twenty-one and without leaving issue, then, after his wife\u2019s death, to sell the trust property and divide the proceeds among certain other <em>persons </em>\u2014 held, that <em>or </em>ought to be read as <em>and, </em>and that the children having attained twenty-one,were absolutely entitled to the property, though their mother was living.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The result of our judgment is in conformity with that of the Circuit Court, that Civility Ewing Maner took an absolute estate, upon attaining the age of 21; and, of course, the limitation over being too remote, is void. The judgment below is therefore affirmed, and this motion dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b270-5\">Richardson, O\u2019Neall, Evans and Wardlaw, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<headnotes id=\"AJG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>The Vice-Chancellor. This case is one of that numerous class in which the word or ought to read <em>and. </em>It is clear the testator did not mean the trust property to go over, if his children attained twenty-one, or if they died under twentv-one, leaving issue. He meant to put in opposition to each other, dying under twenty-one without leaving issue, and attaining twenty-one.</headnotes>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
