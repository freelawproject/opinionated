A.S. \u00a7 47.25.410 (Supp.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-21\">Plaintiffs contend that their families are ineligible to receive benefits under the Alaska AFDC program solely because the need of their children is caused by the involuntary unemployment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>opposed to the death, absence or incapacity, of the father. Plaintiffs argue that this classification is inconsistent with the avowed purposes of the federal and state AFDC programs in that it provides incentive for unemployed fathers to desert their families in order to obtain the assistance needed to feed and clothe their children. This classification, they assert, places an invidious burden upon the integrity of their family relationships and deprives them of equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The case came before the court on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. At the conclusion of oral argument, defendants submitted a cross-motion requesting similar relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\"> The court has jurisdiction to hear this case under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (1970) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343(3), (4) (1962).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The expanding scope of these statutes was explored recently in Eisen v. Eastman, 421 F.2d 560 (2d Cir. 1969). Attempting to reconcile the Supreme Court\u2019s acceptance of jurisdiction under these statutes in King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 88 S.Ct. 821, 19 L.Ed.2d 869 (1968), which invalidated Alabama\u2019s AFDC \u201cman in the house\u201d regulations, with the more conservative interpretation of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343 espoused by Mr. Justice Stone in Hague v. C. I.

While this interpretation of King v. Smith has not been consistently adhered to, McCall v. Shapiro, 416 F.2d 246 (2d Cir. 1969), the Supreme Court continues to hear suits alleging wrongful deprivation of welfare benefits under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343 (1962). Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U.S. 397, 403, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 25 L.Ed.2d 442 (1970); Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970). We conclude that 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343 (1962) confers jurisdiction on district courts to hear claims arising under the Social Security Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>McClellan v. Shapiro, 315 F.Supp. 484 (D.Conn.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">This court is not deprived of jurisdiction by the Eleventh Amendment\u2019s prohibition of suits by individuals against the state. It is well established that a suit against a state official who is attempting to enforce an allegedly unconstitutional statute is not a suit against the state. Georgia R. R. &amp; Banking Co. v. Redwine, 342 U.S. 299, 72 S.Ct. 321, 96 L.Ed. 335 (1952); Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). While there is no single rule for determining when a state is the real party in interest, if the suit demands a judgment which can only be satisfied by an appropriation from the public treasury it will be barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Harrison Construction Co. v. Ohio Turnpike Comm\u2019n. 272 F.2d 337, 340 (6th Cir. 1959). The state argues that a judgment against them in this case would necessarily compel the Legislature to appropriate additional funds for welfare. Plaintiffs, however, have merely asked the court to order responsible state officials to disperse whatever public funds are presently available for welfare in an even-handed fashion. Such a judgment would not violate the Eleventh Amendment. <em>Compare </em>Williams v. Dandridge, 297 F.Supp. 450, 459 (D.Md.1968), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970) and <em>Dews </em>v. Henry, 297 F.Supp. 587, 592 (D.Ariz. 1969) <em>with </em>Westberry v. Fisher, 309 F.Supp. 12, 18 (D.Me.1970). We conclude that the remedy prayed for in this case raises no Eleventh Amendment issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">THE MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">AFDC was established as a federal grant-in-aid program by Title IV of the Social Security Act of 1935. Act of Aug. 14, 1935, ch. 531, Title IV, 49 Stat. 627. The program, as initially enacted, authorized payments on behalf of children who have been \u201cdeprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent * * 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 606(a) (1969). Alaska, as well as every other state, participates in this basic program on a matching fund basis. In order to qualify for federal funds the State must submit a plan \u201cfor the aid and services to needy families with children\u201d to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare for the Secretary\u2019s approval. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 602 (1969). Pursuant to these provisions, Alaska received approximately $1,383,300 in 1969 from the federal government..</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">In 1967 permanent legislation was enacted which made additional grants available to states wishing to provide assistance to children whose need is due to the unemployment of the father. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 607 (1969) [hereinafter, AFDC-UP]. Although \u00a7 607 purports to amend the definition of needy child contained in \u00a7 606(a), AFDC-UP is optional and not applicable unless described in the plan submitted by the state to the Secretary. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 607(b) (1969). Although only about one-half the states currently participate in the AFDC-UP program, plaintiffs contend that the State of Alaska may not refuse to participate in AFDC-UP without violating the Fourteenth Amendment rights of families whose need is distinguishable from that of AFDC families only in its origins.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">At the outset, plaintiffs contend that the burden imposed by Alaska\u2019s AFDC program upon their right to maintain a family association requires that this court apply a strict, or \u201cactive\u201d, standard of review to the state's action.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">The standard test for denial of the Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the law is stated in Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U.S. 61, 31 S.Ct. 337, 55 L.Ed. 369 (1910) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyY\">\u201c1. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not take from the State the power to classify in the adoption of police laws, but admits of the exercise of a wide scope of discretion in that regard, and avoids what is done only when it is without any reasonable basis, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>therefore is purely arbitrary. 2. A classification having some reasonable basis does not offend against that clause merely because it is not made with mathematical nicety, or because in practice it results in some inequality. 3. When the classification in such a law is called in question, if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it, the existence of that state of facts at the time the law was enacted must be assumed. 4. One who assails the classification in such a law must carry the burden of showing that it does not rest upon any reasonable basis, but is essentially arbitrary.\u201d 220 U.S. at 78-79, 31 S.Ct. at 340.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">In cases where a state has made a \u201csuspect classification\u201d or allegedly infringed \u201cfundamental . rights\u201d the standard of review is more strict. The court in these cases must closely scrutinize the state action to determine if it is justified by a <em>compelling </em>(as opposed to a merely rational) state interest, and will require that any legislation be tailored so as to impose the least intrusion upon the preferred rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The category of \u201csuspect classifications\u201d has been limited to discriminations whose proscription may be clearly inferred from the language and legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, such as those based on race, alien-age and lineage. Developments in the Law: Equal Protection, 82 Harv.L.Rev. 1065, 1087-88 (1969). To date the Supreme Court has recognized only a few rights not found in the Constitution which are so fundamental that their infringement requires similar protection.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">Plaintiffs argue that the right to maintain the integrity of one\u2019s family has been recognized as fundamental.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The contention that state welfare programs may not impose any burdens upon the sanctity of the family structure, however, was rejected by the Supreme Court in the recent case of Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970), a case which we view as foreclosing any extension of the \u201cfundamental right\u201d doctrine into the welfare area. Upholding a Maryland AFDC maximum grant provision which placed a ceiling on the allowable aid to large families, the Court characterized welfare legislation as social and economic regulation which must be upheld if the state scheme bears a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-14\">\u201cIf this were a case involving government action claimed to violate the First Amendment guarantee of free speech, a finding of \u201coverreaching\u201d would be significant and might be crucial. For when otherwise valid governmental regulation sweeps so broadly as to impinge upon activity protected by the First Amendment, its very overbreadth may make it unconstitutional. * * * But the concept of \u201coverreaching\u201d has no place in this case. For here we deal with state regulation in the social and economic field, not affecting freedoms guaran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>teed <em>by the </em>Bill of Rights, and claimed to violate the Fourteenth Amendment only because the regulation results in some disparity in grants of welfare payments to the largest AFDC families. For this Court to approve the invalidation of state economic or social regulation as \u2018overreaching\u2019 would be far too reminiscent of an era when the Court thought the Fourteenth Amendment gave it power to strike down state laws \u2018because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">\u201cIn the area of economics and social welfare, a State does not violate the Equal Protection Clause merely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect. If the classification has some \u2018reasonable basis,\u2019 it does not offend the Constitution simply because the classification \u2018is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality/ * * * \u2018The problems of government are practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough accommodations \u2014 illogical, it may be, and unscientific.\u2019 * * * \u2018A statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">\u201cTo be sure, the cases cited, and many others enunciating this fundamental standard under the Equal Protection Clause, have in the main involved state regulation of business or industry. The administration of public welfare assistance, by contrast, involves the most basic economic needs of impoverished human beings. We recognize the dramatically real factual difference between the cited eases and this one, but we can find no basis for applying a different constitutional standard. * * * It is a standard that has consistently been applied to state legislation restricting the availability of employment opportunities. * -x- * And it is a standard that is true to the principle that the Fourteenth Amendment gives the federal courts no power to impose upon the States their views of what constitutes wise economic or social <em>policy.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">Plaintiffs argue that <em>Dandridffe </em>is distinguishable in that it involved a ratable reduction in the grant to each child of a large family while all eligible needy children presumably continued to receive <em>some </em>aid. <em>See </em>397 U.S. at 481, 90 S.Ct. 1153. In this ease, however, the court is confronted with an eligibility requirement which cuts off all assistance to admittedly needy children. The burden on the family is correspondingly greater; for inasmuch as the parents might have \u201cfarmed out\u201d some of their children to avoid the effects of the maximum grant limitation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in the case at bar the father would have to desert <em>all </em>his children in order to qualify them for <em>any </em>benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">These distinctions are difficult to sustain in light of the clear wording of the opinion written by Mr. Justice Stewart, who has consistently maintained that the Court should not look outside the Constitution to find \u201cfundamental rights.\u201d <footnotemark>8a</footnotemark> Moreover, it is difficult to distinguish between the situation in which the child is forced to leave the father and the one in which the father is forced to leave the child. Since the law only requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>that a fundamental right be burdened\u2014 not totally destroyed <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 to justify active review, it is inconsistent to contend that a greater imposition upon family ties in the <em>Dandridge </em>case would have elicited a stricter standard of review.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The question for decision, then, is whether there is a \u201creasonable basis\u201d for dividing needy children into two categories \u2014 those whose need stems from the death, absence or incapacity of a parent, and those whose need is caused by the unemployment of the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Plaintiffs contend that the purpose of AFDC, as defined in 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 601 (1969)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and A.S. 47.25.400 (1962),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is to aid needy children and at the same time to strengthen family life by providing that assistance be channeled through the home. Classifications which are unrelated to, or which detract from, these fundamental purposes of AFDC have been stricken as arbitrary and violative of equal protection.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> AFDC, however, is <em>also </em>designed to preserve in the parents \u201cthe maximum self-support and personal independence consistent with the maintenance of continuing parental care and protection.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 601. To effectuate the goal of self-support and personal independence the state may structure its AFDC program to maximize incentives to seek employment as an alternative to welfare. Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 486, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number> Plaintiffs argue that even if encouragement of employment is an appropriate goal of the AFDC program, this objective is irrational when considered in light of the fact that wage employment is virtually non-existent throughout most of the year in rural Alaska. The effect of this requirement, however, may well be to encourage families to migrate to urban areas where employment and job training are more readily available. AFDC was not designed to provide a guaranteed annual income to those who are capable of gainful employment. If there are no jobs in rural Alaska, and no prospect that jobs will develop in these areas in the foreseeable future, then we cannot say that a governmental policy which promotes relocation is not reasonably related to a legitimate state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Accordingly, summary judgment must be granted in favor of defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-10\">.

Similarly, the court in Smith v. King, 277 F.Supp. 31 (M.D.Ala.1967), also using the traditional equal protection test, invalidated Alabama\u2019s \u201cman in the house\u201d rule because the discouragement of illicit relationships was not related to the purpose of AFDC. The Supreme Court affirmed on statutory grounds without expressing an opinion concerning the equal protection issue. King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 88 S.Ct. 821, 19 L.Ed.2d 869 (1968) .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b484-16\">. Plaintiffs argue that this objective is already achieved by the requirement that AFDC recipients be involuntarily unemployed. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 602(a) (19) (F) (1969) . This fact might be relevant if the standard of review required the state to use the least intrusive alternatives in effectuating its goals, but under the traditional standard of review the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>alternative means are available and actually being employed is not conclusive. <em>See </em>Dandridge v.
