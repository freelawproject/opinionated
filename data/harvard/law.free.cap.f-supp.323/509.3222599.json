Plaintiff Wilczynski is a 75 year old woman in poor health who has for some time been a recipient of medical assistance under the provisions of Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396g. (Sometimes hereinafter referred to as \u201cTitle XIX assistance\u201d or \u201cMedicaid.\u201d) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Her sole source of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>come is social security, from which she receives $85.90 per month. Her sole assets are two life insurance policies with a combined face value of $1,000.00 and cash surrender value of about $700.00. Plaintiff Watson is a 36 year old woman who is permanently and totally disabled. Like Mrs. Wilczynski, she has been receiving Title XIX medical assistance for several years. Similarly her sole source of income ($149.00 per month) is social security, and her sole asset is an insurance policy of $1,000.00 face value and approximately $230.00 cash surrender value.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Both plaintiffs have been notified by the <em>defendant</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that by reason of a change in the resource limitation for Connecticut\u2019s Medicaid program, they will no longer be eligible to receive medical assistance unless and until they use up their resources in excess of the new limitation. They brought this class action <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to challenge on both constitutional and statutory grounds, the validity of the Connecticut Welfare Department regulation (1 Conn.Welfare Man. \u00a7 D-244.1 (1970)) promulgating that new limitation. The regulation is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs seek by this ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>tion a declaration of its invalidity and an injunction against its enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">\n<em>Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Plaintiffs rely on their constitutional claim to support jurisdiction in the federal court. That claim can be briefly stated. The challenged regulation (sometimes hereinafter referred to as \u201c\u00a7 244.1\u201d) excepts from inclusion in the sum of an applicant\u2019s total resources \u201creal property used as a home, * * * an automobile essential for transportation, or United States Government Veterans\u2019 life insurance.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claim this provision of the regulation creates an arbitrary distinction between two classes of Medicaid applicants on grounds wholly irrelevant to eligibility for medical assistance. Specifically, they contend, the regulation renders them ineligible, while others, with equal or greater assets, may, provided they have invested their resources in the right kind of assets, remain eligible. For purposes of eligibility for Medicaid, plaintiffs argue, no rational distinction can be drawn between the two classes; and consequently plaintiffs are by application of the regulation denied equal protection of the laws. Plaintiffs allege that this suit is authorized by the Civil Rights Act, 42 U. S.C. \u00a7 1983<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that a jurisdictional basis is provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">The hitherto troublesome problems of fitting all welfare cases within \u00a7 1343(3)\u2019s judicial limitation to cases where \u201cthe right or immunity [allegedly infringed] is one of personal liberty, not dependent for its existence upon the infringement of property rights,\u201d Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496, 531, 59 S.Ct. 954, 971, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939) (opinion of Mr. Justice Stone); Eisen v. Eastman, 421 F.2d 560 (2d Cir. 1969); <em>see, e. g., </em>Campagnuolo v. Harder, 319 F.Supp. 414 (D.Conn.1970); McClellan v. Shapiro, 315 F.Supp. 484 (D.Conn.1970) (three-judge district court), have now been resolved for the district courts in this circuit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In Johnson v. Harder, 438 F.2d 7, (2d Cir. 1971),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> rev\u2019g 318 F.Supp. 1274 (D.Conn.1970), the court analyzed the recent Supreme Court welfare cases <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and concluded they were rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>oneilable with the Stone formula on the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">\u201cSince welfare cases by their very nature involve people at a bare subsistence level, disputes over the correct amounts payable are treated not merely as involving property rights, but some sort of right to exist in society, a personal right under the Stone formula.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The court held that in welfare cases of this type, \u201cso long as a colorable constitutional claim has been raised, jurisdiction will properly lie.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claim before this court is at least colorable. It is not \u201cobviously without merit\u201d nor does \u201cits unsoundness so clearly result from the previous decisions of [the Supreme Court] as to foreclose the subject.\u201d California Water Serv. Co. v. City of Redding, 304 U.S. 252, 255, 58 S.Ct. 865, 867, 82 L.Ed. 1323 (1938). <em>Cf. </em>Dandridge v. Williams, <em>supra, </em>397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491; Rosado v. Wyman, <em>supra, </em>397 U.S. 397, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 25 L.Ed.2d 442; Johnson v. Harder, <em>supra, </em>438 F.2d at 12. Because plaintiffs seek an injunction against the enforcement of a regulation of statewide application, on constitutional grounds that are not unsubstantial, a three-judge district court was convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281 to hear and decide the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">\n<em>Statutory Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">In addition to their equal protection claim, plaintiffs contend that the state regulation is invalid because antithetical to the Social Security Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Having jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claim, this court may also exercise pendent jurisdiction over the statutory claims. Wyman v. Rothstein, 398 U.S. 275, 90 S.Ct. 1582, 26 L.Ed.2d 218 (1970); Rosado v. Wyman, <em>supra, </em>397 U.S. at 402, 90 S.Ct. 1207; King v. Smith, <em>supra, </em>392 U.S. at 312 n. 3, 88 S.Ct. 2128. <em>Rothstein </em>requires the court to consider the statutory claims for relief prior to reaching the constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">A. <em>The Federal Statutory Scheme </em>\u2014 El<em>igibility Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-14\">A brief description of the relevant statutory scheme<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> for Medicaid will serve to provide a context within which to later consider the specific conflicts alleged. The Medicaid program cuts across the four categorical public assistance programs to meet a special need common to all.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There are three different classes of eligible recipients provided for by Title XIX:</p>\n<p id=\"b574-15\">(1) The first class is composed of those receiving aid under any of the four categorical assistance programs, <em>viz, </em>the programs for assistance to the aged (OAA), the blind (AB), the disabled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>(AD), and families with dependent children (AFDC). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a) (10). HPAA, Supp. D, \u00a7 D-4020(1) (a) . Neither plaintiff being a beneficiary under any of these programs, eligibility is not claimed under this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">(2) Secondly, the state <em>must </em>provide assistance to persons who would be eligible for aid under one of the categorical programs listed in (1) above but for state eligibility requirements applicable to those programs which are at the same time specifically prohibited as eligibility requirements for Title <em>XIX </em>assistance. HPAA, Supp. D, \u00a7\u00a7 D-4020(c), D-4030 (b) . Persons in these first two classes are called \u201ccategorically needy.\u201d HPAA, Supp. D, \u00a7 D-4020. Plaintiff Wilczynski claims eligibility for Medicaid as a categorically needy person because she would be eligible for OAA but for her refusal to assign her life insurance to the Welfare Commissioner \u2014 an eligibility requirement for OAA<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but prohibited as an eligibility requirement for Medicaid. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396a(a) (17) (D) and (a) (18). HPAA, Supp. D, \u00a7\u00a7 D-4000 (1) (c), D-4020(1) (c), and D-5700.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">(3) Thirdly, the state <em>may </em>(and Connecticut does \u2014 Conn.Welfare Man.Supp. D, \u00a7 D-230; Conn.Regs. \u00a7 17-134d-1) provide medical assistance to those who are related to the categorical programs (i. e., by being old, or disabled, or blind, or having dependent children) but whose incomes and/or assets exceed the eligibility limits of the appropriate category. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a) (10) (B). HPAA, Supp. D, \u00a7\u00a7 D-4000 (A) (2) (b) (D, D-4020.2(b). When their income and/or assets are nevertheless not adequate to pay for their medical care, they may qualify for assistance as \u201cmedically needy\u201d persons. It is in this third class that plaintiff Watson claims to be because she is permanently and totally disabled and her income slightly exceeds that for AD assistance, but is insufficient to meet her medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">Under Title XIX, the state may determine the income and asset limitations for eligibility so long as the limits are reasonable. HPAA, Supp. D, \u00a7 D-4240(A) (5). The state may not consider income or assets not actually available to the applicant, 42 U.S..C. \u00a7 1396a(a) (17) (B), assets must be reasonably evaluated, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a) (17) (C), and the limitation must at a minimum be at the most liberal level used in any money payment program in the state on or after January 1, 1966. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 248.21(a) (1) (iv).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">B. <em>Connecticut\u2019s Eligibility Limits for Medicaid </em>\u2014 1 <em>Conn. Welfare Manual </em>\u00a7 <em>244.1 (1970)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">Section 244.1 sets out the income and resource limitations for eligibility for Medicaid in Connecticut.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See </em>n. 4, <em>supra. </em>A single beneficiary may have up to $250.00 liquid assets and in addition thereto' the \u201ccategorically needy\u201d and \u201cmedically needy\u201d may retain up to $600.00 in a burial reserve. The latter may be in the form of a prepaid funeral contract with a funeral director, a trust fund for burial with someone other than the commissioner, or an insurance policy of not more than $600.00 face value payable to the insured\u2019s estate or a funeral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>director. A recipient may also have, without limitation as to value, a home, a car, United States Government Veterans life insurance, and reasonable personal and household effects.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">C. <em>Claims of Statutory Conflict</em></p>\n<p id=\"AdD\">1. <em>The Lien Prohibition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The federal statute prohibits the state from imposing as a condition of eligibility for Medicaid any \u201clien * * * against the property of an individual pri- or to his death on account of medical assistance paid or to be paid on his behalf under the plan * * * \u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a) (18). Plaintiffs contend that the burial reserve provision of \u00a7 244.1 applicable to a limit of $600.00 of assets in excess of $250.00 is just such a lien and, therefore, an impermissible condition of eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">There is no question but that the disputed burial reserve is a lien as defined by the federal regulations. <em>See </em>HPAA, Supp. D, \u00a7 D-5730 (\u201call encumbrances * * * made during his lifetime * * * which would prevent an individual from freely transferring or otherwise disposing of his property\u201d). The critical question is whether it is imposed \u201con account of medical assistance paid or to be paid on his behalf under the plan.\u201d We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Although the meaning of the phrase \u201con account of\u201d as used in the statute is not entirely free from doubt, it would seem to us that the most obvious meaning is to prohibit state provisions designed to recoup state money spent on medical payments made pursuant to the plan, not those designed to protect the state against other kinds of expense such as that for the burial of paupers. The same sentence in the statute which imposes the lien prohibition also prohibits any \u201cadjustment or recovery (with some exceptions not here relevant) of any medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of [any] individual under the plan.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a) (18). This strengthens the view that the concern of Congress was with state efforts (either by lien on the recipient\u2019s property or direct action against him) to require the recipient, where possible, to make restitution of moneys spent on his behalf under the Title XIX program. <em>See also, </em>HPAA, Supp. D, \u00a7 D-5720, and Conn. Regs. \u00a7 17-134d-4 (which explain that the statute prohibits liens imposed \u201cbecause of\u201d medical payments made under the plan) and HPAA, Supp. D, \u00a7 D-5730 (which explains that the prohibition does not apply where a recipient voluntarily initiates and makes repayment for medical assistance provided under the plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">By providing that eligibility is not impaired if assets above $250.00 and up to $850.00 are earmarked for burial, Connecticut has not imposed a lien designed to recoup moneys spent for medical assistance.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Rather this provision operates to protect the state against costs for burial of paupers. <em>See </em>Conn.Gen. Stats. \u00a7 17-286 (which requires the appropriate public official to provide an indigent person with \u201ca proper burial,\u201d the cost of which is not to exceed $600.-00). Accordingly, we find the burial reserve requirement outside the scope of the federal lien prohibition and not in conflict with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>2. <em>Reasonable Evaluation of Assets Actually Available</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Plaintiffs contend that the state\u2019s valuation of their insurance policies at face value rather than cash surrender value conflicts with the federal requirement that in determining eligibility for Medicaid the state must reasonably evaluate an applicant\u2019s assets and consider only those actually available to him. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a) (17) (B) and (C). They reason that nothing above the current cash value of their policies can be applied by them to meet their medical and other needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The Supreme Court has three times struck down state attempts to attribute to applicants for public assistance income or resources not shown to be actually available to them. Lewis v. Martin, <em>supra, </em>397 U.S. 552, 90 S.Ct. 1282, 25 L.Ed.2d 561; Solman v. Shapiro, <em>supra, </em>300 F.Supp. 409 (D.Conn.), aff\u2019d, 396 U.S. 5, 90 S.Ct. 25, 24 L.Ed.2d 5 (1969); King v. Smith, <em>supra, </em>392 U.S. 309, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118. In each case, the state requirement was found to conflict with federal statutes and/or regulations. In the instant case, plaintiffs do not contend that their insurance policies are not available assets, only that they are not worth as much to them for purposes of meeting their present needs as the state contends. Hence they are not reasonably evaluated as required by the federal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 position is demonstrably correct. Reasonable evaluation of available assets in the context of eligibility for public assistance must have reference to evaluation for purposes of meeting those present needs for which assistance would otherwise be provided. <em>See </em>HPAA, Supp. D, \u00a7 D-4230.4 (to be available, resources must be \u201cin hand\u201d or \u201cunder the control of the individual\u201d). Any other measurement of value, e. g., the future value to a recipient\u2019s estate of a life insurance policy, is irrelevant to whether a recipient can meet out of his own assets his present subsistence needs. We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 244.1, insofar as it requires evaluation of life insurance policies at face value, conflicts with the federal statute and is, therefore, invalid. The value of plaintiffs\u2019 insurance policies, for purposes of Title XIX eligibility, is their cash surrender value.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">3. <em>Minimum and Reasonable Asset Limitation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-14\">Plaintiffs' final statutory argument is that Connecticut\u2019s asset limitation on Medicaid eligibility, as set by \u00a7 244.1, is not, as required by 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 248.21(a) (1) (iv), \u201cat the most liberal level used in any money payment program in the State on or after January 1, 1966.\u201d The parties agree that the standard against which to measure \u00a7 244.1 in this respect is \u00a7 323 of the Connecticut Welfare Manual, specifically the resource limitations it sets for eligibility for participation in the OAA, AB, and AD programs. They do not agree, however, on how to interpret that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-15\">Section 323 is not an easily understandable regulation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We find however <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>that the most liberal level of assets allowed by its terms is not more than that allowed by \u00a7 244.1; that, is, $250.00 liquid assets and an additional $600.00 burial reserve. Accordingly, we find that \u00a7 244.1 conforms to federal standards in that regard.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by plaintiffs\u2019 argument that \u00a7 323 permits retention of unencumbered life insurance having a cash value up to $1300.00. Retention of an insurance policy carrying that cash value is conditioned by \u00a7 323 upon its prior assignment to the Welfare Commissioner. Arguing that under Title XIX that requirement would be regarded as a prohibited lien, plaintiffs\u2019 claim that for purposes of determining the minimum asset limitation for Medicaid the state is forced to accept \u00a7 323\u2019s provision for $1300.00 of life insurance without its accompanying assignment requirement. This reasoning of course is patently fallacious. Requiring the state to allow Medicaid recipients to retain at least $1300.00 in life insurance without encumbrance would be to require it to set a resource limit for Title XIX eligibility far more liberal than that used in the most liberal money payment program in the state.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> That is not required by 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 248.21(a) (1) (iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">4. <em>Summary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">Connecticut\u2019s eligibility provision for Medicaid, \u00a7 244.1 of the Connecticut Welfare Manual, to the extent it is challenged by these plaintiffs, does not conflict with the federal statute or regulations except insofar as it requires the defendant to value insurance policies at face value. We hold the federal statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a) (17) (C), requires the defendant to consider the cash surrender value of life insurance policies as their value for purposes of Medicaid eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">As a consequence of that holding, it is apparent first that Mrs. Watson, whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>only asset is her insurance policy with a cash value of less than $250.00, is entitled to retain that policy free and clear of any encumbrance and remain eligible for medical assistance. Mrs. Wilczynski presents a different situation. The value of her two life insurance policies exceeds $250.00 but not $850.00. Accordingly, while she may retain those assets, the state may require a burial reserve on the amount in excess of $250.00. The mechanics of accomplishing that result we leave to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Mrs. Wilczynski, of course, might be afforded more complete relief if her constitutional claim were sustained by the court. Consequently, we next consider the merits of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">D. <em>The Constitutional Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5j\">As noted earlier, plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claim is that Connecticut\u2019s eligibility standards, as expressed in \u00a7 244.1, violate their fourteenth amendment right to equal protection of the laws. Specifically they challenge the permitted exemptions from resources taken into account in determining eligibilty. Exemptions are allowed for the recipients\u2019 home and car, of any value, and United States Government life insurance. <em>See </em>n. 4, <em>supra. </em>Plaintiffs argue that those exemption provisions create two distinct classes of Medicaid recipients based on the kind of assets they hold, and discriminates against those who do not have enough to invest in the exempted class of assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Initially, we note that the traditional equal protection test, requiring only that the legislative classifications to be valid have some \u201creasonable basis,\u201d is applicable in this case. Dandridge v. Williams, <em>supra, </em>397 U.S. at 484-486, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491; McClellan v. Shapiro, <em>supra, </em>315 F.Supp. at 490-491. The traditional test was recently stated by the Court in McDonald v. Board of Election Comm\u2019rs, 394 U.S. 802, 809, 89 S.Ct. 1404, 1408, 22 L.Ed.2d 739 (1969):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXs4\">\u201cThe distinctions drawn * * * must bear some rational relationship to a legitimate state end and will be set aside as violative of the Equal Protection Clause only if based on reasons totally unrelated to the pursuit of that goal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">The state contends in its brief that the end to be served by the challenged legislation is \u201cto conserve the finite resources of the State of Connecticut and spread them amongst the greatest number of potentially eligible beneficiaries * * (Defendant\u2019s brief at 7). In discharging \u201cthe difficult responsibility of allocating limited public welfare funds among the myriad of potential recipients,\u201d Dandridge v. Williams, <em>supra, </em>397 U.S. at 487, 90 S.Ct. at 1163, the state \u201chas a valid interest in preserving the fiscal integrity of its programs,\u201d Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 633, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1330, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969), and \u201cmay legitimately attempt to limit its expenditures * * * for public assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is no doubt then that \u00a7 244.1 setting resource limitations for Title XIX eligibility is designed to achieve a legitimate state end. The next question is whether the specific means chosen to attain that end are rationally related to its attainment. \u201cThe saving of welfare costs cannot justify an otherwise invidious classification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-14\">The state advances no specific justifications for the exemptions allowed by \u00a7 244.1. Nevertheless, we are not foreclosed from ascertaining their purpose from the terms and context of the regulation and the legal and practical objectives which can reasonably be imputed to it. <em>Cf. </em>Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 617, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960); Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464, 466-467, 69 S.Ct. 198, 93 L.Ed. 163 (1948). From that perspective, it is apparent that a rational basis does exist for the exemptions of \u201creal property used as a home * * * [and] an automobile essential for transportation.\u201d It is certainly rational for a state, whose goal is fair allocation of limited welfare funds, to allow those public assistance applicants who already have provision for shelter to retain it, rather than require its divestiture and thrust upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the state the added burden of providing substitute housing. The state in other words may rationally conclude that in most instances it is less costly to allow those otherwise eligible for assistance to keep their own homes, if they have them.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Similarly, while transportation may not be regarded as a bare necessity, its availability will in all likelihood greatly increase opportunities for employment. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that the availability of transportation is reasonably related to the state\u2019s proper purpose of encouraging dependent citizens to become self-supportive. <em>Cf. </em>McClellan v. Shapiro, <em>supra, </em>315 F.Supp. at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">We need not explore all possible justifications for the classifications created by the regulation; it is enough that one rational purpose is served. Dandridge v. Williams, <em>supra, </em>397 U.S. at 486, 90 S.Ct. 1153. Nor do we pass on the wisdom of the challenged provision, or decide whether it \u201cbest fulfills the relevant social and economic objectives that [Connecticut] might ideally espouse * * * \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 90 S.Ct. at 1162. The absence of any limit on the value of a home or car which may be retained causes us some concern but we cannot say that failure to set any limit renders the exemptions unreasonable in light of the purposes for which they were created.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The provision exempting United States Government Veteran\u2019s life insurance stands on a somewhat different footing. The state contends that because insurance policies of that type are specifically made nonassignable except to certain specified members of the insured\u2019s family, <em>see </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 6.62, 8.59, it cannot compel holders of those policies to comply with the burial reserve provisions of \u00a7 244.1. Accordingly, the state adopted the solution of wholly exempting those policies. While we entertain some doubt about the state\u2019s conclusion that government insurance policyholders could not comply with the burial reserve provision applicable to assets in excess of $250.00, <em>see </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 6.56, 6.60, 8.46, 8.47, there is an independent ground for upholding the classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">United States Government life insurance for veterans was designed \u201cto protect from financial hardship the surviving families of those who had served under the nation\u2019s flag.\u201d United States v. Henning, 344 U.S. 66, 71, 73 S.Ct. 114, 117, 97 L.Ed. 101 (1952). The enacting legislation was \u201cplainly adopted for humane and patriotic reasons.\u201d Philippine Nat\u2019l Bank v. United States, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 126, 300 F.2d 718, 720 (D.C.Cir. 1962). Insurance of that kind belonging to a veteran or his family is, therefore, of a decidedly different quality than ordinary life insurance.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Veteran\u2019s life insurance isj in the' nature of a gift and is designedto confer a benefit and to recompense the veteran for his sacrifices in service to the country. <em>See </em>In re McCormick\u2019s Estate, 169 Misc. 672, 8 N.Y.S.2d 179, 183 (1938). In determining, therefore, what assets may be exempted from the accounting of an applicant\u2019s resources in judging eligibility for public assistance, there is a reasonable basis for treating this particular insurance differently from ordinary life insurance. Veterans and their families may constitute a particular class from whom it is permissible to distinguish others in many respects. <em>See, e. g., </em>Bateman v. Marsh, 188 Misc. 189, 64 N.Y.S.2d 678, 683-685, aff\u2019d 271 App.Div. 813, 66 N.Y.S.2d 411 (1946), aff\u2019d, 296 N.Y. 849, 72 N.E.2d 30, 31 (1947). Consequently, we cannot say that the exemption of veteran\u2019s life insurance \u201crests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State\u2019s objective\u201d or that no \u201cstate of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.\u201d McGowan v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 425-426, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1105, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">In conclusion, therefore, we find that \u00a7 244.1, to the extent it is challenged by these plaintiffs, meets the strictures of the equal protection clause. Accordingly, plaintiffs are entitled only to the relief required to rectify the state\u2019s improper valuation of their insurance policies. In all other respects, relief is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-14\">. The Medicaid legislation creates a comprehensive cooperative federal-state program for medical care. Federal grants are authorized to participating states for their medical assistance programs if they submit a state plan comporting with federal requirements. Participation in the federal program is voluntary, but if a state elects to participate, as Connecticut has, Conn.Gen.Stats. \u00a7 17-134a. it must comply with the requirements of the federal statutes and regulations to remain eligible for federal funds. The administrative scheme is similar to that of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program described in King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 316-317, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"Ajg\">For a general discussion of the statutory and regulatory scheme underlying Medicaid, see L. Silver &amp; M.

Plaintiffs purport to represent \u201call other present or potential recipients of medical assistance under the Title XIX Program who are similarly situated.\u201d (Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Amended Complaint 4). We hold this case is properly a class action insofar as the class is limited to those present recipients of Medicaid whose benefits will be terminated, or applicants for Medicaid who are found to be financially ineligible, solely because the face value of their life insurance renders their assets excessive of the eligibility limits set by the regulation challenged by this suit. Defining the class in that way, it is apparent that this action meets the prerequisites for a class action established by Fed.R.Civ.P. 23. <em>See </em>Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, 391 F.2d 555 (2d Cir. 1968). The requirements of Rule 23(a) are met and \u201cthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.\u201d Rule 23(b) (2).
