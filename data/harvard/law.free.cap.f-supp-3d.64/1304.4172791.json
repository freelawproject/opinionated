MAGNUSON, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1347-8\">This matter is before the Court on Defendant Target Corporation\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (Docket No. 163) in the Financial Institution Cases. For the reasons that follow, the Motion is granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-10\">In December 2013, Defendant Target Corporation, a Minnesota-headquartered retailer that is one of the nation\u2019s largest retail chains, announced that over a period of more than three weeks during the busy Christmas holiday shopping season, computer hackers had stolen credit- and debit-card information for approximately 110 million of Target\u2019s customers. Lawsuits soon followed this announcement, and ultimately the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated all federal lawsuits into this litigation. The multidistrict litigation consists of two distinct types of claims: those brought by consumers and those brought by financial institutions. The Motion at issue here seeks to dismiss only the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Docket No. 163) filed in the financial institution cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-13\">The court in another consumer data breach case has succinctly described the nation\u2019s credit- and debit-card system as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-14\">Every day, merchants swipe millions of customers\u2019 payment cards. In the seconds that pass between the swipe and approval (or disapproval), the transaction information goes from the point of sale, to an acquirer bank, across the credit-card network, to the issuer bank, and back. Acquirer banks contract with merchants to process their transactions, while issuer banks provide credit to consumers and issue payment cards. The acquirer bank receives the transaction information from the merchant and forwards it over the network to the issuer bank for approval. If the issuer bank approves the transaction, that bank sends money to cover the transaction to the acquirer bank. The acquirer bank then forwards payment to the merchant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1347-15\"><em>In re Heartland Payment Sys., Inc. Customer Data Sec. Breach Litig., </em>834 F.Supp.2d 566, 574 (S.D.Tex.2011) (footnote omitted), <em>rev\u2019d in part sub nom. Lone Star Nat\u2019l Bank, N.A. v. Heartland Payment Sys., Inc., </em>729 F.3d 421 (5th Cir.2013). Plaintiffs here are a putative class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>of issuer banks whose customers\u2019 data was stolen in the Target data breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint consists of four claims against Target. Count One contends that Target was negligent in failing to provide sufficient security to prevent the hackers from accessing customer data. Count Two asserts that Target violated Minnesota\u2019s Plastic Security Card Act, and Count Three alleges that this violation constitutes negligence per' se. Count Four claims that Target\u2019s failure to inform Plaintiffs of its insufficient security constitutes a negligent misrepresentation by omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">Target now seeks dismissal of all claims, arguing that Plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficient facts to establish any of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-7\">When evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court assumes the facts in the Complaint to be true and construes all reasonable inferences from those facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. <em>Morton v. Becker, </em>793 F.2d 185, 187 (8th Cir.1986). However, the Court need not accept as true wholly eonclusory allegations, <em>Hanten v. Sch. Dist. of Riverview Gardens, </em>183 F.3d 799, 805 (8th Cir.1999), or legal conclusions that Plaintiffs draws from the facts pled. <em>Westcott v. City of Omaha, </em>901 F.2d 1486, 1488 (8th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-8\">To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 545, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Although a complaint need not contain \u201cdetailed factual allegations,\u201d it must contain facts with enough specificity \u201cto raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. \u201cThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclu-sory statements,\u201d will not pass muster under <em>Twombly. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955). In sum, this standard \u201ccalls <em>for enough </em>faet[s] to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [the claim].\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556,127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-10\">A. Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-11\">The parties agree that, at least for the purposes of this Motion, Minnesota law governs Plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim. A claim of negligence under Minnesota law requires a plaintiff to allege four elements: duty, breach, causation, and injury. <em>Schmanski v. Church of St. Casimir of Wells, </em>243 Minn. 289, 67 N.W.2d 644, 646 (1954). Target contends , that Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege that Target owed them a duty or that Target breached any duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-12\">1. Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-13\">Minnesota law imposes a duty \u201cto act with reasonable care for the protection of others\u201d in two situations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1348-14\">First, ... general negligence law imposes a general duty of reasonable care when the defendant\u2019s own conduct creates a foreseeable risk of injury to a foreseeable plaintiff. <em>See 1 </em>J.D. Lee &amp; Barry A. Lindahl, <em>Modern Tort Law: Liability &amp; Litigation </em>\u00a7 3.48 (2d ed.2003).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1348-16\">Second, a defendant owes a duty to protect a plaintiff when action by someone other than the defendant creates a foreseeable risk of harm to the plaintiff and the defendant and plaintiff stand in a special relationship. <em>See Bjerke v. Johnson, </em>742 N.W.2d 660, 665 (Minn.2007). In other words, although a defendant generally does not have a duty \u201cto warn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>or protect others from harm caused by a third party\u2019s conduct,\u201d <em>H.B. ex rel. Clark v. Whittemore, </em>552 N.W.2d 705, 707 (Minn.1996), an exception to this rule exists when the parties are in a special relationship and the harm to the plaintiff is foreseeable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWeO\"><em>Domagala v. Rolland, </em>805 N.W.2d 14, 23 (Minn.2011). The existence of a duty is a question of law. <em>ServiceMaster of St. Cloud v. GAB Bus. Servs., Inc., </em>544 N.W.2d 302, 307 (Minn.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">Target contends that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims must be analyzed as falling under the third-party-harm type of negligence, so, that to be liable Target and Plaintiffs must stand in a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with one another. Target asks the Court to find as a matter of law that Target had no duty to Plaintiffs because there is no special relationship between Plaintiffs and Target and, in any event, \u201c \u2018a person has no duty under Minnesota law to protect another from the harmful conduct, including criminal conduct, of a third person.\u2019\u201d (Def.\u2019s Supp. Mem. (Docket No. 185) at 6 (quoting <em>RKL Landholding, LLC v. James, </em>No. A12-1739, 2013 WL 2149979, at *2 (Minn.Ct.App. May 20, 2013)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-6\">Plaintiffs argue that this case is not a third-party-harm case but rather is a straightforward negligence case: Target\u2019s own conduct, in failing to maintain appropriate data security measures and in turning off some of the features of its security measures, created a foreseeable risk of the harm that occurred, and Plaintiffs were the foreseeable victims of that harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-7\">Plaintiffs also argue that, even if this situation is a third-party-harm situation where a special relationship between Plaintiffs and Target is required, they have pled such a special relationship here. But as Target points out, Minnesota has recognized this \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d special relationship doctrine, <em>Domagala, </em>805 N.W.2d at 23, in a very few, limited situations that are not applicable here. <em>See REL Landholding, </em>2013 WL 2149979, at *2 (noting that the \u201c \u2018special relationship\u2019 exception is a narrow one\u201d). Moreover, the Minnesota Supreme Court has cautioned against extending those situations further. <em>See Whittemore, 552 </em>N.W.2d at 709 (stating that \u201cthis court has carefully carved out\u201d the \u201couter boundaries\u201d of the special relationship exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-9\">At this preliminary stage of the litigation, Plaintiffs have plausibly pled a general negligence case. Although the third-party hackers\u2019 activities caused harm, Target played a key role in allowing the harm to occur. Indeed, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that Target purposely disabled one of the security features that would have prevented the harm is itself sufficient to plead a direct negligence case: Plaintiffs allege that Target\u2019s \u201cown conduct create[d] a foreseeable risk of injury to a foreseeable plaintiff.\u201d <em>Domagala, </em>805 N.W.2d at 23. Thus, the Court must determine whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled that Target owed Plaintiffs a duty of care under general negligence principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-10\">Minnesota courts have considered the following factors when determining whether a defendant owed a duty of care in a general negligence case: (1) the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, (2) the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered, (3) the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct, (4) the policy of preventing future harm, and (5) the burden to the defendant and community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach. <em>Domagala, </em>805 N.W.2d at 26. The duty to exercise reasonable care arises from the probability or foreseeability of injury to the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAlthough in most cases the question of foreseeability is an issue for the jury, the foreseeability of harm can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>be decided by the court as a matter of law when the issue is clear.\u201d <em>Foss v. Kincade, </em>766 N.W.2d 317, 322-23 (Minn.2009). The Court evaluates Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding these factors in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, keeping in mind that this Motion tests only the sufficiency of those allegations and not the ultimate success of Plaintiffs\u2019 legal theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Target\u2019s actions and inactions \u2014 disabling certain security features and failing to heed the warning signs as the hackers\u2019 attack began \u2014 caused foreseeable harm to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have also plausibly alleged that Target\u2019s conduct both caused and exacerbated the harm they suffered. And Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that Target was solely able and solely responsible to safeguard its and Plaintiffs\u2019 customers\u2019 data is also plausible. Imposing a duty on Target in this case will aid Minnesota\u2019s policy of punishing companies that do not secure consumers\u2019 credit- and debit-card information. <em>See </em>Minn.Stat. \u00a7 325E.64. And despite Target\u2019s dire warnings about the burden of imposing such a duty, it is clear that the institutional parties to credit- and debit-card transactions have already voluntarily assumed similar duties toward one another. <em>See, e.g., In re Heartland, </em>834 F.Supp.2d at <em>588 </em>(noting that Visa and MasterCard Card Operating Regulations, which' apply between merchants, issuer banks, and acquirer banks, specify procedures for issuer banks to make claims in the event of data breaches).</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-5\">That Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged.a duty on Target\u2019s part is bolstered by the existence of Minnesota\u2019s Plastic Card Security Act, discussed in more detail below. While courts are reluctant to recognize duties of care in the absence of legislative imprimatur, the duty to safeguard credit- and debit-card data in Minnesota has received that legislative endorsement. And the legislature specifically acknowledged the availability of other causes of action arising out of a Minnesota company\u2019s failure to safeguard customers\u2019 information, stating that the remedies under the PCSA \u201care cumulative and do not restrict any other right or remedy otherwise available\u201d to the issuer banks. Minn.Stat. \u00a7 325E.64, subd. 3. Plaintiffs have adequately pled that Target owed them a duty of care, and their negligence claim will not be dismissed on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-7\">2. Breach</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-8\">Having determined that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged the existence of a duty, there can be no doubt that Plaintiffs have also plausibly alleged that Target breached that duty by failing to safeguard Plaintiffs\u2019 customers\u2019 information. Because Target does not challenge Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations with respect to the elements of causation and damages, Plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim succeeds in stating a claim on which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-9\">B. Negligent Omission</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 negligent-misrepresentation-by-omission claim alleges that Target \u201cfailed to disclose material weaknesses in its data security systems and procedures\u201d that it had an obligation to disclose. (Compl. \u00b6 131.) According to Target, this claim fails for multiple reasons: Target had no duty to disclose anything to Plaintiffs; Plaintiffs have failed to plead this claim with the particularity Rule 9(b) requires; a negligent misrepresentation claim does not he with respect to statements about Target\u2019s intent; and Plaintiffs have failed to allege reliance, which is an essential element of a negligent-misrepresentation-by-omission claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-11\">1. Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-12\">\u201cAs a general rule, one party to a transaction has no duty to disclose materi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>al facts to the other.\u201d <em>Smith v. Questar Capital Corp., </em>Civ. No. 12-2669, 2014 WL 2560607, at *14 (D.Minn. June 6, 2014) (Nelson, J.). This rule applies \u201cunless (1) there existed a fiduciary or confidential relationship between the parties; (2) one party was in possession of special facts that could not have been discovered by the other; or (8) one party who chooses to speak omits information so as to make the information actually disclosed misleading.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Sailors v. N. States Power Co., </em>No. 4:02-253, 1992 WL 532172, at *9 (D.Minn. July 13, 1992) (MacLaughlin, J.); <em>Klein v. First Edina Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>293 Minn. 418, 196 N.W.2d 619, 622 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-4\">Plaintiffs have not alleged that there is a fiduciary or confidential relationship between Target and Plaintiffs. Rather, Plaintiffs contend that Target knew facts about its ability to repel hackers that Plaintiffs could not have known, and that Target\u2019s public representations regarding its data security practices were misleading. Target takes issue with Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations in this regard, but on a.Motion to Dismiss, the Court must determine only whether the allegations are plausible. The allegations meet that plausibility standard, and Plaintiffs have adequately pled a duty of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">2. Rule 9(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-6\">Target also argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 negligent omission claim should be dismissed for failure to comply with the stricter pleading requirements of Rule 9(b). The Rule requires that, \u201c[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). These heightened pleading requirements apply to negligent-misrepresentation-by-omission claims. <em>Trooien v. Mansour, </em>608 F.3d 1020, 1028 (8th Cir.2010). In the context of a claim of negligent omission, the Rule is satisfied \u201cif the omitted information is identified and \u2018how or when\u2019 the concealment occurred.\u201d <em>In re Bisphenol-A (BPA) Polycarbonate Plastic Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>687 F.Supp.2d 897, 907 (W.D.Mo.2009) (citing <em>Great Plains Trust Co. v. Union Pac. R. Co., </em>492 F.3d 986, 996 (8th Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-8\">Plaintiffs have identified the omitted information, namely Target\u2019s failure to disclose that its data security systems were deficient and in particular that Target had purposely disengaged one feature of those systems that would have detected and potentially stopped the hackers at the inception of the hacking scheme. Plaintiffs contend that these omissions were made in representations such as Target\u2019s online Privacy Policy and in Target\u2019s agreement to comply with Visa and MasterCard\u2019s Card Operating Regulations and other security requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-9\">Although these allegations are not as detailed as Target would like, at this early stage of the litigation they are sufficient to allege the \u201chow or when\u201d the information regarding Target\u2019s data security practices was omitted from disclosure. Plaintiffs have complied with 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-10\">3. Omissions</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-11\">Target argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 claim is not cognizable because it is founded on alleged omissions regarding what Target intended to do with respect to data security. Target contends that an omission regarding Target\u2019s \u201cpresent intention to act in the future\u201d is not actionable because it cannot be proved false. (Def.\u2019s Supp. Mem. (Docket No. 185) at 23.) But Target misconstrues Plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Plaintiffs\u2019 negligent-omission claim is not premised on any statement about Target\u2019s future intentions or even on Target\u2019s statements about the data breach itself, but rather on the fact that Target held itself out as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>having secure data systems when Target knew that it did not have secure systems and had taken affirmative steps to make its systems more vulnerable to attack. At this stage of the case, this allegation is sufficient to state a claim for negligent omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">4. Reliance</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">Finally, Target contends that Plaintiffs have, failed to plead any reliance on the alleged omissions. Plaintiffs respond that reliance is not required, citing Judge Nelson\u2019s recent <em>Smith </em>decision. (Pis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n Mem. (Docket No. 204) at 41.) But <em>Smith </em>did not hold that reliance is not a required element for a negligent omission claim. Rather, <em>Smith </em>found that reliance was a \u201cfact-intensive\u201d inquiry inappropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss. <em>Smith, </em>2014 WL 2560607, at *15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">A plaintiff raising a securities fraud-by-omission claim need not plead or prove reliance if the omitted information is material \u2014 reliance on that material information is presumed. <em>Affiliated Ute Citizens v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 128, 153-54, 92 S.Ct. 1456, 31 L.Ed.2d 741 (1972). But courts have not extended this presumption of reliance outside of the securities-fraud context. Plaintiffs are therefore required to plead reliance on Target\u2019s alleged omissions in order to state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">The Complaint contains no indication that Plaintiffs relied on any of the alleged omissions. Rather, the Complaint merely avers that Plaintiffs \u201csuffered injury\u201d \u201cas a direct and proximate result of Target\u2019s negligent misrepresentations by omission.\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 134.) This is insufficient to plead reliance, and Plaintiffs\u2019 negligent-misrepresentation-by-omission claim must therefore be dismissed. Assuming that there are facts supporting Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the alleged omissions, Plaintiffs may file an amended complaint within 30 days that fully and plausibly alleges all of the required elements of a negligent-misrepresentation-by-omission claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-9\">C. Plastic Card Security Act</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-10\">Minnesota\u2019s Plastic Card Security Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-11\">No person or entity conducting business in Minnesota that accepts a[ ] [credit or debit card] in connection with a transaction shall retain the card security code data, the PIN verification code number, or the full contents of any track of magnetic stripe data, subsequent to the authorization of the transaction or in the case of a PIN debit transaction, subsequent to 48 hours after authorization of the transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-12\">\u2021 ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-13\">Whenever there is a breach of the security of the system of a person or entity that has violated this section ... that person or entity shall reimburse the financial institution that issued any [credit or debit cards] affected by the breach for the costs of reasonable actions undertaken by the financial institution as a result of the breach in order to protect the information of its cardholders or to continue to provide services to cardholders....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1352-14\">Minn.Stat. \u00a7 325E.64, subd. 2, 3. Count Two of the Complaint alleges a violation of this section, and Count Three contends that as a result of the alleged violation of the PCSA, Target is negligent per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-15\">Target raises two challenges to Plaintiffs\u2019 PCSA claims. First, Target contends that the PCSA applies only to transactions that occur in Minnesota, making the Act inapplicable to the majority of transactions about which Plaintiffs complain. Second, Target argues that the PCSA only prohibits the retention of customer data, and because the customer data at issue here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>was stolen when the consumer\u2019s card was used at a Target store and was not stolen from Target\u2019s database, Target\u2019s alleged retention of that data did not cause Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-4\">Target\u2019s first argument is not well taken. The Act does not apply only to business transactions that take place in Minnesota. By its terms, it applies to the data retention practices of any person or entity \u201cconducting business in Minnesota.\u201d Minn.Stat. \u00a7 325E.64, subd. 2. Target is a Minnesota company that conducts business in Minnesota, and thus its data retention practices are governed by the Act. And contrary to Target\u2019s assertions, the application of the PCSA to out-of-state transactions does not implicate the dormant Commerce Clause. <em>See Jones v. Gale, </em>470 F.3d 1261, 1267 (8th Cir.2006) (state law violates dormant Commerce Clause if it legislates \u201c \u2018differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter\u2019 \u201d) (quoting, among others, <em>Oregon Waste Sys., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality, </em>511 U.S. 93, 99, 114 S.Ct. 1345, 128 L.Ed.2d 13 (1994)). The PCSA does not discriminate between in-state and out-of-state transactions or economic interests. Rather, it applies only to Minnesota companies\u2019 data security practices and does not purport to regulate the practices of any non-Minnesota company. And it applies equally to the Minnesota companies\u2019 data retention practices with respect to in-state and out-of-state transactions. The dormant Commerce Clause does not render the application of the PCSA in this situation unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">Target\u2019s second argument is that, even if Target violated the retention provisions of the Act as Plaintiffs allege, Target\u2019s allegedly illegal activities did not cause the harm of which Plaintiffs complain. There is no dispute that the hackers who stole Target\u2019s customers\u2019 data did so by installing malware on Target\u2019s computer servers that read the data from customers\u2019 credit and debit cards at the moment those cards were swiped in Target\u2019s stores. Thus, according to Target, the fact that Target may also have stored that data longer than the PCSA allows is irrelevant, because the hackers did not steal the data from Target\u2019s data storage but rather stole it directly from the cards as they were used in Target\u2019s stores. Plaintiffs\u2019 response to this argument is two-fold. First, they allege that the hackers\u2019 malware did not immediately transmit the stolen data to the hackers\u2019 servers, but rather stored the stolen data on Target\u2019s own servers for up to six days before transmitting that data to the hackers. Thus, Plaintiffs contend that Target\u2019s servers did \u201cretain\u201d the data within the meaning of the PCSA, and that retention allowed the hackers to steal that data. Plaintiffs also contend that the hackers would have been unable to steal all of the magnetic stripe information, in particular the card\u2019s CW code, without accessing the customer data Target regularly stored on its servers. In other words, Plaintiffs assert that the hackers gathered some data from the use of the card and other data from Target\u2019s servers, making the data breach even more serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-9\">Plaintiffs and Target disagree over which definition of \u201cretain\u201d the Court should use in interpreting the PCSA\u2019s requirements. Plaintiffs urge the Court to adopt the Oxford Dictionary\u2019s definition of retain, which is to \u201ccontinue to have something.\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n Mem. at 12.) Target, on the other hand, contends that the correct definition of \u201cretain\u201d must be read in the context of technical data retention, and is \u201cthe storage of data for future usage.\u201d (Def.\u2019s Reply Mem. (Docket No. 221) at 2 (emphases omitted)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>Whether the Court interprets \u201cretain\u201d to mean \u201cto continue to have\u201d or \u201cstorage for future use\u201d is immaterial to the outcome of the Motion to Dismiss. Plaintiffs allege that Target stored data for longer than the PCSA allows, and that the hackers were able to access some of this stored data, namely the CW codes, without which the breach would not have been as serious. In other words, although the hackers received some data directly from consumers\u2019 cards, they also retrieved other data from Target\u2019s servers. Even if Target is correct that the hackers\u2019 storage of stolen data on Target\u2019s servers does not implicate the PCSA, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims undoubtedly state a PCSA violation. The Motion to Dismiss this Count must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">Because Target\u2019s only argument regarding the negligence per se claim is that it fails because the PCSA claim fails, the negligence per se claim likewise survives this Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">Plaintiffs have plausibly pled a claim for negligence, a violation of the PCSA, and negligence per se. Plaintiffs failed to plead reliance, however, and therefore their negligent-misrepresentation claim must be dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-7\">Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-8\">1. Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the Financial Institution Cases (Docket No. 183) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-9\">2. The negligent-misrepresentation claim (Count Four) is DISMISSED without prejudice; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-15\">3.Plaintiffs shall have 30 days from the date of this Order to file an Amended Complaint sufficiently alleging the required elements of their negligent-misrepresentation claim, should they wish to do so.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1347-11\">. The Court will refer to this pleading as the Complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">. Perhaps realizing that this definition does not sufficiently help its argument, Target <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>takes it a step further and contends that the PCSA applies only if the entity \"affirmatively stores [data] for its own future use.\u201d <em>{Id.) </em>Thus, according to Target, even if the hackers stored the stolen data on Target\u2019s servers, Target did not \"retain\u201d that data within the PCSA\u2019s definition. Target\u2019s insistence that \"retain\u201d applies only to data the entity stores for its own use, however, is not supported by the authorities Target cites.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
