At the opening of the court, on the next day, the jury appeared, and the foreman delivered the sealed verdict, which was opened and read, by which the jury found for the plaintiff for 150 dollars, damages. On being <em>polled, </em>nine of the jurors dissented from the <em>verdict; </em>but, at the same time, stated that they did agree to the verdict when it was made, and so informed the constable before they separated. The judge directed the verdict to be entered, subject to the opinion of the court, pii the question, whether the same ought to be recorded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A9SB\"><em>Foot, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXh\">The practice of taking sealed verdicts, is not known in the <em>English </em>courts, and seems to have grown up here, for the purpose of convenience. If a party consents that the jury should seal up their ver* diet and then <em>separate, </em>he ought not, afterwards to be permitted to <em>poll </em>them: It may lead, to .very great abuse; for after the jurors have separated, they may be tampered with by the parties, and some of them induced, when <em>polled, </em>to dissent from the verdict, to which.they have before agreed, and which has been signed and sealed up by them. The signing of the verdict is an express assent by each juror to tjie verdict, and is equivalent to a <em>polU ing </em>of the jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aa7\"><em>Haggles </em>and <em>E. </em>Williams, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW-\">The jurors must all agree, to make a verdict.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> If the court refuse to let the jury <em>he polled, </em>after the sealed verdict is delivered, it .viiust he recorded ; but when, the jury have, in fact, been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>polled, and nine of them dissent, the verdict cannot be recorded. No objection was made to the polling of the jury, at the time, so that there was an implied assent; \u25a0and thus this case cannot be aifected by the expediency of the practice. We agree that if the rule of practice was now to be established, it ought to be, that when the parties have agreed that the jury may seal up their verdict and separate, they ought not to be polled.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b80-14\"> <em>7 Bac.

There js no verdict of any force but a public verdict, given openly in court; until it was received and recorded it was no verdict, and the jury had a right to alter it as they may a private verdict. The previous agreement, that the jury might seal up their verdict, did not take away from the parties, the right to a public verdict, duly delivered. There being then no legal verdict in this case, a new trial must be awarded with costs to abide the event of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">New trial granted. -</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
