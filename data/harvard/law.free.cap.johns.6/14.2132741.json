The authority given by the submission must be strictly pursued.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-11\">THIS was an action of debt, on an arbitration bond, conditioned to abide and perform the award of three arbitrators named, or any two of them, to be made in writing, under their hands and seals, ready to be delivered to the parties in difference, on or before the 20th December, 1808.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-12\">The defendant pleaded, 1. no award ; 2. that no award under the hands and seals of the arbitrators, or any two of them, 'was on or before the 20th December, 1808, ready to be delivered to the defendant, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-13\">The plaintiff replied to the irs# plea, setting forth the award ; to the <em>second </em>plea, that although it was true, no award of the arbitrators, or any two of them, under their hands and seals, was, on or before the said 20th day of December, ready to be delivered to the said defendant yet that the said arbitrators, before that day. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>to wit, on, &amp;c. having taken on themselves the burden , , of the award, &amp;c. made and published their award, under their hands and seals, upon the premises, ready to be delivered to the plaintiff, and did, in fact, on the, &amp;c. deliver their said award to the plaintiff, &amp;c.

The arbitrators are bound to pursue the terms of the submission. The submission is their authority, and it must be strictly observed. If it had been, that- the award should be by indenture, it would .have been requisite that the award should he indented.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-9\">In <em>Block </em>v.

The authority given by the submission must be pursued. As the bond provided that the award must be ready to be delivered <em>to the </em>parties, it is no award until it is so ready; and though the cases (2 Caines, 326. <em>Cro. Car. </em>541. <em>Hard. </em>399. 1 Ld. <em>Raym. </em>114.) have gone so far as to hold, that the making of the award was presumptive evidence, that it was ready for delivery; yet here that presumption is destroyed by the direct averment in the replication, that the award was not ready for delivery to the defendant, but was only ready for delivery to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"AX6\"><em> </em>2Caines, sse3~G\u2018</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
