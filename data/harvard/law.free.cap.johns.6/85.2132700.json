A. brought an action of <em>assumpsit </em>against the surviving elders and deacons of the church, who had signed the agreement in 1793, in their individual capacity, for the salary due to him since 1804. It was held that the acts of A. and of the deacons and elders amounted to a waiver of the original contract, by the mutual understanding of the parties; that after the incorporation of the church in 1796, the previous contract became extinguished, as a private and simple contract, and the corporation, acting by their seal, having assumed the contract, and become the debtor of A. with his assent and concurrence, the defend, \u25a0 ants were not responsible to him, in their individual capacity.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-13\">THIS was a special action of <em>assumpsit, </em>brought against the defendants, as survivors of <em>Benjamin Myer, </em>^ \" jun. and <em>John Fan Leuden, </em>deceased, who, together with the defendants, were, on the 2d day of <em>July, </em>1793, the elders and deacons of the <em>Kaatsbaan </em>congregation of the <em>Low Dutch </em>reformed church, in the town of <em>Kintrston, </em>in <em>Ulster </em>county.

One half of the elders and deacons, are annually elected by those in office. The plaintiff proved the tender of his services since, agreeably to his engagement, and the refusal of the <em>consistory </em>to accept them, or to allow him to preach in the church, or to perform his duties, as minister of the congregationj and that no salary had been paid to him since 2d <em>May, </em>1804.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-11\">The defendants produced in evidence a certificate from the records of <em>Ulster </em>county, showing that the minister, elders, and deacons of the said church had been incorporated on the 2d <em>April, </em>1/96, by the Style of the minister, elders, and deacons of the reformed protestant <em>Dutch </em>church of <em>Kaatsbaan, </em>in the town of <em>Kingston, </em>in the county of <em>Ulster ; </em>by this record, it ap- \\ , peared that the plaintiff assented to and was a party to the . . , incorporation. 1 his incorporation was made pursuant t0 the act of the legislature, passed in 1/88,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and which. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Was re-enacted the 27th <em>March, </em>1801, by an act entitled, an . , . , . . r \u201e act to provide tor the incorporation ot religious societies.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ai\">The defendants also produced in evidence the book of marriages and baptisms, and of the admission of members of the church, to show that the plaintiff had admitted existence of the incorporation; having on the 19th <em>No-vernier, </em>1803, made an entry in the book, in his own handwriting, declaring the seal of the corporation. In order also, to show that the plaintiff had waived the original contract of 1793, the defendants produced an account, in the hand-Writing of the plaintiff, in which he had charged the corporation or church of <em>Kaatsbaan </em>for his salary; and they also produced receipts given by the plaintiff, in the years 1802 and 1803, to the same church, for his salary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">The judge was of opinion, that the act of incorporation of the <em>Kaatsbaan </em>church in 1796, rendered the <em>call </em>or contract of 1793, inoperative ; and that if the plaintiff intended that it should continue binding on the church, lie ought to have renewed the agreement with the corporation, and, on that ground, nonsuited the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-9\">A motion was made to set aside the nonsuit, and for \u00e1 new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-10\">X. <em>Elmendorf </em>and <em>Hawkins, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_S\">By the 12 th sect, of the act of the 6th <em>April, </em>1784,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> every corporation, trustees, or persons entrusted with the management of the temporalities of any church, congregation, or religious society, were required to render an account, once in three years, to the chancellor, or one of the judges of the supreme court, or of the common pleas of the county, of all the estate, &amp;c. of such church, &amp;c. under <em>oath; </em>and in case of neglecting to render such account, for one year, the church or society ceased to be a corporation. Unless, therefore, the trustees of the <em>Kaatsbaan </em>church have accounted agreeably to the act, they ceased to be a corporation in 1800. And there is no. evidence that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>such account was ever exhibited. But admitting this c^lurc]:]l was a corporation, it does not follow, that individuais may n0j; make themselves responsible for the salary of the minister. There are many churches incorporated which have no property or funds, and in which the ministers are wholly supported by private subscriptions.

It was subscribed by the defendants and others, in the character of elders and deacons of the church, though they were not, at that time, an incorporated body. They were consequently bound in their individual capacity. The case admits that the plaintiff was paid his salary, yearly, <em>by the elders and deacons, for the time being, </em>from the time of the contract, until the 2d <em>May, </em>1804. One half of the elders and deacons were annually <em>chosen; </em>and it was therefore not the identical defendants who originally made the contract, but the rulers of the church who had assumed and performed the contract with the plaintiff. It does not appear that the plaintiff had ever looked to the individuals, who are now defendants, for his salary, but that he has constantly received it from the elders and deacons of the church. It further appears, that in 1796 the church became an incorporated body, under the act of 1788, and that the plaintiff, under his hand and seal, as pastor of the church, became a party to the act of incorporation j and that he had also, in 1803, under his hand, certified and declared the common seal of the corporation, and, that so late as 1808, he had charged the corporation with the salary for which he now sues.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">These facts are sufficient evidence of. a waiver of the original contract, by the mutual understanding of the parties.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It was <em>never </em>acted upon, as a private contract with the individuals who subscribed it $&gt; and after the. incorporation of the church, (and which the plaintiff is by his own acts\u201eestopped to- deny,) the simple contract became extinguished, equally as a bond extinguishes a simple contract debt.f The <em>corporation </em>created, and acting by seal, became his debtor, and assumed and performed' the contract with his continued assent and concurrence. In short, the contract from the beginning, was considered as being made with the deacons and elders of the church, and not with the individual defendants; and after the incorporation of the church, that new body assumed the contract, and were accepted. The original contract with the defendants, as individuals, was waived or extinguished. The motion to set aside the nonsuit must, therefore, he denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Judgment of nonsuit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b102-14\"> <em>Powell on Contracts, </em>415. f 1 <em>Burr. </em>9.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
