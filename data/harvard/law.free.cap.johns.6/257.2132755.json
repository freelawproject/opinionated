Rogers, </em>and <em>Mary Brooks, </em>the executors of <em>Isaac Brooks, </em>to <em>Benjamin Isaacs, </em>dated the 10th of <em>September, </em>1794, for the same lot. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the reading of the deed, unless the last will of <em>Isaac Brooks </em>was also produced; but the objection was overruled by the judge, who permitted the deed to be read, not as evidence that any estate passed by the deed, but to show, that the possession of the defendant might be adverse to the lessors, if claimed under that deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABR\">The defendant also read in evidence, an agreement between <em>Benjamin Isaacs </em>and <em>Joseph Cody, </em>dated the 12th of <em>May, </em>1795, by which <em>Isaacs </em>covenanted to execute a deed to <em>Cody, </em>for the lot in question, on receiving the sum of 1,500 dollars, which <em>Cody </em>covenanted to pay. On the 22d of <em>March, </em>1797, <em>Cody </em>assigned this contract to the defendant, who paid up the instalments due to <em>Isaacs, </em>on the 8th of <em>April, </em>1797.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AP8\">In 1795, <em>Cody </em>settled on the north-west corner of the lot, claiming under the contract with <em>Isaacs, </em>built a log-house, and cleared about 7 acres ; and in the same year, the defendant agreed with <em>Cody </em>for the purchase of 500 acres, part of the lot, and took possession on the south side of the road, and has since continued in possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ani\">The defendant also gave in evidence, a deed to him' for the same lot, from <em>Benjamin Isaacs </em>and <em>Samuel Bee-bee, </em>dated the 17th of <em>April, </em>1797, which had been duly acknowledged, and recorded. He then offered to prove that <em>William Dunbar, </em>the patentee, when he gave the deed to <em>Zebulon Macey, </em>the 12th of <em>March, </em>1784, was an infant; this was objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, unless the defendant would also prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>that the infant, within a reasonable time after coming of age, made an entry on the premises, or did some act to avoid the deed to <em>Macey; </em>but the judge overruled the objection. It was then proved that <em>William </em>Dunbar, the grantor, was born in June, 1/64.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-4\">The judge charged the jury, that if they found that <em>William </em>Dunbar, the patentee, was of the age of 21 years, on the 12th of March, 1/84, to find a verdict for the plaintiff generally; but if they should find, that he was within the age of 2i years, at that time, to find a verdict for the plaintiff, and also certify, that the patentee . was an infant, at the time of executing the deed. The judge, also, charged the' jury, that as <em>William Thorn </em>claimed under the other lessors, their rights were not concluded by the award, although they had not dissented thereto <em>; </em>but that the plaintiff could only recover on the demise of <em>Zebulon </em>Macey, as the defendant\u2019s possession was adverse, when the subsequent deeds were executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff; and that <em>William </em>Dunbar, on the 12th of March, 1/84, was under the age of 21 years.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-6\"><em>Ruggles, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj5z\">It would be inconsistent and absurd, to require <em>Macey </em>and Platt, from whom <em>Thorn </em>derived his title, to enter a dissent to an award in his favour.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-7\">The principal question is, whether the deed executed by <em>William </em>Dunbar, the 12th of March, 1/84, when he was an infant, did not continue valid; unless some act or dissent by him, after he became of age, was proved. A deed executed and delivered by an infant is good, until it is avoided by him. All deeds or acts in writing, executed by infants, which take effect by delivery, are voidable only.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> To such a deed, the party must plead <em>infancy, </em>not <em>non est </em>factum. The power of rescinding or avoiding the deed rests with the who ought to give notice to the grantee, so that he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>know that it' is the intention of the infant to avoid \"it, 'jQle gr\u00bfntee&gt; to every legal purpose and intent, is seised and possessed of the premises, until he is lawfully dispossessed. He may, by virtue of the deed, maintain trespass. Can he, then, be dispossessed by any act of the grantee, wholly unknown to him? The estate of the grantee is as good as an estate depending on a condition subsequent, which is good until the condition is performed by which it is defeated. As an entry for condition broken, avoids the estate, from the time of its creation ; so a plea of infancy avoids it from the time of the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-4\">\u25a0 Where an estate depends on a limitation, no entry is necessary: and in cases of advowsons, rents, commons, remainders, and reversions, where no entry can be made, a claim must be made on the land, or at the church~ which is notice to the party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-8\">An estate, granted by an infant, is more permanent and important, than an estate at will, to determine which, a notice to the tenant is necessary.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-9\">Again, seven years elapsed, after William Dunbar came of age, before he execu.ted the deed to Broohs, or did any act to avoid the deed to 2Uzce1~. Admitting, then, that he could avoid the deed to iJiacey, merely by executing a deed to a third person, after he had come of age, still, I contend, that by the lapse of time, he must be considered~ as having acquiesced in, and confirmed the first deed. He ought to avoid the deed, within a reasonble time, after he comes of age. A lease made to an infant is voidable; but he mast waive the land before re~it day comes<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> So, if an infant makes a lease for years, and at full age, says to the lessee, \"God give you joy pf it,\" it is a confirmation of the lease <footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> and if he re~ ceives ~rent, it is an affirmance.~</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-10\">If an infant exchanges lands, a~d enters on those acqu~red by the exchange, and continues to hold th~in after he attains full age, it is an a~rx~aace~ and the exc~ng~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>becomes perfect.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> If an infant has an election to make, he must make it within a reaspnable time after he comes of age. In the case of <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Smith,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was held, that a year was too long a <em>time; </em>and that a week or fortnight was a reasonable time. All these cases show, what is certainly just and reasonable, that where an infant has a right, on arriving at full age, to avoid his contract, or . _ . .is exercise an election, he ought to do it within a reasonaHe time; otherwise, his silence will be construed into an affirmance, and the deed or estate will be perfect.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b273-14\"><em>Cady </em>and Baldwin, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au6\">The deed from <em>Dunbar </em>to <em>Macey, </em>must operate as a bargain and sale, or a covenant to stand seised to the use of the bargainee. An entry is not necessary to avoid _ a common law conveyance. An actual entry is only necessary to avoid a fine.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> A feoffment being executed by livery of seisin, an entry is said to be necessary, in order to avoid it* But in case of a feoffment, by an infant, an entry was not <em>necessary; </em>for he might, after he became of age\u2019 have his writ of entry <em>dum fuit infra cetatem.</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Even if an entry was necessary to avoid a feoffment, it not necessary to avoid a bargain and sale, or covenant to stand seised to the use of the bargainee. If an infant gives a bond, and an attempt is made to enforce, the payment of it, he must plead infancy, so, if he executes a deed of bargain and sale, and it is attempted to be enforced against him, he may plead infancy. No entry is necessary; Indeed, considering .the state of the country in which the land was situated, it was impossible. It was a perfect wilderness, and not even surveyed, until by an order of the legislature, in 1790.. An entry would have been of no use. It would not have been an act of notoriety; for there was no person to take notice of an entry. The bargainee was not in possession; no man was in possession in that part of the state. If an entry was impossible or useless^ what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>act could be required of Dunbar, in avoidance of his , , , deed?</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvU\">An infant, we contend, may avoid a deed, at any time after coming of age, unless there is a possession of 20 years. If an infant bargain and sell lands, by deed indented and enrolled, he may avoid'd, at any time.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In the case of <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Wolveston,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where an infant covenanted to levy a fine by a certain time, to certain useS) and before he came of age he levied the fine, and by another deed, made at full age, he declared it to be to other uses; the court held, that the last deed should be the one to lead the uses. This is a strong case, to show that the second deed is to control and avoid the first.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2C\">In the case of <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Leach,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is said, that <em>1 </em>. ... the bond or an infant, or <em>non </em>compos, is void, because the law has appointed no act to be done to avoid it; and the only reason why the party cannot plead <em>\u25a0non est factum </em>is, because the cause of nullity is extrinsic, and does not appear on the face of the deed. In <em>Jackson, ex dem. Ludlow, </em>v. <em>Myers,\u00a7 </em>it is said to have been , \u201e ..... the generally received opinion, in 1788, that a bargain and sale required an enrolment, to render it effectual.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-19\">The present case is compared to an estate upon a condition subsequent; but there it is absolutely necessary that the person should express his determination to defeat the estate ; and that determination is manifested, by an entry. A second deed by an infant, after he comes ,of age, equally manifests his intention to avoid the first deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-20\">Again, it is compared to an estate at will, in which nor tice is required to be given to the tenant, before it can be determined. An estate at will is greater than an estate created by an infant, for the tenant, at will is entitled to emblements; but an infant may put an end to the estate, 'at his pleasure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>Blackstone</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>says, if an infant make an alienation <em>J </em>of his lands, and the alienee enters, and keeps posses<em>sion; </em>this, as the alienation is voidable, is, after avoidanee, wrongful, and, therefore, a <em>deforcement. </em>But in the case of a deforcement, there is no remedy by entry, but the party is driven to his action. If an infant has 20 years to bring his writ of entry <em>dum fait infra </em>cetatem, he cannot be barred by any implied acquiesence. Though the deed was executed in 1784, the patent was not issued until-1790,-before which time there had been no survey or location made. The execution of -a deed is as strong an expression of the intention of the infant to avoid the first deed, as an entry on wild and v\u00e1cant land. The court must presume a fraud in <em>Dunbar, </em>or consider his second deed as a solemn expression of his intention to avoid the first. As <em>Macey </em>knowingly purchased of an infant, he has no reason to complain of this act of avoidance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyZ\">Again, we contend, that no person can disturb the possession of the defendant but <em>Thorn, </em>in whose favour the award\u2019was made. The act of the legislature<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> has declared, that the award of the <em>Onondaga </em>commissioners shall be final and conclusive, unless the person conceiving himself aggrieved by such award, shall dissent thereto within two -years, and, if he is not in possession, bring his action to establish his right to the land. If the party dissenting is in possession, then, the party in whose favour the award is made, must bring his action within three years. The language of the act is explicit and imperative. No person can bring an action, but the person in whose favour the award is made, or the person who has filed his dissent. <em>Macey </em>and <em>Platt, </em>not having dissented, no action can be maintained in their names. It is said, they ought not to be concluded, because <em>Thorn </em>claimed title through them. But, can the court say, that if <em>Platt </em>should recover, that such recovery would be in trust for <em>Thorn P </em>If the award in favour of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Thorn, was not conclusive against all the world, except those who filed their dissent according, to the statute, against whom is it conclusive ? Is it conclusive against the patentee ? The object of the legislature, in passing ' this act, was to put an end to all controversies about the titles to these military lands.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-8\"><em>Ruggles, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3f\">There is, in effect, no difference between a conveyance by feoffment and livery of seisin, and a deed of bargain and sale. The latter vests the bargainee with every seisin and right, as fully and absolutely, to all intents and purposes, as the former mode of conveyance. The one has been substituted for the other, as the most convenient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad4\">Why is an entry on land necessary, in order to avoid a fine ? A <em>fine </em>is a conveyance in a court of record; not by a livery of seisin. There is as much reason to require an entry, to avoid a bargain and sale, as to avoid a fine. There ought to be some act of notoriety; something to make known to the bargainee, the intention of the bargainor to avoid his deed. Though the land was wild and vacant, so that an entry would not be notorious; yet the bargainee was seised in law, and ought to have had some notice from the infant, of the avoidance of his contract. If a person will lie by, in such a case, for such, a length of time, he ought not to be allowed, afterwards, <em>to </em>assert his right of avoidance or election,</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-11\"> Co.

Several points were made on the argument of.this cause; but, from the view I have taken of it, it will be-unnecessary to consider all of them. The title on which the plaintiff relies for a recovery consists, 1. Of an award in favour of <em>William Thorn; 2. </em>Of a deed from <em>William </em>Dunbar, the patentee, to <em>Zebulon </em>Macey, of the 12th. of March, 1784; and, S. Of a deed from <em>Macey </em>to <em>Z. Platt, </em>af the 23d of <em>June, </em>1794.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The defendant having dissented from the award, with- \u00b0 _ in two years after the making thereof, and being then in the actual possession of the lot, or a part of it, as to him the award became inoperative, and the'lessors of the plaintiff must recover, by virtue of their title, independently of the award. <em>Prima </em>facie, a title has been made out, by the conveyance from <em>Dunbar </em>to Macey, by the deed from <em>Macey </em>to Platt, and by his deed to <em>Thorn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AG6y\">The defence to this title is, that the deed from <em>Dunbar </em>to <em>Macey </em>was executed during the minority of <em>Dunbar; </em>and that after his attaining full age, he gave a deed to Brooks, dated the 12th of September, <em>1791. </em>If the deed from <em>Dunbar to Macey </em>is voidable, can the defendant avail himself of the conveyance to <em>Brooks </em>to avoid it? The 3d section (Laws, vol. 2. <em>sess. </em>20. <em>c. 51. </em>266.) of the statute to settle disputes concerning the titles to lands, in the county of Onondaga, renders an award of the commissioners, upon every claim or controversy respecting any lands in the county of Onondaga, after the expiration of two years frpm the making thereof, binding arid conclusive against all persons, except such as, conceiving themselves aggrieved thereby, shall, within two years, dissent from the same, and give notice thereof to the commissioners, and file the same in the office of the clerk of the county of <em>Onondaga.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">There exists no privity of interest or estate between <em>Isaac Brooks </em>and the <em>defendant; </em>for, although certain persons,' styling themselves executors of the last will of Brooks, have conveyed to <em>Benjamin </em>Isaacs, the lot in question, they have shown no authority derived from his will, to make that conveyance; and, therefore, although the dissent by the defendant would enure to the benefit of those from whom he derived his estate, the defendant cannot claim <em>under Brooks\u2019s </em>title ; and it follows, that as the heirs of <em>Brooks </em>have not dissented from the award, it has become binding and conclusive against them. Nor can the defendant set up <em>Brooks\u2019s </em>title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>as an oustanding one ; for such title, to defeat a recotery 211 ejectment, must be a subsisting title. The title under <em>Brooks </em>is not a subsisting one, the award of the commissioners in favour of <em>Thorn </em>having nullified it. This award, though not to operate against the defendant, does operate against any pretended title under which he may seek shelter, by the very terms of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"Aekk\">It was, therefore, unavailing for the defendant to give in evidence a deed which had ceased, by force of this act, to have effect. That deed could operate in this case only as an outstanding title in third persons, putting the statute out of question, and not as conferring a title on the defendant. In consequence of there being no dissent on the \"part of those claiming under <em>Brooks, </em>the award, by the act, has become binding and conclusive against that title, which must now be received, as if it never existed. Had the defendant shown a privity between himself and <em>Brooks, </em>then he could have availed himself of <em>Dunbar\u2019s </em>deed to <em>Brooks; </em>and the question, whether that deed avoided the deed to <em>Macey, </em>would then have arisen.</p>\n<p id=\"AZi5\">\u2022 The deed to <em>Brooks </em>being out of the case, the next question is, whether there should not have been a dissent from <em>Macey </em>and <em>Platt, </em>notwithstanding the award was in .favour of their alienee. It would be the heighth of absurdity to give the act a construction which should require them to enter their dissent to an award confirmatory of their title. They could hot, within the purview of the act, have been- aggrieved by the award, for the commissioners in awarding <em>Thorn to </em>be seised of the lot, must have done so, because he had shown these conveyances ; and, consequently, the award was substantially in affirmance of their deeds. It is true, that in consequence of an adverse possession in the defendant, when <em>Thorn </em>\u25a0received his deed from <em>Platt, </em>that deed has now become inoperative ; yet as the paper title was only in question before the commissioners, the award in favour of <em>Thorn </em>.enured to the benefit of those from whom he derived that paper title.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The defendant, then, ~an be regarded in no other light, than as a possessor without title~; and consequently, he cannot be admitted to set up the infancy of William Dunbar to defeat the deed, which is only voidable by him, or those who have derived an interest under him, which the defendant clearly has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The court are, therefore, of opinion, that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u00b6\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"At4\"> 3 <em>Johns.
