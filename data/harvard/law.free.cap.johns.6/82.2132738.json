He cited also, 1 Caines, 147. and 1 <em>Johns. Rep. 505. </em>and insisted that the words amounted merely to a charge <em>offalsehood.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-20\"><em>E. </em>Williams, contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b95-2\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ANF\">The defendant charged the plaintiff, with swearing false, as a witness m a court of justice, on a point material in the cause. These words so charged are actionable, if spoken <em>maliciously; </em>for they import perjury. To charge a person with taking <em>a false oath </em>in a court, has been held actionable, and this charge is synonymous. <em>(Com. Dig. tit. Action upon the Case for Defamation, D. 5. 7.) </em>In the case of <em>Michell </em>v. Browne, cited in 1 <em>Roll. Abr. 70. pl. 45. </em>it was held not actionable to say, \u201c He hath delivered false evidence and untruths, in his answer to a bill of chanceryj\u201d but the case assigns the reason for it, that many things in a bill are not material to the matter in variance, and peradventure the charge applies to such matter.\u201d In the present case the declaration states that the plaintiff was swearing to a matter material when he was so charged. In <em>Stafford </em>v. <em>Green, (1 Johns. Rep. 505.) </em>the charge was, <em>that he swore false before \u2019squire Andrews ; </em>but there was no <em>colloquium </em>stated, to show that it referred to a trial, or other legal-occasion ; and though there was an <em>innuendo </em>to that purpose,. yet it is certain that the want of a <em>colloquium </em>is not cured-by an <em>innuendo; </em>for that can only explain but not enlarge the meaning of the words, without the aid of a <em>colloquium. </em>(8 <em>East, 427.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">After verdict, we must conclude that the malice was proved. If under any circumstances those words so spoken may be actionable, the suit is now to be sustained, and the motion must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
