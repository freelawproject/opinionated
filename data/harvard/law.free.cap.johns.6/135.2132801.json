The plaintiff also produced a <em>fieri facias, </em>and a <em>testatum fieri facias </em>on the same judgment, the latter directed to the sheriff of <em>\u00a1fueens, </em>by virtue of which, the premises in question were sold, at public auction, by the sheriff on the 31st December, 1806, to the lessor of the plaintiff, as the highest bidder, for 400 dollars. The deed of the sheriff to the lessor, was dated the 22d <em>May, </em>1807. <em>Frost, </em>the tenant, was in possession of the premises at the time the execution was levied, and when the deed was executed. He held under <em>Hafif, </em>as his landlord.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-6\">Two witnesses testified that <em>Barton </em>was the reputed owner of the premises, and lived on the farm for several years, until he removed to <em>New-Tork, </em>about five years since <em>; </em>and that <em>Frost, </em>after <em>Barton\u2019s </em>removal, held under him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-7\">The defendants produced, in evidence, a deed, from <em>Barton </em>to <em>Hajf, </em>dated the 6th <em>December, </em>1805, for the consideration of 4,000 dollars, expressed in the deed, which contained full covenants of warranty, with the usual covenants. This deed was acknowledged the7th <em>December, </em>1805, ancf recorded in the clerk\u2019s office* of <em>\u00a1fiieens </em>county, on the 30th day of the same month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-8\">A person, at the request of <em>Haff, </em>attended at the place of the sheriff\u2019s sale, and before the sale, gave public notice to the sheriff and the persons present, of his claim and title to the premises, by virtue of the deed from <em>Barton, </em>which he showed, and cautioned the bidders not to\" purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-9\">It appeared that <em>Barton </em>and <em>Carpenter, were </em>partners in trade, in the city of <em>New-Tork, </em>and stopped payment m <em>May </em>or <em>June, </em>1805. <em>Barton </em>told a witness, that he would not pay more than one half of any debt; and that he supposed the creditors would endeavour to take his property* but that he knew as much law as any of them, and would put his estate out of his hands, and would pay no debts unless <em>Carpenter </em>paid his half.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>A number of witnesses were then examined, on both sides, to impeach the deed, as fraudulent, on the one hand, and to support it on the other; but it is not necessary here to state their testimony, \u00e1s the cause before the court, turned wholly on the admissibility of <em>Barton, </em>as a witness, who was offered by the defendants, but being objected to, as incompetent, was rejected by the judge. Before <em>Barton </em>was offered, ZTo^executed a release to him of all claims and demands whatsoever, for or on account of the covenants and warranty contained in the deed, and from all claims and demands whatsoever by him, on account of the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-4\">The judge charged the jury, that although fraud ought to be satisfactorily proved, yet positive proof was not indispensably necessary, but it might be inferred from circumstances <em>; </em>and in the present case, the evidence produced was, in his opinion, sufficient to warrant the jury jin finding a verdict for the plaintiff. The jury, accordingly,found a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-5\">A motion was now made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-10\"><em>P. W. Radcliff </em>and <em>St fo\u00f1es,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATQ\">jun. for the defendants, contended, that <em>Barton </em>was a competent witness. To reject the witness, because he is <em>particeps </em>criminis, or concerned in the fraud, is begging the question, and taking it for granted that <em>Haff </em>was guilty of fraud. It is assuming the fraud, to make it a ground for rejecting a witness who is called to show that there is no fraud. They contended that a <em>particeps criminis </em>was a <em>competent </em>witness in any case, and for both parties ; that the objection goes to his credit, and not to his competency. They cited. 1 <em>Gilb. Law of </em>Evidence, by <em>Loft, </em>p. 220. <em>Esp. Dig. 703. 725. Sayer\u2019s Rep. 289. Cowp. </em>199. <em>Gilb.

They cited <em>Ambler, 592. 2 Fesey, 629. 2 Atk. </em>228. 1 <em>Atk. </em>452.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b150-9\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"APj\">The interest of <em>Barton </em>having been released before he was offered as a witness, his being implicated in the fraud, went only to his credit, and not to his competency. He was a competent witness <em>to </em>disprove as well as to prove the fraud. On this ground, we think a new trial ought to be granted, with costs to abide the event of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
