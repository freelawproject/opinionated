It appeared that one <em>Crandall, </em>an officer, had an attachment against <em>Chittenden, </em>at the suit of the defendant, and the defendant requested him to take the horse in question, \"which he refused to do; upon which the defendant took the horse and delivered him to the officer, on the attachment, as the property of <em>Chittenden. </em>The attachment was never returned. It fur-, ther appeared, that the horse in question, had before belonged to <em>Chittenden, </em>who delivered him to <em>Heath, </em>as security for a debt, for which an attachment had been is'-sued by <em>Heath, </em>against <em>Chittenden, </em>but no \u00bfrial ever took place. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, for 50 dollars damages, and six cents costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel applied to the judge, to certify that the trespass was wilful and malicious; but the judge refused to grant the certificate, and referred the plaintiff to the decision of the court, as to the propriety of granting it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-13\"><em>Crary, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADQ\">now moved, that the judge, before whom -the cause was tried, should endorse his certificate On the. record. He cited, <em>Laws of New-York, </em>vol. l. p. 530. sess. 24. c. 170. s. 8. 2 <em>Sellouts </em>Hr.-436. 6 <em>Term, Rep. </em>11.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-14\"><em>Z.

B. will not interfere. The court will not, therefore, make any order in this case. Some of the cases on the construction of the statute (for the statute of 8 and <em>9 W. </em>III. and ours is the same) have been rather rigid, both in <em>England </em>and in this court; and if the court were now to give an opinion, we should not be inclined to consider every voluntary trespass, <em>per se, </em>wilful and malicious. This appears to be too narrow a <em>construction} </em>the statute seems to have meant, by the words <em>-wilful and malicious, </em>some act done <em>mala fide, </em>or with an intention to injure or vex the plaintiff, or with a consciousness of violating right.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">y Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
