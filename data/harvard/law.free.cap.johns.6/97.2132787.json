The defendant was sued, as of <em>August </em>term, 1808, as special bail* on his recognisance; and the plaintiff obtained judgment in <em>November </em>term, 1808, and issued a <em>f. fa. </em>which was returned <em>nulla </em>bona, at <em>February </em>or <em>Mdy </em>term, 1809. The plaintiff then caused a second <em>ca. sa. </em>to be issued against Hutchins, retumable at <em>May </em>term, 1809, upon which he was arrested and imprisoned^ While <em>Hutchins </em>was imprisoned, the plaintiff issued a <em>ca. sa. </em>upon the judgment, against the defendant, returnable in <em>November </em>term, 1809* upon which he was taken, and is now in custody. The court t\u00bbf common pleas of <em>Madison </em>county, in January, 1810, discharged <em>Hutchins, </em>under the act for the relief of debtors, with respect to the imprisonment of their persons.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-12\"><em>Sill </em>cited <em>Cro.

If he takes the bail in execution, he cannot afterwards resort to the principal, and take him in execution, for he has made his election; and so if he has execution against the principal, he cannot afterwards resort to an execution against the bail. This is the doctrine in <em>Higgins\u2019s </em>case, which is summarily reported in <em>Cro. Jac. </em>320. and in 1 <em>Roll. Abr. </em>897. G. but more fully, and with a clear and precise declaration of the law, in 2 <em>Bulst. </em>68. The case of <em>Astre </em>v. Ballard, as reported in 1 <em>Vent. </em>315. intimates that a different rule had afterwards been laid down; but the case is there very loosely reported; and the report of the same case in 2 <em>Mod. </em>312. 2 <em>Lev. </em>195. and 2 <em>Jones, </em>75. contains no such intimation. The true rule of law must, therefore, be considered to be that which is declared in Bulstrode, by the unanimous opinion of the court of K. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
