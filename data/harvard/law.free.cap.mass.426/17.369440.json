Stockwell, challenges his conviction by a jury in the Superior Court of murder in the first degree by reason of deliberate premeditation. We conclude that the conviction should be affirmed, and that the defendant is not entitled to relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Based on the governing standard <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 [1979]), the jury were warranted in finding the following facts. The victim was the defendant\u2019s eighteen year old companion and was approximately six weeks pregnant with his child. The defendant did not want the responsibility of a child, and was concerned about the effect it would have on his life. He and the victim argued over her having an abortion. He also argued with the victim about the clothes she wore, and the possibility that she was attracted to other men.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">On Sunday, October 1, 1989, the couple drove to Nantasket Avenue in Hull in the defendant\u2019s car, took a walk on the beach, and were sexually intimate in the car. As they sat in the car, the defendant began to choke the victim who struggled, kicked the windshield, and beeped the horn. At one point, the victim escaped from the defendant\u2019s grasp and opened the door of the car, but the defendant restrained her, continued to choke her, and, according to the testimony, \u201cheld onto her until she was dead.\u201d The defendant said he knew the victim was dead \u201c[w]hen she stopped kicking and fighting\u201d him. The defendant drove his car with the victim\u2019s body in it to the end of a dead-end street in Brockton where he left her on the ground near some trash in an area thick with brush and, after crossing her arms, covered her with grass. Over the next several days, the defendant told a number of people and the police conflicting stories about the circumstances of the victim\u2019s disappearance. The victim\u2019s body was not discovered until October 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">On that same day, the defendant told his best friend, Herb Soper, that on the previous Saturday night (September 30), he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>had \u201cthought about killing [the victim],\u201d and that he had \u201cmade up his mind\u201d to kill her the following day, Sunday, October l.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">After the victim\u2019s body was discovered, the defendant telephoned Soper and said, \u201cRemember, you don\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">An autopsy of the victim\u2019s body revealed that death was caused by manual strangulation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was medical testimony that it would have taken from three to five minutes from lack of oxygen to kill the victim, but that time frame could have been prolonged if the pressure on her neck was interrupted by her resistance. There were scratch marks on the victim\u2019s neck that could have resulted from her own attempts to reheve the pressure on her neck. She also had other injuries consistent with a struggle, including bruises on her chest, arms, thighs, and back of her head.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">1. The defendant argues that \u201c[t]he simple absence of any evidence of any instrumentality whatsoever and of any significant bodily injury other than the asphyxiation itself precludes a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of finalization of deliberation, rendering as end result a resolve to kill that persisted through the moment of the actual killing.\u201d The jury were warranted in finding the facts set forth above. Based on those facts, the jury properly could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not impulsive or unintended, as the defendant suggests, but rather was the product of the defendant\u2019s \u201cdeliberation, resolution, and action,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Parker, 412 Mass. 353, 360 (1992), and, consequently, that he was guilty of murder in the first degree by reason of deliberate premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">2. The defendant contended that he suffered from a mental impairment and that he lacked criminal responsibility. He moved before trial that his interview with the Commonwealth\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>psychiatrist, Dr. Martin J. Kelly, conducted pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (b) (2) (B), 378 Mass. 874 (1979), and <em>Blaisdell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>372 Mass. 753, 767-769 (1977), be recorded on videotape.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial judge held a hearing on the motion and denied it as \u201ca matter of discretion.\u201d The defendant argues that the denial of the motion was an abuse of discretion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">As grounds for his claim of error, the defendant contends that the judge\u2019s decision was motivated by a concern for who would pay for the production of the videotape. We do not view the judge\u2019s ruling as resting exclusively on this issue. The judge was informed that Dr. Kelly \u201cdisfavors the videotaping of <em>[Blaisdell] </em>examinations, feeling that persons behave differently when there is a videotape camera on. It becomes more of a show and not a psychiatric examination.\u201d The judge was familiar with Dr. Kelly as a witness and appears to have considered him to be objective. The judge noted that Dr. Kelly had \u201ctestified for defendants quite a few times.\u201d The defendant\u2019s trial counsel stated no special reason for wanting the examination recorded on videotape, expressing only the general view that it might be useful to have \u201csome sort of record\u201d to show \u201cthe extent to which [the] defendant released his [F]ifth [A]mendment right for the <em>Blaisdell </em>purpose.\u201d On the hearing conducted, we shall not disturb the judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">3. We next discuss arguments concerning evidentiary matters at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">(a) The judge admitted in evidence, over objection by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, one of three photographs of the victim\u2019s body as it was discovered by the police nine days after the killing. The photograph was gruesome. It had debatable relevance to some of the issues at trial. \u201cThe admission of photographs is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and we have rarely reversed a conviction because of the introduction of photographs of a victim.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meinholz, </em>420 Mass. 633, 635 (1995), and cases cited. The judge carefully instructed the jury that their verdict should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>be influenced by the fact that any photographs admitted in evidence were unpleasant or gruesome. Another judge might have, in the exercise of sound discretion, excluded the photograph. There is, however, no basis for reversal in the judge\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">(b) The defendant takes issue with several portions of the testimony of Dr. Kelly to the effect that the defendant was criminally responsible. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel objected to some but not all of Dr. Kelly\u2019s criticized testimony. We perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Dr. Kelly was properly allowed to define personality disorders, to opine that the defendant had an impulse control disorder, to state that the defendant\u2019s problems exhibited an antisocial orientation, and to indicate that the defendant\u2019s disorder did not constitute a mental disease or defect. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kappler, </em>416 Mass. 574, 583 n.7, 584 (1993). Dr. Kelly\u2019s references in his testimony to bank robbers and career criminals to explain general psychiatric concepts involved in his diagnosis of the defendant did not amount to improper \u201cbad character\u201d evidence as the defendant contends. The references were illustrative only, and Dr. Kelly pointed out that, although a career criminal was one example of an antisocial personality, the defendant was not a career criminal. Dr. Kelly was properly permitted to express his opinion that the defendant had the capacity to form a specific intent, cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Cruz, 413 Mass. 686, 690-691 (1992), and we do not view his testimony as blurring the distinction between psychiatric and legal concepts. Nor do we consider Dr. Kelly\u2019s testimony to have expressed his notions of legal principles that were in conflict with the governing law. The factual inquiries concerning a lack of criminal responsibility, and a defendant\u2019s capacity to possess the requisite state of mind to commit murder, are not identical, but they do have \u201csubstantial similarities.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Genius, </em>387 Mass. 695, 699 (1982). Both the prosecution and the defense were able to present the full range of their contentions through their respective experts concerning the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the killing. The jury could not have been misled by Dr. Kelly\u2019s testimony in view of the judge\u2019s correct instructions on the capacity to form intent, premeditation, and criminal responsibility, together with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>admonitory instructions on the evaluation of expert testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amaral, </em>389 Mass. 184, 194-195 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">4. The defendant contends that his trial counsel provided him with ineffective assistance because he failed in his summation adequately to address what the defendant claims were deficiencies in the prosecution\u2019s proof of deliberate premeditation. We consider the defendant\u2019s argument under the substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 681-682 (1992). No such likelihood exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The summation by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not suggest that the defendant was not seriously contesting premeditation. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel chose to emphasize the evidence suggesting the defendant\u2019s mental impairment and lack of criminal responsibility, and to leave primarily to the judge the discussion of the law concerning premeditation and the other elements of the crimes open to the jury for their consideration. This approach was certainly reasonable, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>401 Mass. 627, 636 (1988), and, based on the proof at trial, and argument by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel that the defendant had \u201cacted spontaneously\u201d and \u201cin a way that was driven by mental illness and his impulse disorder,\u201d the jury were made aware that the defendant claimed he had acted in a way which precluded premeditation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">5. In statements to the police, the defendant admitted that he had choked the victim, but maintained that he had only placed a \u201csleeper hold\u201d on her, and that he had detected a heartbeat in her chest, which he thought was \u201ccute,\u201d as he drove his car to Brockton where he abandoned the victim\u2019s comatose body. In her summation, the prosecutor asked the jury categorically to reject this claim. She further stated that, if the jury \u201cdecide[d] to accept [the defendant\u2019s] half-baked story,\u201d they could find him guilty of premeditated murder because \u201cchoking [the victim] was an act, the plain and strong likelihood [of which] was death or grievous bodily harm.\u201d In this fashion, the prosecutor presented to the jury the improper theory that the defendant could be convicted of premeditated murder in the first degree on the basis of third prong malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>The defendant complains about the prosecutor\u2019s impropriety, and he also protests the judge\u2019s instructions on malice. The instructions contained the statement that \u201c[mjalice aforethought refers to a frame of mind, which includes not only anger, hatred, and revenge, but also every other unlawful and unjustifiable motive,\u201d and the statement that, in addition to an unexcused specific intent to kill or an unexcused, specific intent to do grievous bodily harm, malice also included \u201can unexcused intent to do an act creating a plain and strong likelihood that death or grievous bodily harm would follow.\u201d The defendant now argues that the combination of the prosecutor\u2019s argument, and the malice instructions quoted above, undermined his \u201csleeper hold\u201d claim and would have led the jury to convict him of premeditated murder without finding a specific intent to cause the victim\u2019s death. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s statements or to the criticized portions of the judge\u2019s instructions. We review these imperfections at the trial as to whether they created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Wright, supra. </em>No such likelihood exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The prosecutor should not have made her statements, and the judge\u2019s instructions contain inappropriate explanations of malice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jury were advised before the trial began, and in the final instructions, that the issues in the case were not to be decided on the summations of counsel, and that they were to take the law from the judge. The judge correctly defined deliberate premeditation, and the first two prongs of malice, and he told the jury that they could consider evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental impairment on whether he acted with deliberate premeditation or with either of the first two prongs of malice. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 517 (1987) (instructions may mitigate any prejudice in final argument); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amico, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 650, 652 (1983) (new trial not required where prosecutor intruded on judge\u2019s function of explicating the law, and judge instructed jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>his statements of the law controlled). The defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal are governed by the decisions holding that, even if the defense is primarily based on evidence of mental impairment, any error pertaining to the third prong of malice is inconsequential when the jury have specifically found deliberate premeditation and have rejected a claim of impairment on correct instructions concerning deliberate premeditation, the first prong of malice, and impairment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 391 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>417 Mass. 126, 134-135 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>414 Mass. 618, 627-628 (1993). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, </em>420 Mass. 433, 441-442 (1995).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">6. The defendant also claims that the judge erred in refusing to grant the jury\u2019s request, during deliberations, for a transcript of various witnesses\u2019 testimony. Whether to permit the jury to read the testimony of a witness is within the sound discretion of the judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>386 Mass. 393, 405 (1982). There is always a risk that the reading of testimony may overemphasize certain aspects of the case, <em>id., </em>and the judge is in the best position to weigh this risk. The judge did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">7. In his pro se supplemental brief, the defendant argues that the judge\u2019s manslaughter instruction was so confusing that the jury were impeded from fairly considering manslaughter as a possible verdict, and that there was incorrect instruction on \u201cbattery manslaughter.\u201d No objection was made to the manslaughter instruction. The instruction informed the jury that they could find the defendant guilty of manslaughter if they found that he had committed a battery that caused the victim\u2019s death and did so without justification or excuse. When considered in the context of the entire charge, the instruction was adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>8. The facts of this case, as they were found by the jury, do not warrant relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-9\">The defendant also stated to the police following his arrest that he had \u201cthought about killing [the victim] Saturday.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-10\">During his testimony at trial, the medical examiner explained that manual strangulation may take three forms. These include where the aggressor\u2019s hands are placed on the victim\u2019s neck with the thumbs along the \u201cAdam\u2019s apple\u201d; where the crook of the aggressor\u2019s hand or arm is placed on the neck of the victim (\u201csleeper hold\u201d); and where the aggressor\u2019s forearm is placed on the neck of the victim (\u201cchoke hold\u201d). The medical examiner did not express an opinion as to which form of manual strangulation caused the victim\u2019s death, although he stated that the hemorrhaging of the victim\u2019s neck tissue was consistent with either the sleeper hold or the choke hold.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The defendant had seasonably notified the Commonwealth that he would present evidence that raised an issue as to his criminal responsibility. There was considerable evidence at the trial concerning the defendant\u2019s alleged mental impairment and testimony in the defendant\u2019s case by Dr. Gary G. Dube, a clinical psychologist, and a designated forensic psychologist, that the defendant was not criminally responsible at the time of the killing by reason of a \u201ccombination of mental illness and . . . impulse control disorder.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The judge also did not commit an abuse of discretion when he allowed the jury to view the location where the victim\u2019s body was found.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b42-8\">There is also an argument that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel was derelict in not arguing in his summation that the jury had the option of convicting the defendant of murder in the second degree. The contention is weakly presented and lacks merit. The jury were instructed on a possible verdict of murder in the second degree (along with a possible verdict of manslaughter).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The trial occurred in October, 1989, before <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagles, </em>419 Mass. 825, 836 (1995) (\u201cframe of mind\u201d language often used in defining malice should thereafter be omitted from jury instructions) and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, </em>420 Mass. 433, 441 (1995) (deliberately premeditated murder requires a specific intent to cause death, a requirement that necessarily excludes the mental state involved in third prong malice). It is fair to say that many jury instructions given prior to 1995 in murder cases contained the imperfections involved in these instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument is not substantially advanced by reliance on the \u201cframe of mind\u201d language which would not constitute an independent ground for reversal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>425 Mass. 765, 769 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b44-8\">The Commonwealth in its brief cites <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, supra, </em>in \u25a0 support of upholding the defendant\u2019s conviction, but asks us to reconsider our determination in the <em>Judge </em>decision that third prong malice cannot support a finding of deliberately premeditated murder. The Commonwealth argues, at length, that our determination is wrong. We are not persuaded by the Commonwealth\u2019s argument and decline to make any revision of the principles stated in the <em>Judge </em>opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
