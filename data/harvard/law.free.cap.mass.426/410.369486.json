Greenwood appeal from an order of the Superior Court awarding the defendant, Dean Ricciardi, attorney\u2019s fees and costs as a sanction for their violation of Mass. R. Civ. P. 11 (a), 365 Mass. 753 (1974). We transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">On July 24, 1992, Padilla filed an action for damages in the Superior Court on behalf of the plaintiff, Van Christo Advertising, Inc. (VCA), in which VGA alleged that Ricciardi had participated in the misappropriation of its contract (an agreement concerning advertising and public relations services) with Light Control Systems, Inc. (LCS).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1994, judgment entered on stipulations of dismissal, with prejudice, as to the other named defendants, LCS, M/A-COM/LCS, and VGA\u2019s former employee, Amelia Bissett. On March 17, 1995, summary judgment entered in favor of Ricciardi on the basis that, under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A, the remaining claims asserted in VGA\u2019s complaint were time-barred. VGA was ordered to pay Ricciardi\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Counsel for Ricciardi then moved to impose sanctions against Padilla, and successor counsel, Greenwood, for violating rule 11 (a). A judge in the Superior Court allowed Ricciardi\u2019s motion and ordered that Padilla and Greenwood be held jointly and severally liable with VGA to pay Ricciardi\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>On appeal, Padilla and Greenwood argue that the judge erred in employing an objective standard in evaluating their conduct and in imposing sanctions that are not authorized by rule 11 (a). We conclude that, while monetary sanctions are allowed under our rule, the judge erred in utilizing an objective standard to review the attorneys\u2019 conduct. Because we conclude that neither Padilla nor Greenwood engaged in a \u201cwilful violation\u201d of the rule, we vacate the order imposing sanctions against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">1. The record on appeal is fragmented and requires considerable reconstruction. Based on our review of the record, we glean the following relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">a. <em>Ricciardi\u2019s employment with VCA. </em>In January, 1988, Ricciardi was hired by VCA as an independent contractor to provide temporary administrative assistance to the president, treasurer, and sole shareholder of the company, Van Christo. In this position, he maintained the files related to the LCS account, although other employees had access to those files. VCA terminated Ricciardi\u2019s employment in October, 1988, after he had completed training the person hired to succeed him on a permanent basis. According to Christo, Ricciardi left VCA on \u201cgood terms,\u201d and he provided Ricciardi with a \u201cvery strong reference\u201d for his next job.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">During the time Ricciardi was employed by VCA, the company was the advertising agency and public relations counsel to LCS, pursuant to a letter agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On April 20, 1988, the president of LCS notified VCA that she was terminating their agreement. In early May, 1988, Christo sent a letter to the president of LCS in which he acknowledged receipt of the notice of termination, and he discussed the efforts of Bissett, VGA\u2019s media director, in attempting to resolve the budget dispute between VCA and LCS that may have precipitated the termination. Shortly thereafter, Bissett left VGA\u2019s employ. Approximately one week after she left VCA, Bissett began rendering professional services to LCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">VCA alleged that Ricciardi informed Bissett about the contents of Christo\u2019s letter to LCS. VCA further alleged that Bissett wrongfully took documents that pertained to the LCS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>account prior to leaving VGA, and that Ricciardi assisted Bis-sett in removing the LCS documents. VGA asserted that Ricciardi, without authority, notified various publications that VGA was no longer the advertising agency for LCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Christo noticed that LCS files were missing prior to Ricciardi\u2019s departure and questioned Ricciardi about the files. Ricciardi consistently denied any knowledge of them. During the course of discovery, the missing files were found in a VGA storage facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">b. <em>Padilla\u2019s and Greenwood\u2019s representation of VC A. </em>On September 23, 1992, in response to VGA\u2019s complaint, Ricciardi filed a motion to dismiss. The statute of limitations was not raised by Ricciardi in that motion. Padilla submitted an opposition to Ricciardi\u2019s motion to dismiss (October, 1992), and a memorandum on the fiduciary duty owed by an employee to an employer as requested by the judge who heard oral argument on Ricciardi\u2019s motion to dismiss (November, 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In September, 1992, Ricciardi\u2019s counsel filed a complaint regarding Padilla with the Board of Bar Overseers (board), on which the board took no action. While the board was investigating the complaint, Padilla advised VGA to seek other counsel. Padilla withdrew from the case in January, 1993, at which point Greenwood appeared as VGA\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Soon after he entered his appearance, Greenwood filed a motion to extend the time for filing an opposition to Bissett\u2019s motion to dismiss. In addition to signing a notice of appearance on behalf of VGA in January, 1993, Greenwood filed a number of motions regarding discovery tracking orders that applied to Ricciardi, and he hired Attorney Brian M. Olmstead to take Ricciardi\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">During Christo\u2019s deposition in 1993, Greenwood learned that VGA maintained a storage facility in Saugus. He immediately informed opposing counsel of the existence of the storage facility, and on discovering the missing LCS files at the facility, he promptly withdrew from his representation of VGA (October, 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">2. Rule 11 (a) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he signature of an attorney to a pleading constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading; that to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief there is a good ground to support it; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>that it is not interposed for delay.\u201d A \u201cwilful violation\u201d of the mle may subject an attorney \u201cto appropriate disciplinary action,\u201d although the mle is silent as to the particular disciplinary measures that may be imposed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The provisions of mle 11 (a) are also applied to motions and other papers by virtue of Mass. R. Civ. P. 7 (b) (2), 365 Mass. 748 (1974).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, adopted in 1974, were patterned on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, <em>Giacobbe </em>v. <em>First Coolidge Corp., </em>367 Mass. 309, 315 (1975), and the text of our mle 11 (a) continues to be virtually identical to the text of its Federal analog prior to the latter\u2019s amendment in 1983.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In construing our mies, we follow the construction given to the Federal rules \u201cabsent compelling reasons to the contrary or significant differences in content.\u201d <em>Rollins Envtl. Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>368 Mass. 174, 179-180 (1975). We see no reason to depart from this principle of construction here and, in applying our mle 11 (a), we shall rely on the construction given to the pre-1983 version of Fed. R. Civ. P. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Liability under the original Federal mle was predicated on an attorney\u2019s wilful filing of a pleading that did not have a \u201cgood ground to support it.\u201d See 2 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\u00a7 11App.101[2], at 11App.-20 (3d ed. 1997). Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 (1983).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The phrase \u201cgood ground to support\u201d was interpreted as having both factual and legal elements, see Advisory Committee Note to 1983 Revision to Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, 97 F.R.D. 198 (1983), and Federal courts employed a subjective standard in applying the rule. <em>Id. </em>See, e.g., <em>Nemeroff </em>v. <em>Abelson, </em>620 F.2d 339, 350 (2d Cir. 1980); <em>Peter Kiewit Sons\u2019 Co. </em>v. <em>Summit Constr. Co., </em>422 F.2d 242, 271 (8th Cir. 1969); <em>Kinee </em>v. <em>Abraham Lincoln Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>365 F. Supp. 975, 982-983 (E.D. Pa. 1973). The effect of the rule was to place an affirmative obligation on an attorney signatory to a pleading to be satisfied, in good faith, that \u201cgood grounds\u201d existed for the claims therein asserted. See, e.g., <em>In Re Mid-Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litig., </em>525 F. Supp. 1265, 1282-1283 (D. Md. 1981), aff\u2019d, 704 F.2d 125 (4th Cir. 1983); <em>Helfant </em>v. <em>Louisiana &amp; S. Life Ins. Co., </em>82 F.R.D. 53, 56-57 (E.D.N.Y. 1979); <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Seaton, </em>358 F. Supp. 1, 6 (S.D.N.Y. 1973); <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>27 F.R.D. 395, 397 (S.D.N.Y. 1961). See also Vairo, Rule 11: A Critical Analysis, 118 F.R.D. 189, 190 (1988); Browne, The Significance of the Signature: A Comment on the Obligations Imposed by Civil Rule 11, 30 Clev. St. L. Rev. 385 (1981); Risinger, Honesty in Pleading and Its Enforcement: Some \u201cStriking\u201d Problems with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, 61 Minn. L. Rev. 1 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Like our rule, the pre-1983 Federal rule did not specify the kinds of disciplinary action that could be taken by a judge in response to a violation of the rule. See 5A C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1336, at 97 (2d ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>1990). Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 (1983).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While some Federal courts questioned the propriety of awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs, see, e.g., <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Prudential Group, Inc., </em>81 F.R.D. 418 (S.D.N.Y. 1979), many courts decided, we conclude persuasively, that such an award was a permissible, and indeed appropriate, sanction for a wilful violation of the original rule. See, e.g., <em>Public Interest Bounty Hunters </em>v. <em>Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., </em>548 F. Supp. 157 (N.D. Ga. 1982); <em>In re Mid-Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litig., </em>supra; <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Oppenheimer &amp; Co., </em>500 F. Supp. 174 (N.D. Ill. 1980); <em>Textor </em>v. <em>Regents of N. Ill. Univ., </em>87 F.R.D. 751, 754 (N.D. Ill. 1980); <em>LeGare </em>v. <em>University of Pa. Medical Sch., </em>488 F. Supp. 1250, 1257 n.12 (E.D. Pa. 1980); <em>Kinee </em>v. <em>Abraham Lincoln Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>365 F. Supp. 975, 982-983 (E.D. Pa. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The principles enunciated above lead us to conclude that our rule 11 (a) authorizes a judge to impose attorney\u2019s fees and costs where an attorney has failed to show a subjective good faith belief that the pleading was supported in both fact and law. See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>129 F.R.D. 15, 18 (D. Mass. 1989). Good faith includes, among other things, an absence of design to defraud or to seek an unconscionable advantage. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary.693 (6th ed. 1990).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See also <em>Hahn </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Stoughton, </em>403 Mass. 332, 337 (1988). Although this standard is less demanding than the objective standard embodied in the amended Federal rule (which obliges attorneys to engage in some prefiling inquiry),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> see Advisory Committee Note, <em>supra </em>at 198, our rule does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>excuse an attorney\u2019s \u201cwilful ignorance\u201d of facts and law which would have been known had the attorney simply not consciously disregarded them. See generally <em>West\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 146, 150-151 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">3. A judge has discretion in imposing sanctions under rule 11 (a), and our function is to determine whether the judge abused that discretion, which includes considering whether proper legal standards were applied and whether there was reasonable support for the judge\u2019s evaluation of the facts. See <em>Cooter &amp; Gell </em>v. <em>Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 405 (1990); <em>Media Duplication Servs., Ltd. </em>v. <em>HDG Software, Inc., </em>928 F.2d 1228, 1238 (1st Cir. 1991). Because our rule employs a subjective standard, we agree with Padilla and Greenwood that the judge committed an error of law when he relied on the amended Federal rule\u2019s objective standard in evaluating their conduct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The record is adequate to allow us to decide the case under the applicable subjective standard without a remand. We proceed to review the issue under that standard to ascertain whether either attorney\u2019s conduct warranted the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">a. <em>Padilla. </em>In awarding sanctions against Padilla, the judge concluded that the complaint she filed on behalf of VC A had neither good factual nor good legal ground. He concluded that Christo had \u201cno more than a hunch\u201d that Ricciardi was involved in any alleged wrongdoing regarding the LCS account, relying on part of Christo\u2019s deposition testimony that Ricciardi was named as a defendant because Christo \u201cwant[ed] to know what role he played in the missing files.\u201d He also concluded that no reasonable legal argument could be made that a temporary file clerk owes a fiduciary duty to his employer and thus Padilla was not reasonable in urging the creation of a new duty in that regard. Finally, the judge concluded that Padilla should be sanctioned for including in the complaint a \u201cnonexistent\u201d and \u201cwholly contrived\u201d cause of action for \u201clost profits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Padilla asserted in an affidavit that she \u201cbelieved that the complaint was well grounded in law and fact,\u201d and that she \u201cin good faith, believed\u201d Christo\u2019s allegations as set forth in the complaint. She supported these statements with a detailed (and unchallenged) explanation of the steps she took prior to filing the complaint.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under our rule, Padilla\u2019s affirmations in her affidavit are sufficient to withstand Ricciardi\u2019s motion for sanctions. See <em>In re Mid-Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litig., supra </em>at 1283. In so concluding, we differentiate between Padilla\u2019s sworn statements, which demonstrate adequate diligence on her part, and Christo\u2019s expressed motivations for bringing this lawsuit for which Padilla should not be held responsible.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Furthermore, while we recognize that there are limits to the extent to which an attorney may, in good faith, argue for extensions in existing law, rule 11 (a) \u201cis not intended to chill an attorney\u2019s enthusiasm or creativity in pursuing factual or legal theories. The court is expected to avoid using the wisdom of hindsight and should test the signer\u2019s conduct by inquiring what was reasonable to believe at the time the pleading, motion, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>other paper was submitted.\u201d Advisory Committee Notes, <em>supra </em>at 199. Padilla\u2019s claim that Ricciardi violated his fiduciary duty to VGA is not so outlandish as to establish bad faith on her part.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Nowhere is it indicated that the judge who decided Ricciardi\u2019s motion to dismiss considered the claim to be frivolous. In fact, during a hearing on Ricciardi\u2019s first motion to dismiss, the judge hearing that motion requested that Padilla prepare a memorandum on the claim. Additionally, in his memorandum and order on Ricciardi\u2019s supplemental motion to dismiss, the judge did not conclude that the claim did not apply to Ricciardi, but instead dismissed the claim on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The record demonstrates that Padilla proceeded with a good faith belief that VGA\u2019s claims against Ricciardi were legally viable. Accordingly, attorney\u2019s fees and costs should not have been assessed against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Because we conclude that sanctions were improperly imposed on Padilla, we need not address her contentions regarding the inequities in awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs against her where counsel for Ricciardi had threatened to file a complaint with the Board of Bar Overseers if she did not dismiss the complaint against Ricciardi. We take note of Padilla\u2019s allegations regarding opposing counsel\u2019s unprofessional conduct, see Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.4(h), <em>post </em>1301, 1389 (1998),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and remind members of the bar that sanctions may be imposed on attorneys representing either party in a litigation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">b. <em>Greenwood. </em>In awarding sanctions against Greenwood, the judge concluded that he violated rule 11 (a) by signing an op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>position to Ricciardi\u2019s motion for summary judgment despite his knowledge that certain claims were time barred. The judge determined that as successor counsel, Greenwood was obliged to investigate the legal and factual sufficiency of the complaint prior to assuming representation of VGA.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Greenwood maintains that the judge erred in awarding sanctions against him because he did not sign any offensive pleadings which would warrant the imposition of sanctions. He relies on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pavelic &amp; LeFlore </em>v. <em>Marvel Entertainment Group, </em>493 U.S. 120 (1989), for the proposition that the \u201csigning attorney\u201d language of rule 11 is to be read literally.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">As Greenwood points out, the judge incorrectly found that Greenwood signed the opposition to Ricciardi\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In fact, Padilla signed and filed this document prior to Greenwood\u2019s appearance in this case.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Nevertheless, this factual error does not alter the analysis applicable to Greenwood as successor counsel under rule 11 (a). We reject Greenwood\u2019s argument that, when successor counsel assumes responsibility for a pending case, new counsel\u2019s liability under the rule is limited to those documents he or she signs. We do not read <em>Pavelic </em>to preclude holding successor counsel susceptible to rule 11 (a) sanctions on the basis of a complaint signed by a predecessor where the successor attorney files a pleading indicating his intention to continue prosecution of the action. See <em>Bakker </em>v. <em>Grutman, </em>942 F.2d 236, 240 (4th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">In addition to signing a notice of appearance on behalf of VGA in January, 1993, Greenwood filed a number of motions regarding discovery tracking orders that applied to Ricciardi, and he hired Olmstead to take Ricciardi\u2019s deposition. These actions clearly evince Greenwood\u2019s intent to continue prosecuting the claims against Ricciardi. In these circumstances, our rule imposes on Greenwood an affirmative obligation to be satisfied, in good faith, that good grounds continued to exist for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>claims asserted against Ricciardi in the complaint.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Sungard Business Sys., Inc., </em>91 F.3d 1418, 1421 (11th Cir. 1996) (although only \u201cpaper\u201d substitute counsel signed and submitted to court in prosecuting plaintiff\u2019s claim was notice of appearance, rule 11 sanctions warranted where he continued to advocate claim despite knowledge that it was meritless).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Ricciardi suggests that, because he adopted the statute of limitations argument raised by Bissett, to which Greenwood responded when opposing Bissett\u2019s motion to dismiss, then Greenwood was aware that the claims were time barred as to him. However, Ricciardi did not raise the statute of limitations as a defense until he supplemented his motion to dismiss. This supplemental motion was filed after the LCS files were discovered and Greenwood had withdrawn from the case.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Even if we assume that Greenwood was aware that, if the claims were time-barred as to Bissett, they were also time barred as to Ricciardi, we do not believe Greenwood contravened rule 11 (a) by either not withdrawing the complaint as to Ricciardi or moving for voluntary dismissal based on Bissett\u2019s statute of limitations argument. In ruling on Ricciardi\u2019s motion for summary judgment, even the judge noted that it was unclear whether a claim for breach of fiduciary duty sounds in tort or contract, and thus whether a three- or six-year statute of limitations applied to the claim. He ultimately concluded that it is a tort, and thus determined that the claim was time barred, since any injury suffered by Christo as a result of Ricciardi\u2019s alleged wrongful acts would have occurred in 1988. Only after noting the link between VGA\u2019s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and for lost profits did he conclude that the latter was similarly time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Furthermore, Greenwood stated that throughout his representation of VGA, Christo maintained that Ricciardi had actively worked with Bissett against VGA, and repeatedly stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Ricciardi had improperly removed work product and documents from his office and gave them to Bissett and LCS. On learning of the VC A storage facility, Greenwood immediately informed opposing counsel, and on discovering the missing LCS files at the facility, he promptly withdrew from his representation of VCA. On this record, we conclude that Greenwood did not wilfully violate rule 11 (a), and therefore sanctions were improperly imposed against him.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">4. While rule 11 (a) may be criticized for embodying a less stringent standard of conduct than the amended Federal rule, we note that the 1983 amendments to the sanctions provision of Fed. R. Civ. R 11 generated significant controversy, satellite litigation, and a new \u201ccottage industry.\u201d See generally Pamess, Fines Under New Federal Civil Rule 11: The New Monetary Sanctions for the \u201cStop-and-Think-Again\u201d Rule, 1993 B.Y.U. L. Rev. 879, 879.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The rule was again amended in 1993, in an effort to remedy the problems that arose in the application of the 1983 amendments and to reduce the number of motions for sanctions. 2 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 11App.04[2], at 11App.-9. In particular, the 1993 revision clarified that the main purpose of the rule is deterrence, not compensation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Advisory Committee Note to 1993 Amendments to Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, reproduced in 2 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 11App.04[2], at 11App.-13. See also 5A C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1336, at 45 (Supp.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>1997). To facilitate this purpose, the 1993 amendment encouraged the use of fines instead of attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and contemplated greater use of nonmonetary sanctions such as reprimands, orders requiring mandatory attendance at continuing legal education programs, and referrals to disciplinary authorities. 5A C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, <em>supra </em>at 46.

Had the amendments to the Federal rule been deemed appropriate for incorporation into our rule, we must assume that the committee would have proposed modifications to the rule. No such proposals have been made. Our committee undoubtedly is aware of the controversy over the evolution of the Federal rule, and the efforts made in 1993 to ameliorate the difficulties created by the 1983 revisions. The committee may wish to review rule 11 (a) in light of this decision and to consider whether any revisions are warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">5.
