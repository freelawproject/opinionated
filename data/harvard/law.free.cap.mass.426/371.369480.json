L. c. 90, \u00a7 30A, in implementing a new program that permits automobile dealers to communicate electronically with the registry for new vehicle registrations and title transactions. A judge in the Superior Court granted summary judgment in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>of the registrar. We granted Bombardieri\u2019s application for direct appellate review; the appeal of the companion case, consolidated with Bombardieri\u2019s appeal in the Appeals Court for briefing and decision only, was transferred to this court on our own motion. We affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">1. In April, 1995, the registrar initiated a program called distributed registration and information vehicle entry (DRIVE) program. The program\u2019s purpose is to reduce delays and inconvenience for persons seeking to register new vehicles. Under the DRIVE program, an automobile dealer may communicate electronically with and obtain certain limited information from the registry in order to process new vehicle registrations. Dealer participation is voluntary and subject to terms and conditions established by the registrar. As of January, 1997, forty-five dealers participated in the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">To register a new vehicle, an owner must complete a registration application form (RMV-1) providing the owner\u2019s name, address, driver\u2019s license number, date of birth, principal place of garaging, lessee name (if applicable), varied information about the new vehicle, and identification of the insurer and any lien-holders. This information must be presented to the registry. Except for the DRIVE program, the registry receives the information by direct delivery of the paper form by either the vehicle purchaser or a \u201crunner,\u201d a person used by dealers to carry the RMV-1 to the registry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For registration through the DRIVE program, software electronically transmits the RMV-1 information from the dealers\u2019 computers to a third-party network provider that converts data to a compatible format and then transmits it electronically to registry computers. In either case, the registry verifies the information and determines whether there is any reason a registration may not issue. After reviewing the information and approving the registration, the registry either issues the registration certificate and registration plate in person to the purchaser or runner, or electronically notifies the DRIVE participating dealer of the approval. In the latter cases, the dealer then prints a registration certificate and, if one is required, gives the vehicle purchaser a registration plate from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>controlled inventory that the registry has provided for such transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In instances when the registry cannot complete a registration, the registry notifies the DRIVE participating dealer, but does not disclose the reason why a registration cannot be processed. The dealer then informs the purchaser that a personal trip to the registry is necessary to complete the registration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The electronic communication capability provided to DRIVE participating dealers is restricted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At no time do dealers use any computer terminal under the control of the registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The Bombardieri plaintiffs filed their action on December 12, 1996; the Mann plaintiffs filed their action on January 16, 1997. On May 1, 1997, after a hearing, a judge denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motions for summary judgment, and allowed the registrar\u2019s cross motions holding that the DRIVE program does not violate G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 30A. The plaintiffs filed timely notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">2. The central issue before us is whether the DRIVE program violates G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 30A.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs contend that this statute prohibits the dealers\u2019 access via electronic links to driver information stored in the registry\u2019s computerized database. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>registrar argues that the statute prohibits persons, not otherwise specifically authorized therein, from using the registry\u2019s computer terminals, and, since DRIVE participating dealers use their own terminals and software loaded on to their own computer systems to access the registry\u2019s computer, the statute is not violated by the DRIVE program. The dispute focuses on the proper construction of the statutory phrase \u201cdirect or indirect use of the computer terminals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">We have never had occasion to construe this statute. \u201cWe generally construe statutes to give effect \u2018to the intent of the Legislature [as] ascertained from all [the statute\u2019s] words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Beacon Hill Architectural Comm\u2019n, </em>421 Mass. 570, 584 (1996), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>388 Mass. 326, 328 (1983). See <em>Meunier\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 421, 423 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">A literal reading of the contested statutory phrase, giving \u201ccomputer terminal\u201d its ordinary meaning, suggests that the statute restricts use only of the registry\u2019s computer hardware. In this case, however, we hesitate to limit our inquiry to a \u201cplain meaning\u201d interpretation of the phrase. When the statute was first enacted,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> computer technology was less advanced, configurations of equipment and systems quite different, and the contours of terms less well established or understood. We cannot rule out imprecision in the Legislature\u2019s use of technical terminology. We note, however, that the statute also refers to \u201ccomputer data files.\u201d The Legislature might have prohibited the use of the registry\u2019s computer data files, but chose instead to restrict \u201cuse of the computer terminals . . . whether for inquiry into computer data files or otherwise.\u201d This phrasing seems to place emphasis on protection of the terminals, prohibiting their unauthorized use for any reason, rather than protection of the registry\u2019s data files.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">We also take note of some historical background to the act\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>passage. At that time, motor vehicle registration applications were considered public records.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the records themselves were public at that time, the statute could not have been intended to protect the information contained in the records, albeit the mere fact that registry records were considered public does not definitively rule out a possibility that the Legislature may have intended to restrict access to computerized forms of records. A more specific background fact sheds additional light on the statute\u2019s enactment. On August 28, 1970, the Attorney General issued an opinion that registry records of revocations and suspensions of licenses and vehicle registrations were public records and were to be made available, as requested by insurance companies, \u201cin computer processable form.\u201d Rep. A.G. Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 43, 46 (1971). The Attorney General further concluded that there was no reason not to allow \u201cmembers of the insurance industry to use a computer terminal by which they can inquire directly into the Registry\u2019s corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>puter.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>We are persuaded that the statute was likely a response to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Legislative history on the statute is sparse. Two bills addressing the subject matter had been introduced into the House of Representatives.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> One of these, 1972 House Doc. No. 4554, concerned specifically with registry records of license suspensions and revocations, confirms our conclusion that the legislation concerning the registry\u2019s computers was in response to Rep. A.G., <em>supra </em>at 43. This bill suggests that the main object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>of the statute and the mischief toward which it was directed was the potential disruption of the registry\u2019s daily operations, in light of the Attorney General\u2019s granting access to the registry\u2019s computer terminals to private parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We find the evidence that G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 30A, was intended to protect computer terminals, not computerized records, more persuasive than any of the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments. There is no evidence brought to our attention to support the conclusory argument that protecting motor vehicle registrants\u2019 privacy was the Legislature\u2019s purpose for the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiffs ask us to focus on the word \u201cindirect\u201d in the statute, which, in order to have a meaning independent from the use of computer terminals \u201cdirect[ly],\u201d must prohibit, they contend, electronic access to the data files.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We see no reason to attribute the meaning the plaintiffs advocate to such a general word, especially in light of statutory language attempting to describe a restriction on what at the time was a novel and not well-understood technology. The plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to find support from a superseded advisory opinion of the supervisor of public records, interpreting the statute to prohibit on-line access to registry information, is equally unavailing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Were the foregoing analysis of the statute all that supported our interpretation, we might not be so confident that our narrow interpretation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 30A, was correct. Another more recent statute, G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 7A,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> however, confirms how we must give effect to the statute at issue. The second sentence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 7A, unmistakably authorizes the registrar to use electronic means to fulfil one of his main c. 90 duties of registering vehicles. The plaintiffs point out that G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 8, immediately follows G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 7A, and states that \u201c[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to supersede the powers and duties of the registrar as provided in chapter ninety.\u201d Were we to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 broad interpretation that G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 30A, restricts use of computerized records in addition to computer terminals, and that therefore the clear authorization of G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 7A, may not operate to supersede G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 30A, then the second sentence in c. 90C, \u00a7 7A, would be a nullity. \u201cA statute should not be construed in such a way as to make it a nullity when a sensible construction is readily available.\u201d <em>Clean Harbors of Braintree, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Braintree, </em>415 Mass. 876, 883 (1993). We also attempt to \u201cconstrue related statutes harmoniously so as to give rise to a consistent body of law.\u201d <em>Marco </em>v. <em>Green, </em>415 Mass. 732, 736 (1993). The interpretation that we give here to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 30A, enables us to avoid rendering G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 7A, a nullity and establishes a harmonious and consistent body of related law.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The plaintiffs in one case brought against the registrar are Robert Bombardieri, chief executive officer and shareholder in B &amp; T Express, Inc., and B &amp; T, which provides runners to take registration paperwork from automobile dealers to the registry.

Well after enactment of c. 90, \u00a7 30A, the Appeals Court revisited the issue of registry records in light of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), which exempted from the definition of public records \u201cmaterials or data relating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 415, 418 (1988).

An affidavit of the registrar\u2019s chief information officer points out that the registry computer, a large machine operated with punch cards, primitive by today\u2019s standards and predating the introduction of personal computers, was a technology still not widely available. While protection of computer terminals in today\u2019s age of virtually universal access to such hardware may seem a quaint statutory provision, it is plausible that when G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 30A, was enacted, private organizations would seek access to such computer hardware and the Legislature may have been reluctant to share a valuable Commonwealth resource.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> 1972 House Doc.
