Kendall, the defendant, appeals from provisions of the divorce judgment and a temporary order issued after Barbara Zeitler Kendall, the plaintiff, filed a complaint against him in the Probate Court for contempt of the divorce judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff also filed a cross appeal, requesting an award of attorney\u2019s fees and reversal of the joint custody order and disposition of the marital home. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>We summarize the facts found by the judge. The parties professed to hold different religious beliefs when they were married in 1988, the plaintiff being Jewish, and the defendant, Catholic.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties\u2019 fundamental religious differences would be unremarkable but for their controversial effect on their three minor children<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> caught in the crossfire generated by their parents. Before the parties were married, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>discussed the religious upbringing of any children, and agreed that children would be raised in the Jewish faith.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In 1991, the defendant became a member of the Boston Church of Christ, a fundamentalist Christian faith. The defendant believes in Jesus Christ and that those who do not accept the Boston Church of Christ faith are \u201cdamned to go to hell\u201d where there will be \u201cweeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d The defendant testified that he would like his children to accept Jesus Christ and that he \u201cwill'never stop trying to save his children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The parties\u2019 divergent views polarized in 1994 when the plaintiff adopted Orthodox Judaism.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ariel also began studying and adhering to principles of Orthodox Judaism. Soon after the parties\u2019 beliefs drifted to opposite doctrinal extremes, the plaintiff filed for divorce in November, 1994, based on an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 IB.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">2. <em>The court proceedings. </em>At the outset the plaintiff sought to limit the children\u2019s exposure to the defendant\u2019s religion, and the defendant objected to any limitation on his ability to share his religious beliefs with the children.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On October 18, 1995, the judge granted the plaintiff\u2019s request for the appointment of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>guardian ad litem (GAL) to \u201caddress the inter-religious conflict between the parties in particular.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>383 Mass. 232, 233 (1981), this court addressed the question of accommodating diverse religious practices of parents, living apart, in the upbringing of minor children. The court held that the overriding goal in any such inquiry is to serve the best interests of the children even where \u201cthe attainment of that purpose . . . involve[s] some limitation of the liberties of one or other of the parents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The judge found it substantially damaging to the children to leave each parent free to expose the children, as he or she wishes, to his or her religion. The resulting judgment of divorce contained the following paragraphs:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">\u201c5. <em>RESTRICTIONS UPON RELIGIOUS EXPOSURE: </em>Each parent shall be entitled to share his/her religious beliefs with the children with restrictions as follows: neither may indoctrinate the children in a manner which substantially promotes their . . . alienation from either parent or their rejection of either parent. The [defendant] shall not take the children to his church (whether to church services or Sunday School or church educational programs); nor engage them in prayer or bible study if it promotes rejection rather than acceptance, of their mother or their own Jewish self-identity. The [defendant] shall not share his religious beliefs with the children if those beliefs cause the children significant emotional distress or worry about their mother or about themselves. Thus, for example, [the defendant] may have pictures of Jesus Christ hanging on the walls of his residence, and that will not serve as any basis for restricting his visitation with his children. But, [the defendant] may not take the children to religious services where they receive the message that adults or children who do not accept Jesus Christ as their lord and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>savior are destined to burn in hell. By way of further example, [the defendant] may not shave off [.Ariel\u2019s] payes. This provision shall not be construed so as to prevent [the defendant] from having the children with him at events involving family traditions at Christmas and Easter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">\u201cIn the event that there is a disagreement between the parents as to whether one or more of the children could be exposed to the religious belief(s) of [the defendant] with <em>out </em>substantial negative impact upon their emotional health, the parents shall engage the services of Michael Goldberg, Ph.D., to act as G.A.L./investigator/evaluator on such issues and disputes. The fee of Dr. Goldberg shall be shared equally by the parties. In the event that Dr. Goldberg is unable to serve in this capacity, then the parties shall agree upon an alternate child psychologist, or an alternate shall be selected by the Court. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">\u201c6. <em>EXPLANATION. TO CHILDREN. </em>Neither party shall initially discuss with the children the terms and conditions of this Judgment. Within two (2) days of the date of receipt of this Judgment, the Plaintiff shall contact the Court-appointed Guardian Ad Litem, Dr. Michael Goldberg, to arrange for a meeting with the children. Dr. Goldberg shall explain to the children, in a developmentally appropriate manner, the Court\u2019s decision, with the goal being to help the children understand that they are being raised in the way they are because the Court believes that it is in their best interest. It is intended by the Court that this intervention may help the children avoid blaming themselves.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The defendant argues in this appeal that the judge\u2019s findings did not demonstrate \u201csubstantial harm\u201d to the children so as to warrant the limitations imposed on his liberty interest in educating his children in the tenets of his religion. He challenges both the judge\u2019s factual findings of harm and the legal conclusions based on that evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">3. <em>Standard of review. </em>We scrutinize without deference the legal standard which the judge applied to the facts to ensure the ultimate findings and conclusions are consistent with the law. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Resolution GGF Oy, </em>417 Mass. 377, 382 (1994), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>citing <em>Marlow </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>369 Mass. 501, 508 (1976). The plaintiff was required to demonstrate \u201cin detail\u201d that exposure to the defendant\u2019s religion caused the children \u201csubstantial injury, physical or emotional, and [would] have a like harmful tendency for the future.\u201d <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Felton, supra </em>at 234, 235. We uphold the judge\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>; we review her legal conclusions to ensure they are based on correct legal standards. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Resolution GGF Oy, supra </em>at 382 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">4. <em>Analysis. </em>\u201c[P]arents together have freedom of religious expression and practice which enters into their liberty to manage the familial relationships.\u201d <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Felton, supra </em>at 233, citing <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205 (1972). Those individual liberties may be restricted where there is a compelling interest. <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Felton, supra. A </em>parent\u2019s right to practice religion may be restricted only where limited exposure to that parent\u2019s beliefs is necessary to further a child\u2019s best interests. <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Felton, supra. </em>To do so, there must be an affirmative showing of harm caused by exposure to the conflicting religious teachings. <em>Id. </em>at 233-234.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The determinative issue is whether the harm found to exist in this case is demonstrated to be so substantial so as to warrant a limitation on the defendant\u2019s religious freedom. In <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>this court suggested that a \u201clikely source[]\u201d of proof of substantial harm \u201cby implication\u201d could be derived from testimony as to the child\u2019s general demeanor, attitude, school work, appetite, health or outlook. <em>Id. </em>at 242, citing <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>267 S.W.2d 340, 343 (Mo. Ct. App. 1954). The court also opined that the \u201cwholly uncorroborated testimony\u201d of a parent was insufficient to demonstrate harm. <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Felton, supra. </em>By implication, the court suggested that a plaintiff should consult \u201cchurch, school, medical or psychiatric authorities\u201d to support a charge that a child has been harmed by exposure to the parent\u2019s religious beliefs. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the court specifically recommended the appointment of \u201ca qualified investigator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>(whether called a guardian or some other title) who would look into the facts, render a report, and be subject to examination by the parties.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Other States have struggled to define what constitutes substantial harm.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Very few have actually ruled that substantial harm had been demonstrated.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 14</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">We adhere to the line of cases requiring clear evidence of substantial harm.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See note 12, <em>supra. </em>Application of the strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>requirements in those cases comports with the protections of religious freedoms historically preserved under the Massachusetts Constitution. See <em>Society of Jesus of New England </em>v. <em>Boston Landmarks Comm\u2019n, </em>409 Mass. 38 (1990), <em>S.C., </em>411 Mass. 754 (1992) (citing authorities documenting historical protection of religious freedoms).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The harm found to exist in this case presents more than the generalized fears criticized in <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Felton, supra. </em>The judge afforded substantial weight to the GAL\u2019s report.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The judge considered the report so \u201ccomprehensive\u201d that it should be considered in its entirety on any appellate review.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Among the factors the judge cited to support her conclusion that substantial harm to the children had been demonstrated are the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">\u201c20.1 find that, in early 1995, the [defendant] threatened to cut the fringe off Ariel\u2019s tzitzitz if he did not tuck it inside his pants. This greatly upset Ariel and the [plaintiff], and the [defendant] later apologized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">\u201c21. I also find that, in the summer of 1995, the [defendant] cut off Ariel\u2019s payes. I do not find credible the [defendant\u2019s] explanation that he did so at Ariel\u2019s request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">\u201c24. I find that the Boston Church of Christ services to which [the defendant] has taken his children have included teachings that those who do not accept the Boston Church of Christ faith are damned to go to hell where there will be \u2018weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">\u201c25. I find that the oldest child, Ari, has drawn from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the above teaching the conclusion that [the plaintiff] may go to hell, and that this causes him substantial worry and upset.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">\u201c56. [The defendant\u2019s] behavior toward his children fosters negative and distorted images of the Jewish culture. [The defendant] insists that all individuals who do not accept his beliefs about life and existence are sinners who are destined to torturous punishment. [The defendant] opposes his children being taught the history of the Holocaust. Further, [the defendant\u2019s] cutting off of Ari\u2019s religiously meaningful side bums (payes), and his threats to cut off his clothing fringes (tzitzitz) show that he does not refrain from inducing guilt in the child for having the beliefs that he does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">\u201c57. I find that Ari has a strong Jewish self-identity. I am persuaded by the report of the G.A.L. that Ari \u2018clearly identified himself and his siblings as being Jewish and provided a rationale based on Jewish law for his belief that he is Jewish,\u2019 and that the child\u2019s \u2018behavior in which he ascribes his Jewish identity to Jewish law and theology is indicative of his attainment of a formal self-identification of himself as a Jew.\u2019 Indeed, [the defendant] himself reluctantly concedes that if asked, Ari would unquestionably say he is Jewish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\u201c58. [The defendant] understands that Ari perceives himself as Jewish, and that having a Jewish identity is akin to having an ethnic identity. But the matter goes further. Ari perceives his Jewishness as being part of his \u2018soul.\u2019 For Ari, efforts to convince him that his religion is wrong are logically equated with convincing him that his \u2018soul\u2019 is damaged or inadequate. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">\u201c59. I credit the G.A.L.\u2019s report and testimony that Ari \u2018may experience choosing a religion as choosing between his parents, a task that is likely to cause him significant emotional distress.\u2019 In fact, the G.A.L. specifically concludes, and I credit his conclusion, that the children are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>now in a position where they are perilously close to being forced to choose between their parents, and to reject one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">\u201c60. I find, based upon the G.A.L.\u2019s report as well as his testimony, that the oldest child Ari \u2018. . .is emotionally distressed by the conflict between his strong desire for affection and approval from [the defendant] and his desire to maintain his Jewish religious practice,\u2019 and that as a direct result \u2018. . . there has been a decline in his motivation and academic performance.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">\u201c62. I find that Ari is understandably uncomfortable and unhappy when he \u2018has to do the stuff [he\u2019s] not supposed to do on Shabbas\u2019, and that precisely as the G.A.L. indicates, Ari then has the no-win dilemma of pleasing and obeying [the defendant] (while displeasing and disobeying [the plaintiff] and his own internalized beliefs about how the world is \u2018supposed\u2019 to function on the Sabbath) or the reverse. Poor Ari: he told [the defendant] that he \u2018wants to celebrate the Sabbath and not do stuff that I\u2019m not supposed to do\u2019, and [the defendant\u2019s] response was \u2018we\u2019ll discuss that with the lawyers.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">\u201c64. I credit the G.A.L.\u2019s report that \u2018Moriah is experiencing emotional distress related.to the parental conflict . . .\u2019 I find that Moriah has a very solid understanding of who she is and who her family is: \u2018I\u2019m not Christian. I\u2019m Jewish. Mom is Jewish. My dad is Christian. My brother is Jewish and my sister is Jewish.\u2019 Moriah\u2019s straightforward description is comfortable and age-appropriate. More importantly, it is accurate. And most important of all, it shows that she can tolerate the knowledge of her parents\u2019 religious differences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">\u201c66. I find, based upon the G.A.L.\u2019s report that Rebekah is likely to experience \u2018. . . a sense of not belonging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>in her own home\u2019 by \u2018. . . anything that serves to promote her identity as fundamentally different from that of her mother and siblings.\u2019 I find this would be substantially to her detriment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">\u201c67. I credit the report of the G.A.L. that \u2018should the children come to accept the religious beliefs that [the defendant] reports he wants them to accept, they are likely to come to view their mother negatively and as a person who will be punished for her sins . . -resulting in a \u2018. . . negative impact on their relationship with their mother . . . and difficulty accepting guidance and nurturance from her.\u2019 I find this would be to the children\u2019s substantial detriment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">\u201c68. For children of tender years (and it seems to me that this likely means at least up to age; 12), I find directly contradictory messages from trusted adults to be solidly contrary to their best interests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Whether the harm found to exist amounts to the \u201csubstantial harm\u201d required to justify interference with the defendant\u2019s liberty interest is a close question, especially because there is considerable value in \u201cfrequent and continuing contact\u201d between the child and both parents, and \u201ccontact with the parents\u2019 separate religious preferences.\u201d <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Felton, supra </em>at 234. In this regard the judge ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">\u201cThere is surface appeal to the [defendant\u2019s] argument that the [plaintiff] has not met her burden of establishing substantial present harm to the children from exposure to [the defendant\u2019s] religious beliefs and practices, for the G.A.L. found only a few instances of concrete present harm to the children. I am mindful that the G.A.L. has not found current damage to the children so severe that it has caused them to suffer a psychotic break, or to have a \u2018formal psychiatric diagnosis\u2019. . . . The case law does not require the court to wait for formal psychiatric breakdown and the evidence paints a strong picture of the reasonably projected course if the children continue to be caught in the cross-fire of their parents\u2019 religious difference: [the defendant\u2019s] religion may alienate the children from their custodial parent (she is bad, she will burn in hell), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>may dimmish their own sense of self-worth and self-identity (Jews are bad, Jews will bum in hell). At minimum they will be called upon to \u2018choose\u2019 between their parents, in itself a detrimental result. The G.A.L. predicts damaging consequences of the children\u2019s exposure to two vastly different, and on some points directly contradictory religious views. \u2018Sometimes ... a diversity of religious experience is itself a sound stimulant for a child . . . the question that comes to the courts is whether, in particular circumstances, such exposures are disturbing a child to its substantial injury, physical or emotional, and will have a like harmful tendency for the future.\u2019 <em>(Felton, [supra] </em>at 234-235). Applying that standard to the facts of this particular case, I see substantial evidence of current and imminent harm, to these 7, 5, and 3-year-old children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In balancing these conflicting interests, fully aware of the complexities and nuances involved, we conclude that the judge\u2019s findings support her order in paragraph 5 of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Where, as here, the judge has found demonstrable evidence of substantial harm to the children, we reject the defendant\u2019s arguments that the divorce judgment burdens his right to practice religion under the free exercise clauses of the Massachusetts and United States Constitution.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Both the Massachusetts and the United States Constitutions permit limitations on individual liberties where there exists a compelling interest. See <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 230 (1972) (deferring to parental rights with respect to religious upbringing of children absent harm to their physical or mental health); <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 166-167 (1944) (recognizing parents\u2019 rights to practice religion and rights to family decision-making are not beyond limitation); <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Felton, supra, </em>at 233 (stating limitations on individual liberties permissible where best interests of child must be promoted); <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>375 Mass. 733, 748 (1978) (emphasizing that parental rights \u201cdo not clothe parents with life and death authority over their children\u201d). Promoting the best interests of the children is an interest sufficiently compelling to impose a burden on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>defendant\u2019s right to practice religion and his parental right to determine the religious upbringing of his children. <em>Felton, supra </em>at 233. Paragraph 5 of the divorce judgment is limited in scope and imposes a minimal burden on the defendant\u2019s right to practice religion by requiring only that he limit sharing certain aspects of his beliefs with his children. The divorce judgment imposes no additional limitations on the defendant\u2019s individual ability to practice his religion. Thus, we believe paragraph 5 of the divorce judgment is a constitutional limitation on the defendant\u2019s individual liberties as it is necessary to ensure the best interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">. The defendant\u2019s claim that the divorce judgment violates art. 11 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution and the establishment clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution must also be rejected. In making establishment clause assessments in the past we have applied the test set out by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Kurtzman, </em>403 U.S. 602, 612 (1971). <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>386 Mass. 367, 378, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Bellotti, </em>459 U.S. 970 (1982). In so doing we determine whether the divorce judgment has a secular purpose, that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and does not \u201cfoster \u2018an excessive government entanglement with religion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra, </em>quoting <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Kurtzman, supra </em>at 612-613. Although there is considerable doubt about the continued vitality of the test in <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Kurtzman, supra, </em>in light of recent decisions of the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we reach this conclusion if we apply that more stringent test.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">We reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the divorce judgment \u201cestablished Judaism\u201d as the religion to govern his children\u2019s upbringing. In limiting the children\u2019s exposure to the defendant\u2019s religion, the judge merely recognized the preference that the parties allowed to develop and one that the defendant, until recently, encouraged. Moreover, paragraph 5 was intended for a wholly secular purpose \u2014 to limit the emotional harm to the children caused by exposure to negative messages presented by the defendant\u2019s religion.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Although the judgment contemplates continued court involvement, it does not foster excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>government entanglement because the focus of any judicial inquiry will center on the emotional or physical harm to the children rather than the merit-worthiness of the parties\u2019 respective religious teachings.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">5. <em>Joint custody. </em>The plaintiff argues on cross appeal that it was an abuse of discretion to award joint legal custody to the parties. The determination of custody rests within the discretion of the judge. <em>Vilakazi </em>v. <em>Maxie, </em>371 Mass. 406, 409 (1976). The material facts found and reported must support the judge\u2019s action in awarding joint legal custody to the parties. <em>Id. </em>We are mindful of the importance of a trial judge\u2019s opportunity to observe and appraise both parents in custody matters. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>337 Mass. 625, 627 (1958). The plaintiff argues that joint legal custody is inappropriate because she and the defendant are unable to agree on \u201cmajor decisions regarding the [children\u2019s] . . . moral and religious development.\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31. See <em>Rolde </em>v. <em>Rolde, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404-405 (1981) (suggesting joint custody is appropriate where parents are \u201crelatively stable\u201d and \u201camicable\u201d and agree on basic issues). Because the plaintiff points to no conflict other than the parties\u2019 inability to reconcile their views as to the children\u2019s religious upbringing, we conclude that she has not established that the judge abused her discretion in granting joint custody.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">6. <em>Property disposition and attorney\u2019s fees. </em>The plaintiff also argues the judge erred in granting the defendant twenty-five per cent of the proceeds on the sale of the jointly owned marital home because her family provided the funds for its purchase. We will not set aside the trial judge\u2019s division of marital assets unless an award is \u201cplainly wrong and excessive.\u201d <em>Heins </em>v. <em>Ledis, </em>422 Mass. 477, 481 (1996). The judge found that the purchase of the marital home was a completed gift to the parties from the plaintiff\u2019s parents. The award was well within the proper exercise of her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The plaintiff also claims that she should have been awarded attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to G.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>judge\u2019s decision not to award attorney\u2019s fees is within her discretion. <em>Brash </em>v. <em>Brash, </em>407 Mass. 101, 106 (1990). Furthermore, she was in a position to observe first hand the defendant\u2019s conduct; therefore, we shall not disturb her assessment on the basis of a printed record.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\">On September 26, 1996, the Probate and Family Court judge issued a clarified judgment of divorce nisi, nunc pro tunc, to August 20, 1996. The clarified judgment effectuated minor changes to provisions of the initial judgment. These changes are unrelated to the issues raised in this appeal. Except for the minor revisions, the initial judgment and the clarified judgment are essentially the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The judge issued the challenged temporary order on October 22, 1996 <em>\u201c[i]n the interim\" </em>and <em>\u201cuntil the matter could be heard at trial\u201d </em>(emphasis added). We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the order is reviewable by this court. Despite the defendant\u2019s present position, he treated these orders as temporary when he appealed on November 27, 1996, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par. We note that, were we to conclude that the temporary orders were properly before us, we would scrutinize very carefully any order requiring an individual to audiotape religious services unless there was general acquiescence to the order\u2019s mandates. We would look more favorably on an order defining neutral solutions so as to minimize the court\u2019s involvement in sectarian issues. For instance, requiring a neutral observer to determine whether the content of religious services was violative of the court\u2019s judgment and to report any detrimental effect on the children would allow the court to maintain its focus on the legal issues rather than engage in an interpretation of the intricacies of the parties\u2019 respective beliefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\">We note the judge\u2019s determination that \u201c[bjoth parents share this view: that Jews do not believe that Jesus [Christ] was the son of God, while Christians do believe that Jesus was the son of God.\u201d While noting the divergent beliefs, we do not imply that this seeming \u201c [i]rreconcilability\u201d inevitably signifies conflict and hostility.

We note, however, that the judge found the children had primary familiarity with the Jewish faith. The judge concluded the children had a \u201cJewish identity\u201d based on evidence that: the parties were married in a traditional Jewish wedding ceremony; Ariel was circumcised in accordance with Jewish tradition; both Moriah and Rebekah had traditional Jewish naming ceremonies; the parties agreed the children would attend a Jewish school; and all three children are so enrolled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b260-13\">Orthodox Judaism is considered the most strictly doctrinal of the three Jewish movements (Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b260-14\">After the plaintiff filed her complaint for divorce, a probate judge entered a temporary order according to a stipulation of the parties dated December 9, 1994.

The stipulation contained a provision stating, \u201cNeither party shall make negative or derogatory comments to the children about the other parent or his/her religion.\u201d As soon as the order issued, both parties challenged the order\u2019s visitation schedule as interfering with planned weekend religious events with the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The judge appointed Dr. Michael A. Goldberg as the guardian ad litem (GAL). The defendant initially expressed concern that the GAL would be biased because he perceived him as being Jewish. However, when the GAL indicated his willingness to withdraw, the defendant told him he wished to proceed and stated he was comfortable with his ability to conduct the investigation without bias.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\">The judgment also ordered that the plaintiff retain sole physical custody of the children, and awarded the parties joint legal custody.

The defendant contends Dr. Hassan was not a qualified expert and his testimony was highly prejudicial. Even assuming the testimony was inadmissible, the judge specifically stated that she did not rely on Dr. Hassan\u2019s testimony in making her ruling; therefore, there can be no prejudicial effect.
