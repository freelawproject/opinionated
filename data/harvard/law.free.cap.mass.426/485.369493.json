The variance, granted by the board to the defendant Ciancarelh on January 10, 1995, permitted him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>operate a beauty salon on the ground floor and basement of a four-floor condominium building located in the Beacon Hill section of Boston, a neighborhood zoned for residential use only. The plaintiffs, consisting of the condominium association\u2019s board of managers and the residents, appealed to the Superior Court, claiming that (1) Ciancarelli did not obtain the plaintiffs\u2019 prior consent to seek the variance and thus lacked standing before the board; and (2) the board exceeded its authority in granting the variance. On July 31, 1996, following a trial de novo, the judge set aside the board\u2019s decision on both grounds. Ciancarelli appeals from the judge\u2019s decision. We transferred the case here on our own motion and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The judge made detailed factual findings, which we now recite in summary fashion. The condominium building at issue is a four-story complex known as 39 Joy Street. It is located on Beacon Hill\u2019s north slope and was constructed in 1905 pursuant to a building permit authorizing the construction of a tenement house for three families and one office to be located on the ground floor. The ground floor and the basement, collectively known as Unit C, contain approximately 490 square feet and 390 square feet respectively. The ground floor has a facade of wood construction and a large plate glass window which does not open. Outside the building there is a recessed stoop which services the entry to Unit C exclusively. The complex has a separate entry for the residential units. The basement of Unit C is unfinished and contains an electrical service box, two boilers, and various exposed utility lines. The building\u2019s other three units, one per floor, each contain 750 square feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Since the building\u2019s construction, Unit C has been used for various commercial purposes. The subsequently enacted zoning ordinance of the city of Boston (city) allowed only for residential use of the building.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1986, the building was converted to condominium units. The master deed provided that the building would contain three residential units and one commercial unit. At that time, Unit C\u2019s previous commercial occupant left, leaving the unit completely vacant until Ciancarelli <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>purchased it from the city in May, 1994, for $70,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>At that time, Ciancarelli was operating a beauty salon located in a building housing several small businesses on nearby Myrtle Street. Ciancarelli then received a use variance from the board permitting commercial use in Unit C, spent $30,000 renovating the ground floor, and moved his beauty salon there in September, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">2. <em>Standing. </em>Ciancarelli first claims that the judge erred when he concluded that, in order to have standing to appeal to the board, Ciancarelli needed the plaintiffs\u2019 prior consent. A person\u2019s ownership of a condominium unit includes \u201can exclusive fee interest in [the] individual unit\u201d in which \u201cpossession and control ... is reserved to the unit owner.\u201d <em>Golub </em>v. <em>Milpo, Inc., </em>402 Mass. 397, 400, 401 (1988), citing G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7\u00a7 3-5. An owner\u2019s power over his unit is subject only to the limitations set forth in the master deed and the condominium bylaws. G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 4. See <em>Strauss </em>v. <em>Oyster River Condominium Trust, </em>417 Mass. 442, 452 (1994) (noting master deed prescribed \u201cthe rules of the game\u201d); <em>McEneaney </em>v. <em>Chestnut Hill Realty Corp., </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 573, 577 (1995). Condominium unit ownership also includes \u201can undivided interest with all other unit owners in the condominium\u2019s common areas and facilities,\u201d <em>Golub </em>v. <em>Milpo, Inc., supra </em>at 400, over which entities like the plaintiff board of managers are \u201cempowered by statute \u2018[t]o conduct litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401, quoting G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In the particular circumstances presented in this case, Ciancarelli had standing to seek a variance. It is well settled that an individual may independently seek a variance with respect to property he owns exclusively. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10. Ciancarelli sought a variance to alter the use of his unit alone \u2014 property in which he has an \u201cexclusive fee interest.\u201d <em>Golub </em>v. <em>Milpo, Inc., supra </em>at 400. Its potential effect on the building\u2019s common area was negligible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, Ciancarelli\u2019s ability to seek a variance is subject only to the provisions of the master deed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the condominium bylaws. Neither prohibits him from seeking a variance absent the plaintiffs\u2019 consent or from using the unit commercially. Indeed, the judge found that the master deed, which was recorded in 1986, provided for \u201cone (1) commercial unit\u201d in the building. This express endorsement of Unit C\u2019s commercial use, together with the negligible effect on the common areas, bestows on Ciancarelli independent standing to seek the variance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">3. <em>The variance. </em>Ciancarelli next claims that the judge erred in annulling the board\u2019s grant of the variance. In reviewing the board\u2019s decision, the judge \u201cis required to hear the matter de novo and determine the legal validity of the decision of the board upon the facts found by him.\u201d <em>Josephs </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, </em>362 Mass. 290, 295 (1972). See generally <em>Devine </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Lynn, </em>332 Mass. 319, 321 (1955). We must accept the judge\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous, <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>361 Mass. 472, 477, 478 (1972), but we are independently to \u201c determine [] what decision the law requires upon the facts found.\u201d <em>Bicknell Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>330 Mass. 676, 679 (1953). Furthermore, the validity of the board\u2019s decision is determined on the basis of the facts found by the judge. See <em>id.) Kirkwood </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 423, 426-427 (1984). The burden in such an appeal is on the person seeking the variance. See <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Amherst, </em>383 Mass. 1, 10 (1981); <em>Marr </em>v. <em>Back Bay Architectural Comm\u2019n, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 679, 682 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The grant of a variance to Ciancarelli is governed by St. 1965, c. 665, \u00a7 9, and the Boston Zoning Code. Pursuant to \u00a7 7-3 of the Boston Zoning Code, a variance may be granted only where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\u201c(a) . . . there are special circumstances or conditions, fully described in the findings . . . which ... are peculiar to such land or structure but not the neighborhood . . . such that the application of the provisions of this code would deprive the appellant of the reasonable use of such land or structure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">\u201c(b) ... for reasons of practical difficulty and demonstrable and substantial hardship fully described in the findings, the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or structure and ... the variance ... is the minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">\u201c(c) ... the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this code, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The grant of a variance is proper only where there are findings with respect to all of these requirements. <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Amherst, supra </em>at 9-10. We also recognize that \u201c[n]o person has a legal right to a variance and they are to be granted sparingly.\u201d <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, supra </em>at 479, quoting <em>Damaskos </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>359 Mass. 55, 61 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">In the present case, the judge\u2019s findings form a sufficient basis for denying Ciancarelli\u2019s request for a variance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> First, his findings show that denying the variance would pose no \u201csubstantial hardship\u201d to Ciancarelli. With respect to Unit C\u2019s small size, there was evidence that the ground floor alone had more than sufficient living space to comply with code requirements for residential housing regarding natural light, ventilation, and size.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That Ciancarelli may have to seek dimensional variances for a residential use does not, in our view, alter this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>conclusion. Compare <em>DiRico </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Quincy, </em>341 Mass. 607, 610 (1961) (denying variance for commercial use even where \u201cstructure could obviously be more easily converted to an office building than it could to a dwelling\u201d), with <em>Rodenstein </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>337 Mass. 333, 335, 336 (1958) (variance for parking lot allowed where parcel was not \u201csuitable for development and enjoyment as residential property\u201d because \u201cland was largely rock formation\u201d), and <em>Cavanaugh </em>v. <em>DiFlumera, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 396, 402 (1980) (variance allowed where \u201cit was not economically feasible or likely that the locus would be developed in the future for a use permitted by the zoning ordinance or by-law\u201d). Likewise, Unit C\u2019s \u201cstore front facade\u201d does not necessitate granting a variance because, as the judge found, a number of buildings in the neighborhood with similar facades were converted to and used for residential purposes despite their commercial appearance. Finally, the judge determined that the estimated cost of renovating the ground floor for residential purposes ($30,000 to $60,000 depending on the extent and quality of the renovations) was insufficient to constitute a substantial hardship. We note additionally that \u201c[financial hardship to the owner alone is not sufficient to establish \u2018substantial hardship\u2019 and thereby justify a variance.\u201d <em>McNeely </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>358 Mass. 94, 101 (1970), citing <em>Bicknell </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, supra </em>at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">We also, agree with the judge\u2019s conclusion that, even if restricting Unit C to residential use constitutes a substantial hardship, no variance was warranted because Ciancarelli failed to meet another requirement of \u00a7 7-3. Specifically, the judge found no evidence that the size, \u201cstore front facade,\u201d and renovation costs were \u201cpeculiar to . . . Unit C, but not to the neighborhood,\u201d as required under \u00a7 7-3 (a). To the contrary, his express finding that other buildings with commercial facades had been successfully converted to residences demonstrates that Unit C\u2019s characteristics were by no means unique in the Beacon Hill area.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The judgment annulling the board\u2019s decision granting the variance is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Because the prior commercial use of Unit C predated the zoning bylaws, the city of Boston (city) deemed it a \u201cnon-conforming use\u201d and accordingly allowed the unit to continue to be used in this manner until the use ended. See Boston Zoning Code, art. 9, \u00a7 9-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The city had previously taken title to Unit C for the previous owner\u2019s failure to pay taxes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\">We are mindful of the agreed fact that, \u201c[i]n order to enter Unit C through the primary mode of access on Joy Street, an individual must cross over an exterior step and stoop, which constitute part of the common area . . . but which serves Unit C exclusively.\u201d Given the judge\u2019s findings that (1) the condominium\u2019s other residents have a separate entrance apart from Unit C; (2) Ciancarelli has only ten customers daily; and (3) Ciancarelli receives no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>deliveries at the salon, Unit C\u2019s use of this small portion of the common area does not \u201chinder[] or encroach[] upon the lawful rights of other unit owners.\u201d See G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 5 <em>(d).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b508-10\">In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that condominium ownership involves \u201cjoint sovereignty.\u201d See <em>Woodvale Condominium Trust </em>v. <em>Scheff, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 530, 533 (1989). That is, due to the \u201csharing, often close, of physical space,\u201d an owner has a greater interest as to what goes on within the confines of neighboring units than he otherwise might have in separate, privately owned property. See <em>id. </em>We are confident, however, that the provisions of G. L. c. 40A, allowing neighbors to challenge the granting of variances before the board, adequately protects their interests. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\">The defendant does not argue that any of the judge\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b509-10\">The judge found that \u201c[t]he unfinished basement space is of restricted use because of its size [390 square feet] and the presence of an electrical service box and two boilers which are common elements of the entire condominium.\u201d He also cited the basement\u2019s \u201climited ceiling height\u201d and \u201cexposed and intrusive utility lines for gas, water and sewer\u201d in concluding that the viability of using Unit C residentially must depend on examination of the ground floor alone.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
