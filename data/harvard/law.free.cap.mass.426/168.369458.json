The killing took place during the commission of a separate felony punishable by life imprisonment \u2014 in this case, armed assault in a dwelling, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18A, of which the defendant also was convicted. The defendant received the mandatory term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on the first degree murder convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>tion and a concurrent sentence of from four to five years on a conviction of unlawfully possessing a firearm, third offense, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a). (The judge placed the conviction of armed assault in a dwelling on file, with the defendant\u2019s consent, without imposing sentence.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The defendant appeals from the convictions, claiming that he was improperly denied his right to cross-examine a police officer concerning that officer\u2019s knowledge or awareness of a certain dictum in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>420 Mass. 656 (1995).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also claims that he should have received a jury instruction on involuntary manslaughter. Finally, he requests relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, owing in substantial part to the alleged misconduct of two police officers who, admittedly, used deceptive tactics to elicit incriminating statements from him while he was in police custody. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The deceptive tactics of the two officers are described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, supra </em>at 658-659.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On examining the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d surrounding the defendant\u2019s statements, we concluded that they were given voluntarily and without coercion, despite the officers\u2019 ruse. <em>Id. </em>at 664-665. At the same time, we expressed in dictum our disapproval of such police tactics. <em>Id. </em>at 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">1. <em>Limitation on cross-examination. </em>During his cross-examination of one of the police officers, defense counsel attempted to elicit evidence of the officer\u2019s knowledge of the dictum in <em>Selby. </em>Counsel asked whether the officer was \u201caware that the State Supreme Court has disapproved of [the officers\u2019 technique of deception].\u201d The officer responded, \u201cI believe the State Supreme Court has approved this method, upheld this method five to zero most recently.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defense counsel then remarked to the officer, \u201cThere was a decision that they [the Supreme Judicial Court] disap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>proved of it . . . .\u201d The judge interrupted and, at sidebar, instructed counsel to terminate further inquiry into the <em>Selby </em>opinion. Defense counsel lodged no objection to the judge\u2019s ruling; nor did he produce an offer of proof explaining why testimony concerning a witness\u2019s knowledge, understanding, or interpretation of a particular appellate opinion (or dictum therefrom) was relevant and admissible. Our standard of review, therefore, is limited to whether the uncontested restriction by the judge on cross-examination of the police officer posed a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>401 Mass. 390, 404 (1987). We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">According to the defendant, the truncated inquiry into the <em>Selby </em>opinion left jurors with the false impression that the Supreme Judicial Court approves of police use of deceptive tactics while questioning suspects. Whatever we wrote in <em>Selby </em>(or how that was interpreted by a witness) was irrelevant to the core question posed to the jurors, namely, whether the defendant\u2019s incriminating statements were voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>415 Mass. 680, 687 (1993) (jury could consider defendant\u2019s statement only on finding beyond a reasonable doubt that it was made voluntarily); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 152, cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982) (jurors must disregard defendant\u2019s admissions unless Commonwealth proves beyond a reasonable doubt that they were voluntary). In assessing that question, the jurors were to consider all of the evidence \u201csurrounding the interrogation and the individual characteristics and conduct of the defendant.\u201d <em>Selby, supra </em>at 663, and cases cited. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>420 Mass. 666, 673-674 (1995). That, of course, included detailed evidence produced by the defendant concerning the officers\u2019 use of trickery to help induce the defendant\u2019s statements. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>377 Mass. 552, 563 (1979), cert. dismissed, 445 U.S. 39 (1980) (judge should consider police misconduct, including misinformation given to a defendant by a police officer, in ruling whether confession is voluntary).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The entire question of the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s incriminating statements was submitted to the jury for their independent consideration, in keeping with our long-standing rule of \u201chumane practice.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paszko, </em>391 Mass. 164, 179-180 (1984); <em>Tavares, supra </em>at 149-153; <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>378 Mass. 451, 456 (1979) (humane practice applied to confessions but not to admissions); and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>371 Mass. 462, 469-470 (1976) (humane practice applied to! confessions only). In <em>Tavares, supra, </em>we extended our humane practice to include \u201call incriminating statements made by the accused,\u201d even statements, like those of this defendant, that fall short of a full confession. <em>Id. </em>at 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Under humane practice, the question whether the defendant\u2019s incriminating statements or confessions are voluntary is first decided by the judge outside of the jury\u2019s presence. <em>Id. </em>at 149. If the judge concludes that the statements were, in fact, voluntary, then the entire matter is submitted to the jury for their own determination. <em>Id. </em>at 150. We have stated a preference that jurors <em>not </em>be informed beforehand of the judge\u2019s initial findings on the voluntariness issue. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>371 Mass. 478, 481 n.3 (1976) (\u201cbetter practice\u201d is for judge not to inform jury of his conclusion). In essence, then, humane practice gives a defendant two opportunities \u2014 one before a judge and another before a jury \u2014 to demonstrate that his admissions or confessions were not voluntary. Humane practice, however, is not constitutionally required. See <em>Paszko, supra </em>at 181; <em>Tavares, supra </em>at 151-152; and Chung, <em>supra </em>at 456, all of which state that the judge\u2019s initial ruling on voluntariness and, hence, admissibility of admissions or confessions is constitutionally required, but that independent jury consideration of voluntariness under humane practice is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The jury were given correct instructions on the voluntariness issue. Those instructions included detailed remarks reminding the jurors about the officers\u2019 use of a ruse on the defendant. The jury were further instructed that they should consider that tactic in the over-all assessment \u2014 \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d \u2014 surrounding the defendant\u2019s statements. Significantly, defense counsel neither requested a special instruction on the subject, nor moved to strike the testifying officer\u2019s remark about the <em>Selby </em>case \u2014 a remark that he, himself, had elicited from the officer. Certainly, the judge was not required to strike the officer\u2019s remark on his own initiative. The fact that the officer\u2019s remark may have led jurors to surmise that the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statements had initially been decided in the Commonwealth\u2019s favor, first by a Superior Court judge and then by the Supreme Judicial Court, did not, however, create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"ANB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>2. <em>Failure to instruct on involuntary manslaughter. </em>The defendant contends that the judge erred in failing to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter despite several requests that he do so. \u201cInvoluntary manslaughter is an unlawful homicide unintentionally caused by an act which constitutes such a disregard of probable harmful consequences to another as to amount to wanton or reckless conduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>390 Mass. 144, 150 (1983), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanderpool, </em>367 Mass. 743, 747 (1975). Here, the defendant contends that he did not intend the shooting and that the homicide occurred accidentally because when the victim grabbed the gun, he \u201creflexively\u201d pulled the trigger several times. Thus, he contends that the jury should have been given an instruction on involuntary manslaughter. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">There was uncontradicted evidence that the defendant entered the dwelling house of another, carrying a loaded gun, with the intent to commit a robbery. Based on these circumstances, which were known to the defendant, \u201ca reasonably prudent person would have known that according to common experience there was a plain and strong likelihood that death would follow the contemplated act.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 100-101 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>399 Mass. 469, 470 n.l (1987). The evidence, if believed, required a finding of malice because the threat of death was inherent.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In addition, the defendant\u2019s argument entirely overlooks his conviction on a felony-murder theory based on the predicate felony of armed assault in a dwelling. \u201cWhere the felony-murder rule applies, generally the defendant is not entitled to an instruction on manslaughter.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>390 Mass. 144, 151 (1983). Overwhelming evidence, including the defendant\u2019s own statements, supported conviction on the underlying felony. The defendant entered the apartment brandishing a loaded nine millimeter handgun and threatened the occupants with it. When the gun went off killing the victim, the defendant was involved in the commission of a felony that, by its very nature, is \u201cinherently dangerous to human life.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Claudio, </em>418 Mass. 103, 108 (1994) (armed burglary in dwelling with assault therein, under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 14, is inherently dangerous felony and supported conviction for felony-murder). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hooks, </em>375 Mass. 284, 291-292 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>(1978) (armed assault in dwelling under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18A, supported conviction for felony-murder).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Factually speaking, the defendant\u2019s case is hardly distinguishable on this issue from <em>Evans, supra, </em>on this issue. There, the defendant claimed that the accidental discharge of his gun during a struggle with his robbery victim, who was killed as a result, entitled him to an involuntary manslaughter instruction during his trial for felony-murder. <em>Id. </em>at 150. We rejected that contention, concluding that the pistol\u2019s accidental discharge was \u201cof no consequence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 152, where the victim was killed during the defendant\u2019s commission of a robbery while armed with a gun. <em>Id. </em>at 151. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lussier, </em>333 Mass. 83, 92-93 (1955) (no manslaughter charge required in felony-murder case where defendant claimed accidental discharge of his pistol). Here, in <em>Evans, supra </em>at 152, there was no credible evidence \u201cthat the killing did <em>not </em>take place in the course of an inherently dangerous felony\u201d (emphasis added). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">3. <em>Relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>The defendant requests a reduction in, or vacation of, the murder verdict because he \u201chad a minimal [criminal] record at the time of his arrest,\u201d and because the police misconduct of using deceit to elicit statements from him should not go unnoticed or unsanctioned. We have reviewed the entire record on both the law and the facts, see G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, but see no basis for relief. All of the convictions, in our opinion, are more than amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">As to the police officers\u2019 use of a deception or ruse on the defendant, we reemphasize our strong disapproval of such tactics. Any use by police of trickery, misinformation or the like while questioning suspects will continue to play a prominent role in our assessment whether resulting admissions or confessions were voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\"><em> Commonwealth, </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>420 Mass. 656 (1995), was an interlocutory appeal presented by this defendant seeking suppression of incriminating statements that he claimed were elicited from him as a result of false information concocted by the interrogating police officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-9\">The police officers told the defendant, who was in custody at the time, that they had found his handprint and his fingerprints at the crime scene when, in fact, they had not.
