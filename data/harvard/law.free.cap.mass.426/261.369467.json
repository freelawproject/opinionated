L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 (wiretap statute). We transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion. The plaintiffs argue that the motion judge erred in determining that NYNEX\u2019s secret monitoring and recording of calls from NYNEX telemarketers to customers fell within the \u201ctelephone equipment\u201d and \u201ccommon carrier\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>exceptions set forth in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99. Because we conclude that the monitoring and recording of calls by NYNEX does fall within the \u201ctelephone equipment\u201d exception to the wiretap statute, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The facts relevant to this appeal are as follows. Between September 1 and November 30, 1995, employees of the NYNEX direct marketing center made telemarketing calls to local NYNEX customers. The purpose of these calls was to offer and sell customers new telephone services such as \u201ccall return\u201d and \u201ccall waiting.\u201d Approximately 4% or 90,000 of these calls were randomly selected and anonymously recorded by a computer system known as \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d NYNEX staff were aware of the company practice of monitoring and recording telemarketing calls for quality control purposes. However, NYNEX customers were not informed before, during, or after, that their conversations may have been recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system retained the recorded conversations for fourteen days. The recordings were reviewed by managers from the NYNEX quality control department, who needed a special code to access the recordings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After fourteen days, the \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system automatically deleted the calls unless a quality control supervisor specifically instructed it to retain the call. If so instructed, \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d would retain a call for an additional sixty days for further review by the quality control department. The \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system recorded the entire conversation between NYNEX telemarketing employees and customers. However, it did not make a special note of the customer\u2019s name or telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">NYNEX stopped using the \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system on November 30, 1995. On December 1, 1995, the plaintiffs filed this action in the Superior Court alleging that the secret eavesdropping violated their rights of privacy and was explicitly prohibited by the wiretap statute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99. The plaintiffs are NYNEX customers who received telemarketing calls during the three-month period the \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system was in use. However, the plaintiffs do not know specifically whether their conversations with NYNEX telemarketers were recorded. NYNEX acknowledges that they have no method to recover the names of those whose conversations were recorded by the \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>The Massachusetts wiretap statute prohibits the secret use of intercepting devices by private individuals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99. An \u201cintercepting device\u201d is defined as \u201cany device or apparatus which is capable of transmitting, receiving, amplifying or recording a wire or oral communication . . . <em>[other than </em>telephone equipment] being used by a communications common carrier in the ordinary course of its business\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Under \u00a7 99 D of the wiretap statute, certain types of interceptions of wire or oral communications are permitted. Relevant to this case, the statute explicitly permits employees of communication common carriers who are \u201cengaged in any activity which is a necessary incident to the rendition of service\u201d to randomly monitor communications for mechanical or service quality control checks.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 D 1 a.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">NYNEX filed a motion to dismiss or in the alternative a motion for summary judgment on January 12, 1996. The judge ruled that NYNEX\u2019s \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system was excluded from the statutory definition of \u201cintercepting device\u201d because it was \u201ctelephone equipment\u201d used \u201cin the ordinary course of business\u201d and therefore within the statutory exception contained in the definition. Moreover, the judge determined that, even if the \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system were an intercepting device, that NYN-EX\u2019s activities were exempted from the statute because, as a communications common carrier, NYNEX was permitted to engage in random monitoring of calls for mechanical or service quality control checks. Thus, the judge granted NYNEX\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>with [supporting] affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. R 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974); <em>MacLean </em>v. <em>Delinsky, </em>407 Mass. 869, 874 (1990). There is no disputed issue of material fact here. The only controversy concerns the proper application of the wiretap statute to the undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The plaintiffs contend that NYNEX\u2019s secret monitoring and recording of its telemarketers\u2019 calls to customers was not excused by the \u201ctelephone equipment\u201d exception of the Massachusetts wiretap statute. They assert that the intercepting device NYNEX used in recording the calls was not \u201ctelephone equipment\u201d within the meaning of the statute, and that the intercepting device was not used by NYNEX \u201cin the ordinary course of its business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">To determine whether the \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system was \u201ctelephone equipment,\u201d used by NYNEX in the \u201cordinary course of business,\u201d it is instructive to look at Federal case law interpreting the cognate provisions under the Federal wiretap statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, when applying Federal case law to the interpretation of the Massachusetts wiretap statute, we must be mindful that the Massachusetts statute must be at least as protective of individual rights as the Federal statute. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKinnon, </em>721 F.2d 19 (1st Cir. 1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>367 Mass. 224, 247 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">To come within the definition of \u201ctelephone equipment,\u201d the device must be used or supplied by the telephone company in the ordinary course of its business. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Poulos, </em>11 F.3d 271, 280 (1st Cir. 1993) (system consisting of \u201calligator clips attached to a microphone cable at one end\u201d and an \u201cinterface connecting [a] microphone cable to a [video cassette recorder] and a video camera\u201d on the other is not \u201ctelephone equipment\u201d); <em>Epps </em>v. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Hosp. of Athens, Inc., </em>802 F.2d 412, 415-416 (11th Cir. 1986) (dispatch console installed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>telephone company considered \u201ctelephone equipment\u201d); <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Robert Bosch Corp., </em>38 F.3d 736, 740-741 (4th Cir. 1994) (voice logger system purchased and installed by employer was not \u201ctelephone equipment\u201d); <em>James </em>v. <em>Newspaper Agency Corp., </em>591 F.2d 579, 581 (10th Cir. 1979) (monitoring device installed by telephone company implicitly considered \u201ctelephone equipment\u201d). In <em>Sanders, </em>a corporation purchased a voice logger system and covertly taped the telephone conversations of its guards. The court determined that the voice logger was not \u201ctelephone equipment\u201d within the meaning of the Federal wiretap statute because the telephone company did not supply the voice logger to Bosch in the ordinary course of its business. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">If the device is connected directly to the phone line it is more likely to be \u201ctelephone equipment\u201d within the meaning of the wiretap statute. See <em>Deal </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>980 F.2d 1153, 1157 (8th Cir. 1992). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Todisco, </em>363 Mass. 445, 452 (1973) (\u201ctelephone equipment\u201d does not include eavesdropping devices external and extraneous to regular telephone devices). In <em>Deal, </em>employers purchased a recording device from a retail store and installed it on a telephone extension. They recorded approximately twenty-two hours of conversations between an employee and her boy friend without informing either of them of the recordings. The court concluded that the recording device was not telephone equipment within the meaning of the exception because it was not purchased from the telephone company; and it was connected to an extension phone, not directly to the telephone line. <em>Id. </em>at 1157-1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system utilized by NYNEX is \u201ctelephone equipment\u201d within the meaning of the Massachusetts wiretap statute, because unlike the \u201cvoice logger\u201d in <em>Sanders, </em>the system was designed for and used by the telephone company randomly to monitor and record telephone conversations in the ordinary course of its business to manage the quality of services it provided to its customers. <em>Sanders, supra </em>at 740-741. Moreover, unlike <em>Deal, </em>where the employers purchased the recorder from a retail store and connected it to an extra telephone line, the \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system was designed to operate with telephone lines and had no function outside of its application to telephone lines. <em>Deal, supra </em>at 1157. Finally, the fact that the official product description of the \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system described it as \u201ca call center management tool that automates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>performance monitoring\u201d indicates further that the system was meant to be used by communications carriers in the ordinary course of their business.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Having determined that the. \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system is \u201ctelephone equipment,\u201d the next question we must answer is whether NYNEX was using the system to intercept calls \u201cwithin the ordinary course of business.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99. Most cases that have discussed whether an interception is \u201cwithin the ordinary course of business\u201d involved situations where an employer was monitoring employee conversations. See, e.g., <em>Crosland </em>v. <em>Horgan, </em>401 Mass. 271, 274 (1987); <em>James </em>v. <em>Newspaper Agency Corp., </em>591 F.2d 579, 581 (10th Cir. 1979); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harpel, </em>493 F.2d 346, 351 (10th Cir. 1974); <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Douglas Cable Communications, </em>929 F. Supp. 1362, 1379-1380 (D. Kan. 1996). From those cases, the general rule is that monitoring business calls is legal, but eavesdropping on private calls is illegal unless there \u201cis a legitimate business purpose\u201d for the employer to monitor an employee\u2019s conversation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">An employer may monitor by extension phone an employee\u2019s business-related calls as long as the employer offers a legitimate business reason that justifies such monitoring. <em>See Ali, supra </em>at 1380; <em>James, supra </em>at 581; <em>Sanders, supra </em>at 741 (no legitimate business reason where company had no reason to expect \u201cbomb threats\u201d); <em>Deal, supra </em>at 1158 (monitoring not within boundaries of the ordinary course of business when employer\u2019s suspicions did not justify the extent of intrusion); <em>Crosland, supra </em>at 271-272 (plaintiff argued that it is not within employer-hospital\u2019s ordinary course of business to investigate criminal activities such as bomb threats; however, court held that it was in ordinary course of business for hospital to protect its patients). In <em>James, </em>interceptions were made \u201cin the ordinary course of business\u201d when an employer had the telephone company install a monitoring and recording device on the business line, so that a manager could monitor business calls made by employees to address \u201cthe concern by management over abusive language used by irate customers when called upon to pay their bills, coupled with the possible need to give further training and supervision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>to employees dealing with the public.\u201d <em>James, supra </em>at 581. In reaching this conclusion, the <em>James </em>court noted that the employees mating the calls to customers were aware that their calls were monitored.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Although the <em>James </em>and <em>Ali </em>cases dealt primarily with extension monitoring by supervisors, the practice of recording employees\u2019 conversations with customers was determined to be within the bounds of accepted business practice in <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>American Air Filter Co., </em>630 F.2d 414, 418 (5th Cir., 1980). Even though it may be more difficult to justify recording the customer\u2019s responses, it would be extremely difficult for a business to gauge the performance of its employees without hearing both sides of the conversation. In addressing the plaintiffs\u2019 privacy concerns, we note that the intrusion was minimal. Access to the recordings was strictly limited to quality management supervisors; the \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system automatically erased the recordings after fourteen days unless otherwise instructed; the recordings were anonymous; and the conversations were limited to those necessary for NYNEX training and supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">NYNEX had a legitimate business interest in managing and monitoring the quality of telephone calls made by their telemarketers to NYNEX customers. NYNEX\u2019s interest in ensuring that the telephone calls made complied with the guidelines imposed by the telecommunications statutes (G. L. c. 166, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq.), coupled with the possible need to give further training and supervision to employees dealing with the public, supports this proposition. See <em>James, supra </em>at 581. We conclude that NYNEX used the \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system within the ordinary course of its business. Consequently, the \u201ctelephone equipment\u201d exception applies to NYNEX\u2019s activities as a matter of law, and their motion for summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Because we have decided that the \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system falls within the \u201ctelephone equipment\u201d exception of the wiretap statute, we need not decide whether the \u201ccommon carrier\u201d exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Pior to installation of the \u201cAutoQuality!\u201d system, quality control supervisors would randomly monitor conversations between telemarketers and NYNEX customers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\">In addition, the use of intercepting devices by law enforcement officers is subject to strict judicial oversight. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Vitello, 367 Mass. 224, 244 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b283-9\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 99 D 1 a, states that \u201c[i]t shall not be a violation of [the wiretap statute], for an operator of a switchboard, or an officer, employee, or agent of any communication common carrier, whose facilities are used in the transmission of a wire communication, to intercept, disclose, or use that communication in the normal course of his employment while engaged in any activity which is a <em>necessary </em>incident to the rendition of service or to the protection of the rights or property of the carrier of such communication . . . provided, that said communication common carriers shall not utilize service observing or random monitoring <em>except for mechanical or service quality control checks\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The Massachusetts wiretap statute \u201cin major portion matches section for section the provisions of [the Federal statute regulating interception of wire and oral communications].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>367 Mass. 224, 251 (1975). Because the Massachusetts Legislature adopted the language of the Federal statute regulating the interception of wire and oral communications, we shall construe the Massachusetts statute in accordance with the construction given the cognate Federal statute by the Federal courts. See <em>Crosland </em>v. <em>Horgan, </em>401 Mass. 271, 275 (1987); <em>Vasys </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>387 Mass. 51, 54 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\">For example, employers may record private conversations of employees when they suspect that an employee is using the telephone in an unauthorized manner, or engaged in defrauding the employer. See <em>Deal </em>v. Spears, 980 F.2d 1153, 1158 (8th Cir. 1992) (employee suspected of burglarizing store and of making unauthorized personal calls from employer\u2019s telephone).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\">The <em>Ali </em>court agreed with the conclusion reached in <em>James, </em>but held that employee\u2019s personal calls may not be legally monitored unless the employer has disclosed it to the employee. <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Douglas Cable Communications, </em>929 F.
