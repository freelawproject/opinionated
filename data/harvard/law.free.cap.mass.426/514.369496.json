L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 204 and 205, preclude in camera review of \u201cincident reports\u201d by a trial judge to determine whether the medical peer review committee privilege of \u00a7 204 applies. We hold that in camera review is not appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">On July 22, 1993, Stanley W. Howard (Howard), a psychiatric patient at New England Deaconess Hospital (Deaconess), broke away from an escort as he was being transported between buildings and jumped to his death from the fifth floor of the hospital parking garage, landing on John F. Carr. Carr filed suit against Marjorie A. Howard, the administratrix of Howard\u2019s estate. The administratrix then filed a third-party suit against Deaconess and others seeking contribution toward any judgment rendered in favor of Carr, and for wrongful death, alleging negligence in the care of Howard.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-16\">On September 30, 1996, Carr served a subpoena on Deaconess seeking records related to Howard\u2019s condition or care, including any \u201cincident/deviation/unusual occurrence report, prepared by the New England Deaconess Hospital, its agents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>servants, employees or staff.\u201d Deaconess refused to produce such documents on the ground that they were privileged under G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 204 and 205, as necessary to the work of a medical peer review committee. Carr moved in the Superior Court to compel Deaconess to produce any incident reports regarding Howard\u2019s death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 16, 1996, Deaconess opposed Carr\u2019s motion and submitted an affidavit of its assistant general counsel, stating that the incident reports in question were necessary to comply with risk management and quality assurance programs established by the board of registration in medicine (board), that these reports were not available from any independent source and were not part of the medical record of a patient, and that the reports were necessary to the work of a medical peer review committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">After a status conference, the judge ordered the incident reports produced for in camera review. Deaconess refused to comply. On February 10, 1997, Deaconess submitted a supplemental memorandum in opposition to Carr\u2019s discovery request and an additional set of affidavits. These included affidavits from the vice-chairman of the medical executive committee and a member of the patient care assessment committee, the director of clinical psychiatry at Deaconess, the program director of the department of psychiatry at Deaconess, and the patient care assessment coordinator at Deaconess. These affidavits stated that incident reports are necessary to the work of the patient care assessment committee and that in camera review would negatively affect the functioning of the medical peer review process at Deaconess. The affidavits also provided a complete description of the peer review process. In addition, Deaconess submitted its bylaws, rules, and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">On February 27, 1997, a Superior Court judge entered a written order again directing Deaconess to produce the documents for in camera review. Pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par., Deaconess then sought interlocutory review before a single justice of the Appeals Court. The single justice denied the hospital\u2019s petition for relief, writing that determining \u201cwhat is medical peer review committee material ... is something best accomplished in an in-camera examination.\u201d Deaconess sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>review before the single justice of this court. On May 14, 1997, the single justice entered an order reserving and reporting the matter to the full court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The medical profession has historically regulated itself through internal hospital disciplinary proceedings designed to identify and remedy instances of substandard care. See Adler, Stalking the Rogue Physician: An Analysis of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act, 28 Am. Bus. L.J. 683, 696 (1991). In the 1980s, in response to a perceived medical malpractice crisis and doubts about the efficacy of self-regulation by the medical profession, the Federal government and various State legislatures attempted to bolster medical peer review. In 1986, Congress passed the Health Care Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11101-11152 (1994), which required hospitals to consult a national data bank of physicians when considering granting a doctor staff privileges, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11135(a)(1), and to inform the data bank when a doctor\u2019s privileges were suspended.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The HCQIA made records reported to the Federal data bank confidential, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11137(b), and granted immunity to participants in the peer review process. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11111(a)(1) (providing that professional review bodies and persons participating therein \u201cshall not be liable in damages under any law of the United States or of any State with respect to the action,\u201d except the Federal Civil Rights Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The HCQIA made confidential only those documents actually submitted to the national data bank. As there is no claim under the Federal statute, the matter must be resolved under State law. Although Massachusetts provided no common law privilege for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>materials submitted to or produced by a medical peer review committee, see <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>Strayer, </em>392 Mass. 525 (1984), in 1986 the Legislature enacted St. 1986, c. 351 (Chapter 351), to provide a measure of confidentiality to the work of medical peer review committees. Chapter 351, \u00a7 9, requires, as a condition of licensure, that hospitals participate in \u201crisk management programs\u201d to review past performance and prevent future harm to patients. See G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 203 <em>(d). </em>To promote candor and confidentiality in the review process, G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 204 <em>(a), </em>provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">\u201c[T]he proceedings, reports and records of a medical peer review committee shall be confidential and shall not be subject to subpoena or discovery, or introduced into evidence, in any judicial or administrative proceeding</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Today, almost every State has enacted a similar statutory privilege to protect the work of medical peer review committees. See Comment, The Medical Review Committee Privilege: A Jurisdictional Survey, 67 N.C. L. Rev. 179, 179 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Pursuant to Chapter 351, the board of registration in medicine promulgated regulations, effective July 24, 1987, establishing guidelines for a qualified patient care assessment program (QP-CAP) t\u00f3 be implemented by hospitals. See 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.02 (1987). Incident reporting is one of the core components of the board\u2019s QPCAP regulations. See 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 3.07 and 3.08 (1987). Hospitals must establish internal procedures for reporting \u201cinjuries and incidents\u201d to their patient care assessment coordinator in order to trigger the peer review process, 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.07 (3)(a), and a system for reporting \u201cmajor incidents\u201d directly to the board. 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.08. In addition, the regulations state that \u201cinformation and records both <em>generated pursuant to </em>[the regulations] <em>and which relate to </em>the functions of a \u2018Medical Peer Review Committee\u2019 (as defined by M.G.L. c. Ill, \u00a7 1), are . . . deemed confidential\u201d (emphasis added). 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.04 (1) (1987). In 1987, this court upheld these incident reporting regulations in <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>401 Mass. 172, 177-178 (1987). Regarding both internal and \u201cmajor\u201d incident reporting we stated that \u201cthe board\u2019s determination that the . . . reporting required by the regulation is a <em>necessary </em>component of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>QPCAP ... is reasonable\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 177. See <em>id. </em>at 178. The <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>case then held that the board could not invade \u00a7 204 (a)\u2019s privilege for \u201cproceedings, reports and records\u201d by requiring hospitals to permit the board to \u201caccess and audit\u201d QPCAP information and records. See <em>id. </em>at 179-181 (limiting 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.07 [3][k]). The court noted, however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201cBoard access to all other information generated by the QPCAP system in no way would violate the PRC [peer review committee] privilege and is within the board\u2019s authority .... Thus, the hospitals should make available to the board all <em>incident reports, </em>patient complaints, employee training materials, credentialing items, Patient Care Assessment Coordinator reports, and other items they are charged with generating .... It is only where the board seeks PRC \u2018proceedings, reports and records\u2019 that \u00a7 204\u2019s PRC privilege stands in the way. Section 204 promotes the uninhibited expression of professional opinions before a PRC and protects the PRC\u2019s <em>work product. </em>Section 204 does not protect information generated by other components of the QPCAP system or the \u2018raw materials\u2019 relied on by a PRC if obtained from other sources.\u201d (Emphasis added. Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 183. The court thus articulated clearly that G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 204, as it then stood, did not shield documents produced in the QPCAP system unless they were specifically related to or a product of a peer review committee. The <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>case also cast doubt on whether risk management activities conducted by a medical peer review committee would be protected by the privilege of \u00a7 204 <em>(a), id. </em>at 175 n.7, and whether a patient care assessment coordinator could designate that QPCAP documents fell within the privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 183 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Anticipating the problem of how best to protect QPCAP documents and records that might fall outside the scope of the \u00a7 204 (o) privilege, for almost one year prior to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Beth Israel, </em>the Legislature had considered extending that privilege. Prior to <em>Beth Israel, </em>each proposed bill contained language that essentially tracked the board\u2019s regulations regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>ing confidentiality.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 1987 Senate Doc. No. 2093, for example, submitted on November 12, 1987, provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">\u201cInformation and records <em>generated pursuant to </em>risk management and quality assurance programs established by the board of registration in medicine <em>which also relate to the functions </em>of a medical peer review committee' shall be deemed to be proceedings, reports or records of a medical peer review committee for purposes of section two hundred and four of [c. Ill] and may be so designated by the patient care assessment coordinator; provided, however, that such information and records so designated by the patient care assessment coordinator may be inspected, maintained and utilized by the board .... Such information and records inspected, maintained or utilized by the board . . . shall remain confidential and not subject to subpoena, discovery or introduction into evidence . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Only twenty-three days after the <em>Beth Israel </em>decision, however, the Governor signed St. 1987, c. 579, which contained amended language quite different from 1987 Senate Doc. No. 2093. As enacted, St. 1987, c. 579, created G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 205, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\u201cInformation and records <em>which are necessary </em>to comply with risk management and quality assurance programs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>established by the board of registration in medicine and <em>which are necessary </em>to the <em>work product </em>of medical peer review committees, <em>including incident reports required to be furnished to the board of registration in medicine, </em>shall be deemed to be proceedings, reports or records of a medical peer review committee for purposes of [G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 204] and may be so designated by the patient care assessment coordinator .... In no event, however, shall . . . incident reports or records or information which are not necessary to comply with risk management and quality assurance programs established by the board of registration in medicine be deemed to be proceedings, reports or records of a medical peer review committee . . .\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Section 205 <em>(b) </em>supplements \u00a7 204 (a) by statutorily designating certain \u201cinformation and records\u201d <em>not </em>obviously \u201cof a medical peer review committee\u201d (under the language of \u00a7 204 [a]) <em>as </em>\u201cproceedings, reports or records\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 204 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The final statute as enacted differs in five important ways from its immediate predecessor, 1987 Senate Doc. No. 2093. As these five amendments guide our interpretation of \u00a7 205, we set them out in detail. First, the Legislature changed the \u201cgenerated pursuant to\u201d and \u201calso relate to\u201d language of 1987 Senate Doc. No. 2093 to the \u201cwhich are necessary\u201d language of \u00a7 205 (\u00a3&gt;). This suggests that the Legislature intended to narrow the scope of the provision from what it, and the board\u2019s regulations, 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.04(1), had previously considered appropriate. This change tracked language used in our decision in <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 177-178 (stating that incident reporting is a \u201cnecessary component\u201d of the board\u2019s peer review regulations). Second, the Legislature changed the second clause of the first sentence of \u00a7 205 <em>(b) </em>from related to the \u201cfunctions\u201d of a peer review committee to necessary to the \u201cwork product\u201d of medical peer review committees. This change similarly borrowed language first applied to this context in our decision in <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 183 (\u201c[s]ection 204 promotes the uninhibited expression of professional opinions before a PRC and protects the PRC\u2019s work product\u201d). Third, the Legislature adopted the plural form \u201ccommittees\u201d in \u00a7 205 <em>(b) </em>(\u201cnecessary to the work product of medical peer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>review committees\u201d) rather than maintaining the singular form it had previously employed in 1987 Senate Doc. No. 2093 and in the enacted provisions of \u00a7 204. See discussion, <em>infra. </em>Fourth, the Legislature inserted \u201cincluding incident reports required to be furnished to the board of registration in medicine\u201d as a specific example of records that are \u201cnecessary to\u201d comply with risk management programs and necessary to the work product of peer review committees. G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 205 <em>(b). </em>Fifth, the Legislature added a new final sentence to \u00a7 205 <em>(b) </em>that had not existed in previous, drafts: \u201cIn no event . . . shall . . . <em>incident reports or records or information </em>which are not necessary to comply with risk management and quality assurance programs established by the [board] be deemed to be proceedings, reports or records of a medical peer review committee under this section . . .\u201d (emphasis added). Unlike the first sentence of \u00a7 205 <em>(b), </em>which merely states that <em>\u201cinformation and </em>records\u201d which are necessary to those regulations are protected, this last clause inserts <em>\u201cincident </em>reports\u201d in addition to \u201cinformation and records.\u201d This provision clarifies that the Legislature assumed that <em>some </em>incident reports generated by a hospital are <em>not </em>necessary to comply with the board\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">We begin our analysis with the two general requirements of \u00a7 205 (6).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A party asserting a privilege under its provisions must produce evidence tending to show (1) that the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>and records sought are \u201cnecessary to comply\u201d with risk management and quality assurance programs established by the board,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (2) that the information and records \u201care necessary to the work product\u201d of \u201cmedical peer review committees.\u201d G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 205 <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">We first ask whether incident reports are \u201cnecessary to comply with risk management and quality assurance programs established by the board of registration in medicine.\u201d G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 205. Two kinds of incident reports are mandated by the board\u2019s regulations: \u201crequired internal incident reports,\u201d which pertain to less serious incidents, 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.07 (3)(b), and \u201creportable major incidents,\u201d 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.08 (3).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The regulations define \u201cCategory I Major Incidents\u201d as those involving maternal deaths related to delivery, fetal deaths, chronic vegetative state resulting from medical intervention, or death in the course of or resulting from ambulatory surgical care. 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.08 (2)(a). The regulations define \u201cCategory II Major Incidents\u201d as \u201cmajor or permanent impairments of bodily functions or deaths that are not ordinarily expected as foreseeable results of the patient\u2019s condition or of appropriately selected and administered treatment.\u201d 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.08 (2)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In the <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>case, we stated that 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 3.07 and 3.08 make required internal incident reports and major incident reports \u201ca <em>necessary </em>component\u201d of a risk management program. See <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 177-178. As a general proposition, \u201c[t]he Legislature must be assumed to know the preexisting law and the decisions of this court.\u201d <em>Gillette Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>425 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>670, 677 (1997), quoting <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>324 Mass. 309, 313 (1949). Here the inference that the Legislature was aware of the <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>decision is strengthened by the fact that only weeks after the court\u2019s decision, the Legislature abandoned language that various versions of the proposed statute had incorporated for'almost a year and adopted language used by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">We thus assume that <em>as to incident reports </em>the Legislature intended \u201cnecessary to comply with risk management and quality assurance programs established by the board of registration in medicine\u201d to mean required by 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.07 or \u00a7 3.08.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We note, however, that the Legislature clearly contemplated that some incident reports will <em>not </em>meet this requirement; the final sentence to \u00a7 205 <em>(b) </em>specifically indicates that a class of incident reports exists that is <em>not </em>necessary to comply with the board\u2019s regulations and should <em>not </em>be protected. G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 205 <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">We next turn to the second requirement of \u00a7 205 <em>(b) </em>that the records sought be \u201cnecessary to the work product\u201d of a peer review committee. Carr asserts that we should read \u201cnecessary\u201d in \u00a7 205 <em>(b) </em>narrowly to mean \u201cof an inevitable nature, logically unavoidable, absolutely needed, or required.\u201d Under that definition, Carr claims that the incident reports in question are not \u201cnecessary\u201d to a peer review committee\u2019s work because a committee could evaluate the incident in question based on oral testimony rather than the written reports. Deaconess argues that the reports <em>are </em>\u201cnecessary to. the work product\u201d of medical peer review committees because they trigger the work of such committees.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">As Chief Justice Marshall held long ago, to read \u201cnecessary\u201d to mean \u201cabsolutely indispensable\u201d goes too far. See <em>McCulloch </em>v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 413-414 (1819) (\u201cDoes [necessary] always import an absolute physical necessity, so strong, that one thing, to which another may be termed necessary, cannot exist without that other? We think it does not .... A thing may be necessary, very necessary, absolutely or indispensably necessary. To no mind would the same idea be conveyed, by these several phrases\u201d). Although perhaps a peer review committee could find alternative means of securing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>information contained in incident reports, the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cnecessary\u201d does not require such a stringent showing as a condition of invoking the peer review privilege. The statutory and regulatory schemes as enacted mandate the creation of incident reports as an integral part of the peer review process. See G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 203 (a) (requiring \u201creporting\u201d of substandard care incidents); 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 3.07 and 3.08 (requiring the creation and review of incident reports). Under the peer review system created by the Legislature, established by the board, and described by this court in the <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>opinion, incident reports are a core component of peer review, they begin the peer review process, and they are necessary to a committee\u2019s work product.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Moreover, in this provision of \u00a7 205 (b), the Legislature adopted the plural form \u201ccommittees\u201d rather than use the singular form as in other sections. We infer that the use of the plural \u201ccommittees\u201d expresses the Legislature\u2019s intent to relieve a defendant from showing that a particular record or report was submitted to and was used by a specific hospital committee. Instead, a hospital need only show that the information at issue is of a <em>type </em>that is generally used by such \u201ccommittees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Finally, we note that <em>some </em>incident reports are <em>expressly </em>privileged by \u00a7 205 (bys protection for \u201cincident reports required to be furnished to the board of registration in medicine.\u201d G. L. c.

Our review of the case law in other States<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> convinces us that clear guidance is necessary to prevent lower courts from taking divergent approaches to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Carr contends that \u00a7\u00a7 204 and 205 pose no barrier to in camera review of incident reports or other hospital materials. Deaconess argues that \u00a7\u00a7 204 and 205 create an absolute privilege that bars <em>any </em>disclosure, including in camera review. It urges the court to determine whether a document is privileged under \u00a7 204 by examining the <em>purpose </em>for and the <em>process </em>by which it was created, not the content that it contains. Deaconess claims that incident reports are not compiled in the regular course of business and are not part of a patient\u2019s regular medical record. Instead, Deaconess maintains that these reports are generated <em>solely </em>for the purposes of peer review, and that in camera review would be of no help to a judge in determining whether a given document is privileged under \u00a7\u00a7 204 and 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Various courts of other States have recognized that in some circumstances a trial court has the authority to compel in camera review to determine whether documents are privileged under a peer review statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> For example, in <em>State ex rel. Grandview Hosp. &amp; Medical Ctr. </em>v. <em>Gorman, </em>51 Ohio St. 3d 94, 95-96</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">-:__ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>(1990) (per curiam) (permitting in camera review under Ohio\u2019s peer review statute, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 2305.251), the Supreme Court of Ohio held that in camera review was \u201conly a minimal first step\u201d in the discovery process with few negative consequences for the confidentiality afforded by Ohio\u2019s peer review statute. <em>Id. </em>at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Although in camera review is a lesser intrusion on a hospital\u2019s confidentiality than full disclosure, we do not consider its effects \u201cminimal.\u201d In camera review necessarily involves an invasion and dilution of a statutory privilege. Although the scope of civil discovery is broad, it is .not unlimited. Rule 26 (b)(1) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, states in relevant part that \u201c[pjarties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, <em>not privileged, </em>which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action . . .\u201d (emphasis added). 365 Mass. 773 (1974). Plaintiffs must not be permitted to disregard the policies embedded in the strong legislated protections of G. L. c. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 204 and 205.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although generally \u201c[t]he conduct and scope of discovery is within the sound discretion of the judge,\u201d <em>Judge Rotenberg Educ. Ctr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Retardation, (No. 1), </em>424 Mass. 430, 461-462 (1997), quoting <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., KG, </em>399 Mass. 790, 799 (1987), a protec. five order that violates the provisions of a statutorily enacted privilege would be an abuse of discretion. A court \u201cis not at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>liberty to substitute its judgment for that of the Legislature by expanding on a statutorily defined . . . privilege.\u201d <em>Petition of Catholic Charitable Bur. of the Archdiocese of Boston, Inc., to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>392 Mass. 738, 742 (1984).

Courts should first examine a discovery request to determine whether on its face it seeks information clearly within the scope of G. L. c. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 204 and 205. Where interrogatories or the face of a motion to compel demonstrate that the records sought are within the scope of the statutory privilege, no in camera review should be granted. See <em>Mt. Diablo Hosp. Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>183 Cal. App. 3d 30, 35 (1986) (holding that in camera review of the minutes of a protected committee\u2019s meeting was unnecessary); <em>Santa Rosa Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>174 Cal. App. 3d 711, 727 (1985) (\u201c[cjertain types of information are so clearly within the exclusive sphere of a protected medical staff committee \u2014 such as, for example, the . . . committee\u2019s self-generated analysis of the adequacy of work performed . . . \u2014 that [the statutory privilege of] section 1157 can be found applicable without extensive judicial inquiry\u201d); Stephens <em>vs. </em>Coith, U.S. Dist. Ct. No. C-l-89-0104 (S.D. Ohio, Aug. 31, 1990) (no in camera review where face of a discovery request shows that the documents are protected).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">If the face of a discovery request leaves doubt, the court should then consider the evidence proffered by the party asserting the privilege. Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 26 (c), as amended, 423 Mass. 1401 (1996), requires that a party seeking a protective order make a showing of good cause for limiting the scope of discovery. See 8 C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2035, at 264-265 (1970). Where evidence of the way in which a given record was produced or how it was used demonstrates that the information sought is privileged, a court should refrain from in camera inspection, particularly if the party seeking the allegedly privileged materials offers no reason to doubt a hospital\u2019s sworn</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>statements.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Arlington Memorial Hosp.

App. 761, 769 (1988) (holding that \u201c[i]n determining whether the information or record is privileged, the court should consider the hospital\u2019s bylaws, internal rules and regulations and ... the committee\u2019s function\u201d). Moreover, in this context, uncontradicted affidavits should be taken as true. <em>See A.R. </em>v. <em>C.R., </em>411 Mass. 570, 577 (1992); <em>Farley </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>374 Mass. 419, 425 (1978); <em>Flannery </em>v. <em>Lin, supra </em>at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">This accords with our decisions in other areas, where we have held that if in camera review serves no useful purpose, it should be avoided. See, e.g., <em>Bays </em>v. <em>Theran, </em>418 Mass. 685, 693 (1994) (finding no error where a trial judge refused to conduct in camera proceedings to determine whether confidential attorney-client information had been revealed in a communication, and holding that the judge\u2019s inquiry into the \u201cnature, topics, and extent of the communications\u201d was sufficient where inquiry into the specifics of their content \u201cwould not have been helpful\u201d); <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, </em>371 Mass. 59, 65-66 (1976) (holding that in camera review of police records is unnecessary where oral testimony regarding the documents offered sufficient proof that they were of the type protected by statute).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collett, </em>387 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Mass. 424, 438-439 (1982) (noting that in camera review is warranted where \u201cit is a practical necessity because the determination of whether the exception [for the psychotherapist privilege] applies can be made only when the content of the communication is disclosed\u201d). Determining whether the medical peer review privilege applies turns on the way in which a document was created and the purpose for which it was used, not on its content. Examining that content in camera will therefore do little to aid a judge in applying \u00a7\u00a7 204 and 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">On the facts presented, in camera review is not warranted in this case. Deaconess has produced sufficient evidence to show that the three incident reports in question meet the two requirements of \u00a7 205 (6).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Deaconess submitted four affidavits stating that incident reports generally are necessary to comply with the board\u2019s regulations, and one affidavit specifically swearing that the incident reports made in connection with the death of Howard were necessary in this sense. Although Deaconess could have submitted evidence showing more specifically that these incident reports are \u201crequired internal incident reports\u201d under the board\u2019s regulations, 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.07, we take its submitted affidavit as true. Carr has provided no contradictory evidence to show that these three incident reports are <em>not </em>mandated by the board\u2019s regulations, and, given the severity of the incident in question and the broad scope of 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.07, it seems that the reporting here was \u201cnecessary to comply\u201d with 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 3.01 et seq.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Second, the affidavits submitted by Deaconess state clearly that incident reports are necessary to the work product of the hospital\u2019s peer review committees. Such reports begin the peer review process and provide committees with the information needed to investigate and review incidents of sub-standard health care. They are the \u201cfoundation\u201d of a committee\u2019s work. There had been a patient death in unusual circumstances and Carr\u2019s injury. The incident reports were the reports of persons whom the hospital, through its bylaws, reasonably considered would best be able to enlighten its peer review committee as to what actually happened. It is hard to imagine how the hospital could discharge its obligations under the board\u2019s regulations without undertaking just the kind of inquiry it directed here and which produced these reports. Although none of the hospital\u2019s affidavits specifically avers that these three reports were submitted to such a committee or were used in a committee proceeding, record or report, the hospital need not so prove. Instead, Deaconess only bears the burden of showing that the information it seeks to protect is necessary to peer review committee work product generally. It has done that.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Deaconess has successfully shown that the materials Carr seeks are privileged under G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 204 and 205.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The incident reports in question are necessary to comply with risk management programs of the board of registration in medicine and to the work product of medical peer review committees. There is no reason for in camera review of these documents; the affidavits submitted demonstrate that they are protected by the peer review privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">We recognize that the peer review privilege imposes some hardship on litigants seeking to discover information from hospital records, but the Legislature has clearly chosen to impose that burden on individual litigants in order to improve the medical peer review process generally. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>discovery burden is not unalleviated.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Carr admits that he has access to the names of those who wrote the incident reports at issue, and that he is free to depose those authors in the regular course of discovery about their firsthand knowledge of the events that allegedly led to the death of Howard and the injury of Carr. See <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>American Regent Lab., </em>144 F.R.D. 177, 179 (D. Mass. 1992) (noting that a litigant barred by G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 204, can engage in other forms of discovery to elicit needed information).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">A judgment should be entered in-the county court stating that the order of the Superior Court judge is vacated and that the matter is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\">There are three incident reports at issue in this case: (1) a report authored by the nurse manager at Deaconess, (2) a report by a Deaconess emergency room staff nurse, and (3) a report of the incident prepared by the department of psychiatry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Because this case presents a serious challenge to the Legislature\u2019s statutorily enacted privilege for medical peer review materials, and because of the public interest in the proper application of the statutory framework enacted in G.

Although discovery disputes are generally not appropriate for such review, in this case a single justice has reported this case, indicating that a discretionary exercise of G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, authority is warranted.

This is evidenced by the consistent effort made throughout the evolution of \u00a7 205 to protect peer review materials in the hands of the board.

This principle, however, rests on Federal and State constitutional guarantees of due process that have application in criminal proceedings\u201d).

Although at oral argument Deaconess seemed to suggest that it, in fact, submits <em>all </em>incident reports to the board in its semi-annual reports, nowhere has the hospital shown that it is <em>required </em>to do so. At best, one affidavit states that, \u201cif the incident or unusual occurrence is determined . . . to be reportable to the . . . Board of Registration in Medicine ... a report is then filed in compliance with the appropriate rules and regulations.\u201d This is insufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">As stated above, we do not hold that <em>all </em>incident reports are necessary to comply with the risk management and quality assurance programs established by the board.

Ass\u2019n </em>decision such privilege would preclude their use by the board. This is illogical. The legislative history of \u00a7 205 shows that it was enacted to permit use of these materials by the board without sacrificing the confidentiality provided by \u00a7 204. Moreover, \u00a7 205 <em>(b) </em>specifically grants the board access to such materials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Sections 204 and 205 contain various exceptions for special instances that warrant access to committee materials. See, e.g., G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 204 <em>(Jb) </em>(permitting use of proceedings, reports, findings and records of a peer review committee in an action under G.
