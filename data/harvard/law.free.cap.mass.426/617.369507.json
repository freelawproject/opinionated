We affirm the conviction and decline to exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial or reduce the degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The defendant, Johnson, and the victim, Charles Malone, had been friends until some five months prior to the killing. The rupture came about in October, 1992, when Malone accused Johnson of cheating him in a drug transaction and beat Johnson severely with a baseball bat. Johnson initially reported the assault to the police but eventually told Malone he would not press charges or testify if Malone paid him $3,000. It appears that Malone did give Johnson $1,000, and on the night of the killing they may have had discussions about payment of the balance. A Springfield police officer, Philip Tarpey, testified that prior to the killing Johnson had told him about this arrangement, that he had said he wanted revenge against Malone, that he had said that he should kill Malone but did not want to go to jail, and that he gave the officer information about Malone\u2019s drug organization in order to send Malone to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The killing occurred in the early morning hours of March 13, 1993. Two witnesses who were with Malone just before the killing testified that as they walked toward a bar, Johnson emerged from between two parked cars. The witnesses testified that, when Johnson first confronted Malone as he approached the bar, Johnson said, \u201cHey, Chuckie\u201d (Malone\u2019s nickname), and \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Johnson then raised and pointed a handgun at Malone and pulled the trigger, but the gun did not fire. Malone started backing up, with his hands up. Johnson apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>adjusted the gun and attempted to fire it again. When it failed to fire the second time, Malone turned and ran. Johnson shot him in the back and Malone fell some twenty-five or thirty feet from where the initial encounter had taken place. Johnson went up to him as he lay face up in the street and Malone said, \u201cAll right, George. You got me. Stop. That. . . hurts.\u201d Johnson then stood over him and shot him two more times. Malone kept repeating the words \u201cJ.R.\u201d (Johnson\u2019s nickname) as he lay dying.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">A correction officer testified that he was just arriving at the bar when he heard shots. Before the first shot he heard the assailant say, \u201cRemember me,\u201d and \u201cRemember me, Chuckie.\u201d Then, after the first shot, he saw a man standing over Malone shoot him twice and heard the man say, \u201cYou can\u2019t run. You can\u2019t run now.\u201d The locations of three spent shell casings from a .38 caliber semi-automatic weapon were consistent with this version of the events: one was found near the bar where the defendant fired the first shot and two were found farther up the street near where the victim fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Johnson testified to the beating he had received from Malone, that Malone continued to threaten and harass him, and that he was afraid that Malone would kill him. Officer Tarpey testified that Johnson had sought to obtain a protective order against Malone, and several witnesses testified that after the beating Johnson was terrified and preoccupied with the menace he felt from Malone. Dr. Alan Brown, a psychologist testifying on Johnson\u2019s behalf, gave his opinion that Johnson was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder as a result of the beating. The defendant testified that he went to the bar outside which the encounter took place to attend a family party, even though he knew that Malone and his friends often went there. In the defendant\u2019s version of the events, Malone was outside the bar with some friends as Johnson arrived. He heard Malone say to his friends, \u201cThere go that nigger.\u201d The defendant tried to hide, heard one of Malone\u2019s friends say, \u201cLet\u2019s get him,\u201d and he ran. One of Malone\u2019s friends was behind him and Malone was in front of him. This caused him to panic as he remembered the beating. \u201cI just panicked. That\u2019s when everything happened.\u201d On cross-examination Johnson testified that he shot Malone, who was in front of him but coming toward him. His testimony was that he panicked and shot wildly. He denied remembering speaking any of the words the witnesses attributed to him, nor did he recall walking up to Malone and shooting him as he lay on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>The defendant was convicted on June 27, 1994, and sentenced to life in prison. After the defendant\u2019s appeal was docketed in this court, the defendant filed a petition for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, requesting a stay of proceedings and a remand to the Superior Court for postconviction interviews of certain jurors. A single justice remanded for a hearing on the defendant\u2019s allegations of extraneous influence on the jurors, and a hearing was held on July 23, 1996. Thereafter, the Superior Court judge issued a memorandum of decision on the order of remand, finding that the jurors were impartial and not subjected to extraneous influence. The defendant then pursued his appeal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Given Johnson\u2019s version of the shooting it was important to his defense that the jury receive a favorable instruction on self-defense or at least that they receive an instruction that allowed them to relieve him of full responsibility for the killing, reducing his culpability to that for voluntary manslaughter, on the ground that he was acting in a state of panic induced by the fear that he would again be attacked as he had been some months before.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Johnson complains that the charge regarding self-defense was defective in that it failed to make clear that the prosecution has the burden of showing that the defendant did not act in self-defense. It is undoubtedly true that \u201cwhen the issue of self-defense is properly before the trier of fact, the Commonwealth must, as a matter of due process, prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>370 Mass. 684, 687-688 (1976). The charge defined self-defense correctly, but in defining it the judge did not there state the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof. It would have been better if he had, but the defendant, although he requested an instruction that made this clear, did not object to the charge as given. What the judge did do is explain, in connection with the charge on voluntary manslaughter, that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving that the force used by the defendant in the circumstances was excessive, so that if \u201cthe defendant uses excessive force ... or the defendant himself becomes the attacker or the aggressor . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>then that would constitute manslaughter.\u201d It was precisely the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that Johnson was the attacker or aggressor, and the charge made clear that it was the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove that. Similarly, in defining the elements of murder the judge made clear that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving that the killing was unlawful, and that that meant without lawful excuse or justification \u201cas in the case of self-defense.\u201d Reading the instructions as a whole, as we are bound to do, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beauchamp, </em>424 Mass. 682, 686 (1997), we conclude that there was no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice in this regard. We take into consideration that several witnesses testified that after the initial shot they saw Johnson stand over the victim and fire two more bullets into him, and that the only testimony that supports self-defense in this encounter was the defendant\u2019s own. He does not deny the killing, but only stated that he could not recall committing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">A somewhat more plausible claim is that the defendant acted in the heat of passion and thus that he was guilty of no more than voluntary manslaughter. The judge explained that this lesser charge was an accommodation by the law to \u201cthe frailty of human nature.\u201d The defendant now complains that the charge did not adequately make clear that the Commonwealth has the burden of disproving that the defendant killed in the heat of passion on reasonable provocation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>384 Mass. 396, 405 (1981). But the judge twice stated in his charge that the Commonwealth has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in the heat of passion or on sudden provocation. Once again, the defendant did not object to these instructions, and viewing them as a whole we see nothing approaching a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>394 Mass. 727, 739-740, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Aiello </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>474 U.S. 919 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The jury convicted the defendant of murder in the first degree by reason of deliberate premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty. The defendant raises several challenges to the judge\u2019s charge on malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The defendant first complains that the charge defining malice was defective in that it contained the \u201cframe of mind\u201d language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>we disapproved of in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagles, </em>419 Mass. 825, 836 (1995). As we explained in <em>Eagles, </em>this language is unhelpful because it \u201cmay lead the jury to believe that anger, hatred, revenge or a selfish, wrongful mood is' enough to show malice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As in <em>Eagles, </em>however, here the extraneous frame of mind comments did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>id. </em>at 837. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>422 Mass. 373, 382 (1996) (frame of mind language did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice). The defendant shot the victim three times, twice at close range while the victim lay helpless on the street. There can be little doubt about the defendant\u2019s intent to kill Malone. Given this evidence, and that the judge\u2019s instructions read as a whole explained malice clearly, the use of frame of mind language was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Johnson next argues that the judge\u2019s definition of the third prong of malice referred only to the proof of an act that a reasonably prudent person would have known would cause death to follow, and did not mention that the jury must apply this standard in consideration of \u201cthe nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the circumstances at the time he acted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 389-390 (1995).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Eliminating the subjective component of third prong malice was clear error. <em>Id. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sama, </em>411 Mass. 293, 298 (1991). It was not prejudicial, however. Error in a second or third prong instruction is not prejudicial where the jury convicts by reason of deliberate premeditation, because deliberate premeditation necessarily requires the jury to find a specific intent to kill, which satisfies the first prong of malice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>425 Mass. 765, 768 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>422 Mass. 792, 804-805 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, </em>420 Mass. 433, 437 (1995) (\u201cany error in the instructions on the third prong of malice is irrelevant to a conviction of murder in the first degree on theories of felony-murder and deliberate premeditation\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>414 Mass. 618, 627 (1993). The jury found first prong malice beyond a reasonable doubt and under proper instruction, and therefore we can logically assume that both convictions, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>deliberate premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty, were based on a proper malice determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Moreover, because there was no objection, we ask if there was a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice and, given the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, we conclude that there was not. The defendant shot his victim three times, twice after he had fallen and was lying helpless in the street. There can be no doubt that the defendant subjectively understood that a plain and strong likelihood of death would result from his actions. After initially firing one shot at the victim the defendant took two steps away from Malone and then turned around and walked approximately twenty to thirty feet to where Malone lay wounded. As he stood over the victim, the defendant said, \u201cYou can\u2019t run now,\u201d and fired two additional bullets at close range. Given these facts, there can be no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice in failing to insist that the jury evaluate that action in light of \u201cthe nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the circumstances at the time he acted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, supra </em>at 389-390.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Nor does the complaint that the charge on extreme atrocity or cruelty was unduly vague fare any better. In this case, as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Semedo, </em>422 Mass. 716, 725 (1996), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>416 Mass. 831, 836 (1994), the trial judge instructed the jury to treat the factors from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass. 216, 227 (1983), as merely illustrative and said that \u201cextreme atrocity or cruelty is not limited to cases with this evidence.\u201d We have made it quite clear that this is error, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunter, supra </em>at 836-837, but have also made clear that where the defendant did not object to the charge we will only consider the point if in the circumstances of the case there was a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice on this score. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 30-31 (1996). There was not. The judge\u2019s instructions went on to say that the jury should decide \u201cbased on the factors that I have indicated.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trapp, </em>423 Mass. 356, 361, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1045 (1996). There is no question that the defendant shot the victim three times, twice standing over him as he lay wounded in the street. There was evidence that he fired those last two shots while the victim was expressing pain and pleading for his fife. In view of this evidence, there is no substantial likelihood that the jury did not base their verdict on at least one of the <em>Cunneen </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The defendant makes two arguments regarding the empanel-ling and constitution of the jury. First, he complains that after the original panel of jurors had been sworn and the indictments read, the judge excused two jurors and empanelled three additional jurors: these jurors were sworn and the indictments were again read. Although the defendant\u2019s trial counsel approved of this procedure at trial, his appellate counsel now claims that it was constitutionally defective as violating the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, so much so that even the trial counsel\u2019s specific approval of it will not supply a cure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have approved this procedure, even over a defendant\u2019s objection, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Monahan, 349 Mass. 139, 158-60 (1965), although in that case the indictments had not been read before the additional juror was sworn and a certificate of protracted trial was filed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In a jury trial, jeopardy attaches when a jury are empanelled and sworn. See <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>468 U.S. 317, 325 (1984); <em>Serfass </em>v. <em>United States, </em>420 U.S. 377, 388 (1975); <em>Lovett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>393 Mass. 444, 447 (1984). The double jeopardy clause protects a defendant\u2019s financial and emotional interests in having his trial concluded in a single proceeding, <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 503-504 (1978), as well as his interest in retaining a chosen jury. See <em>Crist </em>v. <em>Bretz, </em>437 U.S. 28, 35 (1978). Here, although the original jury was sworn and seated and the indictments had been read, the empanelling of additional jurors did not violate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>the defendant\u2019s rights. As the United States Supreme Court has said, \u201cthe protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause by its terms applies only if there has been some event, such as an acquittal, which terminates the original jeopardy.\u201d <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 325. As no constitutionally significant event occurred between the time that the judge empanelled the original jurors and the empanelment of alternate jurors the next morning, the original jeopardy was never terminated, and thus the defendant was not twice placed in jeopardy. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Isom, </em>88 F.3d 920, 922 (11th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1325 (1997) (finding no double jeopardy violation where jurors were sworn and seated and then on the following court day the judge empanelled alternate jurors); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Trigg, </em>988 F.2d 1008, 1009-1010 (9th Cir. 1993) (finding no event terminating the original jeopardy in identical circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Although the defendant now urges that the judge could have ordered a mistrial had he felt the need to empanel more than twelve jurors, where jeopardy has attached, mistrial, and the possibility of second jeopardy, must be used cautiously. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steward, </em>396 Mass. 76, 79 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 486 (1981). The defendant not only failed to raise this double jeopardy claim below, despite the judge granting a r\u00e9cess at the prosecution\u2019s request so that the office of the district attorney could investigate whether as a matter of law empanelling the additional jurors was permissible, but also affirmatively <em>approved </em>of the procedure used. When asked \u201cis the defendant objecting to that procedure?,\u201d defense counsel stated, \u201cNo, your Honor. <em>We </em>approve of it,\u201d to which the judge responded, \u201cOkay. I think it would be an issue if the defendant objected to it. . .In view of that, then I think we\u2019ll go ahead and empanel [additional jurors].\u201d We fail to see how the circumstances of this case, particularly in light of defense counsel\u2019s approval and the obvious lack of prejudice, create a defect of constitutional dimensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Finally, the defendant complains about the presence on the jury of juror W. On the second day of empanelment, the prosecutor indicated to the judge that he had received information that juror W might be acquainted with the victim or his family. The judge inquired of her on that score and she said that she did not know the victim or his family personally or in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>employment, and that she could serve as \u201can open minded, impartial juror.\u201d The judge found that the juror could remain impartial and was properly seated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defense counsel then indicated to the judge that he had information that the juror\u2019s husband had attended Malone\u2019s wake, but the judge declined to inquire of the juror if that was so in light of her answers to his more general inquiry. The defendant sought to challenge the juror, but the judge declined based on the juror\u2019s statement that she could be impartial. A short time later, juror W came forward and indicated to the judge that she recognized, but did not know, a woman sitting in the courtroom. The woman.was related to the victim and was a witness for the Commonwealth. The judge inquired of juror W\u2019s relations with or knowledge of the woman, and the juror stated that she merely recognized the woman and that her ability to be impartial would not be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">On appeal, the defendant makes much of the fact that the judge refused to ask juror W whether her husband attended the victim\u2019s wake and refused to allow him to challenge the juror because the jury had already been sworn and seated. The defendant argues that Mass. R. Crim. R 20, 378 Mass. 889 (1978), gives a trial judge the discretion, which the judge here declined to exercise, to allow a peremptory challenge after the juror has been seated, and that the failure to exercise that discretion is an error that requires a new trial. The defendant\u2019s reading of rule 20 is incorrect. Rule 20 (c) (2) explicitly states that a peremptory challenge \u201cshall be made before the jurors are sworn.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 891. The defendant points to the next clause of the rule which states, \u201cand may be made after the determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>that a person called to serve as a juror stands indifferent in the case,\u201d as indicating that the judge has discretion to allow a peremptory challenge after the juror has been sworn. That is not a correct reading of the rule. See K.B. Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1726 (2d ed. 1983). What the second clause states is that, if the juror has not yet been sworn, then there may be a peremptory challenge even after there has been a determination of that juror\u2019s indifference. The defendant offers no authority for his reading of the rule, and the one case he offers as helpful says just the opposite. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagliardi, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 225, 236-237 (1990), <em>S.C., </em>418 Mass. 562 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1091 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">There remains then only the question whether the judge should have inquired of the juror whether her husband had indeed attended Malone\u2019s wake and should have made his decision that she should be seated in light of the answer to that question. Given the defense counsel\u2019s timely notification of the judge about the possibility of bias, the judge should have inquired specifically about the wake and the juror\u2019s, or juror\u2019s spouse\u2019s, attendance. See G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28 (\u201cif it appears that ... the juror may not stand indifferent, the court <em>shall . . . </em>examine the juror specifically with respect to such considerations, attitudes, exposure, opinions or any other matters which may . . . cause a decision .. . . to be made in whole or in part upon issues extraneous to the issues in the case\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The error, however, was not prejudicial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Otsuki, </em>411 Mass. 218, 228 (1991) (defendant must show that the judge\u2019s failure to hold an individual voir dire prejudiced his case). The defendant sought postconviction relief from a single justice of this court on this issue, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings to determine whether any jurors were subject to extraneous influences at trial. In the remand proceedings on July 23, 1996, the judge recalled juror W and a second juror.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the defendant\u2019s urging, the judge specifically asked juror W whether her husband attended the funeral or the wake of the victim. Juror W stated, \u201cNot that I know of. I don\u2019t know ... I don\u2019t know if he did or didn\u2019t.\u201d The judge asked a long series of other questions to probe whether the juror knew the defendant, the victim, or their immediate families, and concluded, in a memorandum of decision dated September 30, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>1996, that, \u201c[b]ased on all the evidence, I do not find either juror dishonestly answered a material question or that any prejudice resulted to the Defendant. I find the jurors were not biased for or against the Defendant and decided the case impartially and fairly on the evidence as instructed by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">On appeal, the defendant raises no challenge to the conclusion reached by the judge at the remand proceedings ordered by this court. In his brief to us, the defendant states that he \u201cis compelled to concede that the defendant did not demonstrate actual prejudice with regard to [the juror] during [the remand] proceeding.\u201d Although the juror\u2019s husband may, indeed, have attended the victim\u2019s wake, she testified that she did not know of his attendance, and the judge found that her participation was not infected by extraneous influence. It is, after all, the juror\u2019s bias we are concerned about. Her husband\u2019s relation to the victim is relevant only as it bears on that question. Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim must be limited to the rather formal question whether the <em>original </em>failure to inquire <em>at trial </em>constituted error requiring a new trial, regardless of the postconviction cure ordered by the single justice. We reject that claim.

A defendant is entitled to be present at all critical stages of a criminal proceeding, including voir dire of an individual juror, <em>if </em>\u201can appropriate request for his presence is made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>414 Mass. 595, 602 (1993), quoting <em>Amado </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>349 Mass. 716, 721 (1965). The defendant made no such request in this case, the judge never \u201cexcluded\u201d him, and his counsel never objected to the defendant\u2019s absence. In such circumstances, we \u201cconsiderQ the issue waived and will not address it on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605. Moreover, even had the defendant requested to be present, any error on this score was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. As explained <em>infra, </em>postconviction proceedings regarding the impartiality of juror W were conducted at the defendant\u2019s request and by order of this court. The defendant was personally present at those proceedings, and they cured any earlier defect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\">On appeal, the defendant raises no challenge regarding the second juror.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
