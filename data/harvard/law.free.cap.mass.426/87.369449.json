Gen. L. ch. 260, \u00a7 2E, the \u2018Daikon Shield Statute,\u2019 valid under the \u2018Standing Laws\u2019 provision of Article 10 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">We answer the question: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-15\">The plaintiff was prescribed the Daikon Shield intrauterine device, and it was inserted in November, 1971. The Daikon Shield was removed from the plaintiff in June, 1974, during an emergency admission to Wesson Womens\u2019 Hospital. Removal of the Daikon Shield was precipitated by her doctor\u2019s suspicion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>that the plaintiff was experiencing an ectopic pregnancy. The pregnancy, which began while the Daikon Shield was in place, was subsequently confirmed. As a result of this condition, the plaintiff underwent laparoscopic surgery shortly after the removal of the Daikon Shield. The defendant, the Daikon Shield Claimants Trust (Trust), contends, and the plaintiff does not dispute, that at the time the Daikon Shield was removed in 1974, the plaintiff had reason to believe that at least some of the medical complaints she was experiencing were caused by the Daikon Shield.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">A.H. Robins Company, Inc., the manufacturer of the Daikon Shield, filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Law in 1985. A plan of reorganization (plan) was consummated in late 1989, which established the Trust against which all Daikon Shield claims were to be filed. The plan also provided that all persons with Daikon Shield personal injury claims were required to complete a specific claim resolution process and be certified by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia prior to commencing or resuming litigation. The plaintiff filed a timely claim against the Trust, completed the Trust\u2019s claim review process in accordance with the plan requirements, and was properly certified to proceed with litigation on March 16, 1995. Having failed to reach a satisfactory resolution of her claim with the Trust, the plaintiff filed her complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on March 11, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The plaintiff does not dispute the Trust\u2019s contention that her lawsuit would be barred under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A, the three-year statute of limitations generally applicable in Massachusetts to the claims made in her complaint. The plaintiff contends that her claims are timely under the provisions of the \u201cDaikon Shield Intrauterine Device Statute of Limitations,\u201d G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2E, which was added by St. 1995, c. 38, \u00a7 200, to enlarge the statute of limitations specifically for claims against the Trust related to the Daikon Shield. The statute is retroactive and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of [G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A], every cause of action for personal injury or death caused by the effects of the Daikon Shield intrauterine device, so called, shall be brought against the Daikon Shield Claimants Trust not later than one year from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>date of the certification by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia of the right to proceed to litigation or arbitration, or six months from the effective date of this section, whichever is later. This section shall apply regardless of when any such action or claim shall have accrued or been filed, and regardless of whether it may have lapsed or otherwise be barred by time under the law of the commonwealth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The Trust contends that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2E, is invalid because it violates the \u201cstanding laws\u201d provision of art. 10 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which prohibits the enactment of special legislation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that \u201csingle[s] out any person for special privileges or advantages at the expense of the rights of another,\u201d <em>Sciuto </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>389 Mass. 939, 944 (1983). This contention must be examined under standards which place a heavy burden on the Trust. \u201cIn asking us to strike down [G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2E], the [Trust] run[s] squarely into the settled rule that a reviewing court must grant all rational presumptions in favor of the constitutionality of a legislative enactment. See <em>Paddock </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>347 Mass. 230, 232 (1964); <em>Druzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haverhill, </em>324 Mass. 129, 138-139 (1949). The sole issue is whether the statute falls within the legislative power to enact, not whether it comports with a court\u2019s idea of wise or efficient legislation. See <em>Zeller </em>v. <em>Cantu, </em>395 Mass. 76, 85 (1985); <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>386 Mass. 701, 710 n.ll (1982); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>368 Mass. 880, 886 n.l (1975). The party challenging the statute\u2019s constitutionality must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt, see <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, supra </em>at 706-707, that there are no \u2018conceivable grounds\u2019 which could support its validity. See <em>Zeller </em>v. <em>Canto, supra </em>at 84; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin Fruit Co., </em>388 Mass. 228, 235 (1983).\u201d <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Keene Corp., </em>406 Mass. 301, 305 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The Trust argues that the conclusions reached in <em>Holden </em>v. <em>James, </em>11 Mass. 396 (1814), and <em>Paddock </em>v. <em>Brookline, supra, </em>govern here. In these opinions, statutes which allowed single named individuals to maintain suits that otherwise would have been barred by a general statute were held to violate art. 10.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Trust maintains that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2E, is similar to the statutes found invalid in <em>Holden </em>and <em>Paddock </em>because it extends the statute of limitations for a relatively small and identifiable group of people.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The number of people benefited by a special statute is a factor to be considered in assessing the strength of an art. 10 challenge, but it is not the dispositive factor. It is also relevant whether the benefit conferred is \u201caccompanied by corresponding injury to another person who can be definitely pointed to . . . .\u201d <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health </em>v. <em>Bessie M. Burke Memorial Hosp., </em>366 Mass. 734, 743 (1975). We have upheld statutes which benefited single named entities because the statutes did no specific injury to any other person or entity. See <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>387 Mass. 531, 538 (1982); <em>Bessie M. Burke Memorial Hosp., supra </em>at 744. On the other hand, we have suggested that a proposed statute which would have benefited a group of females might violate art. 10 because it adversely affected the equal protection rights of similarly situated men. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>373 Mass. 883, 885 (1977). Notwithstanding these considerations, a statute which favors one person or group at the expense of another is not necessarily to be condemned as violating art. 10 because much, if not all, legislation has this effect. The critical inquiry is whether the challenged statute can be said to have some legitimate public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>purpose that predominates over the benefit it otherwise confers on private parties and over any injury to another party. As we have pointed out with respect to art. 10: \u201cthe Legislature may go so far as to confer an outright bounty on selected individuals \u2018if some public purpose is promoted, [that is] if the statute is \u201cfor the good and welfare\u201d of the Commonwealth ... as to which the Legislature\u2019s judgment will weigh heavily\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted). <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Keene Corp., supra </em>at 307, quoting <em>Bessie M. Burke Memorial Hosp., supra </em>at 744. Viewed in this light, the primary vice in the <em>Holden </em>and <em>Paddock </em>cases was the fact that they served no discernible public purpose and operated only to aggrandize the personal interests of a single party. See <em>Paddock, supra </em>at 240 (\u201cWe conclude that there is no basis for a legislative determination that the public good will be served by relieving this plaintiff from the general statutory requirement of giving notice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 2E, does not violate art. 10 because any detriment to the Trust is subordinate to a \u201clegitimate public good\u201d derived from the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>271 Mass. 495, 498 (1930). In enacting the statute, the Legislature may have reasoned that the limitations period set forth in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A, was unfair to women injured by the Daikon Shield. The Legislature may have considered the delays imposed by the A.H. Robins bankruptcy proceedings and what it perceived to be questionable practices engaged in by Robins which may have misled women about the safety of its intrauterine device and their rights. The Legislature also appears to have had information that there were substantial unexpended assets in the Trust to satisfy any obligations it may have had to women who had not yet been afforded a fair opportunity to litigate their claims. The Legislature may have been influenced by the fact that other States have granted relief to similarly situated women by expanding their governing statutes of limitations to permit late claims against the Trust, and the Legislature may have given weight to the policy reasons that motivated the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>State Legislatures to adopt those statutes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the core of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2E, is an effort to protect the interests of Massachusetts women claiming injuries from the Daikon Shield by placing them in parity with injured women in other States. In <em>Danforth </em>v. <em>Groton Water Co., </em>178 Mass. 472 (1901), the court upheld a special statute reviving an eminent domain action for damages against an attack that the Legislature cannot remove a bar or limitation which has already become complete. In the <em>Danforth </em>opinion, Chief Justice Holmes observed that the Legislature may \u201ccall a liability into being where there was none before, if the circumstances were such as to appeal with some strength to the prevailing views of justice, and if the obstacle in the way of the creation seemed small.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477. While <em>Danforth </em>was not an art. 10 case, we think these comments have pertinence here. Some of the assumptions apparently made by the Legislature could be debatable, and the Trust undoubtedly would say that the assumptions are wrong. But this is not the dispositive point. The dispositive point is that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2E, has a legitimate public purpose, and as a result, does not offend art. 10.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-6\">This provision, contained in the first sentence of art. 10, reads as follows: \u201cEach individual of the society has a right to be protected by it in the enjoyment of his life, liberty and property, according to standing laws.\u201d We have interpreted \u201cstanding laws\u201d to mean enacted legislation of general application. See <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health </em>v. <em>Bessie M. Burke Memorial Hosp., </em>366 Mass. 734, 742 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\">We have defined \u201cspecial legislation\u201d to mean \u201clegislation addressed to a particular situation, that does not establish a rule of future conduct with any substantial degree of generality, and may provide ad hoc benefits of some kind for an individual or a number of them.\u201d <em>Bessie M. Burke Memorial Hosp., supra </em>at 740.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The statute in the <em>Holden </em>case removed the defense of various statutes of limitations so the plaintiff could maintain an action against the personal representatives or heirs and devisees of an estate. <em>Holden </em>v. <em>James, </em>11 Mass. 396, 401 (1814). The statute in the <em>Paddock </em>case removed the defense of lack of notice so the plaintiff could maintain a case against the town of Brookline for a fall on a sidewalk. <em>Paddock </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>347 Mass. 230, 231 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b110-7\">As of July 1, 1995, when G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2E, became effective, there were in Massachusetts fifty-three women, and twenty-four husbands with derivative claims, who had completed the Trust\u2019s review process and were either certified for litigation or eligible to be certified. Since the deadline for filing claims against the Trust under the plan was June 30, 1994, and all plaintiffs were required to complete the claim resolution process prior to filing litigation against the Trust, these appear to be the only plaintiffs affected by G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2E.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b111-6\">There may also be due process concerns in connection with a statute challenged under art. 10. The Trust does not expressly raise such concerns here, and it would not prevail if any were argued. General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 2E, does not deprive the Trust of a fundamental or vested right or subject it to any new liability. The statute merely removes a procedural bar to the plaintiff\u2019s legal remedies. See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Keene Corp., </em>406 Mass. 301, 312-313 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b112-5\">At least four States, California (Cal. Code Civ. P. \u00a7 340.7 [West 1994 &amp; 1997 Supp.]); Kansas (Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 60-524 [1995]); New York (N.Y. Public Health Law \u00a7 2404 [McKinney 1993 &amp; 1997 Supp.]); and Ohio (Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 2305.101 [Baldwin 1995]) have enacted statutes similar to G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2E. The rationale identified by the California Legislature was the \u201cunique and extraordinary circumstances surrounding the Daikon Shield and the bankruptcy of A.H. Robins Co.\u201d including \u201c[e]xtraordinary delays in the resolution of these claims [which] have denied many of these women the customary right to file timely lawsuits.\u201d Cal. Stats. 1994, c. 107, \u00a7 2. The California Legislature also stated that this bill \u201cplacets] California women who have claims against the Virginia-based trust on a more equal footing with claimants from other states [with] more liberal statutes of limitations . .. <em>\"Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Based on what has been said, we reject the Trust\u2019s argument, in reliance on <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Keene Corp., supra, </em>that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2E, violates art. 10 because it provides benefits to private persons rather than to the government. A statute is not violative of art. 10 so long as it promotes some legitimate public purpose that is not completely \u201cincident and collateral to the relief of a private citizen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310, quoting <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>271 Mass. 495, 498 (1930). The statute meets this standard. Indeed, although the statute at issue in <em>Keene </em>(which provided relief from statutes of limitations for asbestos-related claims) was limited to governmental entities, we recognized possible legislative authority to extend the statute to private plaintiffs by stating, \u201c[t]he fact that St. 1986, c. 336, does not accord similar benefit to private plaintiffs does not undermine the legitimacy of this governmental interest. The Legislature could well have concluded that the asbestos problem was most acute in public buildings, and thus decided to address that aspect of the crisis first.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
