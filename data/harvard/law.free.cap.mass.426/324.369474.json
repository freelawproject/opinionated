Regs. \u00a7 63.39.1(5) (1993) (regulation) violates Federal statute, Pub. L. 86-272, codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 381 (1994), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>whether, as the Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) argues, \u00a7 381 is unconstitutional as it unduly impairs the sovereign power of the State to tax interstate commerce within its borders and thus violates the United States Constitution\u2019s Tenth Amendment reservation of power to the States. The plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court seeking a declaration that the Federal statute preempts the regulation and that Congress was within its power in enacting \u00a7 381. The parties filed a statement of agreed facts and cross motions for summary judgment. A judge in the Superior Court entered a declaration that the regulation \u201cviolates 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 381 ([Pub. L.] 86-272) by reducing the scope of tax immunity the [Fjederal statute affords to foreign corporations whose only contact with Massachusetts consists of soliciting orders for tangible personal property, and delivering such property into the Commonwealth from a point outside Massachusetts in the corporation\u2019s private vehicles; [tjhat 830 Code Mass. Regs. [\u00a7 ] 63.39.1(5) (1993) as applied to such foreign corporations is hereby declared to be preempted by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 381 ([Pub. L.j 86-272); and [tjhat 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 381 ([Pub. L.j 86-272) is constitutional.\u201d The commissioner appealed. We granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We agree with the declaration entered by the Superior Court judge. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">We set forth the agreed facts. The plaintiff is the national trade association of more than 1,000 corporations that operate their own truck fleets to transport and deliver their products. Some of the plaintiff\u2019s members own their own trucks. Other members lease the trucks used for delivery from a subsidiary corporation, or from another carrier. A number of the plaintiff\u2019s members, not incorporated or based in Massachusetts, regularly solicit sales of tangible goods in Massachusetts. These orders are sent outside the Commonwealth for approval, and once approved, are filled from a point outside Massachusetts. The plaintiff\u2019s members then use their own trucks to make deliveries to their customers in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Section 381 expressly restricts the authority of a State to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>impose an income tax on foreign corporations whose business within the State consists solely of \u201cthe solicitation of orders ... for sales of tangible personal property, which orders are sent outside the State for approval or rejection, and, if approved, are filled by shipment or delivery from a point outside the State.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The regulation, promulgated by the commissioner on January 1, 1990, pursuant to his authority under G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 3, governs the question whether a foreign corporation is subject to the Massachusetts excise tax under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 39 (1990 ed.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The regulation includes, among other things, a section entitled, \u201cException for Solicitation Activities Protected by [\u00a7 381].\u201d This exception states that a foreign corporation whose activities fall within the scope of the Massachusetts statute and regulation \u201cnevertheless is not subject to Massachusetts taxation if Massachusetts is precluded from exercising its jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>tion by [\u00a7 381].\u201d The regulation interprets \u00a7 381 as not imposing the Massachusetts excise on a foreign corporation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">\u201cif the sole activity of the corporation in Massachusetts is the solicitation by the corporation\u2019s representatives (in the name of the corporation or in the name of a prospective customer) of orders for the sale of tangible personal property, provided that the orders are sent outside Massachusetts for approval or rejection, and provided that the orders are filled by shipment or delivery by common carrier or contract carrier from a point outside of Massachusetts.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The parties agree that the regulation exempts from State taxation entities that solicit in Massachusetts orders approved and filled from a point outside out of the State who use common carriers to fill their orders in State. The Commissioner, however, claims that \u00a7 381 does not exempt similarly situated entities who use their own vehicles to bring their goods into Massachusetts. The plaintiff contends that\" \u00a7 381 preempts the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Generally preemption is not favored. <em>Sawash </em>v. <em>Suburban Welders Supply Co., </em>407 Mass. 311, 315 (1990). Because \u00a7 381 impinges on the States\u2019 sovereign powers of taxation, \u201cunless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the Federal-State balance.\u201d <em>Heublein, Inc. </em>v. <em>South Carolina Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>409 U.S. 275, 281-282 (1972), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 349 (1971); <em>English </em>v. <em>General Elec. Co., </em>496 U.S. 72, 79 (1990) (\u201cstate law is pre-empted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law\u201d). Here Congress has made its purpose clear. \u201cSection 381 was designed to define clearly a lower limit for the exercise of [State taxing] power. ... By establishing such a limit, Congress did, of course, implicitly determine that the State\u2019s interest in taxing business activities below that limit was weaker than the national interest in promoting an open economy.\u201d <em>Heublein, supra </em>at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The commissioner urges us to interpret the phrase, \u201cfilled by shipment or delivery from a point outside the state\u201d and, in particular, to construe the word \u201cdelivery\u201d as referring to a transaction in which title passes from shipper to customer at a point outside of the State.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The commissioner points to provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code enacted prior to \u00a7 381 in support of his contention that Congress intended to protect only out-of-State transactions from taxation. The commissioner contends that his interpretation should prevail because \u00a7 381 includes areas that \u201c \u2018traditionally [have been] occupied by the States\u2019 [and in those circumstances] congressional intent to supersede state laws must be \u2018clear and manifest.\u2019 \u201d <em>English, supra </em>at 79, quoting <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947). The commissioner concludes that the congressional intent to supersede State tax law by enacting \u00a7 381 is not \u201cclear and manifest.\u201d The Superior Court judge rejected the commissioner\u2019s argument, concluding that there was congressional intent to preempt the regulation, and that the term \u201cdelivery\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in the context of \u00a7 381 is not limited to out-of-State deliveries.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Neither the language of the statute nor its legislative history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>suggests that Congress intended the specialized meaning the commissioner urges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statute refers to shipment or delivery \u201cfrom\u201d a point outside the State, not \u201cat\u201d a point outside the State. The language requires only that the goods originate from out-of-State, not that the transfer of goods to the buyer occurs outside the taxing State. See 1 J. &amp; W. Hellerstein, State Taxation at 6-32 (2d ed. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Further, the statute describes \u201cshipment or delivery from a point outside the State\u201d as part of the protected business activity that may take place \u201cwithin the [taxing] State.\u201d \u00a7 381. As the plaintiff argues, this makes sense only if \u201cshipment or delivery\u201d is read to mean transportation of goods that originate outside the taxing State and then enter the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Other States have reached the same conclusion we do. In construing \u00a7 381, the Supreme Court of Virginia stated that \u201c[i]n enacting \u00a7 381, Congress did not identify any manner of delivery necessary to qualify for immunity. Section 381 does not specify common carrier, contract or private carrier, or any other particular method of delivery.\u201d <em>Virginia Dep\u2019t of Taxation </em>v. <em>National Private Truck Council, Inc., </em>253 Va. 74, 77 (1997). The tax authorities in New Jersey and New York have also opined that private carriage is protected by \u00a7 381. See New Jersey State Tax News at 4 (Spring 1996); New York Advisory Op. TSB-A-84 (11)C (Sept. 14, 1984). But see Florida Tech. Assistance Advisement No. 95(c)1-004 (Mar. 17, 1995) (advising that private carriage is not protected by \u00a7 381).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The commissioner also argues the regulation should be upheld because \u00a7 381 is unconstitutional. The commissioner contends that \u00a7 381 unduly impairs the sovereign power of the State to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>tax interstate commerce within its borders, in violation of the principles of federalism and the Tenth Amendment\u2019s reservation of power to the States. See <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Cocreham, 246 </em>La. 244, 266, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Mouton </em>v. <em>International Shoe, </em>379 U.S. 902 (1964) (rejecting the Tenth Amendment claim raised here); <em>State ex rel. CIBA Pharmaceutical Prods., Inc. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>382 S.W.2d 645, 657 (Mo. 1964) (same). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Congress\u2019s plenary power to regulate interstate commerce is well established. See, e.g., <em>Hodel </em>v. <em>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Ass\u2019n, </em>452 U.S. 264, 276 (1981). Consistent with this power, Congress can prohibit States from imposing taxes that interfere with interstate commerce. See, e.g., <em>Arizona Pub. Serv. Co. </em>v. <em>Snead, </em>441 U.S. 141, 150 (1979). Where Congress .acts within an enumerated power, such as its authority under the commerce clause, the Tenth Amendment is not implicated. <em>New York </em>v. <em>United States, </em>505 U.S. 144, 156 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Moreover, merely limiting the States\u2019 power to tax is not sufficient encroachment upon the States\u2019 sovereign authority to warrant invalidating a Federal statute under the Tenth Amendment. See <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe R.R., </em>656 F.2d 398, 407 (9th Cir. 1981) (\u201cWe know of no authority for the proposition that Congress may not interfere with state taxation in furtherance of its power over interstate commerce\u201d); <em>Southeastern Pa. Trans. Auth. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n, </em>826 F. Supp. 1506, 1520-1521 (E.D. Pa. 1993) (\u201cThe fact that pre-emptive federal legislation may impinge on a state revenue-raising scheme has no special Tenth Amendment implications. . . . Congress can, in furtherance of its commerce power, displace state taxation\u201d), aff\u2019d, 27 F.3d 558 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 928 (1994); <em>Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Cochran, </em>546 F. Supp. 904, 910 (M.D. Tenn. 1981) (\u201c[T]he constitutional power of Congress under the commerce clause clearly permits some limitation on the states\u2019 power of taxation. As long as the legislation is rationally related to the goal of protecting interstate commerce . . . the mere fact that a state taxation scheme is affected does not itself invalidate the legislation\u201d). Congress enacted \u00a7 381 pursuant to its power to regulate interstate commerce. <em>Kennametal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, ante </em>39, 41 (1997). See <em>Heublein, Inc. </em>v. <em>South Carolina Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>409 U.S. 275, 279-281 (1972). Congress sought to allay concern that arose following the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>358 U.S. 450 (1959), that \u201cmere solicitation\u201d would subject a foreign corporation to State taxation. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Kelly-Springfield Tire Co., </em>419 Mass. 262, 265 (1994); <em>Heublein, supra </em>at 280. Section 381 sets a uniform minimum standard which must be met before a State may tax interstate commerce. See <em>Heublein, supra </em>at 280; <em>CIBA Pharmaceutical Prods., supra </em>at 657. This is clearly within the ambit of Congress\u2019s commerce power. See <em>International Shoe, supra </em>at 266; <em>CIBA Pharmaceutical Prods., supra </em>at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Nor does \u00a7 381 exceed Congress\u2019s constitutional power by mandating State legislation or otherwise commandeering the States\u2019 legislative process. See <em>New York </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 161; <em>Hodel, supra </em>at 288. Section 381 requires no State legislation or otherwise \u201ccommand . . . state governments to implement legislation enacted by Congress.\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 176. The limitation set in \u00a7 381 is a permissibly small preclusion of State taxing power to protect interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The declaration entered by the Superior Court was correct and is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\">This type of transportation arrangement, where a company transports its goods in vehicles owned or leased by it, is known as \u201cprivate carriage.\u201d \u201cCommon carriage\u201d or \u201ccontract carriage,\u201d by contrast, is for-hire transportation in which the shipper and the carrier are different entities. The parties have stipulated that, for the purposes of this case, there is no difference between \u201ccommon\u201d and \u201ccontract\u201d carriers and we refer to both simply as \u201ccommon carriers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The relevant portions of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 381 (1984) provide: \u201c(a) ...

The company regularly delivers furniture that it had sold to locations in Massachusetts using its own delivery trucks. The delivery trucks are corporate property that the company owns or uses in Massachusetts in a corporate capacity within the meaning of 830 Code Mass. Regs. 63.39.1(4)(d). The delivery of goods does not constitute \u2018solicitation\u2019 of orders. Humble Homes is therefore subject to the excise under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 39.\u201d 830 Code Mass.

Delivery is \u201cthe act of putting property into the legal possession of another.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 597 (1993). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines delivery as the \u201cact by which the res or substance thereof is placed within the actual or constructive possession or control of another.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 428 (6th ed. 1990). Neither of these definitions includes the meaning suggested by the commissioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Legislative history supports our interpretation. \u201c[I]f the only business presence within the State by a [company] engaged in interstate commerce is the solicitation ... of orders for sales of tangible personal property and the orders are sent to an office out of state for approval or rejection, and if the order is approved, it is filled by shipment or delivery from a stock of goods, warehouse, plant, or factory located out of the State, the net income tax of the State ... on income derived within the State by such [company] from interstate commerce may not be imposed.\u201d S.
