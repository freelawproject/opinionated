L. c. 175, \u00a7 49A, which authorizes a domestic insurer to \u201ctransfer its domicile to any other state.\u201d The Commissioner of Insurance (commissioner) authorized a domestic insurance company to transfer its domicil to Bermuda. Subsequently the commissioner filed a petition pursuant to G. L. c. 175, 180C (entitled \u201cLiquidation of Domestic Company\u201d) in the county court seeking to be appointed the United States receiver (U.S. receiver) of that insurance company. The commissioner contends that a proper interpretation of the word \u201cstate\u201d in \u00a7 49A refers to foreign countries as well as States of the United States. We do not agree. We conclude, contrary to the commissioner\u2019s interpretation, that the word \u201cstate\u201d in \u00a7 49A refers only to States of the United States. Because the commissioner\u2019s petition relies on the validity of her ruling that the word \u201cstate\u201d in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 49A, includes foreign countries, we remand the case to the county court for the entry of a judgment dismissing the commissioner\u2019s receivership petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">This case arises from Electric Mutual Liability Insurance Company\u2019s (EMLICO\u2019s) redomestication to Bermuda and subsequent declaration of insolvency. On June 28, 1995, the commissioner issued an order approving EMLICO\u2019s redomestication to Bermuda under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 49A. Shortly thereafter, EMLICO redomesticated, declared itself insolvent, and commenced liquidation proceedings in Bermuda. In March, 1997, the commissioner filed a petition in the county court, asking to be appointed the United States receiver of EMLICO pursuant to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180C, and seeking the court\u2019s approval of a related agreement. EMLICO, Electric Insurance Company, and General Electric Company, all of whom are appellants here, support the commissioner\u2019s petition. Several of EMLICO\u2019s reinsurers, designated as amici here, oppose the petition, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>reasons, on the ground that the redomestication was invalid because \u00a7 49A confers no authority on the commissioner to approve a redomestication to a foreign country. Without reaching the petition\u2019s merits, the single justice reserved and reported the three questions set forth below to the full court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Because our responses to the second and third questions aid us in disposing of the first, we address the questions out of order. As an initial matter, we are not persuaded by the appellants\u2019 contention that because all of them support the petition, and only the reinsurers oppose it, the single justice must automatically let the county court proceed to the merits. A judge has a duty to dismiss a petition which he or she concludes is erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">We turn first to question 2. Question 2 asks \u201cwhether a domestic insurer like EMLICO can, under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 49A, be allowed to redomesticate to a foreign country in view of the language in \u00a7 49A which permits redomestication only \u2018to any other state.\u2019 \u201d Section 49A permits redomestication \u201cto any other state,\u201d but does not define \u201cstate\u201d either to mean only States of the United States or to include foreign countries. The commissioner has interpreted \u00a7 49A to authorize redomestication not only to States of the United States, but also to foreign countries. We review this interpretation de novo. <em>Protective Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>425 Mass. 615, 618 (1997), citing <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>364 Mass. 593, 595 (1974). Although we grant substantial deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute, \u201c[a]n incorrect interpretation of a statute ... is not entitled to deference.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Ass\u2019n, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Medical Sec., </em>412 Mass. 340, 346 (1992), quoting <em>Kszepka\u2019s Case, </em>408 Mass. 843, 847 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">To support her petition the commissioner cites a dictionary defining \u201cstate\u201d as \u201ca body of people permanently occupying a definite territory and politically organized under a sovereign government almost entirely free from external control and pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>sessing coercive power to maintain order within the community.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 2228 (1993). This meaning of \u201cstate\u201d includes foreign countries. However, the same dictionary also defines \u201cstate\u201d as \u201cone of the bodies politic or component units in a federal system that is more or less independent and sovereign over internal affairs but forms with the other units a sovereign nation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>This meaning excludes foreign countries. Both meanings are in current usage, and the Legislature could have intended either one. We therefore compare \u00a7 49A to other statutes and look to the history and purpose of \u00a7 49A to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In other sections of c. 175, when the Legislature has intended to refer to foreign countries, it has done so in express terms. See, e.g., G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 11 (\u201cother states or countries\u201d), \u00a7 22 (\u201cany state or country other than this commonwealth\u201d), \u00a7 185 (\u201cany provision of law of this commonwealth or of any other state or country\u201d). We conclude that had the Legislature intended to facilitate redomestication to a foreign country, possibly subjecting policyholders and creditors to the vagaries of foreign law, it would have expressed this intent unambiguously, as other State Legislatures have. See R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 27-2.2-4 (1994) (authorizing redomestication \u201cto any such other state or jurisdiction\u201d); Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 8, \u00a7 3438 (Supp. 1996) (same). See also Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 431:19-102.4 (1993) (authorizing re-domestication of \u201cdomestic captive insurance compan[ies] . . . to any other jurisdiction\u201d); 1997 Me. Laws c. 435, \u00a7 6717 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The commissioner argues that her interpretation of the statute furthers the legislative purpose of facilitating transfers of corporate domicil. She argues that the global nature of the insurance marketplace requires that transfers to foreign countries be permitted under \u00a7 49A. The history of the statute does not support her interpretation of the word \u201cstate.\u201d In context, \u201cstate\u201d means a State of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Section 49A was based on a model statute of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which the Legislature adopted with no relevant changes. The NAIC is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>organization representing the insurance departments of the States and territories of the United States. Uniform Insurers Liquidation Act, 13 U.L.A. 323, 325 (Master ed. 1986). Nothing in the history of \u00a7 49A, or the model statute on which it is based, evinces any intent to facilitate international transfers. The Proceedings of the NAIC reveal a concern about \u201cpreserving the right and ability of the two states\u2019 insurance commissioners to fully protect the interests of the resident policyholders.\u201d 2 Proceedings of the NAIC 210 (1978), cited in 2 NAIC Model Laws, Regulations and Guidelines at 350-7. This history indicates that the NAIC was concerned about its members\u2019 ability to protect; resident policyholders\u2019 interests, and that it contemplated transfers between States regulated by NAIC members. In the history called to our attention, there is no mention of foreign nations or of the international insurance market. We conclude that \u00a7 49A, like the model statute on which it is based, does not seek to facilitate redomestication to a foreign country. The commissioner\u2019s interpretation is contrary to the language and underlying purpose of \u00a7 49A. A domestic insurer like EMLICO therefore may not redomesticate to a foreign country under \u00a7 49A. The single justice\u2019s second reported question is answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">We turn to question 3. Question 3 asks what \u201ceffect an invalid redomestication has on the legal sufficiency of the commissioner\u2019s petition under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180C.\u201d An administrative agency has only the powers and duties expressly or impliedly conferred on it by statute. <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Comm\u2019n, </em>409 Mass. 813, 818 (1991). Section 49A grants to the commissioner the authority to approve a domestic insurer\u2019s re-domestication to another State. Because Bermuda is not a State within the meaning of \u00a7 49A, the commissioner possessed no authority to approve EMLICO\u2019s redomestication there. We conclude that the commissioner\u2019s order purporting to do so is invalid. See <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Life Ins. Co., </em>351 Mass. 283, 289 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The commissioner argues that, even if her approval was invalid, EMLICO still has incorporated- in Bermuda and commenced liquidation proceedings there. Therefore, she argues, an invalid redomestication is immaterial to the legal sufficiency of her petition. We disagree. The commissioner has relied on her order authorizing EMLICO to transfer to Bermuda. Further, the petition assumes that the proper site for the liquidation of EM<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>LICO is Bermuda rather than Massachusetts. This assumption rests on the premise that her redomestication order was valid. That order, however, was beyond the commissioner\u2019s power and authority. The commissioner\u2019s reliance on an invalid transfer to Bermuda therefore renders the petition legally insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Section 49A provides that a domestic insurer \u201cupon such a transfer shall cease to be a domestic insurer.\u201d Because, as discussed above, a domestic insurer cannot be redomesticated to a foreign country under \u00a7 49A, there was no lawful transfer, and EMLICO never ceased to be a Massachusetts insurer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Question 1 asks \u201cwhether the commissioner has demonstrated that the requirements of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 180C are satisfied so that her petition can be considered on its merits.\u201d In fight of the foregoing, we conclude that the commissioner\u2019s petition is legally insufficient. We answer the single justice\u2019s first reported question, \u201cNo.\u201d We answer the second reported question, \u201cNo.\u201d To the third reported question, we answer that the invalid redomestication has the effect of rendering the commissioner\u2019s petition legally insufficient. The matter is remanded to the county court, where a judgment shall enter dismissing the commissioner\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\u201c[1.] [W]hether the commissioner has demonstrated that the requirements of G.

L. c. 175, \u00a7 180C.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\">It is irrelevant that the definition cited by the commissioner is listed before the other one. The dictionary lists definitions in order of their historical development. See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 17a (1993). The order of definitions thus does not indicate that the former is more ordinary, natural, or common than the latter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The parties and amici have speculated a great deal about the consequences in Bermuda if we declare the redomestication invalid. EMLICO\u2019s status as a Bermuda corporation is, of course, a matter of Bermuda law and not before us in any event. We simply hold that EMLICO remains a Massachusetts insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
