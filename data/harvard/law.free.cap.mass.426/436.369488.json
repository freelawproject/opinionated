Pursuant to an order of a Superior Court judge, the matter was initially referred to a master for findings of fact and recommended conclusions of law. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 53 (h) (1), as appearing in 386 Mass. 1237 (1982). After receiving the master\u2019s final report, the judge ruled that (1) the plaintiff\u2019s breach of contract precluded it from recovering on the contract; (2) the plaintiff\u2019s breach also precluded an award of prejudgment interest pursuant to G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39K; and (3) the plaintiff could not recover under G. L. c. 93A, because the town was not engaged in \u201ctrade or commerce.\u201d The judge also recommitted the matter to the master to make further findings regarding the plaintiff\u2019s possible recovery in quantum meruit. The master did so in his supplemental report. Based in part on these findings, the judge then ruled that (1) the plaintiff was entitled to recover $266,692 in quantum meruit; (2) the plaintiff\u2019s quantum meruit recovery should not include overhead costs; (3) the town was not entitled to liquidated damages stemming from the plaintiff\u2019s delay in completing the project; and (4) the plaintiff was entitled, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, to prejudgment interest in the amount of 12% beginning January 1, 1992. We granted the town\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">Both parties claim error. The plaintiff primarily contends that the judge erred in (1) rejecting its G. L. c. 93A claim; (2) concluding that it could not recover on the contract; and (3) denying its claim for overhead expenses. The town contends the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>judge erred in (1) failing to enter judgment in its favor; (2) awarding the plaintiff\u2019s recovery in quantum meruit; and (3) denying the town\u2019s claim for liquidated damages. Both parties claim that the judge\u2019s calculation of prejudgment interest was erroneous. We affirm the judgment except for the interest award, which we vacate and remand for further calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>In December, 1987, the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE) (now known as the Department of Environmental Protection) ordered the town to close its landfill septage lagoons and to construct a new treatment facility for septage and grease wastes. Pursuant to this order, the town contracted with an engineering firm, Metcalf &amp; Eddy (M &amp; E), to plan and to design these facilities. In October, 1989, it contracted with the plaintiff to act as general contractor for the project. The contract called for the plaintiff to complete its work by January 27, 1991, but included provisions for extending the deadline.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The agreement also provided that, absent an excused extension, the plaintiff would pay liquidated damages in the amount of $400 for each day after January 27, 1991, that the work remained incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Deemed \u201cprimarily an equipment procurement job,\u201d the project required the plaintiff first to submit proposed drawings and then, pending M &amp; E\u2019s approval, to procure several pieces of equipment for the facility. One such piece of equipment was a vertical progressive cavity pump (pump). The contract between the plaintiff and the town permitted the plaintiff to select any pump model from one of the manufacturers identified in the project specifications. The plaintiff chose a pump made by Robbins &amp; Myers and subsequently submitted several drawings of the pump to M &amp; E.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> M &amp; E repeatedly rejected the drawings, claiming, among other things, that the Robbins &amp; Myers pump was too tall and contained a platform for which there was no space at the facility. These requirements, however, were not included in the original contract or project specifications. Ultimately, the plaintiff was forced to select another manufacturer\u2019s pump, to submit drawings, and to install it at the facility. According to M &amp; E\u2019s initial analysis, this installation (when combined with the plaintiff\u2019s other work under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>contract) made the project 99.87% complete as of August 30, 1991, 215 days after the scheduled completion date. At the town\u2019s request M &amp; E then switched methodologies for determining substantial completion, and concluded that the plaintiff had completed less than 99% of the project as of that time. Consequently, the town ordered the plaintiff to perform additional work, which the plaintiff refused to do.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, on April 23, 1992, 451 days after the scheduled date of completion, M &amp; E deemed the project substantially complete for purposes of the contract. Because the plaintiff failed to comply with the agreement\u2019s time extension provisions, the town assessed liquidated damages in the amount of $180,400 against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">2. <em>General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 2. </em>The plaintiff first contends that the judge erred in denying its G. L. c. 93A claim. In his final report, the master concluded that the town was engaged in \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d when it contracted with the plaintiff, and that its refusal to declare the project substantially complete on August 30, 1991, constituted an unfair and deceptive trade practice in violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2. The judge disagreed in part, ruling that c. 93A was inapplicable because the town was not engaged in trade or commerce when it contracted with the plaintiff. We agree with the judge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Chapter 93A proscribes \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (a). A party is engaging in \u201ctrade or commerce,\u201d as required under c. 93A, when it acts \u201cin a business context.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Lantner </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>374 Mass. 606, 611 (1978). The statute contains no explicit indication that government entities like the town are subject to its provisions. <em>United States Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>Chi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>copee, </em>402 Mass. 228, 232 (1988). This court, however, has repeatedly held that c. 93A does not apply to parties motivated by \u201clegislative mandate, not business or personal reasons.\u201d <em>Poznik </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Medical Professional Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>417 Mass. 48, 52 (1994), quoting <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>412 Mass. 774, <em>777 </em>(1992). Cf. <em>Linkage Corp. </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston Univ., </em>425 Mass. 1, 25, cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 599 (1997) (defendant university engaged in trade or commerce in part because it \u201cdid not operate under any legislative constraints\u201d). Although not \u201cdispositive of the issue whether c. 93A applies,\u201d <em>Linkage Corp., supra </em>at 23, a party\u2019s status as a nonprofit operation has similarly influenced our analysis, <em>Poznik, supra </em>at 53; <em>All Seasons Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Health &amp; Hosps. of Boston, </em>416 Mass. 269, 271 (1993); <em>Barrett, supra </em>at 776, even where the wrongful behavior related to \u201can ordinary commercial contract.\u201d <em>United States Leasing Corp., supra </em>at 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In the present case, the town is a government entity that contracted with the plaintiff pursuant to an administrative order imposed by the DEQE. Such orders are enforced with the same power as statutes and, indeed, are the creations of a legislative enactment. G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 160, 162, 164. 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 22.00 et seq. (1994). The threat of a civil administra: five penalty or other punishment for violation of the order only underscores the fact that compliance with the order is indeed mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Furthermore, the town\u2019s waste treatment facility is not a profit-making operation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather, it merely sustains itself financially through a combination of subsidies from the town itself and \u201ctipping fees\u201d charged to the facility\u2019s users. Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s assertions, these fees are designed not to generate profits for the facilities or the town in general, but only to \u201cdefray[] the cost of constructing, operating and maintaining\u201d the facility. G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 31D. Compare <em>Linkage Corp. </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston Univ., supra </em>at 25 (defendant deemed to have engaged in trade or commerce when contracting with plaintiff in part because it was \u201cmotivated by a strong desire to benefit\u201d financially from its contract with plaintiff). Given the predominantly public motivation for both the construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the facility and the charging of fees, we conclude that the town was not acting \u201cin a business context\u201d when it contracted with the plaintiff and thus was not engaged in \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d as required by G. L. c. 93A. For this reason, we affirm the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s c. 93A claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">3. <em>Recovery on the contract. </em>The plaintiff next claims that the judge erred in denying it any recovery on the contract. In his final report, the master recommended that the judge award the plaintiff such recovery. The judge declined to follow this recommendation, concluding instead that the plaintiff\u2019s own breach barred recovery on the contract. On appeal, the plaintiff contends that its breach was excused because it was caused exclusively by the town\u2019s wrongful conduct. We disagree and affirm the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery on the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Contractors like the plaintiff \u201ccannot recover on the contract itself without showing complete and strict performance of all its terms.\u201d <em>Andre </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>305 Mass. 515, 516 (1940). Cf. <em>J.A. Sullivan Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>397 Mass. 789, 794 (1986). The plaintiff did not satisfy the strict terms of the contract when it failed substantially to complete its performance by January 27, 1991. Moreover, the plaintiff\u2019s claim that this failure was somehow excused is unavailing. While it may be true that a breach caused solely by the other party\u2019s behavior is generally excused, <em>Rigs </em>v. <em>Sokol, </em>318 Mass. 337, 345 (1945), the facts here establish that the plaintiff is also to blame for the delayed completion of the work. The master found that the project\u2019s delayed completion was caused by the plaintiff\u2019s own \u201cfailure to prioritize equipment procurement. . . failure to aggressively manage its schedule with respect to equipment procurement . . . delayed submission of initial shop drawings . . . and delayed resubmission of shop drawings.\u201d These delays, moreover, occurred with several major pieces of equipment aside from the delayed procurement of the pumps for which the town was responsible. Indeed, the master found that 40% of the project remained functionally incomplete as of July, 1991 \u2014 nearly six months after the contract\u2019s deadline. Consequently, it cannot be said that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to complete on time was caused solely by the town\u2019s wrongful rejection of the pump drawings. For this reason, the plaintiff\u2019s delay was not excused and thus recovery on the contract was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The town argues that the judge erred in not entering judgment in its favor. Specifically, the town contends that, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>neither the judge nor the master explicitly stated that any of the town\u2019s actions constituted a material breach of the contract, a favorable judgment was required. The town\u2019s claim, however, ignores the master\u2019s findings that (1) the town\u2019s rejection of the Robbins &amp; Myers pump constituted a constructive change to the drawings and specifications portion of the contract; and (2) the town\u2019s refusal to acknowledge substantial completion as of August 30, 1991, its determination that substantial completion occurred on April 23, 1992, and its recalculation of percentage complete based on the adjusted contract price rather than on the original contract price \u201cwere [actions] made in bad faith, capriciously and arbitrarily.\u201d It likewise ignores the fact that the judge denied liquidated damages because \u201c[the town] contributed to the delay of the project.\u201d Thus, contrary to the town\u2019s assertions, both the master and the judge determined that the town was in breach. We agree and conclude as a matter of law that the town was not entitled to judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">4. <em>Recovery in quantum meruit. </em>Although he denied recovery on the contract itself, the judge, acting pursuant to the master\u2019s recommendation in his supplemental report, did award the plaintiff damages under a quantum meruit theory. On appeal, the town claims that this was erroneous because the plaintiff\u2019s breach of the contract was not in good faith. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">A contractor \u201cmay recover in quantum meruit,\u201d if he can prove both substantial performance of the contract and an endeavor on his part in good faith to perform fully. <em>J.A. Sullivan Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 796, quoting <em>Andre </em>v. <em>Maguire, supra </em>at 516. Generally, \u201can intentional departure from the precise requirements of the contract is not consistent with good faith in the endeavor fully to perform it.\u201d <em>J.A. Sullivan Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 797, quoting <em>Andre </em>v. <em>Maguire, supra. </em>Here, the master expressly found that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to complete the project by January 27, 1991, was an unintentional departure from the contract\u2019s requirement. Indeed, he found that the plaintiff\u2019s delayed performance was at least \u201cin part\u201d caused by the town\u2019s improper rejection of the pumps. Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 53 (h) (1), we must accept these findings of fact unless we conclude that they are \u201cclearly erroneous, mutually inconsistent, unwarranted by the evidence before the master as a matter of law or are otherwise tainted by error of law.\u201d Since we do not so conclude, the judge\u2019s award of damages in quantum meruit is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>5. <em>The plaintiff\u2019s overhead expenses. </em>In calculating the plaintiff\u2019s quantum meruit recovery, the judge declined to include certain overhead expenses the plaintiff incurred from August 30, 1991, to April 23, 1992. The plaintiff now argues that this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In determining a quantum meruit recovery, the proper focus is \u201cthe value of the services rendered . . . or [] the fair value of what the defendant has received.\u201d <em>Ryan </em>v. Ryan, 419 Mass. 86, 94 n.12 (1994). See <em>J.A. Sullivan Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 797; 12 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 1477, at 261 n.18 (3d ed. 1970). In the present case, the plaintiff seeks to include in the quantum meruit recovery overhead costs incurred both in the field and at its home office from August 30, 1991, to April 23, 1992. These costs, however, did not directly confer any value or benefit on the town. Rather, as the traditional definition of the term \u201coverhead\u201d suggests, the plaintiff was merely incurring \u201cbusiness expenses . . . not chargeable to a particular part of the work or product.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 841 (9th ed. 1991). Accordingly, such costs do not belong in any quantum meruit award.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">6. <em>The town\u2019s liquidated damages. </em>The town also contends that the judge erred when he determined that the town was not entitled to liquidated damages for the plaintiff\u2019s delayed completion of the project.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Liquidated damages are inappropriate here. This court has held that, where both the plaintiff (contractor) and the defendant (owner) were to blame for the plaintiff\u2019s delayed completion of a project, the defendant was not entitled to liquidated damages. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>316 Mass. 413, 418 (1944).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As previously noted, the plaintiff and the town in the present case were independently culpable for the delay in substantial completion until August 30, 1991. Moreover, it appears that the town\u2019s refusal to deem the project substantially complete in August, 1991, single handedly caused the further delay in actual completion until April 23, 1992. Hence, under <em>Morgan </em>and other relevant authority, liquidated damages are improper with respect to both delays. See 5 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 789, at 764 (3d ed. 1961) (\u201cWhere both parties are at fault a party who has contributed to the breach cannot recover a sum stipulated as liquidated damages, even though performance of the contract is continued, and the other party thereafter is at fault\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">7. <em>Interest calculations. </em>In his final report, the master awarded the plaintiff prejudgment interest at 8.2% for the \u201cnet [cjontract balance\u201d of $180,692, pursuant to G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39K. Its accrual date was November 3, 1991. The master also found that, under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, the plaintiff was entitled to 12% interest for the \u201cincreased field and home office overhead amount of $388,644.\u201d The accrual date here was January 1, 1992, \u201cbeing the approximate midpoint of when those [overhead] costs were incurred, i.e., 31 August 1991 through 27 April 1992.\u201d In his first memorandum of decision and order, the judge stated only that no award of interest under \u00a7 39K was warranted because the plaintiff\u2019s damages were in quantum meruit, not on the contract itself. Then, in his supplemental report, the master found that \u201c[i]nterest at the statutory rate of 12% pursuant to M.G.L. c. 231 \u00a7 6C is to be applied to the net amount due and owing to Peabody of $180,692.00, commencing as of 1 January 1992. \u201d Finally, in his second memorandum of decision and order, the judge affirmed the master\u2019s supplemental report, concluding that under \u00a7 6C the plaintiff was entitled to quantum meruit damages \u201cin the amount of $266,692 plus 12% interest, commencing as of January 1, 1992 until paid.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">On appeal, both parties agree that the proper rate of interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>is 8.2%, but differ on whether prejudgment interest is appropriate and, if so, the date on which it accrues. The plaintiff primarily contends that \u00a7 6C mandates an interest award from November 3, 1991. In contrast, the town claims that, because the plaintiff \u201cnever submitted a claim . . . based on quantum meruit,\u201d no recovery under \u00a7 6C is warranted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6C, governs the calculation of prejudgment interest in contract actions. It provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">\u201cIn all actions based on contractual obligations, upon a verdict, finding or order for judgment for pecuniary damages, interest shall be added <em>... at the contract rate, </em>if established, or at the rate of twelve per cent per annum, <em>from the date of the breach or demand. </em>If the date of the breach or demand is not established, interest shall be added . . . <em>from the date of the commencement of the action\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">In the present case, no issue is presented to this court regarding the appropriate rate of interest to be applied under \u00a7 6C. Both parties agree that 8.2% is the appropriate interest rate under the terms of their contract. Rather, the primary issue lies in the date from which the interest accrues. Under \u00a7 6C, interest accrues \u201cfrom the date of the breach or demand [if] established.\u201d Where no demand is made and multiple breaches occur, however, interest must accrue \u201cfrom the date of the commencement of the action.\u201d There is no evidence here that any demand was made by the plaintiff. Furthermore, each party was responsible for at least one breach of the contract: (1) on January 3, 1991, when the town rejected the second formal Robbins &amp; Myers pump submittal when such pump complied with the drawings and specifications; (2) on August 30, 1991, when the town refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>to declare the project substantially complete; and (3) on January 27, 1991, when the plaintiff failed to complete the project. In this context the date of breach was not established and prejudgment interest under \u00a7 6C must accrue from \u201cthe date of the commencement of the action,\u201d or December 3, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In short, the plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest at the rate of 8.2% from December 3, 1991. To the extent that the judge\u2019s order is inconsistent with this conclusion, it is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">8. <em>The town\u2019s other claimed losses. </em>The town makes several other claims regarding the judge\u2019s award to the plaintiff. First, the town claims that the plaintiff\u2019s recovery should be offset in the amount of $45,000, for engineering work the town performed in preparation for the plaintiff\u2019s planned installation of three \u201cgate valves\u201d at the facility.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The plaintiff never actually installed these valves because, as the master found, it devised a new method under which the valves were unnecessary. The master found, as a matter of fact, that the town, through M &amp; E, approved the new method without \u201ca change order deleting the cost of the three gate valves.\u201d Because these findings were not clearly erroneous, see Mass. R. Civ. R 53, <em>Pollock </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>391 Mass. 543, 554 (1984), and cases cited, we will not disturb the denial of the $45,000 offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Second, the town claims that the judge erred in including in the plaintiff\u2019s quantum meruit award $23,092 for additional costs the plaintiff incurred in purchasing a pump to replace the rejected Robbins &amp; Myers pump.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree. Unlike the plaintiff\u2019s overhead costs, the amount spent by the plaintiff to purchase the replacement pump directly benefited the town. <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>419 Mass. 86, 94 n.12 (1994). Moreover, the plaintiff incurred this amount only because the town had wrongfully rejected the Robbins &amp; Myers pump. Consequently, the judge did not err in including $23,092 in the plaintiff\u2019s quantum meruit award.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Third, the town complains that the judge erred in declining to offset the plaintiff\u2019s recovery by $70,000 \u2014 the amount the plaintiff received to settle a dispute with Robbins &amp; Myers. An offset of this kind is appropriate only where the plaintiff\u2019s settlement constitutes \u201ccompensation for the same losses which [it] seek[s] to recover from the [town].\u201d <em>Danca </em>v. <em>Taunton Sav. Bank, </em>385 Mass. 1, 10 (1982). In the present case, the plaintiff is seeking to recover from the town, in quantum meruit, the costs it incurred for the labor and materials accruing to the town. The record does not demonstrate that the amount of the Robbins &amp; Myers settlement was for anything that benefited the town.

The master, however, correctly characterized his statement that the town was engaged in trade or commerce as a \u201cConclusion of Law.\u201d \u201cTo the extent that the master\u2019s ultimate findings are conclusions of law, they are subject to independent judicial review.\u201d <em>Pollock </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>391 Mass. 543, 555 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b459-9\">This, in turn, depends on a number of factors, including \u201cthe nature of the transaction, the character of the parties involved, and [their] activities . . . and whether the transaction [was] motivated by business or personal reasons.\u2019\u2019 <em>Begelfer </em>v. <em>Najarian, </em>381 Mass. 177, 190-191 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b460-7\">We have previously stated that, in the context of G.

Under Mass. R. Civ. P. 53 (h) (2), as appearing in 386 Mass. 1237 (1982), a party\u2019s failure to file timely objections to a master\u2019s subsidiary factual findings precludes that party from challenging those findings. In the present case, however, the judge did not tamper with the master\u2019s findings of fact, but instead disagreed with his conclusion of law that liquidated damages were warranted. Moreover, the judge\u2019s refusal to award liquidated damages was correct as a matter of law. In these circumstances, \u201c[w]e examine the contents of the confirmed report to determine whether the conclusions reached in the final judgment are \u2018such as the law requires upon the facts found by the master and proper inferences therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Antioch Temple, Inc. </em>v. <em>Parekh, </em>383 Mass. 854, 863 (1981), quoting <em>Foot </em>v. <em>Bauman, </em>333 Mass. 214, 219 (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b464-9\">This court concluded in that case that \u201cthe delay, <em>not having been caused by the fault or neglect of the plaintiff, </em>would not establish any right in the town to claim or withhold anything by way of liquidated damages\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>316 Mass. 413, 418 (1944). Because the plaintiff in the present case was partially at fault, any reliance on <em>Morgan </em>by it is misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b464-10\">The amount awarded, $266,692, represents the quantum meruit award of the master, plus $86,000 which had previously been excluded by the master as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the town\u2019s liquidated damages award. As discussed above, the judge rejected the town\u2019s claim for liquidated damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Both parties appear to agree that, because the plaintiff did not recover on the contract, an interest award under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39K, is improper. Assuming that \u00a7 39K applies to this project, we agree. As the Appeals Court concluded in <em>Acme Plastering Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 669, 677 (1986), prejudgment interest under \u00a7 39K applies only where the contractor\u2019s recovery is on the contract itself. \u201cHad the Legislature intended to provide for recovery of penalty interest where the payment was for work not done under the terms of the contract ... it could simply have done so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The master stated that the town claimed that its $45,000 loss stemmed from engineering work it performed in preparation for the plaintiff\u2019s installation of the gate valves. On appeal the town does not argue that, because the valves were never installed, their cost should have been deducted from the plaintiff\u2019s quantum meruit award. Consequently, we must address only the claims presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b466-9\">According to the master\u2019s final report, the plaintiff paid $59,092 for the substitute pump, and received a credit from Robbins &amp; Myers for $36,000 for the cancellation of the plaintiff\u2019s order. Thus, the net additional costs incurred by the plaintiff were $23,092.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\">We reach this figure by subtracting the town\u2019s previous payments to the plaintiff, $3,198,806, and the town\u2019s previous payments of $4,000 for the plaintiff\u2019s electricity costs from the value of material and labor supplied by the plaintiff (and the plaintiff\u2019s other expenses), $3,469,498.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
