Appellant has also appealed the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-18\">Appellant assigns the following three errors for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>\u201cI. The trial court committed reversible error in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to compel certain documents from the insurance adjusters\u2019 file, inasmuch as said information tended to impeach the testimony of appellee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">\u201cII. The trial court committed reversible error in (A) excluding the testimony of James Cookson and Melanie Smith, independent insurance adjusters for appellee\u2019s liability insurance company, (B) excluding from evidence a document entitled Activity Log\u2019 obtained by appellant during the course of discovery from appellee\u2019s insurance adjuster, (C) excluding from evidence all evidence of prior inconsistent statements made by appellee, and (D) excluding all evidence of liability insurance, inasmuch as said testimony and evidence was relevant to the issue of ownership and as a basis to impeach appellee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">\u201cHI. The trial court committed reversible error in overruling appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">According to appellant, on March 6, 1994, he was driving a brown Ford Thunderbird on State Route 104 in Scioto County, Ohio when he encountered a black and white cow standing on the highway. Appellant swerved into the other lane in order to miss the cow, but an oncoming truck forced him back into his own lane where he immediately encountered a different cow, this one being red and white, also on the highway. Due to the oncoming truck, appellant was unable to maneuver around this second cow and he \u201csideswiped\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Appellant immediately pulled to the side of the road in order to determine whose cow he had struck. The person at the first house he approached stated that his only cow was secured in the barn. Appellant then thought the cows might have belonged to appellee, so he proceeded to appellee\u2019s house a short distance away. Appellant testified that after telling appellee that he might have struck one of his cows, they walked back to appellee\u2019s barn. According to appellant, there was a black and white and a red and white cow standing in front of the barn\u2019s gate. After allegedly telling appellant, \u201cMy kids must have left the gate open,\u201d appellee opened the gate and the two cows walked into the barnyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">On the other hand, appellee\u2019s recollection about that night\u2019s events differed substantially from appellant\u2019s testimony. First, appellee testified that appellant was driving a white car, possibly a Chevrolet Cavalier, and not a brown Thunderbird. Second, appellee stated that when the two of them walked back to his barn, there were no cows standing outside of the fence. And, finally, appellee denied telling appellant that anyone had left the gate open.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">Appellant filed a complaint alleging that he suffered permanent personal injuries as a proximate result of appellee\u2019s negligence in permitting his cows to run on the highway. Appellee denied that any of his cows were on the highway or at large on the night in question. When this matter proceeded to trial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>jury returned a defense verdict. Appellant filed a motion for a new trial, which appellee opposed. When the trial court denied his motion, appellant filed a timely notice of appeal from both the jury verdict and the denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Appellant contends in his first assignment of error that the trial court improperly denied his motion to compel discovery. The record reflects that Grange Mutual Casualty Company, appellee\u2019s liability insurer, contracted with GAB Business Services, Inc. (\u201cGAB\u201d) to conduct an investigation into the incident. James Cookson, an adjuster with GAB, telephoned appellee as part of his investigation. Following his conversation with appellee, Cookson made the following entry in the activity log of GAB\u2019s claims file: \u201cC/insd discussed did see calf but questions damages.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant also learned that approximately twelve days after Cookson spoke with appellee on the telephone, Cookson sent a report to Grange that stated, \u201cYour insured\u2019s cow got loose * * Appellant\u2019s counsel got to see this report only briefly and was not provided with a copy of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Appellant later filed a motion to compel discovery, in which he moved the trial court \u201cto order Ms. [Melanie] Smith to produce any documents which may reflect communications of any sort with Mr. Turner, specifically any report in which Mr. Cookson or anyone else renders Mr. Turner\u2019s words to writing, summarizes Mr. Turner\u2019s words or describes the conversation in which Mr. Cookson interviewed Mr. Turner to learn the facts of the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Appellee responded with a motion <em>in limine </em>to prohibit appellant from asking any questions about the GAB claims file that Smith and Cookson had produced as agents of Grange. According to appellee, GAB\u2019s claims file is not discoverable due to both the work-product doctrine and the attorney-client privilege. After additional arguments in chambers prior to trial, the trial court made the following ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">\u201cLet me first say, that the first statement, it\u2019s a written note by Cookson and it says, patient <em>[sic </em>] saw cows and questions liability, is not, to me is not a real clear statement of what\u2019s said. I\u2019m going to not allow the Plaintiff to call Cookson or introduce any evidence about the file, for the reasons I have mentioned here today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">\u201cYes, I think you can call Turner on cross-examination and question him about the cows and that sort of thing, but I don\u2019t think you can then call Cookson or</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Smith as representatives of the insurance company as to things that were in the file as to statements being made by him, because if I do, any time you have the Defendant take the stand, can you then call the adjuster to say, \u2018Well, did he tell you this?\u2019 or \u2018Did he tell you that?\u2019, and I just think we open the flood gates that way. I think you can talk to Turner and use your client to say where the cows were and who owned cows, and your client can say he let him back in his gate and those were the only cows there and that sort of thing, but I don\u2019t think you can use Cookson.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u201cLet me also say that the statement that Cookson has is not real clear in itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">On appeal, appellant contends that the GAB\u2019s claims file documents he requested pertained directly to a primary issue of the litigation, <em>ie., </em>the ownership of the cow. Since the documents were prepared in the normal course of GAB\u2019s business under contract with Grange, appellant argues that the documents are discoverable pursuant to Civ.R. 26(B)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant also rejects appellee\u2019s argument that the documents are protected by either the work-product doctrine or the attorney-client privilege. In the alternative, however, appellant argues that even if the documents are protected by either theory, they are still discoverable under the \u201cgood cause\u201d exception of Civ.R. 26(B)(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The management of discovery lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State ex rel. Daggett v. Gessaman </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 55, 63 O.O.2d 88, 295 N.E.2d 659, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Karmasu v. Bendolph </em>(Feb. 21, 1996), Scioto App. No. 95CA2370, unreported, 1996 WL 79660. An appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s ruling on a matter of discovery for an abuse of discretion. <em>Daggett, supra, </em>at 58, 63 O.O.2d at 90, 295 N.E.2d at 661; <em>Glick v. Marler </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 752, 758, 613 N.E.2d 254, 258-259; <em>Smith v. Klein </em>(1985), 23 Ohio App.3d 146, 151, 23 OBR 387, 392-393, 492 N.E.2d 852, 858-859. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>An abuse of discretion connotes an attitude on the part of the trial court that is arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. <em>Franklin Cty. Sheriff's Dept. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 498, 506, 589 N.E.2d 24, 30-31. Moreover, when applying this standard of review, an appellate court may not freely substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. <em>In re Jane Doe 1 </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 135, 138, 566 N.E.2d 1181, 1184-1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Generally, a party may obtain discovery regarding any unprivileged matter that is relevant to the pending litigation. Civ.R. 26(B)(1). One method of obtaining discoverable material is to compel the production of documents from a person who is not a party to the action pursuant to Civ.R. 34(C) (production of documents) and Civ.R. 45 (subpoena). However, Civ.R. 45(F) expressly provides that this rule shall not be construed as authorizing a party to obtain information that is protected by any privil\u00e9ge authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In the landmark case of <em>In re Klemann </em>(1936), 132 Ohio St. 187, 7 O.O. 273, 5 N.E.2d 492, the plaintiff was injured when his car was struck by an automobile driven by the defendant on behalf of his employer. The driver completed a casualty report, which he gave to his employer, who forwarded the report to a local insurance agency, which then forwarded the original report to the insurance company and a copy of the report to the insurance company\u2019s attorney who was representing the employer. When the plaintiff later sought production of the casualty report, the defendants claimed that the report was privileged and therefore was not discoverable. The Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">\u201cWhere an insurer receives a report from its insured concerning a casualty covered by its policy of insurance, such report becomes the property of the insurer and subject to its complete control; and, when the insurer transmits it to its counsel for the purpose of preparing a defense against a possible law suit growing out of such casualty, such report constitutes a communication from client to attorney and is privileged against production and disclosure * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">More recently, in <em>Witt v. Fairfield Pub. School Dist. </em>(Apr. 22, 1996), Butler App. No. CA95-10-169, unreported, 1996 WL 189040, the court relied upon <em>Klemann </em>to prevent the production of witness statements taken by an insurance company. In that case, a child was injured while leaving the school at recess and the parents sued the school and the child\u2019s teacher for negligent supervision. A few months after the accident, the school\u2019s liability insurer obtained statements from the teacher, the school\u2019s nurse and the school\u2019s principal. When the plaintiffs later requested production of these statements, the defendants claimed the statements were privileged. The trial court agreed and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel their production. On appeal, the appellate court agreed that the statements were protected by the attorney-client privilege. The court noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>that \u201cwhile <em>Klemann </em>refers to reports rather than statements, there is no distinction between reports and statements for purposes of asserting the attorney-client privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See, also, <em>Roman v. Ivanho, Inc. </em>(Jan. 31, 1994), Stark App. No. CA-9302, unreported, 1994 WL 45837.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In the spirit of <em>Klemann, </em>and like the defendants in <em>Witt </em>and <em>Roman, </em>the defendant in this case spoke with an adjuster hired by his insurance carrier to investigate an incident that was potentially covered by an insurance policy issued to the defendant. This defendant, like thousands of other insureds in Ohio, was required to give a statement to his insurer or risk the insurer\u2019s denying him coverage for this incident. A brief note purportedly summarizing the defendant\u2019s statement to the GAB adjuster was then provided to Grange, which in turn provided the statement to defendant\u2019s counsel in order to prepare a defense against a possible lawsuit arising out of this alleged incident. As a result, this notation regarding the defendant\u2019s statement constitutes a communication from client to attorney and is privileged against production and disclosure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, like the trial court, we conclude that the notes taken by Cookson are too summary and vague to be classified as Turner\u2019s statements absent some acknowledgement or ratification by Turner. See Civ.R. 26(B)(3), cited at fn. 3 above.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">We also note that appellant is not entitled to the documents under the \u201cgood cause\u201d exception, of Civ.R. 26(B)(3). According to this rule, documents prepared in anticipation of litigation are conditionally privileged. That is, although initially considered privileged, these documents are subject to discovery if the requesting party demonstrates good cause. However, in this case, we have held that the documents requested by appellant are protected by the attorney-client privilege and are thus absolutely privileged and not subject to disclosure in the absence of a valid waiver of the privilege by the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">After reviewing the record in this matter, we hold that the trial court\u2019s decision to deny appellant\u2019s motion to compel discovery of specific documents in GAB\u2019s claims file was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court improperly excluded evidence that was relevant both to prove that appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>owned the cows involved in this incident and to impeach appellee\u2019s denial of ownership. The specific evidence that appellant sought to introduce was the testimony of GAB adjusters Cookson and Smith, the activity log purportedly containing an admission of ownership by appellee, evidence of prior inconsistent statements by appellee and evidence of appellee\u2019s liability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The admission or exclusion of evidence lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Finnerty </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 104, 107, 543 N.E.2d 1233, 1236-1237; <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus. A trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>O\u2019Brien v. Angley </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 159, 163, 17 O.O.3d 98, 100, 407 N.E.2d 490, 493-494. An abuse of discretion connotes an attitude on the part of the trial court that is arbitrary, unreasonable or unconscionable. <em>Franklin Cty. Sheriff's Dept., supra. </em>Moreover, when applying this standard of review, an appellate court may not freely substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Jane Doe 1, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Appellant\u2019s arguments in this assignment of error regarding the testimony of Cookson and Smith, the activity log, and the evidence regarding appellee\u2019s alleged prior inconsistent statements were essentially disposed of above. That is, appellant concedes in his brief that the \u201cpurpose of calling Mr. Cookson and Ms. Smith was to impeach Mr. Turner\u2019s deposition and trial testimony that he did not see or own the cow.\u201d These two witnesses could impeach appellee\u2019s denial only by testifying about the allegedly inconsistent statement made by appellee to Cookson as noted in the activity log. However, we have already determined that the activity log contained information that is protected by the attorney-client privilege and is therefore inadmissible. Since the witnesses\u2019 testimony about information contained in the activity log was inadmissible, and since appellant has failed to allege the existence of any inconsistent statements other than the purported statements made to Cookson, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The final issue in this assignment of error concerns the trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence concerning appellee\u2019s liability insurance. Generally, Evid.R. 411 states that evidence that a person was insured against liability is not admissible upon the issue of whether he acted negligently. However, the rule also provides an exception to the general rule. That is, the rule permits the admission of evidence of liability insurance \u201cwhen offered for another purpose, such as proof of agency, ownership or control, if controverted, or bias or prejudice of a witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">In this case, appellant argues that he offered evidence of appellee\u2019s liability insurance in order to demonstrate ownership and bias. Appellant claims that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>\u201cissue of ownership allowed appellant to show the jury that Mr. Turner spoke with his insurance company about ownership and made certain admissions to [it].\u201d In addition to the fact that these statements are privileged, we also hold that this evidence does not fall within the exception provided in Evid.R. 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">As noted in 1 Giannelli &amp; Snyder, Evidence (1996) 350, Section 411.5, insurance coverage of certain objects or premises is probative of a party\u2019s ownership of those objects or premises. This rule is based on the presumption that persons would not state that they have or do not have insurance on an object which they did not own. For example, in <em>State v. Laub </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 517, 621 N.E.2d 585, the defendant was charged with aggravated vehicular homicide. During the state\u2019s case, a witness to the accident was asked what the defendant said when he got out of the car. Over counsel\u2019s objection, the witness testified that the defendant stated that he had no insurance. The appellate court affirmed the admission of this evidence because one of the issues in the case was whether the defendant had operated the vehicle involved in the accident. Because the defendant had not stipulated his operation of the vehicle in question, the court held that \u201c[t]he jury was entitled to hear the subject statement for whatever help it would be in deciding the disputed fact.\u201d <em>Id., </em>86 Ohio App.3d at 519, 621 N.E.2d at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Applying the logic of the rule to the particular facts in this case, we hold that the trial court properly excluded evidence of appellee\u2019s liability insurance. In this case, although appellee admits that he owns cows and that he has liability insurance that covers his cows, appellee denies that it was his cows which caused appellant\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">There is nothing intrinsic either to the policy or the cows that would properly assist the appellant in identifying the wandering bovine as belonging to the appellee. We do not believe that Evid.R. 411 permits appellant to use the existence of appellee\u2019s liability insurance, in general, to establish his ownership of an unidentified object. The following example illustrates an appropriate use of this rule of evidence: Appellant\u2019s vehicle strikes a red and white cow which has been branded \u201cJT\u201d; during discovery, appellee discloses a liability policy which requires all of his livestock to be branded \u201cJT,\u201d appellee\u2019s initials; appellee later denies he owned the cow, branded \u201cJT,\u201d which appellant struck; appellant then uses the liability policy to establish that appellee owns livestock branded \u201cJT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Appellant next claims that the \u201cissue of bias allowed appellant to show that Mr. Cookson now works for Mr. Turner\u2019s insurance company.\u201d We hold that this evidence does not fall within the exception enumerated in Evid.R. 411. 1 Giannelli &amp; Snyder, Evidence (1996) 350, Section 411.6, provides that evidence of insurance may be admitted in order to prove bias or prejudice on the part of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>witness. A classic example of the application of this rule occurred in <em>Ede v. Atrium S. OB-GYN, Inc. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 124, 642 N.E.2d 365. That case involved a medical malpractice action against a gynecologist and his corporation. When the doctor called another gynecologist to testify as an expert on his behalf, the plaintiff sought to demonstrate that both doctors were insured by the same malpractice carrier. According to the plaintiff, the expert had a potential bias and financial interest in the outcome of the case because fewer successful malpractice claims meant lower premiums charged for malpractice insurance. Although the trial court excluded the evidence, the Supreme Court reasoned that the evidence was admissible because the trial court did not appreciate the probative value of establishing that both doctors were insured by the same company.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">We hold that the trial court properly excluded the evidence regarding appellee\u2019s liability insurance because Cookson, the person whom appellant wanted to impeach in this case, was not called as a witness on behalf of appellee. If appellee had called Cookson as a witness to testify that his investigation of this incident revealed that appellee\u2019s cows were not involved, then appellant could have impeached Cookson\u2019s testimony by demonstrating that it was in his employer\u2019s best interest to deny liability coverage for the incident. However, since appellee admitted he was not going to call Cookson as a witness and since we have already held that it was improper for appellant to call Cookson as an adverse witness on cross-examination, the trial court properly excluded this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Appellant contends in his third assignment of error that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a new trial filed pursuant to Civ.R. 59(A)(1) and (9).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to appellant, he was entitled to a new trial because the court\u2019s rulings denying his motion to compel and excluding the various pieces of evidence regarding appellee\u2019s liability insurance prevented him from having a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">The granting of a motion for a new trial rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>discretion. <em>Rohde v. Farmer </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St.2d 82, 52 O.O.2d 376, 262 N.E.2d 685, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Thompson v. Hayslip </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d 829, 836, 600 N.E.2d 756, 761. Based on our determinations that the trial court did not err in its discovery and evidentiary rulings, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled. Therefore, the judgment of the Scioto County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b284-6\">Stephenson, P.J. and Peter B.
