Shortly after she entered Zeb\u2019s vehicle, appellant approached the vehicle and tried to pull her out of the car by her hair. Shointa screamed for Zeb to pull away.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>As Zeb Freeman drove away with Shointa, appellant followed in his vehicle. Appellant attempted to force the car off the road. Zeb Freeman turned and began traveling back toward Shointa\u2019s residence. Zeb attempted to enter State Route 30, but appellant blocked the entrance with his vehicle. Another vehicle struck Zeb\u2019s car from the side.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">As the driver of the second vehicle appeared to be injured, Zeb began to walk to a nearby fire station for help. He turned and saw appellant inside his car, punching Shointa in the face. Her face was bruised, and her eye was red and swollen.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Appellant was charged with domestic violence in the Canton Municipal Court. The case proceeded to jury trial. Shointa Smith testified on behalf of appellant that he never struck her. Appellant was convicted as charged and sentenced to one hundred eighty days\u2019 incarceration, with ninety days suspended, and fined $100. He assigns a single error on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motions for a mistrial based upon prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Before the jury trial began, the court granted appellant\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>to exclude any evidence of past acts of domestic violence against Shointa Smith. Appellant argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by persistently referring to past instances of conduct, despite the ruling on the motion <em>in limine, </em>and the court\u2019s admonishment to stay away from that line of questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">The prosecutor is not only entitled but encouraged to advocate strongly for conviction. <em>State v. Draughn </em>(1992), 76 Ohio App.3d 664, 671, 602 N.E.2d 790, 793-794. But while he may strike hard blows, the prosecutor is not at liberty to strike foul ones. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Berger v. United States </em>(1935), 295 U.S. 78, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\"> The prosecutor\u2019s conduct must always be judged within the context of the entire case. <em>Draughn, </em>76 Ohio App.3d at 671, 602 N.E.2d at 793-794. The trial of the case is under the control of the trial judge, who must monitor the proceedings as they develop and control the conduct of both counsel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">When misconduct occurs, the trial judge should admonish the prosecutor, and if the conduct is severe enough, admonish him within the presence of the jury. He should instruct the jury to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s statements only if requested by defense counsel. <em>Id. </em>If appellant moves for a mistrial, the court should overrule the motion only if satisfied that the conduct will not result in a miscarriage of justice, considering the curative steps taken by the court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">When reviewed by the appellate court, we should examine the climate and conduct of the entire trial, and reverse the trial court\u2019s decision as to whether to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>grant a mistrial only for a gross abuse of discretion. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>State v. Maurer (1984), 15 </em>Ohio St.3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, certiorari denied (1985), 472 U.S. 1012, 105 S.Ct. 2714, 86 L.Ed.2d 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Courts have been quick to label prosecutorial behavior misconduct but justify affirming the conviction on the basis that the evidence of guilt is overwhelming. <em>Draughn, </em>76 Ohio App.3d at 672, 602 N.E.2d at 794. The incongruity of this rationale is that the better the state\u2019s case, the more leeway is given to the prosecutor to overstep. <em>Id. </em>As it is in the close case where the conduct is scrutinized more closely, a prosecutor jeopardizes his or her case by misconduct in direct proportion to its prosecutive merit. <em>Id. </em>This court has previously asserted that the consequences of misconduct should be resolved essentially without regard to the merit of the evidence, as the quality and quantity of the evidence are almost always subject to an independent assignment of error and judicial review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In the instant case, the transcript is fraught with instances where the prosecutor badgered witnesses, argued with the court in front of the jury, and repeatedly referred to past instances of appellant\u2019s misconduct, in direct contravention of the ruling of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The following instances of misconduct occurred during the questioning of Zeb Freeman, a witness for the state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">\u201cQ. Do you remember what street that was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">\u201cA. I was at Cherry exit viaduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">\u201cQ. Okay. And I got to say, if that were me I would think that, what in the heck is going on, this crazy guy is trying to run me off the road\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-11\">\u201cBY MR. WAKSER: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">\u201cBY THE COURT: That\u2019s sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-13\">\u201cQ. You were asked a lot of questions about your relationship and Mr. Gardner\u2019s relationship with Shointa. In fact, you\u2019re aware of their relationship, aren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-14\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-15\">\u201cQ. In fact, I\u2019ve instructed you not to talk about that relationship, isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-16\">\u201cA.

I\u2019m not going to permit any other inquiry along these lines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">\u201cQ. A box cutter. Okay. And now although I normally would never ask this question of a witness, since in fact, it was brought out on direct examination, I\u2019m going to because they already heard part of it. Were you charged with a crime regarding this box cutter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">\u201cBY MR. WAKSER: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">\u201cBY THE COURT: That\u2019s sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">\u201cQ. Were you ever charged with a crime of dishonesty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Sus\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-10\">\u201cBY MR. MARAGAS: I\u2019m allowed to ask that question, Your Honor. It\u2019s Rule 609.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-11\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Not a conviction. I\u2019ll sustain the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-12\">\u201cBY MR. MARAGAS: A crime of dishonesty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-13\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Well, for one thing there is no such crime at least in what I\u2019ve seen. Are you talking about perjury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-14\">\u201cBY MR. MARAGAS: Well, I think, Your Honor, what I\u2019m saying is that under Rule 609 I\u2019m entitled to ask the witness if he\u2019s been charged with a crime of dishonesty or a felony. Especially if it\u2019s my witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-15\">\u201cBY THE COURT: To bolster his \u2014 no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-16\">\u201cBY MR MARAGAS: Well, it\u2019s already been\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-17\">\u201cBY THE COURT: \u2014 I\u2019m not going to permit that, I\u2019ll sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-18\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-19\">\u201cQ.

You know of his reputation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-22\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-23\">\u201cQ. Okay, would you have a reason to be in fear of Mr. Gardner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-24\">\u201cBY MR. WAKSER: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-25\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-26\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-27\">:BY MR.

Now Mr. Freeman, you took no aggressive action towards my client other than pulling a knife and a baseball bat, right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">\u201cBY MR. MARAGAS: Oh, objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">\u201cBY MR. MARAGAS: Isn\u2019t this what we just got done talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">\u201cBY THE COURT: I\u2019m going to overrule the objection, Mr. Maragas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">\u201cBY MR. MARAGAS: Then may I get into his past?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Mr. Maragas, no. Sit down.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">The following instances of misconduct occurred during the testimony of Jason Page, a defense witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-12\">\u201cQ. But I think the main point I want to make sure about is that although they were having words in the car and although Zebb got out of the car with a knife and a bat, Steven, being the brave man that he is, gets in Zebb\u2019s car\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-13\">\u201cBY MR.

MARAGAS: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-24\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Let\u2019s just ask a question and preferably a simple question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqR\">\u201cBY MR.

I do not understand, why a person would get out of their car and go towards another person\u2019s car who has a bat and a knife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-27\">\u201cA. Out his car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-28\">\u201cQ. Yes, why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-29\">\u201cA. To get his phone and talk to his woman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>\u201cQ. This guy must be really brave, I don\u2019t understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">\u201cBY MR. WAKSER: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">\u201cBY THE COURT: This is getting argumentative, I\u2019ll sustain that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u00ab* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">\u201cQ. Okay. So, I\u2019m asking you again, did you know why your friend, Steve, ignored the threat of a bat and a knife being held in the hands of Zebb, and blatantly went into Zebb\u2019s car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">\u201cBY MR. WAKSER: Objection, Your Honor. It\u2019s been asked and answered and assuming facts not in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-10\">\u201cBY MR. MARAGAS: It\u2019s not been answered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-11\">\u201cBY THE COURT: He did answer it. He did answer it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\">\u201cBY MR. MARAGAS: Well, refresh my mind, why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-13\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m not going to do that, he answered it. Move on to another area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-14\">The following instances of misconduct occurred during the examination of Shointa Smith:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-15\">\u201cQ. If Steve \u2014 this is a direct quote from Mr. Wakser. If Steve would have assaulted you, you would have told the police and prosecutor, you answered, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-16\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-17\">\u201cQ. Well, it just so happened, that you have told the police about prior incidents, and you did not prosecute. We ended up in this very same position, we had to dismiss\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-18\">\u201cBY MR. WAKSER: Objection, Your Honor, may we approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-19\"><em>tl* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-20\">\u201cQ. She drove you back and forth from North Canton to Canton. If you didn\u2019t have the time to come here and testify, when you were subpoenaed to testify, isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-21\">\u201cBY MR. WAKSER: I\u2019m going to object, we\u2019re not here \u2014 the witness is not a defendant or accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-22\">\u201cBY MR. MARAGAS: She is a hostile witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-23\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Okay, well,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-24\">\u201cBY MR. MARAGAS: And she\u2019s your witness, by the way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-25\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Okay, Counsel if you have any comments to make, you make it to the bench. I think you made your point, Mr. Maragas. I\u2019m going to sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>\u00ab* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">\u201cQ. Uh huh (yes). Do you know of any particular reason why your mother would call our office fearful of your health, in regard to this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">\u201cBY MR. WAKSER: Objection, irrelevant, Your Honor, assuming facts not in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Yes, unless you\u2019re going to bring her mother in here, I\u2019m going to sustain that objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">\u201cQ All right. Here\u2019s her notes. Tell me if this is correct. There was a car wreck, the police came, the victim says the defendant hit her in the face, wouldn\u2019t say much else, said last time she pressed charges \u2014 oh, excuse me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">\u201cMR. WAKSER: I\u2019m going to object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-10\">\u201cBY MR. MARAGAS: I apologize to the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-11\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Okay, sustained, jury will disregard that last question. Okay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">Further, in closing argument, the prosecutor stated that dealing with a hostile witness is very difficult, especially when the hostile witness is the victim, as battered women\u2019s syndrome is a pretty tough thing to deal with.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">While the court sustained appellant\u2019s objections to the inappropriate statements and editorial comments by the prosecutor, the record does not demonstrate that the prosecutor was strongly admonished to end his inappropriate conduct, either in or out of the presence of the jury. The court did give several cautionary instructions to the jury to disregard any comments relative to past instances of domestic violence by appellant. However, given the improper tenor of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct throughout the entire trial and the prosecutor\u2019s \u25a0persistence is asking inappropriate questions after the court repeatedly sustained appellant\u2019s objections, we conclude that the court abused its discretion in overruling appellant\u2019s motions for mistrial. The case hinged solely on the credibility of the eyewitnesses, all of whom were close friends of either appellant or the victim. We cannot conclude that the error was harmless in the instant case. The prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was so prejudicial and so pervasive that the steps taken by the court were insufficient to cure the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">The prosecutor attempts to argue now that appellant opened the door to questioning concerning past instances of misconduct. He directs our attention to two questions asked by defense counsel to Shointa Smith, concerning whether appellant struck her \u201cat any time.\u201d However, viewing the questions in the context of the trial, it is clearly apparent that the prosecutor was referring the incident occurring on June 24, 1997, and the question was directed to whether appellant struck her at any time on that night. Further, if the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>believed that appellant had opened the door to such questioning, the issue should have been addressed at side bar and not in front of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Attorneys who know how to think but have not learned respect or how to behave toward the court, their opponent, or the witnesses are a menace and a liability, not an asset, to the administration of justice. We suggest the necessity for civility and respect is relevant to lawyers because they are the living exemplars' \u2014 and thus teachers \u2014 everyday, in every case, and in every court, and their worst conduct will be emulated more readily than their best.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The judgment of conviction and sentence is reversed. This ease is remanded to the Canton Municipal Court for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b576-9\">Farmer, P.J., and John W.
