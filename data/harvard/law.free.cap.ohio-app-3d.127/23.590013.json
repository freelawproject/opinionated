This saga unfolded after Dr. Singh castrated a cat named Buster in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-16\">After Singh neutered Buster, the cat experienced complications, such as swelling in the genital area and a blockage in the urinary tract, during the next few days. Buster was treated by another veterinarian and recovered from the complications. Buster\u2019s owner, Karen Bicknell, filed a complaint against Singh with the board almost a year after the complications developed. Approximately a year after Bicknell filed the complaint, the board notified Singh. Singh wrote to the board, expressing surprise and detailing the care and treatment he gave Buster. A few months later, the board subpoenaed Singh\u2019s records pertaining to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Buster\u2019s treatment. Singh complied. The board then assigned the complaint to its sole investigator, James Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">For well over a year, no action was taken on the complaint. In the meantime, Singh filed a federal lawsuit against the board, the individual board members, and Thompson, alleging discrimination and harassment based on his national origin. This lawsuit was based on matters other than what is at issue in this appeal. A little more than a month after the lawsuit was filed, on January 3, 1995, Thompson appeared at Singh\u2019s office. Thompson stated that he wanted to investigate the Bicknell complaint and to check whether Singh was complying with his thirty-day license suspension, which was imposed by the board for a matter unrelated to this appeal. On that day, Singh was not at his office, and Thompson confirmed that Singh was complying with his suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Two days later, on January 5, 1995, Thompson again appeared at Singh\u2019s office to investigate the Bicknell complaint and to check whether Singh was complying with his suspension. Thompson was confused about the timing of Singh\u2019s reinstatement, because Singh\u2019s suspension had actually ended the day before, on January 4. So Singh was in a back room of his office when Thompson arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">When he entered Singh\u2019s office, Thompson demanded to speak with Singh and to see his files pertaining to the Bicknell complaint. Singh\u2019s wife and Dr. Sinah, another veterinarian in the office, told Thompson that Singh\u2019s attorney had advised him not to speak with Thompson or to provide him with the records. Thompson left the premises. Two weeks later, Singh received an undated letter from the board authorizing Thompson to investigate a complaint. On February 2, 1995, Thompson again went to Singh\u2019s office. Singh was not there, and his wife told Thompson that the records were at their lawyer\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">The board then charged Singh with violating R.C. 4741.22(A) and (R) for failing to abide by rules governing the proper treatment of animals and for gross incompetence, and with departing from the minimum standards of care under Ohio Adm.Code 4741-1-03. Both of these charges grew out of the Bicknell complaint concerning Buster\u2019s surgery. Additionally, the board charged Singh with refusing to permit Thompson to inspect his business premises under R.C. 4741.22(Y).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">After a hearing, the board-appointed hearing examiner concluded that Singh\u2019s use of dimethyl sulfoxide, more commonly known as \u201cDMSO,\u201d fell below the minimum standards of care for veterinarians under R.C. 4741.22(A) and Ohio Adm.Code 4741-1-03(B). He held, though, that there was no evidence of gross incompetence under R.C. 4741.22(R) and dismissed that charge. The examiner further determined that Singh had refused to allow Thompson to inspect his business premises on January 5,1995, in violation of R.C. 4741.22(Y). Singh filed objections to the examiner\u2019s report. The board adopted the examiner\u2019s report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>and recommended penalties: a sixty-day veterinary license suspension, a $500 fine, and costs of $1,086.70.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Singh appealed the board\u2019s order to the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas. The trial court determined that the charges relating to Buster regarding violations of minimum standards of care, R.C. 4741.22(A) and Ohio Adm.Code 4741-1-03, were not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, and dismissed them. But the trial court upheld the board\u2019s finding that Singh had violated R.C. 4741.2200 by refusing to allow Thompson to inspect his business premises. The trial court then ordered the case back to the board for a recalculation of the appropriate discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Singh now brings three assignments of error from the trial court\u2019s decision that he violated R.C. 4741.22(Y). The board, however, has not appealed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the charges pertaining to Singh\u2019s alleged violations of the minimum standard of care for animals. In his first assignment, Singh contends that the trial court\u2019s decision upholding the board\u2019s finding of a violation of R.C. 4741.22(Y) was not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. We must disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In examining the first assignment, we must first determine our standard of review. In an administrative appeal under R.C. 119.12, a trial court must determine whether the decision by the administrative board or agency was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court must give due deference to the administrative resolution of evidentiary conflicts and must not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative board or agency.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">In <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd., </em>the Ohio Supreme Court explained the appellate court\u2019s standard of review in an appeal from a medical board\u2019s order: \u201cThe appellate court\u2019s review is even more limited than that of the trial court. While it is incumbent on the trial court to examine the evidence, this is not a function of the appellate court. The appellate court is to determine only if the trial court has abused its discretion * * <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are uncertain why our standard of review is more limited than that of the trial court. The trial court has taken no new evidence and has merely looked at the record of the case \u2014 just as we do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>now. We can find no support for that position in R.C. 119.12. We can see no reason for the added deference to the trial court\u2019s decision in these instances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We also note that the Ohio Supreme Court has stated that a different standard applies in unemployment compensation cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But we are forced to follow the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>Pons </em>and thus must review Singh\u2019s assignment under an abuse-of-discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">This abuse-of-discretion standard, however, applies only to factual issues. We review issues of law <em>de novo</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Applying this standard to Singh\u2019s first assignment, we are constrained to hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by upholding the board\u2019s order pertaining to R.C. 4741.2200. From the facts in the record, it is clear that during his investigation, Thompson wanted only to check Buster\u2019s original records. Singh\u2019s main contention seems to be that an inspection of the business premises under R.C. 4741.2200 does not contemplate the inspection of a veterinarian\u2019s records \u2014 and therefore that Singh did not refuse to allow Thompson to inspect his business premises. Singh contends that the purpose of a business-premises inspection under R.C. 4741.220/) is to check the facility for safety, sanitary conditions, and compliance with other applicable standards, and not to examine records. In support of this, Singh points to R.C. 4741.03(D)(1), which allows the board to subpoena the records that it desires to examine. Because there is no Ohio case law germane to the present dispute for guidance, we would be inclined to agree with Singh but for R.C. 4741.03(D)(2), not mentioned by either party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">R.C. 4741.03(D)(2) states that the board may \u201c[ejxamine and inspect books, papers, public records, animal patient records, and other documentary evidence at the location where the books, papers, records, and other evidence are normally stored or maintained.\u201d Thus, under the dictates of this statute, the board had the absolute right to examine Buster\u2019s records at Singh\u2019s office pursuant to an investigation. Because the board had directed Thompson to \u201cconduct an investigation and/or compliance inspection of [Singh\u2019s] facility rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>tive to a complaint filed with this office,\u201d Thompson had the authority to inspect the records during his investigation of Singh\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Singh makes two further arguments. First, he asserts that Thompson did not provide him with proper notice of the investigation as required by R.C. 4741.26(A). We first must distinguish between an inspection and an investigation under R.C. Chapter 4741. We interpret R.C. 4741.26(A) to allow the board to conduct an inspection of a veterinarian\u2019s place of business during normal business hours after giving five days\u2019 written notice. However, under R.C. 4741.26(A), \u201c[i]n conducting any investigation for a suspected violation of this chapter, the board or its authorized agent does not have to provide any prior written notice to the licensee, permit holder, or registrant as long as the board provides a written authorization for the investigation.\u201d This section further requires the board\u2019s investigator to provide a copy of the written authorization for an investigation to the subject of the investigation at the time it takes place.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The intent of the statute seems clear. The board, in discharging its duties, needs to supervise veterinarians by conducting inspections and investigations. At least five days\u2019 notice is given to veterinarians before an inspection takes place. Obviously, the board would use inspections for routine checks of a veterinarian\u2019s facilities. But when a written complaint is filed with the board, it is allowed to investigate the complaint with notice given contemporaneously with the investigation. The element of surprise is obviously an important factor in conducting investigations to determine whether a veterinarian has violated a provision in R.C. Chapter 4741.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">As noted earlier, on January 5, Thompson came to Singh\u2019s office to investigate a complaint filed with the board. Singh alleges that Thompson did not have the authorization required by R.C. 4741.26(A) with him when he arrived to investigate on that day. Thompson-did not leave the authorization at Singh\u2019s office before he left; it was mailed, undated, to Singh two weeks later. Though there is evidence in the hearing transcript that may support Singh\u2019s contention that Thompson did not in fact have the authorization with him that day, Thompson stated that he had sent notice to Singh before January 3, when he first visited Singh\u2019s office. Thompson also stated that he had the authorization with him on January 3. Thompson was never directly asked whether he had the authorization with him on January 5. But, apparently, the hearing examiner, the board, and the trial court all believed that he had the notice with him on January 5, because they agreed that Singh violated R.C. 4741.22(Y). We are limited by our standard of review and cannot take issue with the credibility of the witnesses. Thus, for our purposes, we must accept that Thompson had the proper authorization with him on January 5 to enable him to investigate Singh\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Singh\u2019s second argument is that there is no reliable, probative, and substantial evidence that <em>he </em>refused to permit Thompson to inspect his records. Singh asserts that because his wife and Dr. Sinah told Thompson that he could not see the records, Singh could not have violated the statute. But Singh\u2019s wife and Dr. Sinah certainly could have been acting as his agents in denying Thompson permission to inspect. As the trial court noted, Singh could be held accountable for the actions of his agents. Singh even testified that he knew that Thompson was at his office while he was in the back room. From the evidence in the record, the obvious implication is that Singh authorized his wife and Dr. Sinah to deny Thompson access to the records. The trial court did not err in determining that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence existed that Singh violated R.C. 4741.22Q0- The first assignment is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">In Singh\u2019s second assignment, he asserts that the trial court erred by holding that a portion of the board\u2019s final order complied with the requirements of due process and a fair hearing. This assignment is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Essentially, Singh contends that the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact in his report and recommendation were skewed and therefore violated his rights to due process, because the board could not make an informed decision. We, however, believe that the hearing officer\u2019s report was fairly accurate, and that the board\u2019s review of this report comported with Singh\u2019s due-process rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Singh was also permitted under R.C. 119.09 to file objections to the hearing officer\u2019s report with the board, which he did. The second assignment is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">In his third assignment, Singh contends that the trial court erred by refusing to grant his motion for reconsideration. In this assignment, Singh claims that the board violated its duty to transmit a complete record under R.C. 119.12, because three pages were missing from the transcript of the. hearing. This assignment is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\"> A motion for reconsideration of a final judgment is a nullity in Ohio.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Singh\u2019s motion for reconsideration was filed after the trial court\u2019s written decision but before the trial court put on the judgment entry disposing of the case. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>trial court did not rule on the motion. The trial court could have ruled on the motion before entering judgment, but its failure to do so rendered the motion a nullity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the trial court did not err by failing to grant the motion for reconsideration because it became a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">But even if we were to entertain the third assignment, Singh has not demonstrated that the absence of the three pages was prejudicial to him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Singh notes that one of the missing pages gives greater details of the federal lawsuit against the board and Thompson. But Singh has not alleged a defense based on the federal lawsuit. The question on appeal to the court of common pleas was merely whether Singh had refused to permit Thompson to inspect his business premises. Therefore, the omission of some of the federal lawsuit\u2019s details from the transcript did not prejudice Singh. The third assignment is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Though we must uphold the trial court\u2019s decision, we are troubled by the charges against Singh, and, although not addressed specifically on appeal, by the implication of the federal lawsuit filed by Singh against the board and Thompson in November 1994. In our view, because of this history, Singh was not inordinately uncooperative when Thompson came to his office on January 5, 1995, to investigate a complaint filed more than two years earlier. Singh had been advised by his lawyer not to talk with Thompson or the board members, who were all defendants in Singh\u2019s federal lawsuit. During the hearing, Singh\u2019s lawyer noted that the investigation of the Bicknell complaint came from nowhere in 1995; he had not expected such a belated investigation and therefore had not attempted to obtain a stay in federal court to keep Thompson or the board from conducting an inspection. It is unfortunate that the parties were unable to cooperate regarding the supposed issue \u2014 the Bicknell complaint \u2014 but perhaps that is now part of the federal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Constrained by our limited standard of review, we must uphold the trial court\u2019s decision. The judgment of the trial court, remanding the case to the Ohio Veterinary Medical Board so that it may recalculate the appropriate discipline, is affirmed. Given that the major charges against Singh have been dismissed by the trial court, we would expect that the remaining finding of lack of uncoopera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>tion, considering the facts and circumstances here, would result in a major downward revision of disciplinary sanction, if any at all is imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-6\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Marianna Brown Bettman, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-10\">.
