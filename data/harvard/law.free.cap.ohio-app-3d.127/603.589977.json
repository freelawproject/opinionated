Sims appeals from her conviction and sentence in the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court for corrupting another with drugs in violation of R.C. 2925.02(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">During the pendency of her appeal, Sims passed away. Her counsel, Victor A. Hodge, notified us of her death, and, upon motion by the state and with the concurrence of her counsel, this court substituted Victor A. Hodge for Sims as the party on appeal. App.R. 29(A). <em>State v. McGettrick </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 138, 31 OBR 296, 509 N.E.2d 378. The matter is now properly before us and ready for decision. References to Sims in this decision denote Hodge as the party on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">Sims advances four assignments of error. First, she challenges the warrant-less entry by police officers into a home where she was found and detained. Next, Sims contends that the trial court erred by declaring a subsequently issued warrant supported by probable cause. Third, she argues that the trial court erred by refusing to suppress a statement she made to officers. Finally, Sims claims that the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings denied her the opportunity to cross-examine the state\u2019s witnesses effectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">The present appeal stems from Sims\u2019s arrest on July 19, 1996, after police entered a home at 164 McReynolds Street in Dayton, detained the home\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>occupants, secured a warrant, and searched the home, finding, among other things, drugs in Sims\u2019s purse. Prior to Sims\u2019s arrest, area law enforcement officers had received information from various sources over a three-year period identifying a Cassidy Stapleton as a drug trafficker. Additionally, on June 2, 1996, agents of the Ohio Organized Crime Investigations Commission observed Stapleton engage in an apparent drug transaction at \u201cDr. Doodle\u2019s\u201d lounge with \u201cGinger,\u201d a barmaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Thereafter, around June 24, 1996, a confidential informant told police that Stapleton was engaged in drug trafficking with Earnest Washington and Carmen Sims. Police also knew-that Sims resided at 8095 Mt. Hood in Huber Heights, Ohio, and that Washington frequented that address. The confidential informant told police that Stapleton had received up to one ounce of cocaine from Washington and/or Sims at 8095 Mt. Hood within the previous thirty days. In addition, officer Kirk J. Bell learned from two law enforcement agencies that Sims and Washington were involved in drug trafficking at 8095 Mt. Hood. Officer Bell also learned that a dark green 1994 Eagle was used to transport the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">On July 18, 1996, officer Bell received information from an unidentified source, stating that Stapleton was about to buy cocaine from 8095 Mt. Hood. Police then conducted surveillance of Stapleton and 8095 Mt. Hood, observing Stapleton use a public phone in West Carrollton, Ohio, and within two minutes, observing the 1994 Eagle leave 8095 Mt. Hood. Subsequently, on July 19, 1996, police learned from an unidentified source that Stapleton would purchase cocaine from Sims. The officers expected the drug transaction to occur at 8095 Mt. Hood in Huber Heights and, as a result, secured a warrant for that address.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Conducting surveillance, however, police observed Stapleton leave a motel in a car driven by Jeff Maxey, a- known drug dealer. Police followed the car to the Bolton Street area of Dayton. There officers observed Stapleton exit the car and meet with an unidentified male approximately one block away from 164 McReynolds Street. Police stopped Stapleton as he walked back to the car and arrested him after.discovering cocaine in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">After arresting and removing Stapleton, several officers approached a residence at 164 McReynolds Street with the 1994 Eagle parked \u201cin the immediate vicinity.\u201d After reaching the house, officers waited outside for five to ten minutes. They then approached the front door and sought permission to enter and search the house. After being denied permission by Bruce Castle, the homeowner, approximately five officers entered anyway and detained several people, including Sims, in the living room. Police waited with the detained occupants while officer Bell sought a search warrant for the house. Prior to the warrant\u2019s arrival, the detained individuals were not free to leave unless they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>consented to a search \u201cto make sure that none of the evidence would leave the scene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">At one point, Jennifer Debrusk, a juvenile, consented to be searched so she could leave. The search revealed drugs in her possession. Debrusk told police she had obtained the drugs from Sims. Additionally, sometime before the warrant\u2019s arrival, Sims complained of sharp pains and difficulty breathing. As a result, police accompanied her to a local hospital and remained with her until she could be searched for contraband. After searching Sims and discovering nothing, an officer left her alone at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">While Sims remained at the hospital, officer Bell returned to 164 McReynolds Street several hours later with a search warrant. When executing the warrant, police discovered drugs in Sims\u2019s purse at 164 McReynolds. Officers subsequently arrested her at a gas station, where she was waiting for a ride home after checking herself out of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">A grand jury later indicted Sims on charges of drug trafficking, drug possession, and corrupting another with drugs. She filed a motion to suppress the evidence against her on September 27, 1996. Following a hearing, the trial court overruled Sims\u2019s motion on February 24, 1997. Sims then entered a no-contest plea to corrupting another with drugs, and the state <em>nolled </em>the drug trafficking and possession charges.' Additionally, the state agreed not to oppose a minimum two-year sentence. At sentencing, however, the trial court imposed a three-year sentence but allowed Sims to remain free on bond pending her appeal. Sims then filed a timely notice of appeal advancing the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">\u201cI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in finding lawful the warrantless entry into 164 McReynolds and in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">In her first assignment of error, Sims contends that the trial court erred by finding proper the officers\u2019 initial entry into the residence at 164 McReynolds Street. More specifically, Sims claims that the record does not demonstrate that the warrantless entry was necessary to prevent the destruction of drugs. Additionally, she argues that the officers could not create an \u201cexigency\u201d by making their presence outside the house known and then entering without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">In response, the state contends that Sims lacks standing to challenge the warrantless entry into the home. The state notes that Sims did not own the home and alleged only to have spent the previous night there as a guest. Furthermore, the state contends that Sims lacks standing to challenge the admissibility of drugs found in Jennifer Debrusk\u2019s possession. The state also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>alleges that the drugs in Debrusk\u2019s possession formed the sole evidentiary basis underlying the corrupting count to which Sims entered her plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">We cannot agree with the state\u2019s assertions. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Sims lacks standing as an overnight guest to contest the entry, we believe that she possesses standing to challenge the officers\u2019 entry into the home because she was seized immediately upon their entry. After entering the home, Sims and the other occupants were placed in the living room and not allowed to leave unless they consented to a search for evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>State v. Carter </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 57, 63, 630 N.E.2d 355, 360, the Ohio Supreme Court reasoned that both a driver and a passenger possess standing to challenge a warrantless vehicle stop \u201cbecause when the vehicle is stopped, they are equally seized, and their freedom of movement is equally affected.\u201d Additionally, in <em>State v. Herron </em>(Dec. 6, 1996), Darke App. No. 1404, unreported, 1996 WL 697021, we reasoned that a three-hour in-home detention for the sole purpose of preventing a suspect from leaving the presence of police while they obtain a search warrant amounts to a custodial detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Similarly, we believe that Sims and the other occupants of 164 McReynolds Street possess standing to challenge the officers\u2019 entry because they were seized for several hours until police returned with a warrant. We do, however, agree with the state\u2019s argument that Sims cannot challenge the admissibility of drugs found in Jennifer Debrusk\u2019s possession. Nevertheless, we cannot agree that Debrusk\u2019s drugs were the only evidence relevant to Sims\u2019s conviction of corrupting another with drugs. At a hearing on Sims\u2019s suppression motion, the parties\u2019 stipulated that drugs found in Sims\u2019s purse formed the basis of her indictment for drug possession. In light of this stipulation, the state suggests that the drugs found in Debrusk\u2019s possession necessarily formed the basis of Sims\u2019s indictment for corrupting another with drugs. Since Sims cannot challenge the admissibility of drugs found in Debrusk\u2019s possession, the state argues that she lacks standing to challenge her conviction of corrupting another with drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">We cannot agree with the state\u2019s reasoning. Although the parties agreed that drugs found in Sims\u2019s purse resulted in the possession charge, we harbor no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>doubt that the state would have supported its charge of corrupting another with drugs at trial with the drugs found in Sims\u2019s purse <em>and </em>the drugs found in Debrusk\u2019s possession. Absent a stipulation in the record stating that the <em>only </em>evidence relevant to Sims\u2019s charge of corrupting another with drugs was the evidence taken from Debrusk, we decline to make such a determination on appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Accordingly, we proceed now to Sims\u2019s argument that the officers unlawfully entered the home at 164 McReynolds Street without a warrant. In a February 24, 1997 judgment entry, the trial court found the officers\u2019 entry permissible because they \u201cfeared the destruction of evidence while awaiting the warrant.\u201d This court\u2019s review of the record, however, fails to demonstrate that the officers possessed probable cause to believe that drugs were located in 164 McReynolds when they made the warrantless entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we find very little in the record explaining why the officers believed that drugs would be found in the home. In an affidavit for a search warrant drafted while officers waited in the home, Officer Bell averred at length about information indicating that Sims and Earnest Washington were dealing drugs out of 8095 Mt. Hood in Huber Heights. The affidavit also cited a tip from an unidentified source, stating that Cassidy Stapleton would purchase drugs from 8095 Mt. Hood. Officer Bell\u2019s affidavit does not mention the 164 McReynolds Street residence until the final paragraph. That paragraph states that police observed Stapleton and a Jeff Maxey drive to the Bolton Street area of Dayton, where Stapleton exited the car and met with a \u201cmale individual\u201d in \u201cthe area of 164 McReynolds.\u201d The affidavit also states that police arrested Stapleton as he walked back to the car driven by Maxey. Additionally, the affidavit notes that the Eagle vehicle was parked \u201cin the immediate vicinity\u201d of 164 McReynolds and that the home\u2019s occupants refused to consent to a search for \u201cspecific evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Significantly, however, nothing in the affidavit describes illegal activity occurring inside 164 McReynolds Street. All allegations of drug activity related to 8095 Mt. Hood in Huber Heights. Furthermore, Bell\u2019s affidavit states that police arrested Stapleton \u201cin the area of\u2019 164 McReynolds after he met with an unidentified male. The record, however, demonstrates that the meeting occurred up to one block away from 164 McReynolds, and nothing suggests why officers believed contraband would be found in the home. Indeed, many houses were \u201cin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>the area\u201d where police arrested Stapleton. The only piece of evidence even arguably linking 164 McReynolds to drug activity is the presence of the green Eagle outside. Without more, however, we are unprepared to say that the presence of a suspected drug vehicle \u201cin the immediate vicinity\u201d of an otherwise unsuspicious residence justifies a warrantless intrusion into the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Testimony presented at the suppression hearing further supports our conclusion that the officers improperly entered 164 McReynolds. At the hearing, Officer Bell was asked on redirect examination why police entered 164 McReynolds and detained its occupants. He responded: \u201cThat is where the course of this drug transaction took place.\u201d Subsequently, on recross-examination the following exchange occurred between defense counsel and Bell:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">\u201cQ. Detective, you just mentioned this is where \u2014 164, this is where the drug transaction went down. I don\u2019t see anything about a drug transaction taking place at 164 McReynolds Street. What drug transaction are you talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">\u201cA. The transaction which Miss Sims was arrested for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">\u201cQ. But your affidavit doesn\u2019t say anything about Miss Sims being involved in a drug transaction, does it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">\u201c(Prosecutor Burk) Objection. That\u2019s for your Honor to decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">\u201c(The Court) Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-11\">\u201cQ. Let me ask specifically: What was the \u2014 describe the drug transaction that you\u2019re saying Carmen Sims was involved in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-12\">\u201c(Prosecutor Burk) Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-13\">\u201c(The Court) Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-14\">\u201cA. The sale of cocaine to Cassidy Stapleton.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-15\">\u201cQ. Where and when?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-16\">\u201cA. 164 McReynolds. As it says, in the immediate vicinity of 164 McReynolds on July 19th at \u2014 approximately 2:15 p.m. or so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-17\">\u201cQ. Doesn\u2019t your affidavit state that Stapleton met another male individual in the area of 164? It doesn\u2019t say anything about meeting Carmen Sims there, a female.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-18\">\u201c(Prosecutor Burk) Objection</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-19\">\u201c(The Court) Sustained. Save it for your argument. It says what it says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-20\">\u201cQ. Where exactly did the drug transaction take place, in or out of 164 McReynolds Street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-21\">\u201cA. That\u2019s a tough question to answer as, of course, I was not there. It happened in the vicinity of 164 McReynolds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>\u201cQ. And this transaction occurred between Cassidy Stapleton and Carmen Sims?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">\u201cA. Those were the two principals, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">\u201cQ. And you don\u2019t have any knowledge as to whether or not it occurred in or out of the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">\u201cA. At that time, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">\u201cQ. So you didn\u2019t know whether or not a drug transaction had occurred inside or outside of the house, but you went to request a warrant to enter the house. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">Through the foregoing testimony, Officer Bell explained that police entered 164 McReynolds because it was the location where Sims and Stapleton had engaged in a drug transaction. In support, he referred to his affidavit for a search warrant. As defense counsel pointed out, however, the affidavit does not describe criminal activity involving 164 McReynolds Street. To the contrary, it describes Stapleton meeting an unidentified <em>male </em>individual after exiting a car \u201cin the area of\u2019 164 McReynolds, which, as we noted above, is also \u201cin the area of\u2019 other homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">In its February 24, 1997 judgment entry overruling Sims\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court recited as fact that \u201cStapleton exited the car and entered the home at 164 McReynolds at 1:30 p.m.\u201d The court then stated that Stapleton was arrested for \u201cthe cocaine purchase\u201d as he returned to the car. We find nothing in Officer Bell\u2019s affidavit, however, stating that Stapleton entered 164 McReynolds Street and purchased drugs. \u201cWhen reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence, we must accept the trial court\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by competent, credible evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Martin </em>(Nov. 14, 1997), Montgomery App. No. 16256, unreported, 1997 WL 705472. In the present case, we find no evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s determination that Stapleton purchased drugs inside 164 McReynolds from Sims or anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">Furthermore, we agree with Sims\u2019s assertion that the record is devoid of evidence suggesting that the home\u2019s occupants were aware of the police presence outside. Sims is correct in her contention that police cannot create an exigency by announcing their presence and then entering a home to prevent the destruction of drugs. <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1995), 104 Ohio App.3d 265, 661 N.E.2d 806. Accordingly, we agree that the officers improperly entered the home without a warrant, and we sustain Sims\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>\u201cII</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred in finding that the search warrant issued on probable cause and in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">In her second assignment of error, Sims contends the trial court erred by finding that the search warrant for 164 McReynolds was issued on probable cause. In opposition, the state argues that Sims lacks standing to challenge the warrant and, in any event, that the warrant was supported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Once again, even assuming that Sims lacks standing to challenge the warrant on the basis of her overnight-guest status, an issue the parties dispute, we find standing for two reasons: (1) the warrant specifically identified Sims as one of the individuals to be searched, and (2) the officers\u2019 search included Sims\u2019s purse, an item in which she possessed a privacy interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\"> Furthermore, for largely the same reasons stated above, we agree that Officer Bell\u2019s affidavit did not establish probable cause to search Sims or the residence at 164 McReynolds Street. Other than Sims\u2019s statement, made after police unlawfully entered 164 McReynolds, the affidavit contained little information about 164 McReynolds and related drug activity. The first paragraph simply recited Bell\u2019s qualifications. Paragraphs 2 through 8 recited information linking Sims, Washington, and Stapleton to drug activity and also linked the activity to 8095 Mt. Hood in Huber Heights. Only paragraph 9 even mentioned 164 McReynolds, noting that Stapleton had exited a car and met an unidentified male \u201cin the area of 164 McReynolds.\u201d The affidavit also noted that a green Eagle was parked \u201cin the immediate vicinity\u201d of 164 McReynolds. In <em>Martin, supra, </em>this court recognized its duty to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of a trial court\u2019s probable cause determination. <em>Martin, supra, </em>citing <em>Ornelas v. United States </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 690, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911. After conducting such a review, we cannot agree that Officer Bell\u2019s affidavit established probable cause justifying the search warrant\u2019s issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Furthermore, we find the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the warrant requirement inapplicable. The officers sought the warrant only after first unlawfully entering 164 McReynolds. In addition, Officer Bell\u2019s warrant affidavit included information police learned only after entering the residence. The affidavit included a statement that Sims allegedly made after police entered the home. It also noted Sims\u2019s presence inside the residence and, consequently, named her as one of the people to be searched. We note too the issuing magistrate\u2019s inability to recall Officer Bell\u2019s telling him that police already were inside 164 McReynolds when the magistrate signed the search warrant. The magistrate testified that it was not possible that Bell told him police were inside because \u201cI\u2019m an old criminal defense lawyer, and I think I would have made a note of that.\u201d The magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>also testified that he would have been \u201cdisinclined\u201d to issue the warrant if he had known that police were inside the home.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the officers acted in \u201cgood faith\u201d when procuring the warrant. As a result, we sustain Sims\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">\u201cHI</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in refusing to suppress appellant\u2019s statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In her third assignment of error, Sims first contends that the trial court should have suppressed a statement she made after the officers\u2019 warrantless entry into 164 McReynolds. In support, she argues (1) that she was in custody and (2) that the officers failed to recite her <em>Miranda </em>rights. Based upon the record before us, however, we cannot determine whether Sims made her statement in response to custodial interrogation or whether she offered it gratuitously. Consequently, we cannot determine whether the statement was suppressible under the Fifth Amendment based upon the officers\u2019 failure to provide <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Regardless of whether Sims\u2019s statement was voluntary or the product of custodial interrogation, however, she made her statement <em>after </em>the officers unlawfully had entered the home. This fact implicates the Fourth Amendment and its exclusionary rule, which prohibits the state\u2019s use of evidence resulting from unreasonable searches and seizures. As the United States Supreme Court recognized in <em>Brown v. Illinois </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 590, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416, the Fourth and Fifth Amendments involve different interests and serve different policies. See, also, <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 256, 15 OBR 379, 393, 473 N.E.2d 768, 785 (noting that <em>\u201cMiranda </em>concerns the Fifth and Sixth Amendment guarantees. The Fourth Amendment concerns illegal arrests, and the fruits therefrom.\u201d). Even if Sims\u2019s statement is found voluntary under the Fifth Amendment, certain Fourth Amendment concerns still remain. <em>Brown, supra, </em>at 601-602, 95 S.Ct. at 2260-2261, 45 L.Ed.2d at 425-426.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Incriminating statements stemming from unreasonable searches and seizures, however, need not always be suppressed as \u201c \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>422 U.S. at 599, 95 S.Ct. at 2259, 45 L.Ed.2d at 424, quoting <em>Wong Sun v. United States </em>(1963), 371 U.S. 471, 487-488, 83 S.Ct. 407, 417-418, 9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>L.Ed.2d 441, 455-456. As the <em>Brown </em>court noted, \u201cIt is entirely possible, of course, as the State here argues, that persons arrested illegally frequently may decide to confess, as an act of free will unaffected by the initial illegality.\u201d <em>Id., </em>422 U.S. at 603, 95 S.Ct. at 2261, 45 L.Ed.2d at 427. The court then reasoned, however, that <em>\u201cMiranda </em>warnings, alone and <em>per se, </em>cannot always make the act sufficiently a product of free will to break, for Fourth Amendment purposes, the causal connection between the illegality and the confession. They cannot assure in every case that the Fourth Amendment violation has not been unduly exploited.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Rather, the admissibility of an incriminating statement made after an unlawful seizure depends upon several factors. As the <em>Brown </em>court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201c * * * The question whether a confession is the product of a free will under <em>Wong Sun </em>must be answered on the facts of each case. No single fact is dispositive. The workings of the human mind are too complex, and the possibilities of misconduct are too diverse, to permit protection of the Fourth Amendment to turn on such a talismanic test. The <em>Miranda </em>warnings are an important factor, to be sure, in determining whether the confession is obtained by exploitation of an illegal arrest. But they are not the only factor to be considered. The temporal proximity of the arrest and the confession, the presence of intervening circumstances * * * and particularly the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct are all relevant. * * * The voluntariness of the statement is a threshold requirement. And the burden of showing admissibility rests, of course, on the prosecution.\u201d See, also, <em>State v. Davis </em>(Jan. 31, 1994), Brown App. No. CA93-06-007, unreported, 1994 WL 29884, citing <em>Brown.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">In the present case, the trial court\u2019s judgment entry overruling Sims\u2019s suppression motion did not address the Fourth or Fifth Amendment issues raised by her statement. Rather, the court erroneously concluded that Sims made no incriminating statements after police entered the home. Paragraph 9 of officer Bell\u2019s affidavit for a search warrant, however, contains an incriminating statement Sims allegedly made after officers entered the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Based upon our own review of the record, we find little information in the suppression hearing transcript concerning the circumstances of Sims\u2019s statement. As a result, we cannot determine (1) whether the statement was gratuitous and unsolicited by police, (2) whether it was the product of questioning and, if so, whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given, and (3) even if voluntary, whether the statement was sufficiently an act of free will to purge the taint of the Fourth Amendment violation in accordance with <em>Brown, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Furthermore, we note that the admissibility of Sims\u2019s statement is not moot. As we explained above, the trial court erred by not suppressing the drugs found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>in Sims\u2019s purse. Given our finding that Sims lacks standing to challenge the evidence obtained from Jennifer Debrusk, however, the state still may decide to pursue a charge against Sims based on that evidence, and her statement to police would be relevant. Consequently, we must remand this cause for the trial court to answer the questions we identified in the preceding paragraph and to determine whether the admission of Sims\u2019s statement would violate either the Fourth or Fifth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In this assignment of error, Sims also argues that the trial court erred by refusing to suppress statements she made at the police station after her arrest. The record reveals that police formally arrested Sims after discovering drugs in her purse. She was taken to the Montgomery County Jail, where she spoke with police and consented to a search of her Huber Heights home. The trial court\u2019s judgment entry does not specifically address Sims\u2019s <em>Mirandized </em>statements at the police station or her consent to a search of her Huber Heights home. In her brief to this court, Sims contends that the trial court should have suppressed the statements and any evidence obtained from the search as fruit of the poisonous tree. For the same reasons we identified above, however, the trial court must determine upon remand whether Sims\u2019s postarrest statements and consent to search were sufficiently acts of free will to purge the taint of the Fourth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">\u201cIV</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying appellant her constitutional right to confrontation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">In her final assignment of error, Sims contends that the trial court erred by limiting defense counsel\u2019s ability to cross-examine Officer Bell regarding the contents of his warrant affidavit. In response, the state argues that the trial court properly sustained its objections to defense counsel\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Sims\u2019s assignment of error focuses upon the following questions from defense counsel to Officer Bell, objections by the state, and evidentiary rulings by the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">\u201cQ. Now, at the time your officers entered the premises, your understanding is that\u2019s when they first encountered Carmen Sims?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">\u201cA. Yes, that\u2019s my understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-12\">\u201cQ. Why was she detained at that point in time if there was no warrant for her, was there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-13\">\u201cA. No, sir, there was no arrest warrant for her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>\u201cQ. And from what I see in the affidavit, you didn\u2019t witness any criminal act alleged in the affidavit by her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">\u201c(Prosecutor Burk) I object to that. I think that was up for a judge to decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">\u201c(The Court) Sustain the objection. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">\u201cQ. The affidavit reflects a meeting that Mr. Stapleton had. It doesn\u2019t reflect anything about what Carmen Sims did. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">\u201c(Prosecutor Burk) Objection, again, your Honor. I think that\u2019s for your Honor to decide when you review the affidavit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">\u201c(The Court) Sustain the objection. I tend to agree with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-10\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-11\">\u201cQ. Detective, you just mentioned this is where \u2014 164, this is where the drug transaction went down. I don\u2019t see anything about a drug transaction taking place at 164 McReynolds Street. What drug transaction are you talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-12\">\u201cA. The drug transaction which Miss Sims was arrested for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-13\">\u201cQ. But your affidavit doesn\u2019t say anything about Miss Sims being involved in a drug transaction, does it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-14\">\u201c(Prosecutor Burk) Objection. That\u2019 for your Honor to decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-15\">\u201c(The Court) Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-16\">\u201cQ. Let me ask specifically: What was the \u2014 describe the drug transaction that you\u2019re saying Carmen Sims was involved in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-17\">\u201c(Prosecutor Burk) Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-18\">\u201c(The Court) Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-19\">\u201cA. The sale of cocaine to Cassidy Stapleton.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-20\">\u201cQ. Where and when?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-21\">\u201cA. 164 McReynolds. As it says, in the immediate vicinity of 164 McReynolds on July 19th at \u2014 approximately 2:15 p.m. or so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-22\">\u201cQ. Doesn\u2019t your affidavit state that Stapleton met another male individual in the area of 164? It doesn\u2019t say anything about meeting Carmen Sims there, a female.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-23\">\u201c(Prosecutor Burk) Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-24\">\u201c(The Court) Sustained. Save it for your argument. It says what it says.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-25\">In its brief to this court, the state insists that the trial court properly sustained its objections. In support, the state relies upon Evid.R. 1002, the \u201cbest evidence\u201d rule. This rule states that to prove the contents of a writing, a party must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>produce the original writing. In the present case, however, defense counsel did not attempt to establish the contents of Officer Bell\u2019s affidavit. To the contrary, defense counsel\u2019s questions focused upon what the affidavit <em>did not </em>say. In our view, the questions constituted a legitimate effort to cross-examine Officer Bell regarding his testimony that Sims engaged in a drug transaction with Stapleton. \"Nothing in Evid.R. 1002 made the questions improper simply because they referred to Officer Bell\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Accordingly, we sustain Sims\u2019s fourth assignment of error, and we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in part. As we noted above, Sims lacks standing to object to the admissibility of evidence obtained during the officers\u2019 search of Jennifer Debrusk. Consequently, the trial court properly overruled Sims\u2019s motion to the extent it sought suppression of that evidence. The trial court erred, however, by failing to suppress the drugs found in Sims\u2019s purse. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment to the extent it found the drugs admissible. Finally, we must remand this cause for the trial court to determine (1) whether the admission of Sims\u2019s statement inside the house violates either the Fourth or Fifth Amendment and (2) whether Sims\u2019s subsequent <em>Mirandized </em>statements and consent to have her Huber Heights home searched were Sufficiently acts of free will to purge the taint of the officers\u2019 earlier Fourth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">' <em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b648-7\">Fain and Grady, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-8\">. In its brief to this court, the state argues that no \"seizure\u201d occurred because Sims was free to leave if she agreed to be searched and, in fact, did leave for the hospital. We disagree. The officers possessed no authority to force Sims to exchange her freedom from warrantless searches for her freedom of movement. Furthermore, although the officers eventually allowed Sims to go to the hospital after she complained of health problems, an officer remained in her company until she consented to a search. Under these circumstances, we believe that Sims and the other occupants were \"seized\u201d upon the officers\u2019 entry into the home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\">. In a final sentence, the affidavit states: \"Sims made the statement that Stapleton was present with her to sell her cocaine, not to purchase it from her.\u201d We note, however, that Sims made this statement <em>after </em>police had entered the home. Consequently, we will not consider it to determine whether the officers possessed probable cause to make the warrant-less entry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b644-10\">. On cross-examination by the state, the magistrate later agreed that he would not have been troubled by the officers' entry into the home if he had known \"that the entry and detention were reasonable and necessary to avoid the destruction of evidence.\" As we explained in our analysis of Sims\u2019s first assignment of error, however, the record does not support these assumptions. The record fails to demonstrate that the officers possessed probable cause to believe that drugs would be found inside 164 McReynolds. Furthermore, as we explained above, no exigent circumstances existed because the record is devoid of evidence showing that the home's occupants were aware of the officers' presence in the neighborhood.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
