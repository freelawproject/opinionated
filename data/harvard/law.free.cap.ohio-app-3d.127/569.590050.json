She sought in this action to recover uninsured motorist benefits under an automobile policy, under which she qualified as an insured, issued by defendant-appellee Nationwide Insurance Co. (\u201cNationwide\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-15\">Nationwide filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the bicycle which struck her did not constitute a \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d After receiving Haynes\u2019 brief in opposition, the trial court granted Nationwide\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-16\">Haynes appeals raising the following sole assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>\u201cThe trial court erred in granting defendant-appellee\u2019s motion for summary-judgment and finding that defendant-appellee Nationwide had no duty to compensate plaintiff-appellant Nicole Haynes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">This assignment lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Haynes argues alternately that Nationwide\u2019s policy clearly covers bicycles as \u201cmotor vehicles,\u201d that the policy is ambiguous, so it should be construed to do so, and that failure to provide such coverage is contrary to public policy. She argues that bicycles should be deemed to constitute \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d for purposes of uninsured motorist coverage because bicycles are frequently treated like motor vehicles for purposes of state and municipal traffic, registration, and licensing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">As in all insurance coverage disputes, our review begins with the uninsured motorist provision of Nationwide\u2019s Century II Auto Policy, which provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">\u201cWe will pay compensatory damages as a result of bodily injury suffered by you or a relative and due by law from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle. Damages must result from an accident arising out of the:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">\u201c1. ownership;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">\u201c2. maintenance; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-11\">\u201c3. use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-12\">\u201cof the uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">The parties\u2019 dispute in this case concerns paragraph 7 of the definition section of the policy, which defines the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-14\">\u201c7. \u2018MOTOR VEHICLE\u2019 means a land motor vehicle designed for use on public roads. This does not include motor vehicles operated on rails or crawler treads. Other motor vehicles designed for use mainly off public roads are covered when used on public roads.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-15\">There is no ambiguity in this language. Plaintiffs argument that a \u201cbicycle\u201d constitutes a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d ignores that the term \u201cmotor\u201d modifies the term \u201cvehicle\u201d each time it is used. It is undisputed that the bicycle which collided with her was propelled by human power and was not powered by a \u201cmotor\u201d of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-16\">The commonly shared and well-understood distinction between these terms is reflected in R.C. 4501.01, which defines the terms \u201cvehicle,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>\u201cbicycle <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> R.C. 4501.01(B) specifically defines the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d to mean \u201cany vehicle * * * propelled or drawn by power other than muscular power * * * except motorized bicycles * * *.\u201d Bicycles do not constitute \u201cmotor vehicles.\u201d <em>Brown v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1995), 70 Ohio Misc.2d 71, 651 N.E.2d 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Contrary to plaintiffs argument, R.C. 3937.18, the uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance coverage statute, relies on the same definitions. R.C. 3937.18(A)(1) mandates that \u201cuninsured motorist coverage * * * shall provide protection for bodily injury or death * * * for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operations of uninsured <em>motor vehicles </em>because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death, suffered by any person insured under the policy. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.) It does not mandate such coverage for \u201cbicycles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">For these reasons, neither Nationwide\u2019s policy nor R.C. 3937.18 provides or mandates uninsured motorist coverage for bicycle-pedestrian accidents arising solely from the use of bicycles. Nor is there any public policy that dictates otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Accordingly, plaintiffs sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b602-9\">Blackmon, A.J., Karpinski and Patton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-17\">.
