Slay asked the court to delete the special condition that he not incur new credit charges, open new lines of credit, or make any new major purchases without the approval of his probation officer. This condition was imposed after he pleaded guilty to one count of possession of 500 grams of cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B). Slay argues on appeal that the district court erred because it failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in denying his motion and did not respond to the points raised in his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-15\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to modify conditions of supervised release for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Serrapio, 754 F.3d 1312, 1318 (11th Cir. 2014) (reviewing the modification of conditions of probation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563(c) for abuse of discretion); see also United States v. McClamma, 613 Fed.Appx. 846, 848 (11th Cir. 2015) (per curiam). This standard of review recognizes the range of possible conclusions that a district court may reach, and \u201cwe must affirm unless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d United States v. Frazier, 387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir. 2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-16\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2), a district court may, after considering the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), \u201cmodify, reduce, or enlarge the conditions of supervised release, at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2). After careful review of the record, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>the district court made a clear error of judgment, and therefore abused its discretion. See Frazier, 387 F.3d at 1259.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Slay\u2019s motion before the district court was unopposed. Both Slay and the government agreed they knew of no reason why this condition was included at sentencing for a drug crime. Indeed, as the Guidelines point out, this special condition is usually imposed when a defendant has special debt obligations like a restitution' payment or f\u00edne being paid through an installment schedule. See USSG \u00a7 5D1.3(d)(2). In his motion, Slay explained that since his release from prison, he had secured employment as a Sales Representative with B &amp; B Outdoor Advertisement/Daily Billboards Company, His responsibilities in this role included facilitating sales, making calls, and setting up events including sales luncheons, client briefing, client entertainment, and the like. Slay said in his motion that his special release condition \u201chindered] his ability to perform at work\u201d because he had to pay for many of these expenses out-of-pocket and then submit his expenses to the company for reimbursement. Attached to his motion was an email from Jessica Miner, the President of B &amp; B Outdoor Advertisement. She confirmed to the court that Slay had received employment with the company and detailed his job responsibilities, pay structure, and benefits. She also confirmed that Slay\u2019s responsibilities included paying for many client events out-of-pocket which require up to two weeks for reimbursement. She estimated these expenses varied between $50 and $500 per day depending on the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Nonetheless, the district court summarily denied Slay\u2019s unopposed motion saying only: \u201cThe special condition does not forbid or prohibit Defendant\u2019s use of credit; rather, his use of credit simply requires prior approval of his probation officer.\u201d This explanation is not sufficient. Although the district court was not required to \u201carticulate the applicability of each [\u00a7 3553(a)] factor\u201d in reaching its determination, \u201cif it is not possible to determine from the record whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we must vacate and remand the case to the district court.\u201d United States v. Douglas, 576 F.3d 1216, 1219 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (quotation omitted). And like Douglas, \u201cthe form order ... does not mention the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at all.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Neither did the district court respond to the points raised by Slay in his motion. The purpose of special release conditions is to facilitate the transition of offenders back into the community. See United States v. Johnson, 529 U.S. 53, 55-59, 120 S.Ct. 1114, 1117-19, 146 L,Ed.2d 39 (2000) (describing the aims of supervised release as \u201cassisting] convicted felons in their transitions to community life\u201d and \u201cfulfilling] rehabilitative ends, distinct from those served by incarceration\u201d); see also USSG \u00a7 5D1.3(b) (describing the district court\u2019s considerations at sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">As Slay points out, the special condition at issue requires that he receive approval not only before opening a new line of credit, but also each time he \u201cincur[s] new credit charges.\u201d That means every time Slay needs to pay for a client luncheon, pay for a meeting space, or even fill up his car with gas to drive between clients, he must first receive his probation officer\u2019s approval or pay cash and wait for the reimbursement. Incurring as much as $500 each day that may not be reimbursed for two weeks is a significant burden to impose on someone simply carrying out his job duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">Slay is doing exactly what we want convicted felons to do after they have served their time. He has a good job with benefits and a manager who is supportive of him. As Slay points out, it is quite difficult for ex-offenders to find jobs, let alone good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>ones. And his request to remove the special condition was not opposed by the government or the probation office when he filed it with the district court. Based on this record, the district court\u2019s summary explanation was not sufficient to deny Slay\u2019s motion. This is particularly so because granting Slay\u2019s motion would still allow his probation officer to monitor his finances. Another of Slay\u2019s special conditions requires he \u201cprovide the probation officer access to any requested financial information.\u201d Thus, his credit charges could be regularly monitored without hindering his job performance. Based on the district court\u2019s limited explanation, we conclude it abused its discretion because it failed to address the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and did not explain how the special condition served a rehabilitative purpose for Slay. As a result, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for it to rule on Slay\u2019s motion to modify the conditions of his supervised release, in a way consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
