He was sentenced to 480-months imprisonment in part because his sentence was enhanced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l). On appeal, he argues his plea was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary because the district court plainly erred in failing to inform him that if he rejected the plea deal, those two enhancements would have to be submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. He also says the district court plainly erred in ruling that his prior Florida conviction for lewd and lascivious molestation triggered those two sentencing enhancements. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">On May 5, 2015, Johnson was indicted for production of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251(a), (e), and 3559(e) (Count One); receipt of child pornography in violation of \u00a7 2252A(a)(2), (b)(1) (Count Two); possession of child pornography in violation of \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B), (b)(2) (Count Three); transfer of obscene matter to a minor in violation of \u00a7 1470 (Count Four); and penalties for registered sex offenders in violation of \u00a7 2260A (Count Five). Johnson agreed to plead guilty to Counts One, Two, Four, and Five. His plea agreement said the minimum and maximum sentence for Count One was 15 to 30 years, or if his prior Florida conviction for lewd or lascivious molestation under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(5) (2002)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> triggered a sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 2251(e), then 25 to 50 years. The plea agreement also set out that the minimum and maximum sentence for Count Two was 5 to 20 years, or if the same Florida conviction triggered a sentencing enhance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>ment under \u00a7 2252A(b)(l), then 15 to 40 years. The agreement provided that the sentencing would be left to the judge, but that the parties reserved the right to appeal the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">At Johnson\u2019s plea hearing, the district court told him Counts One and Two carried mandatory minimum sentences that would be enhanced if he had a qualifying prior conviction. The court said it would determine his sentences, that \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l) would control his sentence, and that it had not yet determined whether the enhancements under those provisions would apply. The court then told Johnson no one would be able to determine his actual sentence until the sentencing hearing because the court needed more information to resolve the question of whether Johnson\u2019s prior Florida conviction for lewd and lascivious molestation triggered those sentencing enhancements. Johnson said he understood each of these points and pleaded guilty to Counts One, Two, Four, and Five. The court accepted Johnson\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) found that Johnson qualified for sentence enhancements under both \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l) because of his prior lewd and lascivious molestation conviction. Based on a total offense level of 39 and a criminal history category of V, it calculated a guideline imprisonment range of 360 months to life. Johnson objected to the PSR. He argued that the Shepard documents related to his conviction for lewd and lascivious molestation did not support the two sentencing enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">At sentencing, Johnson argued his prior conviction did not trigger either of the enhancements because the Florida statute under which he was convicted criminalized touching over the clothing and on the buttocks. Thus, he asserted, \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l) were not broad enough to encompass every act criminalized by the Florida statute. The district court noted that the Eleventh Circuit had upheld the application of the enhancement even in cases involving no physical touching. It also said \u201cabusive sexual contact\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2243 and 2244 would cover the elements of the Florida statute. The court then overruled Johnson\u2019s objection to his sentence being enhanced under \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l). The court imposed a 360-month sentence on Counts One and Two, to run concurrently, a 120-month sentence on Count Four, to run concurrently, and a 120-month sentence on Count Five, to run consecutively, for a total of 480-months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Johnson makes two arguments on appeal. First, he says his plea was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 because the district court failed to inform him of the nature of the charges against him. Specifically, he argues the district court failed to inform him that if he rejected the plea deal and went to trial, a jury would be required to find that his prior Florida conviction for lewd and lascivious molestation qualified him for enhanced sentences under \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l). Johnson acknowledges that the mere fact of his prior conviction need not be submitted to the jury, even if it increases his sentence. However, he argues that whether his prior conviction triggers sentence enhancements under \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l) is a question of fact that must be decided by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">Johnson did not make this objection below, so we review it for plain error. United States v. Moriarty, 429 F.3d 1012, 1018-19 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam). \u201cTo establish plain error, [Johnson] must show there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>affects substantial rights.\u201d Id at 1019. To comply with Rule 11, a court must \u201cen-sur[e] that a defendant (1) enters his guilty plea free from coercion, (2) understands the nature of the charges, and (3) understands the consequences of his plea.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Johnson correctly recognizes that a judge can increase a defendant\u2019s sentence based on the mere fact of a prior conviction even if a jury never found that fact. See, e.g., Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2160 n.1, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). But beyond that, it is also true that whether a prior state conviction triggers a sentencing enhancement under a federal statute is a question of law that a judge can decide. See United States v. Gibson, 434 F.3d 1234, 1247-48 (11th Cir. 2006). There is no requirement that a jury decide whether Johnson\u2019s prior Florida conviction qualified him for sentencing enhancements under \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l). The district court did not therefore err, plainly or otherwise, by failing to inform Johnson to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Johnson\u2019s second argument is that his prior Florida conviction for lewd and lascivious molestation does not trigger sentencing enhancements under \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l) because the Florida statute under which he was convicted, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(6), was broad enough to criminalize touching of a minor between 12 and 16 years old even if (1) the touching was over the minor\u2019s clothing and not skin-to-skin contact; (2) the touching was consensual; (3) the defendant touched body parts that were not genitalia (like the buttocks); and (4) the defendant reasonably believed the minor had reached the age of 16. However, when Johnson objected to the sentencing enhancements in the district court, he argued only the first two points\u2014that his conviction does not trigger either \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l) because the Florida statute criminalized touching a minor\u2019s buttocks or breasts over her clothing. Thus, as Johnson correctly concedes, we review Johnson\u2019s argument on appeal for plain error because it \u201cis much broader in scope [compared to his argument in the district court] and includes additional arguments not raised below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261(e) says any person who violates \u00a7 2251 shall be imprisoned for at least 15, but not more than 30 years. However, if that person has a prior state conviction \u201crelating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, [or] abusive sexual contact involving a minor or ward,\u201d then \u00a7 2251(e) provides for a longer sentence of 25 to 50 years. Similarly, \u00a7 2252A(b)(l) sets a sentence of 5 to 20 years for anyone who violates certain paragraphs of \u00a7 2252A(a), but increases that sentence to 15 to 40 years if a person has a prior state conviction \u201crelating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">To determine whether a defendant\u2019s pri- or conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for a sentencing enhancement, we apply the \u201ccategorical approach\u201d This means we look only to the elements of the statute under which the defendant was convicted, and not at the facts underlying the prior conviction. See Mathis v. United States, 579 U.S.-, 136 S.Ct. 2243, 2253, 195 L.Ed.2d 604 (2016); Descamps v. United States, 570 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2283, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). Specifically, we compare the elements of the statute to the \u201cgeneric\u201d offenses mentioned in the federal sentencing-enhancement statute. See generally Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 576, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). Here, \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l) mention \u201caggravated sexual abuse,\u201d \u201csexual abuse,\u201d \u201cabusive sexual contact involving a minor or ward,\u201d and \u201cabusive sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>conduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d These generic offenses are non-traditional, and when we apply the categorical approach, we define non-traditional generic offenses in federal sentencing enhancement statutes based on the \u201cordinary, contemporary, and common meaning\u201d of the statutory words. United States v. Ramirez-Garcia, 646 F.3d 778, 783 (11th Cir. 2011) (quotation omitted). In sum, we must determine whether the elements of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(5) \u201crelat[e] to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual contact involving a minor or ward\u201d (\u00a7 2251(e)), \u201cor abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\u201d (\u00a7 2252A(b)(l)), within the plain meaning of those words.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">When applying the categorical approach, \u201cwe must presume that the conviction rested upon nothing more than the least of the acts criminalized\u201d by Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(5). Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. 184, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 1684, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013) (alterations adopted and quotation omitted). This is often referred to as the \u201cleast culpable conduct.\u201d See Donawa v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 735 F.3d 1275, 1283 (11th Cir. 2013) (citing Moncrieffe, 133 S.Ct. at 1685). And we must also analyze \u201cthe version of state law that the defendant was actually convicted of violating.\u201d McNeill v. United States, 563 U.S. 816, 821, 131 S.Ct. 2218, 2222, 180 L.Ed.2d 35 (2011). The text of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(5) prohibits persons who are at least 18 years old from intentionally touching (in a lewd or lascivious manner) the clothing covering the breasts or buttocks of a person who is at least 12 but younger than 16 years old. Neither the victim\u2019s consent, nor the victim\u2019s misrepresentation of his or her age, nor the defendant\u2019s bona fide belief that the victim was at least 16 years old, can constitute a defense. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(2) <em>&amp; </em>(3). Therefore, the \u201cleast culpable conduct\u201d criminalized by Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(5) at the time Johnson was convicted was: lewd and lascivious touching of a 15-year-old minor\u2019s clothing covering her breasts or buttocks; by an 18-year-old defendant; where the minor misrepresented her age to the defendant and consented to the touching; and the defendant had a bona fide belief the minor was at least 16 years old. We must determine whether this conduct \u201crelatfes] to\u201d the generic crimes listed in \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Eleventh Circuit precedent involving \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l) construes \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d to modify not only \u201cabusive sexual contact\u201d (in \u00a7 2251(e)) and \u201cabusive sexual conduct\u201d (in \u00a7 2252A(b)(l)), but also \u201caggravated sexual abuse\u201d and \u201csexual- abuse.\u201d See, e.g., United States v. Mathis, 767 F.3d 1264, 1284-85 (11th Cir. 2014) (per curiam). As a result, we have identified \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d as one of the generic crimes mentioned in \u00a7 2251(e). Id. However, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Lockhart v. United States, 577 U.S.-, 136 S.Ct. 958, 194 L.Ed.2d 48 (2016), revealed that we were wrong to interpret \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l) this way. Lock-hart held that \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d modifies only \u201cabusive sexual conduct,\u201d and not \u201caggravated sexual abuse\u201d or \u201csexual abuse\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(2), a federal sentencing enhancement statute with wording identical to \u00a7 2252A(b)(l). Id. at 961. Because Lockhart construed language identical to that we must interpret here, we must follow Lockhart, which requires us to construe \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d as modifying only \u201cabusive sexual conduct.\u201d Indeed, in United States v. Miller, 819 F.3d 1314 (11th Cir. 2016) (per curiam), we applied Lockhart to \u00a7 2251(e) and held that \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d modifies only \u201cabusive sexual contact\u201d in that statute. Id. at 1317. Thus, Lockhart clarifies that, contrary to our precedent, \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d is not a generic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>crime listed in either \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) or 2252A(b)(l). The only generic crimes in those statutes are \u201caggravated sexual abuse,\u201d \u201csexual abuse,\u201d and \u201cabusive sexual contact [or conduct] involving a minor or ward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">That leaves us to define these generic crimes by their ordinary, common meaning. Ramirez-Garcia, 646 F.3d at 783. In construing \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d we surmised from dictionary definitions that \u201cabuse\u201d means \u201cmisuse\u201d or \u201cto use or treat so as to injure, hurt, or damage,\u201d and that \u201csexual\u201d means \u201cof or relating to the sphere of behavior associated with libidinal gratification.\u201d United States v. Padilla-Reyes, 247 F.3d 1158, 1163 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 8, 2082 (1981)). Among its definitions of \u201cconduct,\u201d Webster\u2019s includes \u201cbehavior in a particular situation or relation or on a specified occasion.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 474 (1986). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cconduct\u201d as \u201c[personal behavior; deportment; mode of action; any positive or negative act.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 295 (6th ed. 1990). Finally, Webster\u2019s first definition of \u201ccontact\u201d is \u201cunion or junction of body surfaces: a touching or meeting.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 490 (1986). From these definitions, we deduce that \u201csexual abuse\u201d means misuse or maltreatment for the purpose of libidinal gratification, \u201cabusive sexual contact involving a minor or ward\u201d means touching a minor in a way that harms the minor for the purpose of one\u2019s libidinal gratification, and \u201cabusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\u201d means behaving in a way that harms a minor for the purpose of one\u2019s libidinal gratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">With these definitions in mind, Johnson\u2019s case presents the question of whether the \u201cleast culpable conduct\u201d criminalized by Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(5)\u2014that is, (1) lewd and lasciviously touching of a 15-year-old minor by an 18-year-old adult; (2) over the clothing covering the minor\u2019s breasts or buttocks; (3) with the minor\u2019s consent; (4) after the minor misrepresented his or her age to the defendant; and (5) when the defendant had a good-faith belief, based on the minor\u2019s misrepresentation, that the minor was at least 16 years old\u2014\u201crelat[es] to\u201d \u201csexual abuse\u201d or \u201cabusive sexual contact [or conduct] involving a minor or ward,\u201d according to their plain meanings. Because our Circuit had no precedent governing this specific question at the time Johnson was sentenced, the district court could not have plainly erred. See United States v. Lejarde-Rada, 319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir. 2003). And because the district court did not plainly err in enhancing Johnson\u2019s sentence under \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l), we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-11\">.

I write separately because I read Lockhart v. United States, \u2014 U.S.-, 136 S.Ct. 958, 194 L.Ed.2d 48 (2016), to teach us we should no longer define the generic crimes listed in \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l) (and other similarly-worded statutes) based on the \u201cordinary, contemporary, and common meaning of the statutory words.\u201d United States v. Ramirez-Garcia, 646 F.3d 778, 783 (11th Cir. 2011) (quotation omitted). Lockhart clarifies that the terms \u201caggravated sexual abuse,\u201d \u201csexual abuse,\u201d \u201cabusive sexual contact involving a minor or ward,\u201d and \u201cabusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\u201d should be construed by looking to how they are defined in Chapter 109A of Title 18 of the United States Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">The panel opinion correctly recognizes that when we apply the categorical ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>proach to decide whether a prior conviction triggers a sentencing enhancement, our binding precedent requires us to define any non-traditional generic offenses listed in the federal sentencing enhancement statute based on their plain meaning. Ramirez-Garcia, 646 F.3d at 783. Further, we have applied this rule to federal statutes that list generic crimes like those listed in \u00a7\u00a7 2261(e) and 2252A(b)(l). See United States v. Mathis, 767 F.3d 1264, 1284-85 (11th Cir. 2014). Although most of our sister circuits adhere to this same rule, see, e.g., United States v. Mateen, 806 F.3d 857, 859-63 (6th Cir. 2015); United States v. Barker, 723 F.3d 315, 322-25 (2d Cir. 2013) (per curiam), one notable exception is the Seventh Circuit. That Circuit, in an opinion written by Judge Easterbrook, held that the term \u201cabusive\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(1) (yet another federal statute that assesses enhancements for prior state convictions \u201crelating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\u201d) should be construed in light of \u201cthe treatment that term [\u201cabusive\u201d] receives in Chapter 109A of the Criminal Code (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241-48, and titled \u2018Sexual Abuse\u2019).\u201d United States v. Osborne, 551 F.3d 718, 721 (7th Cir. 2009). More to the point, the Osborne panel said that \u201c[g]iven the lack of a definition [of the word \u201cabusive\u201d] in \u00a7 2252, we think it best to say that, as a matter of federal law, sexual behavior is \u2018abusive\u2019 only if it is similar to one of the crimes denominated as a form of \u2018abuse\u2019 elsewhere in Title 18.\u201d Id. Further, the Osborne panel singled out \u00a7 2241 (titled \u201cAggravated sexual abuse\u201d), \u00a7 2242 (titled \u201cSexual abuse\u201d), and \u00a7 2243 (titled \u201cSexual abuse of a minor or ward\u201d) because the titles of those three sections match the \u201cthree terms that \u00a7 2252(b)(1) employs\u201d to indicate which state crimes trigger sentencing enhancements under \u00a7 2252(b)(1). Id. at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Although the Seventh Circuit holds the minority view on this issue, Lockhart indicates to me that their approach is right. In Lockhart, the Supreme Court construed the phrase \u201caggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(2) and held that \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d modifies only \u201cabusive sexual conduct,\u201d and not \u201caggravated sexual abuse\u201d or \u201csexual abuse.\u201d 136 S.Ct. at 961. To arrive at this conclusion, the Supreme Court (like the Seventh Circuit in Osborne) observed that the titles of \u00a7\u00a7 2241-2243\u2014the first three sections in Chapter 109A of Title 18\u2014\u201cmirror precisely the order, precisely the divisions, and nearly precisely the words used to describe the three state sexual-abuse predicate crimes in \u00a7 2252(b)(2): \u2018aggravated sexual abuse,\u2019 \u2018sexual abuse,\u2019 and \u2018abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u2019\u201d Id. at 964. The Supreme Court said \u201c[t]his similarity appears to be more than a coincidence.\u201d Id. Although the Court could not \u201cstate with certainty that Congress used Chapter 109A as a template for the list of state predicates\u201d in \u00a7 2252(b)(2), it also could not \u201cignore the parallel.\u201d Id. Finally, the Supreme Court reasoned that if Congress had wanted \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d to modify all the terms in the phrase, and not just \u201cabusive sexual conduct,\u201d it would not \u201chave followed, or thought it needed to follow, so closely the structure and language of Chapter 109A.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">In short, the Lockhart holding relied in part on the similarity between the generic crimes listed in \u00a7 2252(b)(2) and the statutory crimes that make up Chapter 109A, which it thought was \u201cmore than a coincidence.\u201d Id. This strongly suggests that we should construe those generic crimes in light of their parallel Chapter 109A sections. As Lockhart reasoned, if Congress had wanted the generic crimes in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>\u00a7 2252(b)(2) to be construed according to their common, ordinary meaning, and not by reference to Chapter 109A, I doubt it would \u201chave followed, or thought it needed to follow, so closely the structure and language of Chapter 109A.\u201d Id. Thus, with regard to \u00a7 2252A(b)(l), which also contains the phrase \u201caggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, and abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward,\u201d I would look to \u00a7 2241 to define \u201caggravated sexual abuse,\u201d \u00a7 2242 to define \u201csexual abuse,\u201d and \u00a7 2243 to define \u201cabusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d As for \u00a7 2251(e), I would use \u00a7 2244\u2014a section in Chapter 109A titled \u201cAbusive sexual contact\u201d\u2014to define \u201cabusive sexual contact involving a minor or ward.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Under this approach, Johnson\u2019s prior Florida conviction for lewd and lascivious molestation would not trigger a sentencing enhancement under either \u00a7 2251(e) or \u00a7 2252A(b)(l). Section 2243(a) defines sexual abuse of a minor as \u201cknowingly engaging] in a sexual act\u201d with a minor who is (1) at least 12 but not older than 15 years of age; and (2) at least 4 years younger than the defendant. However, touching genitalia \u201cthrough the clothing\u201d is not defined as a \u201csexual act\u201d by Chapter 109A, and neither is touching other body parts (through or underneath clothing). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(2)(D). Also, \u00a7 2243(c)(1) allows the defense that a defendant had a reasonable belief that the victim was 16 years of age. On the other hand, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(6) (2002) criminalized touching non-genitalia body parts through clothing (which is not a \u201csexual act\u201d under \u00a7 2246(2)(D)), did not require the defendant to be at least four years older than the victim, and expressly forbade good-faith belief defenses. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) (2002). The elements of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(5) (2002) were therefore too much in contrast to those in \u00a7 2243 for a conviction under \u00a7 800.04(5) to \u201crelat[e] to\u201d \u201cabusive sexual conduct involving a minor.\u201d See Osborne, 551 F.3d at 721 (\u201c[A] state statute that makes it a crime for one teenager to engage in sexual contact with another, without committing a sexual act or without a four-year difference in age, is hard to classify as \u2018abusive\u2019 given the treatment that term receives in Chapter 109A of the Criminal Code (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241-48, and titled \u2018Sexual Abuse\u2019).\u201d). By extension, a prior conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(5) (2002) also doesn\u2019t \u201crelat[e] to ... abusive sexual contact involving a minor\u201d as defined by \u00a7 2244 because the subsection of \u00a7 2244 that addresses minors who are at least 12 but not older than 15 years of age defines \u201cabusive sexual contact\u201d as contact that amounts to a \u201csexual act\u201d that would violate \u00a7 2243. See \u00a7 2244(a)(3). Because Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(5) (2002) criminalizes a much broader range of conduct than does \u00a7 2243, the two are not \u201crelat[ed].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Even though Lockhart strongly supports the Seventh Circuit\u2019s approach to interpreting statutes like \u00a7 2252(b)(2) (including \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l)), Lock-hart is not so \u201cclearly on point\u201d that it \u201cundermine[s]\u201d our established practice of interpreting these statutes based on their plain meaning \u201cto the point of abrogation.\u201d United States v. Archer, 531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir. 2008). While the Supreme Court supported its conclusion in Lockhart by pointing to the similarity between the generic offenses in \u00a7 2252(b)(2) and the statutory crimes in Chapter 109A, its holding was not about how to construe the generic crimes of \u201caggravated sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>abuse, sexual abuse, and abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\u201d individually. It was instead about whether \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d modifies only \u201cabusive sexual conduct,\u201d and not \u201caggravated sexual abuse\u201d or \u201csexual abuse.\u201d As a result, even if our current approach to defining those generic crimes appears to conflict with the reasoning set out in Lock-hart, we must apply it until it is overturned by the Supreme Court or by this Court sitting en banc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-5\">.
