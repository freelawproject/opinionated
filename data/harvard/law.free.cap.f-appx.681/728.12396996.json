The officers\u2019 argument in favor of qualified immunity is based on allegations made on the face of the amended complaint. The officers contend the allegations fail to show they violated Anthony Ledea\u2019s constitutional rights with respect to the failure to intervene claim. Specifically, they contend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>the complaint did not identify the officers who failed to intervene or to allege how the officers had the time and ability to intervene.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The officers assert the amended complaint failed to plead factual allegations sufficient to show Ledea\u2019s constitutional rights were violated, thus they should have received qualified immunity. After review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we affirm the denial of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense to personal liability that can be asserted on a pretrial motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. <em>Skrtich v. Thornton, </em>280 F.3d 1295, 1306 (11th Cir. 2002). An official asserting the affirmative defense of qualified immunity must initially establish that he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority, and the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to show that the official is not entitled to qualified immunity. <em>Skop v. City of Atlanta, Ga., </em>485 F.3d 1130, 1136-37 (11th Cir. 2007). To overcome qualified immunity, the plaintiff must show that: (1) the defendant violated a constitutional right; and (2) the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation. <em>Id. </em>at 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">\u201cAt the motion to dismiss stage in the litigation, \u2018the qualified immunity inquiry and the Rule 12(b)(6) standard become intertwined.\u2019 \u201d <em>Keating v. City of Miami, </em>598 F.3d 753, 760 (11th Cir. 2010). \u201c[W]hether a particular complaint sufficiently alleges a clearly established violation of law cannot be decided in isolation from the facts pleaded.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). To properly state a claim, a complaint must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (quotations omitted). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">The district court did not err in concluding that Ledea\u2019s <em>pro se </em>amended complaint <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> sufficiently alleged that the officers violated Ledea\u2019s constitutional rights. Although the officers argue the pleading did not adequately identify the defendants involved, the complaint alleged Officers A. Rodriguez and Lang broke the passenger windows to Ledea\u2019s car while Detective Menoud stomped on the windshield until it broke. It further alleged Officer Valdes-Valle and Detective Romero jerked Ledea out of his car and beat him for a few minutes. The complaint contended that all other officers witnessed the beating, were in \u201cpositions to intervene,\u201d and acted with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>indifference during those \u201cfew minutes\u201d by failing to prevent Ledea\u2019s injuries. These allegations established the minimum facts necessary to state a claim that Ledea\u2019s constitutional rights were violated by the officers\u2019 failure to intervene. This Court has acknowledged the difficulties <em>pro se </em>petitioners have in pre-trial investigations and identifying alleged wrongdoers. <em>Brown v. Sikes, </em>212 F.3d 1205, 1209 n.4 (11th Cir. 2000). As such, the court did not err in concluding that, at the pleading stage, and without the aid of discovery, the complaint is sufficient to place the officers on notice of Ledea\u2019s claim. The complaint alleged the minimum facts necessary to state a claim that Ledea\u2019s constitutional rights were violated by the officers\u2019 failure to intervene.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the district court did not err in denying the officers qualified immunity and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-7\">. In their statement of the issues on appeal, the officers also allege that the district court erred by improperly shifting the burden to them in order to show that they are entitled to qualified immunity. This issue is not meaningfully addressed in the briefing, and is without merit, as the district court\u2019s order placed the burden upon Ledea to allege a constitutional violation and show that the constitutional right was clearly established.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b751-8\">. We review the denial of a motion to dismiss based upon qualified immunity <em>de novo. Cot-tone v. Jenne, </em>326 F.3d 1352, 1357 (11th Cir. 2003).
