Reg. 10,494 (March 26, 1986), and its implementing legislation, the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (\u201cICARA\u201d),' 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 9003(b) (together, \u201cHague Convention\u201d). She alleged that her child\u2019s father, Noe Manuel Perez, an American citizen, abducted the child and wrongfully retained him in Florida. After a bench trial, the district court granted Reyes\u2019s petition. Per\u00e9z has appealed. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">The facts of this case are described in detail in the district court\u2019s order; we recite here only what is necessary to resolve this appeal. '</p>\n<p id=\"b800-14\">Perez, a United States citizen and resident of Florida, met Reyes in Guatemala, and the two began a romantic relationship. Perez traveled to Guatemala frequently, in part to spend time with Reyes. When Perez visited Guatemala, he stayed at Reyes\u2019s parents\u2019 house. When the relationship became more serious, Reyes obtained a tourist visa, valid for ten years, which permitted her to stay in the United States for up to six months at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-15\">In March 2016, Perez visited Reyes in Guatemala to attend a friend\u2019s wedding. During this visit, Reyes became pregnant with E.L. Reyes spent the bulk of her pregnancy in Guatemala. Both Reyes and Perez expressed a desire to raise their child in a traditional two-parent household, and so, in June 2016, Reyes traveled to the United States to stay with Perez. The parties dispute the purpose of this trip: Reyes testified that she was merely testing the waters to see what life in Florida with Perez would be like; Perez testified that it was their mutual intention to raise their child together in Florida. Reyes left the' overwhelming bulk of her personal belongings in Guatemala\u2014including her seven pets. Reyes also owned an auto repair shop in Guatemala, which she did not sell, instead arranging for her mother to manage it in her absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-16\">Reyes testified that this trial period went poorly, as Perez paid little attention to her and did not seem to care about her pregnancy-related discomfort or other health issues. Perez did not take her to' see a doctor or help her to navigate the Ameri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>can health care system. Reyes returned to Guatemala a little over a month after arriving in Florida. She had no intent to return to Florida, noting that her time with Perez had been unpleasant. Nevertheless, Perez persistently attempted to persuade her to return to Florida, visiting Guatemala in August 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">On this trip to Guatemala, Perez gave Reyes an engagement ring. Reyes testified that she rejected the ring; Perez testified that Reyes enthusiastically accepted his proposal. Nonetheless, Reyes agreed to give Florida another chance. Perez returned to Guatemala in late September 2015 to bring Reyes back to Florida. Reyes testified that Perez again presented her with an engagement ring, which she accepted but never wore. In early October, Perez and Reyes returned to Florida. Once more, the great bulk of Reyes\u2019s possessions, including her pets, remained in Guatemala. Reyes received an offer to purchase her business, but she turned it down in part because she was uncertain that her relationship with Perez in Florida would work. Reyes also had a house under construction in Guatemala at the time, and she did not turn off utilities at the house; indeed, she continued to pay her utility bills even though she was in Florida. She again entered the United States on a tourist visa. According to Reyes, she never told Perez that she was coming to Florida permanently; rather, she told him that she was merely coming to try Florida again. Perez disagreed, testifying it was his understanding that Reyes was coming to Florida to stay and that they both intended to raise a family in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">E.L. was born in Florida in December 2015. According to Reyes, the relationship between Perez and Reyes was deteriorating. Perez disputed this, testifying that their time in Florida was happy. In February 2016, when E.L. was first able to travel, Reyes, Perez, and E.L. took a trip to Guatemala. Because Perez\u2019s relationship with Reyes\u2019s parents had been strained, Reyes and Perez stayed in separate places during the trip. Reyes stayed with E.L.\u2014 and held E.L.\u2019s passport\u2014while Perez stayed with a friend. Reyes testified that upon their arrival in Guatemala, Perez\u2019s friend approached Reyes\u2019s mother and advised her that Reyes should hold on to E.L.\u2019s documents, as the friend was aware that Perez intended to take E.L. back to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">While in Guatemala, Reyes met with an immigration attorney who advised her that because she had spent almost five months in the United States on a tourist visa\u2014and' because she had given birth to a child during that period'\u2014she risked being denied entry to the United States again. The attorney also advised her that because Perez and E.L. were American citizens, Perez would be able to enter the United States with E.L. Reyes subsequently applied for and obtained \u201cSecurity Measures\u201d\u2014essentially, a restraining order against Perez\u2014in Guatemala, claiming that she was \u201ca victim of abuse, psychological, economic, moral and mental violence, threats, indignities and the most important he is threatening me that he will take my son [ajway because he has American nationality.\u201d Reyes did not inform Perez about the Security Measures, but did tell him that she and E.L. would not be returning to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Perez returned to Florida and obtained an \u201cOrder to Pick-Up Minor Child\u201d from the Broward County Circuit Court. Perez did not inform Reyes about the order. After finding out about the Guatemalan Security Measures, Perez filed a response in opposition to them. Despite the parties\u2019 legal gymnastics, Perez and Reyes continued to communicate with one another, Perez periodically sent money to Reyes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>support E.L., and he visited Guatemala on three separate occasions between April and June 2016. In Guatemala, E.L. lived with Reyes and her parents and brother, regularly attended church with them, and regularly saw a pediatrician.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">On a fourth visit to Guatemala in July 2016\u2014for E.L.\u2019s baptism\u2014Perez devised a scheme to remove E.L. to the United States. Perez asked Reyes to accompany him to drop off an invitation to the baptism at a friend\u2019s house. E.L. was with Perez and Reyes when they went to drop off the invitation. Perez asked Reyes to take the invitation to the front door, and when she got out of the car, Perez drove off with E,L. He then drove back to the United States through Mexico. After arriving, Perez informed Reyes that he was in the United States with E.L., who was safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">On September 7, 2016, Reyes filed a verified petition in federal district court requesting relief under the Hague Convention, seeking the return of the child to Guatemala. The following day, the district court issued a show cause order and set an evidentiary hearing for September 16. Two days before the hearing, Perez filed a response to the petition and show-cause order. Then, at the evidentiary hearing, Perez requested a continuance of at least one week. The district court granted a continuance to September 21. On September 21, the district court began a four day bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">After the trial, the district court entered an order granting Reyes\u2019s petition and requiring E.L.\u2019s immediate return to his mother. This is Perez\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">In deciding an appeal under the Hague Convention, \u201c[w]e review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions and applications of the law to the facts <em>de novo.\u201d Gomez v. Fuenmayor, </em>812 F.3d 1006, 1007 (11th Cir. 2016). \u201cThe clearly erroneous standard is highly deferential and requires that we uphold the district court\u2019s factual determinations so long as they are plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1007-OS (internal quotation marks omitted). Determining a child\u2019s habitual residence presents a mixed question of fact and law, so the district court\u2019s findings of historical facts are reviewed for clear error, \u201cbut with regard to the ultimate issue of habitual residence, the appellate court will review <em>de novo.\u201d Seaman v. Peterson, </em>766 F.3d 1252, 1258 (11th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">The Hague Convention is designed \u201cto protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the State of their habitual residence.\u201d <em>Hanley v. Roy, </em>485 F.3d 641, 644 (11th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under the Hague Convention, if a petitioner demonstrates that a child was removed wrongfully from the country of his habitual residence, the district court must order the child returned.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>Therefore, in order to prevail, Reyes had to prove that: (1) the child was \u201chabitually resident\u201d in Guatemala at the time Perez removed him to the United States; (2) the removal was in breach of Reyes\u2019s custody rights under Guatemalan law; and (3) Reyes was exercising those rights at the time of removal. <em>See Ruiz v. Tenorio, </em>392 F.3d 1247, 1251 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>(llth Cir. 2004). Although the Hague Convention lacks a definition for \u201chabitual residence,\u201d \u201c[c]ourts have been instructed to interpret the expression according to the ordinary and natural meaning of the two words it contains\u201d and decide a child\u2019s habitual residence \u201cby reference to all the circumstances of a particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1252 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although generally an infant\u2019s habitual residence can be discerned based on the parents\u2019 shared intent, where \u201cthe parents\u2019 relationship has broken down\u201d through a \u201cconflict [that] is contemporaneous with the birth of the child, no habitual residence may ever come into existence\u201d based on the parties\u2019 shared intent. <em>Delvoye v. Lee, </em>329 F.3d 330, 333 (3d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In its order granting Reyes\u2019s petition, the district court concluded that Reyes and Perez never shared an intent to reside in Florida or Guatemala and that the child\u2019s only habitual residence was in Guatemala with his mother. The district court further found that Perez\u2019s removal of E.L. was in breach of Reyes\u2019s custody rights under Guatemalan law, which rights Reyes was exercising at the time of E.L.\u2019s wrongful removal. Thus, the district court ruled, the Hague Convention required that E.L. be returned to Reyes.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Perez challenges the first and second Hague Convention elements. As to the first element, he asserts that the district court erred in determining that the parents had never formed a shared intent to live in Florida such that the child\u2019s habitual residence was Guatemala. As to the second element, Perez contends the district court\u2019s conclusion that Reyes had custody of E.L. under Guatemalan law was erroneous because it was based on a flawed affidavit from Reyes\u2019s Guatemalan attorney. Finally, Perez argues the district court violated his right to due process by denying him a fair opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">A. The district court did not err in determining that E.L.\u2019s habitual residence was Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Perez mounts two challenges to the district court\u2019s conclusion that E.L.\u2019s habitual residence was Guatemala. First, Perez asserts that the district court overlooked evidence that he and Reyes shared an intent to reside in Florida, thereby making Florida the child\u2019s habitual residence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, Perez asserts that he never consented to the child living in Guatemala, so Guatemala could not have been the child\u2019s habitual residence. We reject both of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">We cannot agree that the district court - erred in determining that Reyes never formed an intent to reside in Florida. The parties\u2019 testimony was in conflict with regard to Reyes\u2019s intentions when she moved to Florida. The district court resolved the conflict in favor of Reyes\u2014 finding that she had no settled intent to raise E.L. in Florida\u2014and we see no clear error in that finding. The district court found that although Perez and Reyes had discussed marriage, they never announced an engagement. Crucial to the court\u2019s find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>ing was the fact that Reyes was in Florida on a tourist visa that only permitted her to stay in the country for six months at a time. Aside from one meeting with an immigration attorney, neither Reyes nor Perez took any steps to change Reyes\u2019s immigration status. In concert with her temporary immigration status, Reyes left virtually all of her possessions\u2014including her pets\u2014in Guatemala, and she made no plans to sell or close her business there. The evidence showed that Reyes only remained in Florida after the birth of E.L. because her midwife advised her to wait to ensure E.L.\u2019s health, and she had to wait for E.L.\u2019s passport to issue. In short, ample evidence\u2014much of it undisputed\u2014supported the district court\u2019s finding that Reyes had no intent to raise E.L. in Florida; the district court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">With respect to the district court\u2019s conclusion that Florida was not E.L.\u2019s habitual residence, <em>Ruiz </em>is on point. There, the court found that the parents had no settled intent to reside in Mexico where the \u201cnumerous objective facts\u201d indicated that the mother\u2019s \u201cintent with respect to the move to Mexico was clearly conditional.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>392 F.3d at 1254. The mother \u201cretained bank accounts and credit cards in the United States; [ ] had her American mail forwarded to an American address and not to Mexico; and [] moved her nursing license to Florida shortly after [ ] mov[ing] to Mexico.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Reyes\u2019s behavior here creates an equally strong\u2014if not stronger\u2014 inference that there was no settled intent to raise E.L. in Florida. Like the mother in <em>Ruiz, </em>Reyes\u2019s actions demonstrate that she moved to Florida for \u201ca trial period,\u201d and nothing more. <em>Id.-, see also Chafin v. Chafin, </em>742 F.3d 934, 939 (11th Cir. 2013) (affirming the district court\u2019s conclusion that the United States was not the child\u2019s habitual residence where the mother \u201ccame to the United States in February, 2010 on a ninety-day visitor visa that is only issued with proof of a return ticket\u201d and \u201cmaintained her residence in Scotland and did not cancel [the child\u2019s] planned enrollment in Scottish school when she came to Alabama\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Moreover, this case contrasts starkly with situations where we have found a settled intent to reside in a particular location. For example, in <em>Seaman, </em>we affirmed the district court\u2019s finding that the parties had a settled intent to raise their child in Mexico where they \u201csold their possessions in Georgia and took up their own dwelling in Mexico,\u201d \u201cenrolled the children in Mexican schools when they reached the appropriate age,\u201d \u201cwere absent from the United States from a residential standpoint for more than four years, returning to the United States only a few times for visits of limited duration,\u201d and \u201cestablished legal, temporary residence in Mexico.\u201d <em>Seaman, </em>766 F.3d at 1258. Despite the duration of the parties\u2019 residency in Mexico and the fact that they sold their possessions in Georgia, we nevertheless noted that <em>Seaman </em>was a \u201cclose and difficult case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1261. Here, by contrast, Reyes stayed only briefly in the United States after the E.L.\u2019s birth, and her possessions and business remained in Guatemala. To the extent <em>Seaman </em>was a close call, in this case it is clear: the parties had no settled intent to raise E.L. in Florida.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">The cases Perez cites do nothing to alter this conclusion. Perez first cites to a passage from <em>Mozes v. Mozes, </em>239 F.3d 1067, 1077 (9th Cir. 2001), noting that courts are \u201cgenerally unwilling to let one parent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>alleged reservations about the move stand in the way of finding a shared and settled purpose.\u201d But <em>Mazes </em>explicitly qualified this language, limiting it to circumstances where \u201ca family has jointly taken all the steps associated with abandoning habitual residence in one country to take it up in another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the district court\u2019s finding that Reyes did not take \u201call the steps associated with abandoning\u201d her residence in Guatemala was well supported by evidence. Equally unhelpful to Perez is <em>Feder v. Evans-Feder, </em>63 F.3d 217 (3d Cir. 1995), in which the court held that Australia was the child\u2019s habitual residence where the parents \u201cpurchased and renovated a house, pursued interests and employment, and arranged for [the child\u2019s] immediate and long-term schooling\u201d in Australia, notwithstanding the mother\u2019s reservations. <em>Id. </em>at 224. Reyes took no similar steps in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The district court als\u00f3 properly found\u2014 and Reyes does not contest\u2014that the parties had no settled intent to raise E.L. in Guatemala. Therefore, the question is whether the district court properly found that E.L. became habitually resident in Guatemala before Perez removed- E.L. to Florida. We conclude that it did. We are persuaded by the district court\u2019s reliance on <em>Kijowska v. Haines, </em>463 F.3d 583 (7th Cir. 2006), which featured a similar fact pattern. There, shortly after the child\u2019s birth in the United States, the mother removed the child to Poland. <em>Id. </em>at 586. The father then obtained an ex parte custody order from an Illinois state court. <em>Id. </em>When the mother returned to the United States attempting to reconcile with the father, the father falsely informed an immigration officer that the mother intended to overstay her visa. <em>Id. </em>The officer let the father take the child, forcing the mother to return to Poland. <em>Id. </em>In determining the child\u2019s habitual residence, the Seventh Circuit explained that the father had circumvented available legal remedies by wrongfully abducting the child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXL\">Suppose that [the child\u2019s] habitual residence when her mother took her to Poland in December 2004 was the United States and that [the mother\u2019s] removal of her was wrongful. [The father\u2019s] remedy would have been to file a petition under the Hague Convention and its implementing federal statute. He did not do that. He merely sought a custody order from an Illinois state court and then used that order to help obtain the self-help remedy of taking the child from' the airport. To give a legal advantage to an abductor who has a perfectly good legal remedy in lieu of abduction yet failed to pursue it would be contrary to the Hague Convention\u2019s goal of discouraging abductions by denying to the abductor any legal advantage from the abduction. By failing to pursue his legal remedy, [the father] enabled [the child] to obtain a habitual residence in the country to which her mother took her, even if the initial taking was wrongful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 588-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">So too here. Perez voluntarily left Guatemala after he was informed that neither Reyes nor E.L. would return to the United States. Instead of following the procedures outlined by the Hague Convention, Perez initiated a custody proceeding in the United States, received a favorable outcome, and engaged in self-help by returning to Guatemala and abducting E.L.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As in <em>Ki-jowska, </em>Perez\u2019s failure to \u201cpursue his legal remedy\u201d under the Hague Convention weighs in favor of finding that E.L\u2019s habitual residence was in Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"AD4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>The district court also properly considered E.L.\u2019s settlement in Guatemala in determining that it was E.L.\u2019s habitual residence. \u201cWhere a child is born while his ... mother is temporarily present in a country other than that of her habitual residence it does seem, however, that the child will normally have no habitual residence until living in a country on a footing of some stability.\u201d <em>Delvoye, </em>329 F.3d at 334 (alteration ]n original) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]he Convention is concerned with the situation where the child is taken out of the family and social environment in which its life has developed.\u201d <em>Holder v. Holder, </em>392 F.3d 1009, 1019 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, the district court properly relied on a number of factors in determining that E.L. was living in Guatemala with some stability, including the facts that E.L. was: living in a house with his mother, grandparents, and uncle, with whom he was bonding; regularly seen by a pediatrician in Guatemala; to be baptized in Guatemala; and regularly attending church with Reyes and her family. Moreover, Perez repeatedly sent money to Guatemala to support E.L. and visited the child in Guatemala multiple times prior to the abduction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Were any greater quantum of contacts with a particular location required to establish an initial habitual residence, parents could freely engage in a continuous game of abduction ping pong, given the many months or even years in which they could freely abduct the child before any particular location became the child\u2019s habitual residence. This is contrary to the purposes of the Hague Convention. We therefore conclude, as did the district court, that at the time E,L. was abducted, his habitual residence was in Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">B. The district court did not err in determining that Reyes had custodial rights over E.L. under Guatemalan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Perez next argues that the district court erred in determining that Reyes had custody rights under Guatemalan law. He quibbles with the district court\u2019s failure to view \u201cmore skeptically\u201d the affidavit of Reyes\u2019s counsel, which described Guatemalan custody law and Reyes\u2019s rights thereunder. Perez Brief at 26. According to Perez, \u201cthe [district] court accepted this [affidavit] even though [Reyes] testified that the <em>same lawyer </em>told her to lie in the Guatemalan court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We are unpersuaded that the district court so erred. Critically, in its order granting Reyes\u2019s petition, the district court nowhere relied on the affidavit regarding Guatemalan law that Reyes\u2019s counsel supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">Instead, the district court relied on the Hague Convention, Guatemala\u2019s Civil Law Code, and a series of federal cases construing the Hague Convention\u2019s parental rights provisions. Perez argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>district court\u2019s construction of these sources was erroneous. Specifically, he asserts that the district court improperly rejected the assessment of Guatemalan law provided by a Guatemalan attorney on Perez\u2019s behalf. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">As the district court explained, Article 252 of the Civil Law Code of Guatemala grants parental power over minor children jointly to a married mother and father, and in any other case to the parent in whose power the child is. Because Reyes and Perez were not married, the question becomes: in whose power was E.L. at the time he was removed to the United States? Article 261 of the Civil Law Code notes that children shall be in the power of the mother where the mother is unwed, unless both parents agree that the father should have custody. Consequently, the district court properly determined that under Guatemalan law Reyes had custodial rights over E.L. sufficient to render Perez\u2019s removal of E.L. unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The attorney\u2019s affidavit Perez submitted did not quarrel with the conclusion that if the Civil Law Code applied, Reyes had custodial rights over E.L. Instead, the affidavit asserted that the Civil Law Code did not apply to E.L. because E.L. was not \u201cregistered\u201d in Guatemala. The problem with the affidavit is that it provided no primary source Guatemalan law\u2014either in the form of statutes or case law\u2014to support the proposition that the Civil Law Code does not apply to unregistered children. While the affidavit repeatedly cited (and provided translated text of) law indicating that Guatemalan parents must register their children within 60 days of birth, none of the law cited in the affidavit makes application of the Civil Law Code contingent on registration. Indeed, the law Perez provided (which the affidavit labeled Registration At The Vital Records, Articles 67-73) explicitly identified the consequences of failing to register: \u201cThe lack of registration before the Office of Vital Records prevents the individual from obtaining a Personal [] Identification Card and the issuance of any certification by [Guatemala\u2019s registration agency].\u201d Aff. of Frank Rigoberto de Le\u00f3n Ortiz (Doc. 43-l).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This language affords us no basis to reject application of the Civil Law Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Perez protests that construing Guatemalan law in the way Reyes suggests would permit single Guatemalan mothers to abduct their children and bring them to Guatemala, whose courts would automatically grant them custody. But the Hague Convention prevents Perez\u2019s slippery slope from manifesting. Where a child is removed from his habitual residence and taken to Guatemala, the Hague Convention mandates that the child be returned to his habitual residence for a custody determination. Where a child has no previous habitual residence and the mother removes the child to Guatemala\u2014as happened here\u2014a Guatemalan court is only empowered by the Hague Convention to determine each parent\u2019s custodial rights if the child has become habitually resident in Guatemala. If the child has become habitually resident in Guatemala, then Guatemala is the Hague Convention\u2019s preferred forum. If the child has no habitual residence in any location, then there is no alternative forum that necessarily would be preferable to Guatemala, and Perez\u2019s complaint is simply that he finds Guatemalan law unfavorable. In short, Perez\u2019s assertions are unfounded. In this case, Guatemala is empowered to make the custody determination\u2014and Perez\u2019s removal of E.L. was unlawful\u2014because E.L. was habitually resident in Guatemala at the point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>when he was removed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">We therefore uphold the district court\u2019s determination that Reyes had custodial rights over E.L. in Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">C. The district court did not violate Perez\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Finally, Perez argues that the district court violated his due process rights by giving him only seven days to prepare for an evidentiary hearing. This argument is meritless. \u201cThe court\u2019s inquiry is limited to the merits of the abduction claim and not the merits of the underlying custody battle.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>392 F,3d at 1250. \u201cThe [Convention is intended as a rapid remedy for the left-behind parent to return to the status quo before the wrongful removal or retention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Consequently, \u201cArticle 11 of the Convention provides [t]he judicial ... authorities of Contracting States shall act <em>expeditiously </em>in proceedings for the return of children.\u201d <em>West v. Dobrev, </em>735 F.3d 921, 929 (10th Cir. 2013) (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). To facilitate the goal of expediency, \u201ca district court has a substantial degree of discretion in determining the procedures necessary to resolve a petition filed pursuant to the Convention and ICARA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSpecifically, neither the Convention nor ICARA, nor ... the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment ] requires that discovery be allowed or that an evidentiary hearing be conducted as a matter of right in cases arising under the Convention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also March v. Levine, </em>249 F.3d 462, 474 (6th Cir. 2001) (noting that the Hague Convention \u201crequires not only expeditious action by courts under article 11 ... but use of the most expeditious procedures available\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Although this court has not yet assessed the interaction between the Hague Convention\u2019s demand for expediency and due process rights, we are persuaded by the Tenth Circuit\u2019s approach in <em>West. </em>There, the district court possessed the petition, the respondent\u2019s answer to the petition, and the affidavit of a psychologist (provided by the respondent) who had interviewed the children at issue and noted possible child abuse on part of the petitioner. <em>West, </em>735 F.3d at 926-27. The psychologist refused to testify at a hearing, so the respondent asked the court to appoint a psychologist to interview the children. <em>Id. </em>at 927-28. The court declined to do so, found that no evidentiary hearing was necessary, and ordered the respondent to return the children to the petitioner. <em>Id. </em>at 928-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">On appeal, the Tenth Circuit held that the respondent\u2019s due process rights had not been violated. In doing so, the court noted that the respondent was not entitled to \u201cwhat appears ... under the totality of the facts presented [to be] a \u2018fishing expedition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 932. \u201cTo condone Respondent\u2019s efforts would sabotage the underlying premise of the Convention, <em>i.e., </em>that wrongfully removed or retained children be promptly returned to their country of habitual residence, ... so that a court there may resolve custody-related questions in the best interests of the children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, the court reasoned that the respondent \u201creceived a meaningful opportunity to be heard,\u201d which is \u201call due pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>cess requires in the context of a Hague Convention petition.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Here, the district court conducted fact-finding substantially more robust than the district court in <em>West. </em>Instead of relying on written submissions alone, the district court held a four day evidentiary hearing. At the hearing, Perez was permitted to enter documentary evidence, call witnesses, and cross examine Reyes\u2019s witnesses. Although Perez protests that he was unable to locate certain witnesses or obtain certain documentary evidence in time, he was given a five day continuance, and he never identifies what these witnesses\u2019 likely testimony would have been or what that evidence might have shown. Moreover, even if he had, as <em>West </em>demonstrates, the perfect cannot be the enemy of the good in assessing Hague Convention petitions. Like the respondent in <em>West, </em>Perez \u201creceived a meaningful opportunity to be heard,\u201d satisfying his due process rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-9\">. This rule is subject to a number of affirmative defenses, none of which Perez argues applies here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b803-7\">. Perez relatedly contends that the district court erred as a matter of law in concluding that E.L. had no habitual residence for the first two months of his life, arguing that if Guatemala was not the child\u2019s habitual residence at that time, Florida necessarily was. There is no support in the Hague Convention or our case law for the proposition that an infant must have an identifiable habitual residence from the time of birth. Indeed, as the Third Circuit has explained, an infant may indefinitely lack a habitual residence if the parents\u2019 relationship breaks down \"contemporaneous with the birth of the child.\u201d <em>Del-voye, </em>329 F.3d at 333.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b804-5\">. On appeal, Perez argues only that the parties\u2019 shared intent established E.L.\u2019s habitual residence in Florida. He does not argue that E.L.\u2019s acclimatization or contacts in Florida during his brief time there established Florida as E.L.\u2019s habitual residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b805-6\">. Even had E.L. been in Florida, the Pick Up Order that Perez received from a Florida state court permitted law enforcement\u2014not Perez himself\u2014to bring E.L. to Perez.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b806-4\">. <em>Holder </em>concerned children who had a previous habitual residence. 392 F.3d at 1014-15. The question was whether children became sufficiently acclimatized in a new country such that the new country displaced the original country as the children\u2019s habitual residence. <em>Id. </em>In such circumstances, we have held that \"courts should be slow to infer from [contacts in the new location] that an earlier habitual residence has been abandoned.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>392 F.3d at 1253-54 (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, because we conclude that Florida was never E.L.'s habitual residence, the scales are not tipped in favor of Perez, as they would be had we determined otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b806-10\">. Perez argues that the district court improperly found that he consented to Guatemala being E.L.\u2019s habitual residence. But the district court never made such a finding; instead the court cited to Perez\u2019s behavior as one piece of evidence among many indicating that Guatemala had become E.L.\u2019s habitual residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b807-7\">. Citations to \"Doc.\u201d refer to docket entries in the district court record in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\">. Perez also argues that the district court improperly made a final determination that Reyes should have custody of E.L. The district court did no such thing, instead properly recognizing that once E.L. was returned to Guatemala, \u201cthe parties will be able to pursue legal custody proceedings in accordance with the laws of Guatemala.\" Order at 23. The district court found only that Reyes had some custodial rights under Guatemalan law such that Perez's removal of E.L. was unlawful under the Hague Convention,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b809-10\">. To the extent Perez argues that the district court violated his due process rights by setting a hearing for transfer of E.L. too soon after its ruling or by reading from prepared remarks in rejecting Perez\u2019s Emergency Motion to Stay, we reject these arguments as meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
