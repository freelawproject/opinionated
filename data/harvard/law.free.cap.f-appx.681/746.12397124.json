Lozman claimed his arrest violated the First and Fourth Amendments, and constituted a false arrest under Florida state law. The case was tried before a jury and. the jury returned a verdict in favor of the City on all claims. Lozman appeals (1) the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for new trial, and (2) various instructions the district court gave the jury. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">Lozman moved to the City in March 2006 and lived in a floating home in the Riviera Beach Marina. After moving there, Lozman learned that the City had proposed a redevelopment plan for the Marina, which sought to revitalize the City\u2019s waterfront through the use of eminent domain. While many residents opposed the plan, especially the proposed use of eminent domain, Lozman became \u201can outspoken critic.\u201d He attended City Council meetings in May and June 2006 at which he sharply criticized the Mayor and the Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">While the City was finalizing its redevelopment plan, the Florida legislature passed a bill prohibiting the use of eminent domain for private development. In an effort to pass the redevelopment plan before the law went into effect, the City Council held a special emergency meeting the day before the Governor was scheduled to sign the bill into law. That evening, the City approved the redevelopment plan. On June 8, 2006, Lozman filed a lawsuit against the City under the Florida Sunshine Law, seeking to invalidate the City\u2019s approval of the redevelopment plan on the ground that the eleventh-hour meeting was convened without sufficient public notice. On June 28, 2006, the Council held a closed executive session to discuss Lozman\u2019s suit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During this meeting, Councilperson Elizabeth Wade said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-13\">I think it would help to intimidate the same way as [the Florida Department of Law Enforcement] is coming to my house. I am wondering if my lines are tapped or whatever. I think they should be questioned by some of our people ... so that they can feel the same kind of unwarranted heat that we are feeling. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-14\">In response, another councilperson said: \u201cI think what Ms. Wade says is right. We do have to beat this thing, and whatever it takes, I think we should do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-15\">On November 15, 2006, the City Council held a regular public session. Lozman was granted permission to speak during the \u201cnon-agenda\u201d public comments portion of the meeting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The events surrounding Loz-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>man\u2019s comments at the meeting, and his subsequent arrest, were captured on video. Upon reaching the podium, Lozman said, \u201cAs is typical, the Mayor and [another Councilperson] aren\u2019t here during my comments.\u201d The Council remained silent. Loz-man proceeded: \u201cThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office has arrested the second corrupt local politician ... former Palm Beach County Commissioner Tony Masilotti.\u201d At that point, Councilperson Wade interjected, \u201cYou will not stand up and go through that kind of....\u201d Lozman interrupted Councilperson Wade and said \u201cYes, I will.\u201d Councilperson Wade responded, \u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d Lozman continued with his allegations despite Councilperson Wade\u2019s instructions. Wade then called out \u201cOfficer,\u201d summoning City Police Officer Francisco Aguirre who was providing security for the meeting. As Officer Aguirre approached Lozman at the podium, Lozman, speaking louder, said, \u201cI am informing the citizens that two County Commissioners.... \u201d After walking up to Lozman, Officer Aguirre gestured to him and said \u2018Will you walk outside with me[?] I need to talk to you.\u201d In response, Lozman said, \u201cI\u2019m not finished,\u201d and continued speaking. Officer Aguirre then told Lozman, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be arrested if you don\u2019t walk outside.\u201d Lozman responded, \u201cExcuse me? I\u2019m not walking outside, I haven\u2019t finished my comments.\u201d Councilperson Wade then said, \u201cWell, carry him out.\u201d Officer Aguirre handcuffed Lozman. Lozman yelled, \u201cWhy am I being arrested! I have a First Amendment right!\u201d Councilperson Wade responded, \u201cIf you go out, you won\u2019t be arrested.\u201d After Lozman was removed from the meeting, the next person to speak was called to the podium.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Lozman was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest without violence. The state\u2019s attorney determined there was probable cause for the arrest but dismissed the charges because there was \u201cno reasonable likelihood of successful prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">In February 2008, Lozman filed a \u00a7 1983 action against the City. Lozman claimed the City retaliated against him for opposing the City\u2019s redevelopment plan by having him arrested at the City Council meeting. Lozman brought claims for: (1) retaliation by false arrest, in violation of the First Amendment; (2) unreasonable seizure, in violation of the Fourth Amendment; and (3) common-law false arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">In November 2014 the case went to trial, with Lozman proceeding pro se. Among the many instructions the district court gave the jury, Lozman challenges two on appeal. The first is the district court\u2019s instruction on retaliatory animus. The court instructed the jury that, in order to find the City liable for the First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim, the jury had to find that \u201ca [City] poljce officer arrested [Lozman] and the officer was motivated to take this action because he had an impermissible animus to retaliate against Mr. Lozman for engaging in constitutionally protected speech or conduct.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">The second instruction relevant to Loz-man\u2019s appeal consists of two comments the district court made when instructing the jury on the City\u2019s authority to limit the subject matter of public comment during City Council meetings. First, during Loz-man\u2019s testimony, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-12\">Clearly, it would not be appropriate for someone to come in and take a copy of the New York Times and just simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>read the editorial section of the New York Times, that would have nothing to do with the City of,Riviera Beach....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5n\">Then, during the final charge, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-4\">[I]f a chairperson [of the City Council] was saying to Mr. Lozman, Mr. Lozman, you need to sit down because we\u2019re only going to hear comments about the City of Riviera Beach, even if they didn\u2019t have that rule but if the person was doing that, exercising her discretion or his discretion as the chairperson that would not be discriminatory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the City on all counts. Lozman filed a Motion for New Trial, which the district court denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial for an abuse of discretion. Hewitt v. B.F. Goodrich Co., 732 F.2d 1554, 1556 (11th Cir. 1984). When ruling on a motion for new trial, a trial judge must determine \u201cif in his opinion, the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence or will result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted and alteration adopted). \u201cTo assure that the judge does not simply substitute his judgment for that of the jury, ... new trials should not be granted on evidentiary grounds unless, at a minimum, the verdict is against the great\u2014not merely the greater\u2014weight of the evidence.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted and alteration adopted).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">\u201cWe review jury instructions de novo to determine whether they misstate the law or mislead the jury to the prejudice of the objecting party.\u201d Palmer v. Board of Regents, 208 F.3d 969, 973 (11th Cir. 2000). When reviewing a trial court\u2019s jury instruction, \u201cour task is to examine whether the jury charges, considered as a whole, sufficiently instructed the jury so that the jurors understood the issues and were not misled.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). Reversal is warranted only if the failure to give an instruction prejudiced the requesting party. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-13\">A. '</p>\n<p id=\"b772-14\">Lozman first argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for new trial because the jury\u2019s verdict finding probable cause to arrest for a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 871.01 was against the great weight of the evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-15\">Probable cause \u201cconstitutes an absolute bar\u201d to a claim for false arrest. Rankin v. Evans, 133 F.3d 1425, 1435 (11th Cir. 1998). That is true whether the false arrest claim is brought under the First Amendment, Dahl v. Holley, 312 F.3d 1228, 1236 (11th Cir. 2002), the Fourth Amendment, Rankin, 133 F.3d at 1430, 1435, or state law, id. at 1435. Thus, for all three false arrest claims, the district court instructed the jury that, in order to find in favor of Lozman, the jury had to find that \u201cthe arresting officer lacked probable cause to believe that Mr. Lozman had or was committing a crime.\u201d The jury was instructed, more specifically, to consider whether the officer had probable cause to arrest Loz-man for the offense of Disturbing a Lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Assembly, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 871.01(1). By finding for the City on the three false arrest claims, the jury thus found Officer Aguirre did have probable cause to. arrest Lozman for disturbing a lawful assembly under \u00a7 871.01(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Lozman argues the district court erred in denying his motion for new trial because the jury\u2019s finding of probable cause was against the great weight of the evidence. We disagree. In order for probable cause to exist, \u201can arrest must be objectively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.\u201d Rankin, 133 F.3d at 1435 (quotation omitted and alteration adopted). This standard is met when \u201cthe facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, of which he or she has reasonably trustworthy information, would cause a prudent person to believe, under the circumstances shown, that the suspect has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">To obtain a conviction under \u00a7 871.01(1), the State must prove three elements: (1) the defendant \u201cmust have deliberately acted to create a disturbance^] [t]hat is, he must act with the intention that his behavior impede the successful functioning of the assembly in which he has intervened, or with reckless disregard of the effect of his behavior\u201d; (2) \u201c[t]he acts complained of must be such that a reasonable person would expect them to be disruptive\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe acts must, in fact, significantly disturb the assembly.\u201d S.H.B. v. State, 355 So.2d 1176, 1178 (Fla. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Based on the evidence before the jury\u2014 especially the video footage of Lozman\u2019s conduct at the City Council meeting\u2014the jury could have found that Officer Aguirre reasonably believed Lozman was committing, or was about to commit, the offense of Disturbing a Lawful Assembly. The video shows Lozman interrupted and refused to listen to Councilperson Wade when she tried to admonish him; Lozman refused to leave the podium when Officer Aguirre first asked him to \u201cwalk outside\u201d; and Loz-man then continued to refuse to leave after Officer Aguirre again directed him to \u201cwalk outside\u201d or else be arrested. Because Lozman failed to heed Councilperson Wade and Officer Aguirre\u2019s directions, and repeatedly failed to leave the podium when directed to do so, Officer Aguirre could have reasonably believed: (1) that Lozman acted with \u201creckless disregard of the effect of his behavior\u201d; (2) that \u201ca reasonable person would expect [his conduct] to be disruptive\u201d; and (3) that his conduct \u201csignificantly disturbed] the assembly,\u201d or was about to. See S.H.B., 355 So.2d at 1178. Thus, we cannot say the jury\u2019s finding that Officer Aguirre had probable cause to arrest Lozman for a violation of \u00a7 871.01(1) went against the great weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">Next, Lozman argues the district court erred in its jury instruction on the First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim, specifically, the part of the instruction on retaliatory animus. The court instructed the jury that, in order to find for Lozman on this claim, the jury had to find that Officer Aguirre possessed a retaliatory animus. However, Lozman\u2019s theory at trial was that it was Councilperson Wade\u2014not Officer Aguirre\u2014who was the City official with the retaliatory animus. Lozman claimed that Councilperson Wade caused his arrest by summoning Officer Aguirre to the podium and then directing Officer Aguirre to \u201ccarry [Lozman] out.\u201d Lozman argues he was entitled to have the jury instructed on this theory of animus and causation, and that the district court erred by instructing the jury that Officer Aguirre was the City official whose animus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>(or lack thereof) was dispositive of the First Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Lozman\u2019s argument is compelling, as he seems to have established a sufficient causal nexus between Councilperson Wade and the alleged constitutional injury of his arrest. See Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 370-71, 96 S.Ct: 598, 604, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976) (\u201c[Section 1983] impose[s] liability ... for conduct which \u2018subjects, or causes to be subjected\u2019 the complainant to a deprivation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws.\u201d (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983) (emphasis added)); Sims v. Adams, 537 F.2d 829, 831 (5th Cir. 1976)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u201cThe language of \u00a7 1983 requires a degree of causation ... but it does not specifically require \u2018personal participation.\u2019 \u201d). However, even assuming Lozman is right that it was error to restrict the jury\u2019s animus inquiry to Officer Aguirre, this error was harmless in light of the probable cause finding. See United States v. Webb, 655 F.3d 1238, 1249 n.8 (11th Cir. 2011) (\u201cJury instructions are subject to harmless error review.\u201d). The jury\u2019s determination that the arrest was supported by probable cause defeats Lozman\u2019s First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim as a matter of law. See Dahl, 312 F.3d at 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Finally, Lozman argues the district court erred in its jury instructions about the City\u2019s authority to restrict public comment at City Council meetings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">In order to prevail on a First Amendment retaliation claim, \u201cthe plaintiff must show that the defendant was subjectively motivated to take the adverse action because of the protected speech.\u201d Castle v. Appalachian Tech. Coll., 631 F.3d 1194, 1197 (11th Cir. 2011). Lozman claimed the City had him removed and arrested because he opposed the redevelopment plan. As its defense, the City presented evidence that Lozman was removed\u2014regardless of his opposition to the redevelopment plan\u2014 simply because his comments violated the rules governing the non-agenda public comment period of City Council meetings. More specifically, the City argued Loz-man\u2019s remarks about the arrest of a coun-\u215e commissioner violated the rule that comments during the non-agenda public comment period, while not limited to an agenda item, must still relate to City business. Lozman countered with testimony showing no such requirement existed and that, during the public comment period, residents could speak on any topic, whether related to City business or not. Thus, one of the fact issues for the jury was whether a person during the public comment period could speak only about a topic related to City business. The district court instructed the jury, both during trial and in its final charge, that the First Amendment would not prohibit a city from imposing this sort of restriction if it wanted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">Lozman argues that two comments the district court made while offering instructions on this subject were error. First, during Lozman\u2019s testimony, the court said, \u201cit would not be appropriate for someone to come in [to a City Council meeting] and just simply read the editorial section of the New York Times, that would have nothing to do -with the City of Riviera Beach.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Then, during the final charge, the court said, \u201ceven if [the City Council] didn\u2019t have [a] rule\u201d restricting public comment to topics related to City business, it \u201cwould not be discriminatory\u201d for the Council chairperson to \u201cexercis[e] her discretion\u201d to say \u201cMr. Lozman, you need to sit down because we\u2019re only going to hear comments about the City of Riviera Beach,\u201d Lozman argues these statements effectively told the jury that the City was merely enforcing a valid rule barring speech about non-City matters, instead of allowing the jury to decide whether such a rule existed and whether this rule was what motivated the City\u2019s adverse action against Lozman,</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Read out of context, it might seem that the district court\u2019s comments could have confused the jury by suggesting that the issue of causation\u2014that is, whether the City acted out of an improper retaliatory motive or a legitimate enforcement of its rules\u2014was determined as a matter of law in favor of the City. But these were two isolated remarks, and each was accompanied by a lengthy discussion that clearly presented the fact issue for the jury to decide. After saying \u201cit would not be appropriate\u201d to read The New York Times during the public comment period, the district court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">The jury is going to have to decide what was in the City Council\u2019s mind when they [took the adverse action]. Were they trying to retaliate against him because of something he said before? Or were they saying, You\u2019re not obeying our rule today, and you need to stop. See? That\u2019s what the jury is going to have to decide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Similarly, after saying it \u201cwould not be discriminatory\u201d for the Council chairperson to \u201cexereis[e] her discretion\u201d to remove Mr. Lozman for speaking about non-City matters, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">You\u2019re looking at what is in the mind of the person making the decision. So if the chairperson says to Mr. Lozman, you need to sit down, if [the chairperson is] doing it because they believe they\u2019re enforcing a rule of procedure, and they\u2019re not doing it to strike back at Mr. Lozman, then Mr. Lozman would not have established a discriminatory animus. But if Mr. Lozman has proven to you that they did have \u00e1 discriminatory animus then he would have established that fact no matter what they say. In other words, just because someone says, wait a minute, you\u2019re violating this rule or that rule, if what\u2019s really in their mind is that they\u2019re trying to strike back at Mr. Lozman, that would not be appropriate. That would not be permissible. So remember when we\u2019re talking about discriminatory animus we are looking at what is in the mind of the person making that decision. Are they just trying to run an orderly meeting or are they trying to strike back at Mr. Lozman because he engaged in constitutionality protected speech or conduct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">Taking the court\u2019s instructions \u201cas a whole,\u201d the two comments Lozman complains of would not have misled the jury. Christopher v. Cutter Labs., 53 F.3d 1184, 1190 (11th Cir. 1995); see also Morgan v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc., 551 F.3d 1233, 1283 (11th Cir. 2008) (\u201cWhen the instructions, taken together, properly express the law applicable to the case, there is no error even though an isolated clause may be inaccurate, ambiguous, incomplete or otherwise subject to criticism.\u201d (quotation omitted)). The district court correctly stated the law concerning the City\u2019s authority to restrict public comment during its Council meetings. Further, the court correctly advised the jury that, even if the City claimed to be enforcing such a restriction, the jury would need to decide whether this was pretext for a retaliatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>motive. \u201cSo long as the instructions accurately reflect the law, the trial judge is given wide discretion as to the style and wording employed in the instructions.\u201d Palmer, 208 F.3d at 973. The district court was well within its discretion to phrase the instructions as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-10\">.
