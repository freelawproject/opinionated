(\u201cRESPA\u201d). On appeal, Meeks argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claims because Ocwen did not comply with 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.36(c), that Meeks alleged a concrete injury sufficient to confer Article III standing for statutory damages, and that the district court should have allowed him to amend his complaint. After a careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The facts of this case are straightforward and may be found in greater detail in the district court\u2019s order in the proceedings below. Meeks had a mortgage loan on his property, and Ocwen was at one point the servicer of the loan. When a borrower requests information from a loan servicer, Regulation X provides that the loan servi-cer shall provide \u201ca written response acknowledging receipt\u201d of that request within five days of receiving the request. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">By way of brief review, Meeks, through counsel, mailed Ocwen a written request for information (\u201cRFI\u201d) pursuant to RES-PA and Regulation X. Meeks\u2019s counsel sent the RFI via certified mail, and Ocwen received it on. November 10, 2015. An agent of Ocwen signed the certified mail return receipt (the \u201cCertified Receipt\u201d) on that same day. it is undisputed that Meeks\u2019s attorneys then received this Certified Receipt signed by Ocwen\u2019s agent. This Certified Receipt is attached to Meeks\u2019s amended complaint. On November 19, 2015, Ocwen sent Meeks a substantive response to his RFI.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Over five months later, on April 29, 2016, Meeks, through counsel, sent Ocwen a \u201cNotice of Error\u201d (\u201cNOE\u201d) letter, stating that \u201c[w]e are unsure as to whether you have received our client\u2019s [RFI].\u201d After sending this NOE, Meeks filed this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">On June 3,2016, Meeks filed a counseled amended complaint in Florida state court, alleging that Ocwen violated 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.36(c) (Count I). As to Count I, Meeks alleged that Ocwen did not correctly or timely acknowledge receipt of his RFI, and that he incurred actual damages of less than $100 for mailing the April 2016 NOE, along with attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Meeks also sought statutory damages under RESPA (Count II).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">Defendant Ocwen removed the case to federal court and filed a motion to dismiss. The district court granted Ocwen\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that, under 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.36(c)\u2019s plain and unambiguous language, the Certified Receipt signed by Ocwen\u2019s agent satisfied the regulation\u2019s requirements. The district court also concluded that Meeks had not alleged a sufficiently concrete injury to confer Article III standing as to his claim for statutory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">Under these facts, the district court did not err in dismissing Meeks\u2019s counseled amended complaint with prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-13\">Regulation X provides in relevant part: Within five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>servicer receiving an information request from a borrower, the servicer shall provide to the borrower a written response acknowledging receipt of the information request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.36(c). As the district court acknowledged, whether a Certified Receipt qualifies as a \u201cwritten response acknowledging receipt\u201d is an issue of first impression. As to Count I, under the undisputed factual circumstances of this case\u2014where Meeks\u2019s attorney sent the RFI on behalf of Meeks as a borrower and Meeks\u2019s attorneys unquestionably received the Certified Receipt in response signed by Ocwen\u2019s agent\u2014we agree with the district court that Regulation X was satisfied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">As to Count II, we also agree with the district court that Meeks has not suffered a concrete injury in fact and, thus, does not have Article III standing to assert a claim for statutory damages. See Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. -, -, 136 S.Ct. 1540, 1548-49, 1550, 194 L.Ed.2d 635 (2016) (holding that, while an injury need not be tangible to be \u201cconcrete,\u201d a plaintiff \u201ccannot satisfy the demands of Article III by alleging a bare procedural violation\u201d). Here, Meeks (and his attorneys) had undisputed actual knowledge of receipt of the RFI, although they dispute that its form was sufficient to meet Regulation X\u2019s requirements. Thus, Meeks suffered at most \u201ca bare procedural violation,\u201d and he cannot show that he suffered a real, concrete injury from Ocwen\u2019s actions. See id. at 1548, 1550.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">In sum, under the circumstances of this case, we affirm the district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-7\">. Meeks argues that Ocwen's November 19 response was an untimely \"acknowledgment\u201d of receipt, but that letter plainly provides substantive information about the loan and promises to send Meeks additional relevant documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b814-14\">. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Renfroe v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC, 822 F.3d 1241, 1243 (11th Cir. 2016).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b815-10\">. Alternatively, we affirm because Meeks did not suffer any compensable damages from Ocwen\u2019s alleged violation. See Renfroe, 822 F.3d at 1246 (explaining that damages are an \"essential element in pleading a RESPA claim\u201d). Here, we agree with the district court that Meeks's counsel's NOE appeared to \"falsely question[] the servicer's receipt in order to create a claim for damages.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b815-11\">. Meeks acknowledges in his brief that the \"only question now before this court is whether [he] made a prima facie claim under 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.36(c).\u201d This is consonant with our reading of the scope of his amended complaint and the district court's order. Thus, to the extent his brief seeks to raise other claims, we do not address them. See Egidi v. Mukamai, 571 F.3d 1156, 1163 (11th Cir. 2009) (\"Arguments not properly presented in a party\u2019s initial brief ... are deemed waived.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-26\">As to Meeks\u2019s argument that he should have been granted leave to amend his complaint to supplement his statutory-damages claim, the record reflects that Meeks never requested such leave from the district court. See Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., 314 F.3d 541, 542 (11th Cir. 2002) (\"A district court is not required to grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint sua sponte when the plaintiff, who is represented by counsel, never filed a motion to amend nor requested leave to amend before the district court.\u201d),</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
