The district court\u2019s order compelling arbitration and staying litigation pending arbitration is not appealable. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b); see also Green Tree Fin. Corp.-Ala. v.

Appellant has not shown that the order is appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), because it does not have the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of denying an injunction that \u201caffects predominantly all of the merits\u201d or \u201cmight have a serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence, and ... can be effectually challenged only by immediate appeal.\u201d See Salazar ex rel.
