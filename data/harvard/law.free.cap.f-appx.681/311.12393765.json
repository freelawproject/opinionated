He sought the reduction under Amendment 782 of the Sentencing Guidelines, effective November 1, 2014. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. App. C, Amend. 788. The court deniefl the motion because Salinas-Landaverde was sentenced after the effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission\u201d if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Commission. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 824-26, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). A defendant is eligible for a reduction if the range originally applicable to him was lowered by an amendment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l), p.s. (2014). Because Salinas-Landaverde was afforded the full benefit of Amendment 782, his sentencing range was not lowered as a result of it, and he was not eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 824-26,130 S.Ct. 2683.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">.Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED. Salinas-Landaverde\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
