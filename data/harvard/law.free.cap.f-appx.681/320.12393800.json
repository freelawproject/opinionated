An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) reviewed DeJoh-nette\u2019s application and concluded that, because DeJohnette was capable of working with certain restrictions, he was not enti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>tied to SSDI benefits. The district court concluded there was substantial record evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s factual determinations, and affirmed the ALJ\u2019s ruling. DeJohnette appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">DeJohnette applied for SSDI benefits, alleging disability because of schizophrenia psychosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression, high blood pressure, migraines, anxiety/panic attacks, and insomnia. After his claim was initially denied by the state agency, DeJohnette requested and received a hearing before the ALJ. The ALJ applied the five-step sequential evaluation process established by the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) to determine whether an individual is disabled for purposes of SSDI benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.P.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a), At step four, the ALJ determined that DeJohnette, despite his various ailments, could continue to perform his past work as a paper mill laborer. The ALJ therefore determined that De-Johnette did not qualify for SSDI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">DeJohnette sought to appeal the ALJ\u2019s decision to the SSA\u2019s Appeals Council. The Appeals Council declined DeJohnette\u2019s request for review, concluding there was \u201cno reason under [SSA] rules to review the [ALJ\u2019s] decision.\u201d DeJohnette then went to federal district court. The district court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">\u201cIn an appeal from an ALJ\u2019s denial of [SSDI] benefits, we review the ALJ\u2019s decision alone to determine whether [it] applied the proper legal standard and, if so, whether substantial evidence supports [its] decision.\u201d <em>Randall v. Astrue, </em>570 F.3d 651, 655 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">DeJohnette makes three arguments as to why the ALJ\u2019s determination was not supported by substantial evidence. He contends that the ALJ: (1) wrongly rejected the assessment of Dr. Agarwal, DeJoh-nette\u2019s treating psychiatrist; (2) made a mistaken credibility determination because it did not properly take into account the ways in which DeJohnette\u2019s mental impairments prevented him from complying with prescribed treatment; and (3) mistakenly relied on the testimony of a Vocational Expert (\u201cVE\u201d) to the effect that DeJoh-nette could competently work as a paper mill laborer. None of these arguments is availing. We address each in turn,</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">A. Dr. Agarwal</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">After treating DeJohnette in 2012, Dr. Rita Agarwal filled out a form and checked a box indicating that DeJohnette \u201cface[d] a substantial possibility of deterioration in mental or physical condition or functioning if either home and community-based services or nursing facility services [were] not provided in less than 120 days.\u201d The form then instructed the physician to \u201c[p]lease provide a brief statement supporting your response.\u201d Dr. Agarwal failed to provide any such statement. Because Dr. Agarwal failed to provide any explanation supporting her conclusions, the ALJ accorded Dr. Agarwal\u2019s opinion \u201clittle weight.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">DeJohnette contends that the ALJ\u2019s decision not to credit Dr. Agarwal was not supported by substantial evidence. We disagree. The ALJ was well within its discretion to conclude that Dr. Agarwal\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>cheeking a single box on a single form without any supporting medical evidence did not outweigh the other substantial record evidence supporting a finding of no disability. The ALJ\u2019s choice not to credit Dr. Agarwal was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">B. Credibility Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">DeJohnette next argues that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that DeJohnette\u2019s \u201cstatements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects\u201d of his symptoms were not credible was not supported by substantial evidence. As the district court explained, the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based largely on the fact that DeJohnette \u201cwas not compliant with his medication. There was record evidence demonstrating his condition often improved when he was compliant with his medication.... Moreover, there is record evidence that [DeJohnette] did not complete activities suggested by his treating psychologist at the time which may have improved his condition.\u201d The ALJ thus found that DeJohnette\u2019s noncompliance with prescribed treatment made his testimony as to the severity of his symptoms not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">DeJohnette now argues that the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination was flawed because, to the extent that DeJohnette was not complaint with his treatment, that noncompliance was itself caused by his medical condition. He contends, in short, that the nature of his medical condition \u201cexcuses any noncompliance.\u201d But, as the Commissioner notes in her brief, the ALJ asked DeJohnette point blank, \u201cdo you take the medication as prescribed by your doctors?\u201d and DeJohnette answered, \u201cYes sir.\u201d Thus, DeJohnette\u2019s argument before us now that his noncompliance is excusable\u2014-which implicitly acknowledges that such noncompliance existed\u2014itself contradicts DeJohnette\u2019s own testimony and calls his credibility into question. The ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was amply supported by substantial record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">C. VE\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Finally, DeJohnette argues that the ALJ erred in relying on the VE\u2019s testimony to the effect that DeJohnette could work in his old job at the paper mill. The ALJ asked the VE whether a hypothetical individual with limitations comparable to DeJohnette\u2019s would be able to perform work as a laborer in a paper mill. The VE answered in the affirmative. DeJohnette now argues that, because the ALJ incorrectly discredited Dr. Agarwal\u2019s medical findings, the hypothetical person the ALJ described to the VE\u2014who embodied .De-Johnette\u2019s limitations as the ALJ saw them\u2014was not actually an accurate reflection of DeJohnette. Because we conclude that the ALJ correctly gave little weight to Dr. Agarwal\u2019s medical findings such as they were, this argument is also unavailing. The hypothetical person described to the VE was fairly analogous to DeJoh-nette, and so the ALJ\u2019s decision to credit the VE\u2019s testimony was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">TV</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">We AFFIRM the holding of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-18\"> Pursuant to 5th C\u00ede.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-10\">. In explaining why it did not lend much credence to Dr. Agarwal\u2019s opinion, the ALJ also noted that Dr. Agarwal had herself indicated only one month prior to filling out the form that DeJohnette was \u2018\u2018doing well.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
