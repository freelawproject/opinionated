Salery first argues the district court erred when it determined he was competent to plead guilty. He next argues he did not knowingly or voluntarily waive his right to appeal. And if his appeal waiver is not valid, then he argues the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) for possessing a stolen firearm. After careful review, we conclude Sal-ery\u2019s appeal waiver is not enforceable but affirm his convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-16\">On December 16, 2014, Salery was charged by superseding indictment with five counts. After he was charged, his counsel filed a motion for competency determination. Dr. Robert Shaffer, a clinical psychologist, evaluated Salery in January 2015. Dr. Shaffer concluded Salery \u201cexhibited symptoms consistent with ... Schi-zoaffective Disorder, Major Neurocogni-tive Disorder, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\u201d as well as possibly \u201cBorderline Personality Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.\u201d Dr. Shaffer also conducted neurological testing that showed impairment of Saleras frontal lobes. As a result of Dr. Shaffer\u2019s findings, the district court ordered the Bureau of Prisons to evaluate Salery\u2019s competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>Dr. Tennille Warren-Phillips, a licensed psychologist, evaluated Salery\u2019s competence for the Bureau of Prisons over a two-month period. She administered several tests to Salery, one of which showed his IQ was 58. However, she suspected Salery intentionally misrepresented himself as impaired because of validity indicators in the testing and because Salery\u2019s results did not align with his reported academic performance. Dr. Warren-Phillips diagnosed Salery with severe Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and severe Cannabis Use Disorder. She concluded Salery was competent to stand trial because he \u201cexhibited good verbal skills, memory, and related abilities necessary to consult effectively with counsel.\u201d In her opinion, Salery did not appear to suffer from any mental issue that would make him unable \u201cto understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to properly assist in his defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The district court then held a hearing to determine Salery\u2019s competence. Both Dr. Shaffer and Dr. Warren-Phillips testified and were cross-examined. Based on the two doctors\u2019 reports and the evidence presented at the hearing, the district court found \u201cSalery is competent and has the mental capacity to stand trial.\u201d The court recognized Dr. Shaffer\u2019s conclusions, but credited Dr. Warren-Phillips\u2019s testimony over his because she evaluated Salery for a longer period of time and with more comprehensive testing. However, the district court later issued an order telling the parties to jointly craft a plan for Salery to receive \u201cimmediate and regular\u201d mental-health treatment. The court said although Salery was competent to proceed, it recognized the serious mental-health issues he suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">In October 2015, Salery agreed to plead guilty to two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and one count of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. In exchange, the government dropped two other charges against him and agreed Salery would receive a sentence of no more than 10-years imprisonment. The plea agreement also contained an appeal and collateral attack waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">The district court held a plea colloquy at which Salery pleaded guilty. The district court questioned Salery about whether he understood: the effects of his plea deal including that he had the right to appeal his sentence \u201cunder some circumstances.\u201d Salery said he did. The court then asked if he understood he was waiving his right to appeal any sentence imposed. Salery again said yes, but the court noted his hesitancy. Salery replied he was comprehending everything as best he could and that the court could \u201cgo ahead.\u201d The court found him competent to enter a plea and accepted the plea agreement. Salery was sentenced to 90-months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s determination of competency to stand trial as a factfinding subject to reversal only for clear error.\u201d United States v. Saingerard, 621 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (quotation omitted). The district court\u2019s competency finding \u201cis clearly erroneous only when we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d United States v. Izquierdo, 448 F.3d 1269, 1278 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">We review de novo the validity of a sentence appeal waiver. United States v. Johnson, 541 F.3d 1064, 1066 (11th Cir. 2008). We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings on sentencing matters, including guidelines enhancements. United States v. Bradley, 644 F.3d 1213, 1283 (11th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">Salery first argues the district court clearly erred when it found he was competent to plead guilty. He points to Dr. Shaffer\u2019s evaluation and testimony, as well as the district court\u2019s acknowledgement of his mental-illness history and order that he receive treatment. \u201cThe standard for competency to stand trial is whether the defendant has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u2014and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d Bradley, 644 F.3d at 1268 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Dr. Shaffer and Dr. Warren-Phillips conducted evaluations of Salery but reached different conclusions on his competency to stand trial. The district court held a full competency hearing where both experts testified and were subject to cross examination. Under this Court\u2019s precedent, \u201c[wjhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d Izquierdo, 448 F.3d at 1278 (quotation omitted). And when the district court is \u201c[f]aced with diametrically opposite expert testimony, [it] does not clearly err simply by crediting one opinion over another where other record evidence exists to support the conclusion.\u201d Bradley, 644 F.3d at 1268 (quotation omitted). The district court here was faced with conflicting opinions and evaluations from two experts, and chose to credit Dr. Warren-Phillips over Dr. Shaffer because she evaluated Salery for a longer period of time and with more comprehensive testing. See id. And although the district court acknowledged Salery\u2019s mental-health issues, it specifically found he was still competent to proceed despite them. Thus, the district court did not clearly err in finding Salery competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Next, Salery argues his appeal and collateral attack waiver is invalid because he did not knowingly or voluntarily waive his rights. An appeal waiver is valid if it was knowingly and voluntarily made. United States v. Bushert, 997 F.2d 1343, 1350 (11th Cir. 1993). For it to be knowing and voluntary, the government must show: \u201c(1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant\u201d about the waiver; or \u201c(2) it is manifestly clear from the record that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver.\u201d Id. at 1351, The text of the plea agreement alone is not sufficient to find the defendant made an appeal waiver knowing and voluntarily. Id. at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">Although Salery was competent to stand trial and waive his rights, his appeal and collateral attack waiver is not enforceable on this record. The district court first asked Salery if he understood he could appeal his sentence \u201cunder some circumstances.\u201d In Bushert, this Court held this exact language was not sufficiently clear for a valid waiver. Id at 1352-53. The Bushert panel said such language was \u201cconfusing\u201d because although it was \u201ctrue that even under the terms of the sentence appeal waiver, [the defendant] could appeal his ' sentence under some circumstances,\u201d the court\u2019s statement \u201cdid not clearly convey to [the defendant] that he was giving up his right to appeal under most circumstances.\u201d Id. The court then asked Salery if he understood he was waiving his right to appeal any sentence imposed. Salery said yes, but the record shows the court thought Salery \u201cseem[ed] to be hesitant about this.\u201d Salery replied he was comprehending everything to the best of his ability. This Court has held the district court\u2019s questioning at the plea colloquy must \u201cestablish[ ] that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>understood the nature and extent of the appeal waiver and agreed to it\u201d in order to satisfy the requirements in Bushert. United States v. Buchanan, 131 F.3d 1005, 1008 (11th Cir. 1997) (per curiam). Because the district court did not explain with specificity the nature and extent of the appeal waiver; was contradictory in its questioning about the scope of Salery\u2019s appeal rights; noted Salery\u2019s hesitancy; and because Salery has a recognized history of mental-health issues, we cannot say on this record it is \u201cmanifestly clear\u201d that Salery understood the full significance of his waiver. See Bushert, 997 F.2d at 1353. As a result, Salery\u2019s appeal and collateral attack waiver is not enforceable and it is severed from his plea deal. Id. at 1353-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Because his appeal waiver is not valid, Salery may appeal his sentence. Sal-ery argues the district court erred when it applied a two-level enhancement to his guidelines range under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A) after finding the offense involved a stolen firearm. He says the district court\u2019s factual finding was clearly erroneous because it was based on the testimony of the case agent, which was impermissible hearsay. Salery also argues this hearsay was unreliable because it was based on a stolen firearm report about a 9 mm Glock, but he was found with a .40 caliber Glock.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The district court may consider any information (including hearsay), \"regardless of its admissibility at trial, in determining whether factors exist that would enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence, provided that the evidence has sufficient indicia of reliability, the court makes explicit findings of fact as to credibility, and the defendant has an opportunity to rebut the evidence.\u201d United States v. Ghertler, 605 F.3d 1256, 1269 (11th Cir. 2010) (quotation omitted); see also USSG \u00a7 6A1.3(a). Hearsay evidence at sentencing is sufficiently reliable when it is consistent with or corroborated by other evidence. See United States v. Gordon, 231 F.3d 750, 760-61 (11th Cir. 2000); United States v. Wilson, 183 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">The district court properly applied the two-level enhancement for possessing a stolen firearm. The court did not clearly err by relying on the case agent\u2019s testimony, regardless of whether it was hearsay, because it was sufficiently reliable. See Ghertler, 605 F.3d at 1269. Salery is correct that the incident report about the stolen firearm misreported the stolen weapon as a 9 mm Glock. But at sentencing, the case agent testified that she traced the .40 caliber Glock found in Salery\u2019s possession to its original owner. That owner told her his .40 caliber Glock had been stolen from his wife\u2019s car. He explained his wife filled out the police report and mistakenly detailed the stolen firearm as a 9 mm Glock. The original owner also provided a bill of sale for the .40 caliber Glock he said was stolen. The serial number on the bill of sale matched the firearm found in Salery\u2019s possession. Because of this corroboration, we agree with the district court that although the testimony included hearsay, it was sufficiently reliable to support a factual finding. See id As a result, Salery's convictions and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
