Gonzalez argues that his personal property was mishandled, lost, or destroyed during a prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>transfer as a result of negligence by the Government. He asserts that his goods were not detained and that the district court erroneously concluded that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the claim. Gonzalez also argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claims of abuse of process. He contends that the Government ignored its policies and procedures and obstructed the grievance procedures by delaying and destroying his mail. Finally, Gonzalez asserts that the prison commissary violates federal racketeering and antitrust laws. He contends that the prison commissary is a monopoly and a racket within the meaning of federal criminal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of an action based on exceptions to the FTCA de novo, accepting all of the plaintiffs well-pleaded factual allegations as true. <em>Jeanmarie v. United States, </em>242 F.3d 600, 602 (5th Cir. 2001). The United States is immune from suit unless it has specifically waived immunity. <em>Jeanmarie, </em>242 F.3d at 602. The FTCA\u2019waives the sovereign immunity of the United States for \u201cclaims arising out of torts committed by federal employees.\u201d <em>Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>552 U.S. 214, 217-18, 128 S.Ct. 831, 169 L.Ed.2d 680 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">However, this waiver of immunity does not apply to \u201c[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c). Additionally, claims \u201carising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter\u201d are excluded from the waiver of sovereign immunity. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(b). Gonzalez\u2019s claims regarding the loss of his property and tampering with his mail were properly dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the claims were barred by sovereign immunity. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2680(b), (c); <em>See Ali, 552 </em>U.S. at 218-28, 128 S.Ct. 831; <em>Chapa v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>339 F.3d 388, 390 (5th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Gonzalez failed to administratively exhaust his abuse of process claims. Thus, the district court properly dismissed these claims for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a); <em>Price v. United States, </em>69 F.3d 46, 54 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Additionally, the Government\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity does not extend to racketeering laws. <em>McNeily v. United States, </em>6 F.3d 343, 350 (5th Cir. 1993). Likewise, the Government is \u201cnot controlled by the antitrust laws\u201d and cannot be a defendant in an antitrust action. <em>U.S. Postal Service v. Flamingo Industries Ltd., </em>540 U.S. 736, 744-48, 124 S.Ct. 1321, 158 L.Ed.2d 19 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Gonzalez\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED. All other outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47,5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
