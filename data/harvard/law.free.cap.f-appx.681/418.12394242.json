Wright, </em>642 Fed.Appx. 486 (5th Cir. 2016), and remanded to this Court for our further consideration in the light of <em>Mathis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 2243, 195 L.Ed.2d 604 (2016). <em>Wright v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 192, 196 L.Ed.2d 6 (2016). We now VACATE Wright\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-17\">Under a plea agreement in which he waived his right to appeal, Wright pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2) by possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. When the district court calculated his Guideline offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, it increased his base offense level from twenty to twenty-two because, the court concluded, Wright\u2019s Texas conviction for \u201cdelivery\u201d of a controlled substance was a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. The court then calculated Wright\u2019s Guidelines range as 100-120 months<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of imprisonment and sentenced him to 96 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-20\">Wright appealed to us, notwithstanding his waiver of his right to appeal. He contended that the factual basis for his guilty plea was legally insufficient because it did not establish that he knew that the firearm in question had traveled in interstate commerce. <em>Wright, </em>642 Fed.Appx. 486. Wright conceded that this issue was foreclosed by binding precedent, and, on plain error review, this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>Id,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-21\">Two months later, the Supreme Court issued <em>Mathis v. United States. </em>In <em>Mathis, </em>the Court held that, when determining whether an offense qualifies as an Armed Career Criminal Act predicate, a sentencing court may subdivide a defendant\u2019s pri- or statute of conviction, and thus apply the modified categorical approach, only if that statute contains multiple \u201celements\u201d constituting separate crimes\u2014not simply multiple \u201cmeans\u201d of committing the same offense. <em>Mathis, </em>136 S.Ct. at 2251-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-22\">Wright subsequently filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court, challenging our dismissal of his claims. Wright argued to the Supreme Court that the district court had erred by applying the modified categorical approach in classifying his prior drug offense as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d because the statute under which he was convicted does not set forth alternative elements for committing the statutory offense of conviction and thus is not divisible into separate offenses. Moreover, he \u25a0 asserted, because \u2022this Court has held that an offer to sell a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>controlled substance is not a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d within the meaning of the Guidelines, <em>United States v. Price, </em>516 F.3d 285, 288-89 (5th Cir. 2008), the indivisibility of the statute demonstrated his entitlement to relief. Wright also noted to the Supreme Court that he had waived any appeal from his guilty plea and that he was raising these arguments for the first time before the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">In response, the Government conceded to the Supreme Court that \u201cthe appropriate disposition is to grant certiorari, vacat\u00e9 the judgment of the court of appeals, and remand the case for further consideration in the light of Mathis.\u201d It is important that the Government never raised the matter that Wright had waived appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">While Wright\u2019s certiorari petition was pending before the Supreme Court, we held in <em>United States v. Hinkle, </em>832 F.3d 569, 570 (5th Cir. 2016), that, in the light of <em>Mathis, </em>a defendant\u2019s Texas \u201cconviction for delivery of a controlled substance is not a \u2018controlled substance offense\u2019 within the meaning of the Guidelines.\u201d It was shortly thereafter that the Supreme Court granted Wright\u2019s petition, vacated our judgment, and remanded the case to this Court for further consideration in the light of <em>Mathis. Wright, </em>137 S.Ct. 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Wright now asks this Court to vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing, arguing that: (1) the waiver in his plea agreement is not enforceable as to his Mathis-based argument; (2) his failure to raise the issue until the petition for certio-rari is not an insurmountable barrier to relief; and (3) his sentence is reversible on plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">We first consider whether the appellate-rights waiver in Wright\u2019s plea agreement is enforceable as to his Matte-based claim. Wright contends that his waiver is unenforceable because a defendant can only waive \u201cknown\u201d rights and he could not have intentionally relinquished a claim based on <em>Mathis </em>and <em>Hinkle </em>because those cases were decided after he was sentenced. Moreover, Wright argues, this Court should not find waiver here because the Government did not raise his waiver in its response to his petition for certiorari, did not seek to enforce it, and affirmatively conceded that this Court\u2019s judgment should be vacated and that his case should be remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">The Government counters that Wright\u2019s argument is precluded by the mere existence of the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">.We hold that Wright has not waived his Matte-based argument and, even if he had, the Government has waived the right to assert waiver. \u2018Waiver occurs when a party intentionally abandons a right that is known.\u201d <em>United States v. Troxler, </em>390 Fed.Appx. 363, 367 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing <em>United States v. Arviso-Mata, </em>442 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir. 2006)). Where, as here, a right is established by precedent that does not exist at the time of purported waiver, a party cannot intentionally relinquish that right because it is unknown at that time. <em>Id.; see also, e.g., Smith v. Blackburn, </em>632 F.2d 1194, 1195 (5th Cir. 1980). Additionally, the Government has waived the right to assert waiver by failing to object to Wright\u2019s appeal based on the waiver clause in his plea agreement. <em>E.g., United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 231 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-14\">Wright also argues that his failure to raise the Matte-based issue until his petition for certiorari is not an insurmountable barrier to relief. Although he admits that we have long required \u201cextraordinary cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>cumstances\u201d to consider arguments raised for the first time in a petition for certiora-ri, Wright argues that we need not find extraordinary circumstances to vacate his sentence because his claim is based on precedent not available when he drafted his initial brief. Alternatively, Wright contends, where, as here, an intervening Supreme Court opinion clearly shows a serious error, the extraordinary circumstances test is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The Government counters that Wright has not demonstrated, as he must, extraordinary circumstances to justify this Court\u2019s consideration of an issue that was raised for the first time in his certiorari petition, especially because his <em>Mathis-based </em>argument cannot survive plain error review given that it is precluded by his appellate-rights waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The Government\u2019s argument overlooks that it urged the Supreme Court to remand this case to us for consideration on the merits, stating that it was \u201cappropriate\u201d for us \u201cto further consider[] [the case] in the light of Mathis.\u201d We hold the Government to this concession and therefore consider the merits of Wright\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The question now is whether Wright\u2019s sentence is reversible on plain error review. To establish reversible plain error, Wright must show: \u201c(1) an error (2) that is clear or obvious, (3) that affects substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Nava, </em>762 F.3d 451, 452 (5th Cir. 2014) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Wright contends that the district court committed reversible plain error in classifying his Texas conviction for delivery of a controlled substance as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. The court erred, Wright argues, because the sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2,l(a) requires a \u201ca felony conviction of ... a controlled substance offense\u201d and, under <em>Mathis, </em>a Texas conviction for delivery of a controlled substance does not constitute a conviction for a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d Our holding in <em>Hinkle, </em>Wright asserts, made this error plain. Wright further contends that the court\u2019s error affected his substantial rights because it significantly changed his Guidelines range\u2014increasing his maximum sentence of imprisonment by fifteen months and his minimum sentence by sixteen months\u2014and, he further argues, there is a reasonable probability that this affected his sentence because the court imposed a sentence below the Guidelines range. Finally, Wright claims, this error merits discretionary remand because it has a clear and substantial impact on his sentence; it resulted from an unforeseen change in the law, not dereliction by the defense; and there are mitigating circumstances in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">We hold that Wright has satisfied the requirements for plain error review. The error of law lies in classifying Wright\u2019s conviction as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d because, as we explained in <em>Hinkle, </em>in the wake of <em>Mathis, </em>a conviction under the Texas statute in question \u201cis not a controlled substance offense under the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Hinkle, </em>832 F.3d at 574-77 (citations omitted). Even though the error was not plain at the time the district court sentenced Wright, it is classified as \u201cplain\u201d because <em>Mathis </em>and <em>Hinkle </em>were decided prior to the conclusion of Wright\u2019s direct appeal. <em>See Henderson v. United States, </em>568 U.S. 266, 133 S.Ct. 1121, 1124-25, 185 L.Ed.2d 85 (2013). This error affected Wright\u2019s substantial rights because there is a reasonable probability that it impacted his sentence. <em>See Molina-Martinez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>1338, 1345, 194 L.Ed.2d 444 (2016). Finally, this sentencing error, if allowed to go uncorrected, \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d because, as Wright notes, it resulted from an unforeseen shift in the law, not defense counsel\u2019s error, and, in a substantial way, it \u201cclearly affected [Wrightj\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Price, </em>516 F.3d at 290 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE Wright\u2019s sentence and REMAND for re-sentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
