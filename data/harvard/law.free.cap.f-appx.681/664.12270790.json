McHugh, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b1220-17\">Liberty Bank, F.S.B., appeals a district court order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s approval of a settlement agreement, which exhausted an obligation owed by Liberty\u2019s garnishees to its judgment debtor. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-19\">Following a failed joint venture to develop real estate in Kansas, Aan E. Meyer and John R. Pratt obtained a federal jury verdict against D.J. Christie, Inc., David J. Christie, and Aexander W. Glenn (collectively, \u201cChristie parties\u201d), for almost $9.2 million. We affirmed, in part and reversed in part, leaving intact a judgment in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>of Meyer and Pratt for approximately $7.1 million (\u201cFederal Judgment\u201d). <em>See Meyer v. Christie, </em>634 F.3d 1152, 1161-63 (10th Cir. 20ll). Our mandate entered on April 25, 2011. Four days later, on April 29, 2011, the Christie parties began acquiring outstanding judgments in Iowa against Meyer and Pratt for a combined total of some $7.4 million (\u201cIowa Judgments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">Shortly thereafter, in May 2011, Liberty served garnishment orders against Christie and D.J. Christie, Inc. to recover on two judgments totaling $948,084.11 it had obtained against Meyer in 2010. Christie answered the garnishments on May 31, 2011, asserting that the Christie parties had no liability to Meyer because any amounts owed to Meyer were offset by the amounts Meyer and Pratt owed on the Iowa Judgments acquired by the Christie parties. Christie claimed that Meyer and Pratt were indebted to them on account of the Iowa Judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">D.J. Christie, Inc. initiated the underlying Chapter 11 proceeding, and then filed an adversary complaint, seeking to offset the Federal Judgment with the Iowa Judgments. Meyer and Pratt initially resisted but eventually agreed to settle. As recited in the settlement agreement, the parties were embroiled in at least twenty legal proceedings in multiple jurisdictions. Meyer, Pratt, and the Christie parties agreed to the offset and a $1,825 million payment from D.J. Christie, Inc. to Meyer and Pratt\u2019s attorneys, which would constitute a final settlement of their claims. Liberty\u2019s judgments against Meyer were noted in the settlement agreement. Liberty was not a party to the agreement or the negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">Liberty moved to intervene in the adversary proceeding, claiming the Federal and Iowa Judgments were not subject to offset and the settlement agreement impaired its garnishment rights. The bankruptcy court granted Liberty\u2019s motion to intervene and heard oral argument on the matter but ultimately approved the settlement agreement. Liberty appealed to the district court, which reversed and remanded for further proceedings. On remand the bankruptcy court again approved the settlement agreement, finding that Liberty\u2019s interests were subordinate to the offset and other senior interests. The district court affirmed and denied rehearing. Liberty now appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-10\">\u201cEven though this appeal comes to us from the district court, we review a bankruptcy court\u2019s decisions independently, examining legal determinations de novo and factual findings for clear error,\u201d <em>FB Acquisition Prop. I, LLC v. Gentry (In re Gentry), </em>807 F.3d 1222, 1226 (10th Cir. 2015). \u201cA bankruptcy court\u2019s approval of a compromise may be disturbed only when it achieves an unjust result amounting to a clear abuse of discretion. The bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to approve the settlement, however, must be an informed one based upon an objective evaluation of developed facts.\u201d <em>Reiss v. Hagmann, </em>881 F.2d 890, 891-92 (10th Cir. 1989) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-11\">\n<em>A. Analytical Framework</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-12\">Liberty first challenges the analytical framework used by the bankruptcy court to evaluate the settlement agreement. We perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-13\">\u201cA court\u2019s general charge is to determine whether the settlement is fair and equitable and in the best interests of the estate.\u201d <em>Rich Global, LLC v. Zubrod (In re Rich Global, LLC), </em>652 Fed.Appx. 625, 631 (10th Cir. 2016) (unpublished) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). In evaluating a proposed settlement, \u201cthe bankruptcy court is not required to conduct a mini-trial ... or decide numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>questions of law and fact,\u201d but it \u201cmust canvas the issues to determine whether the proposed settlement falls below the lowest point in the range of reasonableness.\u201d William L. Norton, Jr. and William L. Norton III, 8 <em>Norton Bankr. Law &amp; Prac. </em>\u00a7 167:2 (3d ed. 2011) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9019(a) provides that \u201c[o]n motion by the trustee and after notice and a hearing, the court may approve a compromise or settlement.\u201d Four factors guide the bankruptcy court\u2019s analysis of a proposed settlement agreement: \u201c(1) the chance of success of the litigation on the merits; (2) possible problems in collecting a judgment; (3) the expense and complexity of the litigation; and (4) the interest of the creditors.\u201d <em>In re Rich Global, </em>652 Fed.Appx. at 631; <em>see also Korngold v. Loyd (In re S. Med. Arts Cos.), </em>343 B.R. 250, 256 (B.A.P. 10th Cir. 2006); 8 <em>Norton Bankr. Law &amp; Prac. </em>\u00a7 167:2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">Employing these standards, the bankruptcy court evaluated the settlement agreement and determined it was fair and equitable. The court reasoned that the parties had been litigating the offset issue for almost two years and Christie would have substantial difficulty collecting the Iowa Judgments because Meyer and Pratt were seemingly insolvent. Moreover, the court observed that there could be additional parties claiming an interest in the Federal Judgment, while Pratt was signaling his intent to go to trial. Weighing these difficulties, the court noted that none of the creditors were harmed by the settlement because they negotiated it and supported its approval. The district court\u2019s remand did not alter these findings, which the bankruptcy court relied upon in its final decision. This was a sound analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">Nevertheless, Liberty suggests that any analysis under Rule 9019(a) impairs its rights. Liberty asserts the proper analysis should follow <em>Local No. 93, International Ass\u2019n of Firefighters, AFL-CIO C.L.C. v. City of Cleveland, </em>478 U.S. 501, 106 S.Ct. 3063, 92 L.Ed.2d 405 (1986), and <em>Overton\u2019s, Inc. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. (In re Sportstuff, Inc.), </em>430 B.R. 170 (8th Cir. BAP 2010). Specifically, Liberty cites <em>Local No. 93 </em>for the proposition that \u201cparties who choose to resolve litigation through settlement may not dispose of the claims of a third party.... \u201d 478 U.S. at 529, 106 S.Ct. 3063. And in <em>Sportstujf, </em>the court stated that \u201c[a] \u2018settlement\u2019 between only two parties to a multi-party lawsuit is not a settlement, and the procedure to approve a compromise under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9019(a) cannot be used to impose an injunction on the non-settling parties.\u201d 430 B.R. at 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-8\">We do not dispute these general principles, but neither of these cases requires a different analysis. <em>Local No. 93 </em>was a Title VII suit in which a labor union opposed a consent decree intended to remedy discriminatory employment practices. 478 U.S. at 504, 510, 106 S.Ct. 3063. That case offers no particular guidance for analyzing a bankruptcy settlement agreement under the circumstances here. Of course, we recognize a settlement \u201ccannot dispose of the valid claims of nonconsenting intervenors\u201d and cannot \u201cimpose[ ] obligations on a party that did not consent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 529, 106 S.Ct. 3063, but the settlement here does not do those things. Liberty\u2019s claims against Meyer remain intact, and the agreement imposes no legal duties on Liberty. The settlement agreement simply exhausts the proceeds of the Federal Judgment, preventing Liberty from garnishing them due to its lower priority, as we will explain below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-9\"><em>SportStuff </em>is similarly unavailing. That non-binding case involved settlements that extinguished the claims and contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>rights of third-party vendors against the debtor\u2019s insurers. 430 B.R. at 176-78. The bankruptcy court approved the settlements, but the Eighth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel reversed, ruling the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction or authority either to extinguish the vendors\u2019 contract rights or to enjoin them from pursuing their claims. <em>Id. </em>at 178-79, 181. There are no analogous facts here because the settlement does not prevent Liberty from pursuing whatever rights it has against Meyer. In short, these cases do not demonstrate that the bankruptcy court applied the wrong analysis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">\n<em>B. Nature of Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">Liberty also challenges the nature of the bankruptcy court\u2019s analysis. Asserting the court summarily determined that the settling parties were entitled to offset the Federal and Iowa Judgments, Liberty contends \u201cit was error for the Bankruptcy Court to decide that issue without a full due process evidentiary hearing.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 29. Liberty contends a due process hearing was necessary because the offset effectively extinguishes its garnishment hens both in the adversary proceeding and in the separate state-court garnishment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">This argument misapprehends the extent of analysis required under Rule 9019(a). The bankruptcy court was not charged with conducting a mini-trial on the propriety of the offset; rather, the court was obliged to canvass the issues to determine whether the proposed settlement was reasonable. Consistent with that directive, the bankruptcy court reviewed the proposed offset and the relevant legal authority and determined there were no circumstances that precluded the offset. This analysis of the'offset was adequate to assess the fairness of the settlement agreement. As Liberty acknowledges, the bankruptcy court expressly stated that \u201c [although these matters may involve consideration of the Kansas law of offset, this is not an offset case; this case is about approval of a proposed settlement.\u201d Aplt. App. at 396. Liberty protests that the bankruptcy court should have considered its \u201crights in the Federal Judgment prior to any determination of' whether the Christie Parties can or cannot offset the Iowa Judgments.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 30 (internal quotation marks omitted). But that argument attempts to bypass any analysis of Liberty\u2019s priority interest relative to the offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-10\">Moreover, Liberty\u2019s dispute with the merits of the offset is unpersuasive. Liberty insists an offset is discretionary and there are equitable grounds here for denying it, specifically, the alleged collusion between Christie and D.J. Christie, Inc. in pursuing the settlement agreement. But there is nothing collusive about these debtors seeking to settle their debt. Liberty notes the Iowa Judgments are \u201cessentially worthless\u201d and the offset could be reduced by the actual value of the Iowa Judgments. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Aplt. Br. at 32 (internal quotation marks omitted). But Meyer and Pratt agreed to the offset, and the bankruptcy court recognized there was no basis for prohibiting it. <em>See Mynatt v. Collis, </em>274 Kan. 850, 57 P.3d 513, 534-35 (2002) (setting forth criteria for offset). These circumstances fail to indicate the settlement agreement was unreasonable in light of the offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">As for Liberty\u2019s assertion that it was entitled to a due process hearing, we must clarify its argument. To the extent Liberty claims it was entitled to \u201ca due process trial\u201d because the offset extinguished its garnishment liens, Aplt. Br. at 29, Liberty forfeited that theory by failing to preserve it either in the district court or in the bankruptcy court. <em>See Richison v. Ernest Grp., </em>Inc., 634 F.3d 1123, 1127-28 (10th Cir. 2011). To the extent Liberty asserts the bankruptcy court committed legal error in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the offset under Rule 9019(a), the argument is meritless. Liberty was allowed to intervene, challenge the settlement agreement, and appeal its approval to the district court. On remand, the bankruptcy court held a status conference and took briefing on the scope of the remand. The bankruptcy court concluded that the pertinent issues before the court were the priority of competing interests in the Federal Judgment and the impact on Liberty of the settlement agreement\u2019s offset provision. In evaluating these issues, the bankruptcy court allowed discovery, accepted the parties\u2019 joint factual stipulations, and heard oral argument. Thereafter, Liberty extensively briefed the offset issue in its second appeal to the district court. Liberty availed itself of ample opportunities to contest the offset and continues to do so in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">\n<em>C. Priority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">We turn, then, to Liberty\u2019s priority in the Federal Judgment to help discern whether the settlement is fair and equitable. The bankruptcy court concluded that Liberty\u2019s interest was subordinate to senior interests held by Meyer\u2019s attorneys and assignees, as well as the Christie parties\u2019 interest as holders of the Iowa Judgments. Liberty does not dispute the senior interests of Meyer\u2019s attorneys and assignees, but it does challenge the Christie parties\u2019 priority vis-a-vis the Iowa Judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-8\">We generally look to state law to determine the priority of competing interests, <em>see Redmond v. Jenkins (In re Alternate Fuels, Inc.), </em>789 F.3d 1139, 1147 (10th Cir. 2015), mindful that \u201cthe lien first in time is first in right,\u201d <em>United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., </em>440 U.S. 715, 720, 99 S.Ct. 1448, 59 L.Ed.2d 711 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted). In Kansas, upon service of a garnishment order, a garnish- or of intangible property attaches \u201c[a]ll intangible property, funds, credits, or other indebtedness belonging to or owing the judgment debtor ... due from the garnishee to the judgment debtor at the time of service of the order.\u201d Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 60-732(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">Our mandate confirming the Federal Judgment entered on April 25, 2011. The Christie parties acquired the Iowa Judgments on April 29, May 2, May 4, and May 18. Liberty served its garnishment orders on May 16 and May 19, attaching the Federal Judgment. But on May 31, Christie answered the garnishment orders, averring that the Christie parties were not indebted to Meyer but rather Meyer was indebted to them on account of the Iowa Judgments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on this chronology, the Iowa Judgments are senior to Liberty\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>garnishment liens if, at the time they were acquired, they represented a choate interest in offsetting the Federal Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">On this score, Kansas law preserves a preexisting offset against a subsequent garnishment lien:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-6\">When the garnishee claims that he or she is not indebted to the defendant for the reason that the defendant is indebted to the garnishee, or that the indebtedness due to the defendant is reduced thereby, the garnishee is not discharged unless and until he or she applies the amount of his or her indebtedness to the defendant to the liquidation of his or her claim against the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 60-719. Moreover, a subsequent garnishment lien does not alter the relationship between the garnishee and the defendant, nor does it put the plaintiff in a better position than the defendant if the defendant had brought an identical claim directly against the garnishee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHqr\">Proceedings in garnishment do not change the legal relations and rights existing between the defendant and the garnishee, nor place the plaintiff in a more favorable position for the enforcement of a claim against the garnishee than would be the defendant in an action brought by him for the same cause; nor can any one be held in such proceedings to the payment of a liability which the defendant could not himself enforce because of existing equities and set-offs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\"><em>Curiel v. Quinn, </em>17 Kan.App.2d 125, 832 P.2d 1206, 1209 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under these circumstances, the garnishee bears \u201cthe burden of proving offsets or indebtedness claimed to be due from the judgment debtor to the garnishee, or liens asserted by the garnishee against personal property of the judgment debtor.\u201d Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 60-738(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">This is precisely what occurred here. The Christie parties acquired the Iowa Judgments before Liberty served its garnishment orders. Thus, when Christie answered, he averred that they owed nothing to Meyer, who was indebted to them on account of the Iowa Judgments. Kansas law preserved the Christie parties\u2019 preexisting offset interest in the Federal Judgment. As a result, the bankruptcy court correctly determined their interest prevailed against Liberty\u2019s garnishment liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-10\">Liberty contests this conclusion, asserting the Christie parties had no lien on the Federal Judgment because they never levied on it. <em>See </em>Aplt, Br. at 34. But they never levied the Federal Judgment because they were obligated to pay it; they were the judgment debtors of the Federal Judgment and could not claim a lien on debt they owed. Liberty further contends it should be given priority because there is no absolute right to offset. Again, however, that argument attempts to circumvent the Christie parties\u2019 prior offset interest and the relevant analysis concerning the propriety of the offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-11\">\n<em>D. The Settlement Agreement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-12\">We now turn to the final issue\u2014 whether the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in approving the settlement agreement. Accounting for the duration and complexity of the litigation, the difficulty the settling parties would have collecting their judgments, and the impact of the proposed settlement, particularly in light of Liberty\u2019s priority status, the bankruptcy court determined the agreement was fair and equitable. We cannot say this was a clear abuse of discretion. Liberty insists the offset impaired its rights. But the issue is whether the settlement agreement was fair and equitable and in the best interests of the estate. In answering those questions, the bankruptcy court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>evaluated Liberty\u2019s priority status and concluded that its garnishment liens were subordinate to the Christie parties\u2019 offset interest. The impact on Liberty was that the proceeds of the Federal Judgment were exhausted. This does not render the agreement unfair or inequitable, particularly where it does nothing to impede Liberty\u2019s claims directly against Meyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1220-8\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">. Liberty advances several other arguments asserting the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision is \u201cparticularly perplexing\u201d because its initial decision was reversed by the district court, and the bankruptcy court granted Liberty\u2019s motion to intervene, quoted from <em>Local No. 93 </em>and <em>SportStuff, </em>and agreed that the offset issue was not dispositive. <em>See </em>Aplt. Br. at 20-24. Liberty fails to explain how these arguments indicate the bankruptcy court employed the wrong legal analysis. To the extent Liberty suggests allowing it to intervene is inconsistent with the bankruptcy court\u2019s approval of the settlement agreement, <em>Local No. 93 </em>rejected a similar argument, holding that an intervenor has no \"power to block [a consent] decree merely by withholding its consent,\u201d 478 U.S. at 529, 106 S.Ct. 3063. To the extent Liberty's remaining arguments are relevant to other issues in this appeal, we address them as appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">.
