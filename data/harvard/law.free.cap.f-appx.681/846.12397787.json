On appeal, both Reese and Morris argue that the district court erred in using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(a) to calculate their guideline ranges, and that even if that was the correct Guidelines section to use, that they were not \u201cpublic officials\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 201.1(b)(3). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-19\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo but accept the court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d United States v. Ford, 784 F.3d 1386, 1396 (11th Cir. 2015). In order t\u00f3 be clearly erroneous, the finding of the district court must leave us with \u201ca definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>The Sentencing Guidelines provide that a district court should refer to the \u201cStatutory Index (Appendix A) [of the Guidelines] to determine the ... offense guideline, referenced in the Statutory Index for the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(a). The Statutory Index provides that the appropriate offense guideline for an offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 is either \u00a7 2B1.1 or \u00a7 2C1.1. Where the Statutory Index gives a choice between multiple Guidelines sections, the district court must \u201cdetermine which of the referenced guideline sections is most appropriate for the offense conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.2, cmt. n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Section 2C1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines addresses offenses that involve, among other things, fraud involving the deprivation of the intangible right to honest services of public officials. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2C1.1. The base offense level under \u00a7 2C1.1 is 12, unless the defendant was a public official, in which case it is 14. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(a). An additional 4 levels shall be added where the offense involved an elected public official or any public official in a high-level decision-making position. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(b)(8). The application notes state that \u201cpublic official\u201d \u201cshall be construed broadly,\u201d and that the term includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-5\">(A) \u201cPublic official\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(a)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-6\">(B) A member of a state or local legislature. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-7\">(C) An officer or employee or person acting for or on behalf of a state or local government, or any department, agency, or branch of government thereof, in any official function, under or by authority of such department, agency, or branch of government, or a juror in a state or local trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-8\">(D) Any person who has been selected to be a person described in subdivisions (A), (B), or (C), either before or after such person has qualified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-9\">(E) An individual who, although not otherwise covered by subdivisions (A) through (D): (i) is in a position of public trust with official responsibility for carrying out a government program or policy; (ii) acts under color of law or official right; or (iii) participates so substantially in government operations as to possess de facto authority to make governmental decisions (e.g\u201e which may include a leader of a state or local political party who acts in a manner described in this subdivision).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1 cmt. n.l. The commentary for \u00a7 2C1.1 provides that the section will apply to convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 \u201cif the scheme or artifice to defraud was to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services of a public official.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2C1.1 cmt. The section\u2019s commentary also provides background information regarding \u00a7 2C1.1, explaining that the section applies to offenses prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, and that \u201c[sjuch fraud offenses typically involve an improper use of government influence that harms the operation of government in a manner similar to bribery offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G, \u00a7 2C1.1 cmt. background.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">Section 2B1.1 also addresses offenses, of fraud and deceit, among other things. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1. The \u00a7 2B1.1 commentary indicates that it may apply to convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. U.S.S.G, \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. But it elaborates that \u201ca state employee who improperly influenced the award of a contract and used the mails to commit the offense may be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 for fraud involving the deprivation of the intangible right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>honest services[,]\u201d and that \u201c[s]uch a case would be more aptly sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 201.1.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Here, the district court did not err in applying \u00a7 2C1.1, rather than \u00a7 2B1.1, The indictment charged Reese and Morris with \u201cdevisfing] and intending] to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud and deprive the citizens of Chatham County and the Chatham Area Transit Authority of their right to honest and faithful services through bribery, kickbacks and the concealment of material information,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C \u00a7 1341. The plea agreements provided that Reese and Morris intended to \u201cdefraud and deprive the citizens of Chatham County and the Chatham Area Transit Authority of their right to honest and faithful services.\u201d (emphasis added). And, after hearing argument from both sides regarding whether the Transit Authority was a public entity, the district court overruled the defendants\u2019 objection and adopted the findings in the PSI, which stated that the Transit Authority was \u201ca public transportation entity.\u201d Given the support in the record for this determination, we cannot say that this finding was clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">As we\u2019ve said, the Guidelines\u2019 Statutory Index gave the district court a choice between \u00a7 2C1.1 and \u00a7 2B1.1, In addition, the background to \u00a7 2C1.1 specifically states that it applies to the kind of \u201cfraud offenses [that] typically involve an improper use of government influence that harms the operation of government in a manner similar to bribery offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2C1.1 cmt. background. Further, the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 explains that \u201ca state employee who improperly influenced the award of a contract and used the mails to commit the offense may be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 for fraud involving the deprivation of the intangible right of honest services[,]\u201d but that \u201c[s]uch a case would be more aptly sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 2C1.1.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.16. Having found that the Transit Authority was a public entity, the district court did not err, in applying \u00a7 2C1.1 instead of \u00a7 2B1.1 to the defendants\u2019 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">As for the defendants\u2019 claim that, as employees for the Transit Authority, they were not \u201cpublic officials\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 201.1(a), we disagree. As discussed above, the district court found that the Transit Authority is a government entity. And the definition of \u201cpublic official\u201d found in the Guidelines\u2019 application notes provides that the term \u201cpublic official\u201d \u201cshall be construed broadly,\u201d and includes any \u201cofficer or employee or person acting for or on behalf of a state or local government, or any department, agency, or branch of government thereof, in any official function, under or by authority of such department, agency, or branch of government.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2C1.1 cmt. n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">The indictment in this case explained that the Transit Authority was created by an act of state legislation, to operate a public transit system in Chatham County, and that its yearly revenues included millions of dollars in passenger fares, local taxes, and federal grants. It detailed that Reese was the Executive Director of the Transit Authority, and that Morris was the Director of Maintenance. The indictment and the plea agreements also all provided that Reese and Morris used their \u201cofficial positions to enrich themselves by soliciting and accepting cash and other payments in exchange for rigging the award of [Transit Authority] contracts to selected individuals and companies.\u201d Similarly, the FBI agent who testified at both the defendants\u2019 sentencing hearings said that they had used their positions at the Transit Authority to ensure that a company they selected received a bus cleaning contract with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Transit Authority, in exchange for monthly payments. Thus, the defendants admitted, the record supports, and the court found that the defendants used their \u201cofficial .positions\u201d to enrich themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">In light of this record, and the Guidelines\u2019 instruction to construe the definition of \u201cpublic official\u201d broadly, the district court did not err in determining that both Reese and Morris were \u201cpublic officials\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 201.1(a). See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2C1.1 cmt. n.l. Moreover, on the record as a whole, we cannot say that the district court erred in concluding that \u00a7 2C1.1 was the most appropriate Guidelines section to apply to the defendants\u2019 convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
