Prummel. McCourtney-Bates sued Prummel in his official capacity, based on allegations that a Charlotte County Sheriffs Deputy, Walter F. Bates,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violated the Driver\u2019s Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2721-25, by im-permissibly accessing her information in the Driver and Vehicle Information Database (DAVID) maintained by the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV). Her complaint stated claims under both the DPPA and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. On appeal, McCourtney-Bates argues that the district court erred in concluding that the statute of limitations for her DPPA claims had run, because: (1) DAVID accesses are self-concealing, so the DPPA violations should not accrue for statute of limitations purposes until the accesses are discovered, instead of when the alleged violations occurred; and (2) Prummel had a statutory duty to notify her of the unlawful DAVID access, and his failure to do so equitably tolled the statute of limitations. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">We review a summary judgment ruling de novo, viewing the evidence and all factual inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. Shaw v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., 353 F.3d 1276, 1282 (11th Cir. 2003). \u201cSummary judgment is proper where \u2018there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d Haynes v. McCalla Raymer, LLC, 793 F.3d 1246, 1249 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)). \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of statutes of limitations de novo.\u201d Foudy v. Miami-Dade County, 823 F.3d 590, 592 (11th Cir. 2016) (\u201cFoudy I\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">First, we are unpersuaded by McCourtney-Bates\u2019s claim that DAVID accesses are by their nature self-concealing. The district court relied on this Court\u2019s holding\u2014in a DPPA suit nearly identical to this one\u2014that the statute of limitations for a DPPA violation accrues when the alleged violation occurs. Foudy I, 823 F.3d at 594. In that ease, we said that \u201cDPPA violations are not by their nature self-concealing.\u201d Id. We made this point again recently when we unambiguously stated that \u201calleged DAVID accesses cannot be categorized as self-concealing wrongs.\u201d Foudy v. Indian River Cty. Sheriffs Office, 845 F.3d 1117, 1124-25 (11th Cir. 2017) (\u201cFoudy II\u201d). In that case, we explained that \u201c[a] self-concealing wrong is one in which the clandestine nature of the activity is essential to the act itself, where a deception, misrepresentation, trick or contrivance is a necessary step in carrying out the illegal act, not merely separate from the illegal act and intended only to cover up the act.\u201d Id. (quotations omitted). A DPPA violation consists of \u201cknowingly obtaining], disclosing] or us[ing] personal information, from a motor vehicle record\u201d for a prohibited purpose. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2724. Because \u201cthe illegal act of accessing the database without a legitimate purpose does not by necessity involve a deception, mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>representation, trick, or contrivance,\u201d DPPA violations are not self-concealing, Foudy II, 845 F.3d at 1124-25. Thus, the district court correctly concluded that McCourtney-Bates\u2019s DPPA claims accrued when the alleged violations occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Next, we are unpersuaded by McCourtney-Bates\u2019s claim that she \u201cwas and is entitled to rely on the mandatory notification measures to alert her to unlawful accesses of her DAVID information, and [Sheriff Prummel\u2019s] failure to notify her is tantamount to the concealment of fraud\u201d such that the statute of limitations for her DPPA claims should have been equitably tolled. This Court has explained that \u201c[a]s a general rule, a plaintiff relying on the doctrine of fraudulent concealment must show affirmative actions by the defendant constituting concealment,\u201d Hill v. Texaco, Inc., 825 F.2d 333, 335 (11th Cir. 1987), but has noted in passing that an exception applies \u201cwhere the defendant has a fiduciary responsibility to make disclosure,\u201d id. at n.2. McCourtney-Bates alleges no concealing activity by Prummel in this case; instead, she claims that Prummel had a statutory duty to notify her of the allegedly unauthorized DAVID access, and his failure to do so constituted concealment. She points to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 817.5681(l)(a) as establishing that duty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-5\">[a]ny person who conducts business in this state and maintains computerized data in a system that includes- personal information shall provide notice of any breach of the security of the system, following a determination of the breach, to any resident of this state whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 817.5681(l)(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">We need not examine whether a violation of \u00a7 817.5681 would constitute concealment, or even whether \u00a7 817.5681 applies to Prummel at all, because McCourtney-Bates has failed to allege, much less provide any evidence, that Prummel made \u201ca determination of the breach\u201d prior to her DAVID audit request. Without providing any evidence tending to show that Prummel violated \u00a7 817.5681, she cannot rely on that alleged violation to argue that Prummel actively concealed the DPPA violation. Accordingly, equitable tolling is not warranted, and the district court did not err in concluding that the statute of limitations for McCourtney-Bates\u2019s DPPA claim had run.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-9\">. McCourtney-Bates originally filed suit against both Prummel and Bates, but failed to ever serve Bates. The district court accordingly dismissed the case against Bates for failure to prosecute. McCourtney-Bates does not appeal that dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b784-20\">. This statute was repealed in 2014, but was operative during the relevant period in this dispute,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
