By mid-afternoon of the next day, he had died after hanging himself in his cell. Love\u2019s mother, Gloria Allen, as administra-trix of Love\u2019s estate and as next friend of Love\u2019s minor children (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging various constitutional and state law causes of action against the City of Grovetown (\u201cGrovetown\u201d), Chief A1 Robinson, Sergeant Mike Freeman; Officer Chester Hopkins; and Sergeant Christopher Harden. The district court dismissed the claims against Grovetown, Robinson, and Harden on a motion for judgment on the pleadings. After discovery, Hopkins and Freeman made an offer of judgment pursuant to Rule 68, which Plaintiffs accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">The district court entered judgment according to the Rule 68 offer and granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to award fees over Hopkins and Freeman\u2019s objections. Hopkins and Freeman argued that the offer of judgment unambiguously included costs and fees within the $100,000 offer, particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>larly when considered along with contemporaneous email communications between the.parties. The district court concluded that Hopkins and Freeman\u2019s offer to settle Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cclaims for relief\u2019 was at least ambiguous as to whether costs and attorney\u2019s fees were included. And because ambiguity in an offer of judgment must be construed against the offeror, the district court awarded attorney fees against Hopkins and Freeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Hopkins and Freeman appeal the award of fees. Plaintiffs cross appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Grovetown and Robinson. After careful review, we affirm the district court\u2019s award of fees and dismiss Plaintiffs cross appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of a Rule 68 offer de novo. See Reynolds v. Roberts, 202 F.3d 1303, 1312-13 (11th Cir. 2000) (de novo review applies to construction of settlement offers). Ambiguity in a Rule 68 offer is construed against the drafter. Util. Automation 2000, Inc. v. Choctawhatchee Elec. Co-op., Inc., 298 F.3d 1238, 1244 (11th Cir. 2002). Unlike other settlement offers, a Rule 68 offer is not subject to the back and forth of ordinary negotiation. Instead, the offeree is faced with, a straight up or down decision, and the failure to accept has consequences. If the offeree fails to obtain a result more favorable than the rejected offer, it must pay costs accrued after the offer was made. Fed. R. Civ. P. 68. This feature of \u201cRule 68 requires that the responsibility for clarity and precision in the offer must reside with the offeror.\u201d Util. Automation 2000, 298 F.3d at 1244. Given the potential consequences, \u201cthe plaintiff should not be left in the position of guessing what a court will later hold the offer means.\u201d Id. at 1244 (quoting Webb v. James, 147 F.3d 617, 623 (7th Cir. 1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">On June 17, 2015, Hopkins arid Freeman made a timely offer of judgment pursuant to Rule 68:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADA\">Pursuant to Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendants hereby offers to allow Judgment to be entered against them in this action in the amount of $100,000.00 (One Hundred Thousand Dollars and No/100), including all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">Counsel for the parties met to discuss the offer on June 30, 2015, and after that meeting, counsel for Hopkins and Freeman sent an email expressing that their \u201cintention for the offer was to include .all costs, fees, or any other relief [Plaintiffs] may be entitled to in this action.\u201d Plaintiffs accepted the offer of judgment the next day, and moved for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">After considering argument from both parties, the district court awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the Plaintiffs in addition to the $100,000 judgment finding that the offer was ambiguous as to whether the $100,000 included fees. We agree. \u201cClaims for relief\u2019 does not unambiguously encompass claims for attorney\u2019s fees. We often use claims for relief to mean the causes of action that show a plaintiff is entitled to relief rather than the damages, costs, and fees a plaintiff might claim entitlement to. For example, Rule 54(b) provides that, absent a specific finding by the court, an action with multiple \u201cclaims for relief\u2019 is not final until all such claims are resolved. But subsection (d) of the very same rule provides the procedure for addressing claims for attorney\u2019s fees after a judgment is entered\u2014indicating that a claim for attorney\u2019s fees is not a \u201cclaim for relief\u2019 that delays finality under subsection (b). Given these distinctions, offering to pay $100,000 to satisfy Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cclaims for relief\u2019 does not unambiguously communicate that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>offer includes fees. See Sanchez v. Prudential Pizza, Inc., 709 F.3d 689, 692-93 (7th Cir. 2013) (holding that a Rule 68 offer using the term \u201cclaims for relief\u2019 was at least ambiguous as to whether it included fees); Lima v. Newark Police Dep\u2019t, 658 F.3d 324, 332 (3d Cir. 2011) (holding that the phrase \u201call of Plaintiffs claims for relief\u2019 was ambiguous).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s clarification by email does not change the analysis. Allowing extrinsic evidence to expand on the meaning of a Rule 68 offer would conflict with our rule that \u201cany ambiguity in the terms of the offer must be resolved against its drafter.\u201d Util. Automation 2000, 298 F.3d at 1244 (emphasis added); see also Lima, 658 F.3d at 331 (holding that extrinsic evidence cannot be used to modify the terms of a Rule 68 offer). Otherwise Plaintiffs are \u201cleft in the position of guessing what a court will later hold the offer means.\u201d Util. Automation 2000, 298 F.3d at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The offer of judgment was at least ambiguous as to whether it included fees, and thus the district court properly read the offer to not include them. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Plaintiffs filed a cross appeal challenging the district court\u2019s dismissal of their claims against the City and Robinson. However, we do not reach the merits of this argument because we lack jurisdiction over the cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">In a civil case, the timely filing of a notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement, and this Court cannot entertain an appeal that is out of time. Green v. Drug Enf't Admin., 606 F.3d 1296, 1300-02 (11th Cir. 2010). To be timely, a notice of appeal in a civil action must be filed no later than 30 days after the judgment or order the party seeks to challenge is entered on the docket. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a). However, the running of this 30-day period will be tolled if a party files one of several enumerated motions, including a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59, or a motion for relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60 \u201cif the [Rule 60(b) ] motion is filed no later than 10 days after judgment is entered.\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A). In those circumstances, \u201cthe time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.\u201d Id. If one party files a timely notice of appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the first notice was filed, or within the time otherwise prescribed by Rule 4(a), whichever is later. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">The district court issued final judgment on the merits on July 20, 2015. All earlier interlocutory orders\u2014including the order dismissing Grovetown and Robinson\u2014became immediately appealable, notwithstanding the fact that the attorney\u2019s fees issue remained outstanding. See Ray Haluch Gravel Co. v. Cent. Pension Fund of Int\u2019l Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs &amp; Participating Emp\u2019rs, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 773, 777, 187 L.Ed.2d 669 (2014). Therefore, to appeal the dismissal of Grovetown and Robinson, Plaintiffs should have filed their notice of appeal on or before August 19, 2015. Because they did not do so, we lack jurisdiction to hear their appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-15\">As for Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments to the contrary, we are unpersuaded.-First, they point out that they filecj a motion to reconsider the order dismissing Grovetown and Robinson which the Court never ruled on, and argue that this pending motion preserves their time to appeal. However, four months after that motion was filed, the district court entered an order staying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>ease pending mediation. In that May 2011 order, the court directed the parties to file a motion to reopen if they failed to reach a settlement and to notify the court if there were any pre-stay motions they wished the court to address. The district court\u2019s stay order constructively denied the motion for reconsideration without prejudice, and though the case was reopened, Plaintiffs made no mention of any motion to reconsider, That motion, therefore, does not toll the time to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Plaintiffs also argue that the district court\u2019s order directing the clerk to enter judgment pursuant to Rule 68 was not a final order because the district court deferred approval of the settlement until it resolved the fee issue. But in its order,-the district court expressly granted the motion for settlement and directed the clerk to enter judgment against Hopkins and Freeman. It reserved only the approval of fees, and cited Local Rule 17.1(c) of the Local Rules for the Southern District of Georgia\u2014a provision requiring the district court to approve fee arrangements when entered into by a guardian on behalf of a minor. Reserving ruling on the fee issue does not affect the finality of the judgment on the merits. See Ray Haluch Gravel Co., 134 S.Ct. at 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Finally, Plaintiffs argue that their cross-appeal is timely because it was filed \u201cwithin 14 days of when the first notice [of appeal] was filed\u201d as required by Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(3). But for Plaintiffs cross appeal to be timely, Hopkins and Freeman\u2019s notice of appeal must also have been timely. Hopkins and Freeman\u2019s notice of appeal, however, was timely only as to the appeal of the fee award, not the substantive judgment on the merits. Consequently, Plaintiffs cross appeal was likewise timely only to the extent it challenged the fee award. None of the Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments have merit, and we dismiss Plaintiffs cross appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
