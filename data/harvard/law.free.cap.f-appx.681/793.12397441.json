The defendants, proceeding pro se, jointly appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions for sentence reductions based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court concluded that the defendants were ineligible for sentence reductions because, in light of the sentencing court\u2019s finding that each defendant was responsible for in excess of 50 kilograms of crack cocaine, Amendment 782 did not lower the defendants\u2019 sentencing ranges. The district court also denied the defendants\u2019 joint motion for reconsideration. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-16\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b816-17\">In 1993, a jury convicted the defendants David and Joseph, who are brothers, with conspiring to possess, and possessing, cocaine base with intent to distribute it. At separate sentencing hearings, the district court found that each defendant was responsible for more than 50 kilograms of crack cocaine. Thus, each defendant\u2019s orig-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>mal base offense level was 42 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)\u2019s Drug Quantity Table. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l)(1993) (assigning a base offense level of 42 for offenses involving 15 kilograms or more of cocaine base).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">As to David Hall, the district court: (1) imposed a four-level leadership role increase for an adjusted offense level of 46; (2) reduced the total offense level to 43 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5A1.1; and (3) calculated a criminal history category of I, which resulted in a guidelines range of life imprisonment. The district court imposed two concurrent life sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">As to Joseph Hall, the district court: (1) imposed no adjustments, for an adjusted offense level of 42; and (2) calculated a criminal history category of IV, which resulted in a guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment. The district court imposed concurrent 360-month sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">In 1996, both defendants filed \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motions based on Amendment 505, which capped the base offense level at 38 for offenses involving 1.5 kilograms or more of cocaine base. See U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 505 (1994). At that time, the district court concluded that based on Amendment 505, both defendants were \u201centitled to a base offense level of 38.\u201d As to David Hall, the district court recalculated his guidelines range as 360 months to life, granted the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and imposed a new 360-month sentence. As to Joseph Hall, the district court recalculated his guidelines range as 324 months to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment, but denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as a matter of discretion, which left Joseph\u2019s original 360-month sentence intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">In 2008, the defendants, along with other codefendants, filed a joint \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706. Amendment 706, among other things, increased the amount of cocaine base needed to trigger a base offense level of 38 from \u201c1.5 kilograms or more\u201d to \u201c4.5 kilograms or more.\u201d See U.S.S.G. app. c., amend 706 (2007). The district court denied the 2008 motion as to David and Joseph. The district court concluded that the defendants were ineligible for sentence reductions because Amendment 706 did not lower either defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range. The district court noted that both defendants were held responsible at sentencing for 50 kilograms of cocaine base, far more than the 4.5 kilograms .of cocaine base needed to trigger the highest base offense level of 38 under Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">This Court affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling on appeal, concluding that the defendants were ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief \u201c[bjecause the district court found at sentencing that each of the movants was responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine,\u201d the amount needed to trigger a base offense level of 38 at that time. See United States v. Caldwell, 381 Fed.Appx. 933, 935 (11th Cir. 2010). In so doing, this Court noted that the district court had determined at the original sen-tencings that both David and Joseph were responsible for more than 50 kilograms of crack cocaine. Id. at 934 n.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">II. DEFENDANTS\u2019 CURRENT SECTION 3582(c)(2) MOTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">A district court may reduce a term of imprisonment only if it was based on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>sentencing range that was subsequently-lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); see also United States v. Lawson, 686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir. 2012); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Amendment 782, which is retroactive, reduced by 2 levels the base offense levels for most drug offenses. See U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 782 (2014). Amendment 782 increased the amount of crack cocaine necessary to qualify for the highest base offense level of 38 to 25.2 kilograms or more. Compare U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(a)(6),(c)(1) (2011), with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 (a)(5), (c)(1) (2014); see also U.S.S.G. app. C. amend. 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Here, the district court properly denied the defendants\u2019 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. As discussed above, the original sentencing court found that each defendant was responsible for more than 50 kilograms of cocaine base. Moreover, each defendant\u2019s last-applied base offense level was level 38, the highest base offense level for crack cocaine offenses. After Amendment 782, the more than 50 kilograms of crack cocaine attributed to each defendant still results in a base offense level of 38. See U.S.S.G. app. C, amend 782; Id. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (assigning a base offense level of 38 for cocaine base offenses involving 25.2 kilograms or more). Accordingly, each defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range remains the same. Because Amendment 782 did not have the effect of lowering either defendant\u2019s last-applied guidelines range, the district court lacked authority to reduce their sentences pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">There is no merit to the defendants\u2019 argument that the sentencing court attributed to them only 15 kilograms of crack cocaine. The defendants\u2019 respective pre-sentence investigation reports (\u201cPSI\u201d) stated that each defendant was responsible for \u201cwell over\u201d 15 kilograms of crack cocaine. After each defendant objected to his PSI\u2019s drug quantity, the district court overruled the objection and made an explicit finding that each defendant\u2019s offenses involved more than 50 kilograms of crack cocaine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Moreover, the sentencing court\u2019s drug quantity finding was sufficiently specific to support the district court\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. After Amendment 782, any quantity of crack cocaine in excess of 25.2 kilograms qualifies for a base offense level of 38. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(6), (c)(1) (2015). A finding of \u201cmore than 50 kilograms\u201d is sufficient to show that both defendants still qualify for a base offense level of 38. The district court was not required to make any further drug quantity determinations in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. Cf. United States v. Hamilton, 715 F.3d 328, 340 (11th Cir. 2013) (vacating a denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion when it was not clear from the record what drug quantity finding the court made at the original sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">For all these reasons, the district court properly denied the defendants\u2019 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions for sentence reductions based on Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\">. This Court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and for clear error its factual findings underlying those legal conclusions. United States v. Davis, 587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-8\">. The government argues that under the law- \u25a0 of-the-case doctrine, we are bound by Caldwell's finding in footnote 2 that each defendant was responsible for more than 50 kilograms. It is not clear that footnote 2 was necessary to the holding in Caldwell. See United States v. Anderson, 772 F.3d 662, 668 (11th Cir. 2014). In any event, even without the law-of-the-case doctrine, we conclude for the reasons that follow that the district court properly denied the defendants\u2019 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions based on Amendment 782.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b818-6\">. There is also no merit to the defendants\u2019 argument that the drug quantities in the defendants' PSIs and the sentencing court's drug quantity findings at the original sentencing hearing are inconsistent. The sentencing court's finding of more than 50 kilograms is in fact \u201cwell over 15 kilograms,\u201d as stated in the PSIs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
