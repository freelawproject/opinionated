In other counts plaintiff asked for an accounting, and for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The defendants deny that \u201cplaintiff is entitled to redress . . . for any matter or thing alleged in said second amended complaint;\u201d admit executing the contract of employment, plaintiff\u2019s previous employment, and his performance of certain duties during the period in question. It is alleged that on January 6, 1956, \u201cdefendant Foremost notified plaintiff that his services would be no longer required by reason of plaintiff\u2019s failure to properly perform his services; that plaintiff thereupon requested that he be permitted to remain in the employ of said defendants for a period of two weeks longer, to assist said defendants in completing those of the 120 houses on said Tract 20732,\u201d to which continuation defendants agreed, but that, nevertheless, \u201con January 9, 1956, plaintiff did not return to work, but accepted a position with another company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The answer also states that, \u201cdefendant Foremost advised plaintiff on January 6, 1956, that notwithstanding his failure to properly perform his services for it, said company nevertheless would pay him an incentive bonus of 3%% on the net profit of the 120 houses, ... as soon as said houses were completed and sold and the certified public accountant . . . had completed his audit thereof,\u201d but that at the commencement of this action, not all of the houses had been sold and the accountant was not able to ascertain the net profits realized. In a later paragraph, defendants again \u2018 \u2018 allege that defendant Foremost agreed to pay a bonus of 3%% on net profits,\u201d but that such profits had not yet been ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">After a trial without a jury, lasting 10 days, the trial court gave judgment against the plaintiff and in favor of all defendants. It is from this judgment that plaintiff appeals. Appellant\u2019s contention is that \u201cPlaintiff is entitled to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>bonus on Tract 20732 as a matter of law, and the judgment in favor of all defendants is therefore erroneous.\u201d This argument is predicated upon the statements in the answer, hereinbefore mentioned, to the effect that defendants \u201cagreed to pay a bonus of 3%% on the net profits;\u201d and that since \u201cdefendants conceded and admitted their obligation to plaintiff, ... it was error for the Court to hold to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention is specious in nature, and cannot be sustained. As pointed out in respondents\u2019 brief, the argument is based upon only a partial survey of the allegations contained in the answer, and a partisan view of certain evidence which is in conflict with other evidence supporting the judgment. In respect to the answer, Paragraph X thereof, specifically alleges that notwithstanding the agreement that plaintiff was to continue work for another two weeks in order to assist in completing certain houses, \u201con January 9, 1956, plaintiff did not return to work, but accepted a position with another company.\u201d As respondents state, \u201ca large portion of the ten-day trial was devoted to this phase of the ease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">That this was a vital issue in the case, can hardly be denied, and the record indicates that the trial was conducted on this theory. This matter is particularly important inasmuch as the agreement between the parties specifies that \u201cShould you voluntarily leave the employ of the company, or should you be discharged for just cause, prior to completion and sale of all of the houses in a tract, then you shall not be entitled to any bonus regardless of the number of houses completed and sold at the termination of your employment.\u201d The circumstances surrounding plaintiff\u2019s dismissal and his alleged voluntary abandonment of work after agreeing to stay on for two weeks, were matters of considerable moment in reference to defendants\u2019 liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The record certainly discloses substantial evidence in support of the trial court\u2019s decision to the effect that plaintiff was entitled to receive nothing from the defendants. This state of the record brings into play the long established principle that an appellate tribunal will not then attempt a reappraisal of the evidence but will accept the conclusions of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Nor can it be said that the trial court was in error for failing \u201cto declare the respective rights of the parties in connection with the profits.\u201d As a matter of fact, that is exactly what the court did do, by declaring that plaintiff was entitled to receive nothing. No other or further declaration was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>quired. And, of course, a court may as well deny declaratory relief as well as any other kind of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\">The decision was not, as appellant claims, one which controverts an admission by the defendants and which should have been decided in plaintiff\u2019s favor as a matter of law. It was rather, a decision based upon substantial evidence, as herein-before indicated. Both sides were given ample opportunity to present their respective theories, and the record reveals no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">White, P. J., and Pourt, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b537-17\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
