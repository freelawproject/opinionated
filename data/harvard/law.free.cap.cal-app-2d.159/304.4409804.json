Brenner while riding to work on the foggy morning on February 10, 1955, as a passenger in an automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>owned and operated by Robert Dealy, which automobile collided on Bloomfield Road, near Artesia in the county of Los Angeles, at approximately 6:50 a. m., on said date, with an automobile owned and operated by Harry Curtis Beardsley.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Beardsley had driven from his home on Bloomfield Road into a private driveway or feed alley on his dairy property, which was immediately adjacent to his home. Richard Aeree, one of his employees, joined him in the automobile, and Beardsley backed his automobile \u201cuntil the rear end of the car was approximately to the edge of the property line paralleling Bloomfield.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Beardsley testified that after stopping, \u201cWe looked both north or\u2014both north and south for approaching vehicles,\u201d and when asked how far he could see, he said \u201cI would say approximately seventy-five feet.\u201d Having backed out across the shoulder of Bloomfield Road until at least the left rear wheel was on the asphalt-improved portion, Beardsley stated \u201cI just practically started forward in very\u2014going in very\u2014I don\u2019t suppose over two to five miles per hour and I was hit in the rear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Beardsley\u2019s automobile was first struck by the Dealy automobile in which Brenner was riding, and then almost simultaneously, the Beardsley car was struck by an automobile driven by Richard Phelps, which also was traveling in a southerly direction on Bloomfield Road behind the Dealy automobile. There were skid marks to the point of impact, and the testimony presented was in conflict as to whether the skid marks were laid down by the Dealy automobile or the Phelps automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Contributory negligence was not in issue, and this appeal is based primarily upon alleged errors in the giving of certain instructions and in the refusal to give certain other instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Specific exception was taken at the trial, and is taken on appeal to the instruction given at defendant\u2019s request on the issue of unavoidable accident, which instruction is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">\u201cIn law we recognize what is termed an unavoidable or inevitable accident. These terms do not mean literally that it was not possible for such an accident to be avoided. They simply denote an accident that occurred without having been proximately caused by negligence. Even if such an accident could have been avoided by the exercise of exceptional foresight, skill or caution, still, no one may be held liable for injuries resulting from it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>\u201cBear in mind, however, that if the defendant failed to exercise ordinary care, and if that failure was a proximate cause of the accident in question, then, whether or not such conduct was the sole cause, the accident was not unavoidable, and the defense of unavoidability may not be maintained by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">It is further contended that plaintiff\u2019s requested instruction, which was refused as otherwise covered, should have been given, said requested instruction being as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">\u201cYou are instructed that an unavoidable accident is one that human skill and foresight could not in the exercise of ordinary prudence have provided against, and if you find from the evidence in this case that the collision and consequent injury to the plaintiff could have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary care on the part of defendant Beardsley, then I instruct you that this was not an unavoidable accident. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In the recent case of <em>Butigan </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co., </em>49 Cal.2d 652 [320 P.2d 500], the Supreme Court considered the propriety of giving California Jury Instructions, Civil (4th rev. ed., 1956) Number 134, the same instruction given by the trial court in the instant case. The-court stated (at p. 660), \u201cThe instruction is not only unnecessary, but it is also confusing. When the jurors are told that \u2018in law we recognize what is termed an unavoidable or inevitable accident\u2019 they may get the impression that unavoidability is an issue to be decided and that, if proved, it constitutes a separate ground of nonliability of the defendant. Thus they may be misled as to the proper manner of determining liability, that is, solely on the basis of negligence and proximate causation. The rules concerning negligence and proximate causation which must be explained to the jury are in themselves complicated and difficult to understand. The further complication resulting from the unnecessary concept of unavoidability or inevitability and its problematic relation to negligence and proximate cause can lead only to misunderstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">To the above, the following comment is added (on p. 661), \u201cIn addition, the giving of the instruction obviously overemphasized defendants\u2019 case, and, as we have said, the instruction suggested to the jury that they should consider unavoidability as an issue or ground of defense separate and apart from the questions of negligence and proximate causation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Under the circumstances of this case the instruction on unavoidable accident was clearly prejudicial. Contribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>tory negligence is not in issue; and there is nothing in the evidence tending to indicate that the collision could have resulted from any cause other than the negligence of the driver of the Beardsley car or the driver of the Dealy car in which Brenner was riding.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">It is unnecessary under the circumstances of this case to determine the other contentions of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">White, P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 4, 1958.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
