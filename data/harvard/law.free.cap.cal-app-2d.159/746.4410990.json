J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avm\">The plaintiff, Margaret Fowler, appeals from a judgment entered on a jury verdict in favor of the defendants in an action for personal injuries. She urges the following errors on appeal: (1) the verdict is not supported by the evidence; (2) the trial court abused its discretion in sustaining the defendant\u2019s objection to the introduction of certain evidence; (3) the trial court erroneously instructed the jury; (4) defense counsel\u2019s reference to an insurance company constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">On the morning of April 26, 1955, at about 10 :55 a. m., the plaintiff, a 37-year-old <em>woman, </em>was a pedestrian waiting for a bus near the intersection of 24th and Harrison Streets in Oakland. The garage of the defendants, Dempsey and Saunders, is located at that intersection. The plaintiff was standing on the south sidewalk of 24th Street, leaning against the bus stop sign, which was located in front of the defendant\u2019s garage, about 100 feet from the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">On the morning of April 26, the defendant, Max Wriggles-worth, an employee of Dempsey and Saunders, had begun to install seat covers in a 1950 Chrysler automobile owned by the defendant, George H. Callis, an employee of the Stafford Ink Company. Callis died before the trial and the case against him and that against the ink company were dismissed. Wrigglesworth drove the Callis vehicle around the block from the service garage on Harrison Street, to 24th Street, and parked it facing west, partially on the sidewalk and partially on the street, with the front of the ear beyond the garage doors, and about 25 feet from the bus stop sign. He engaged the emergency brake, left the keys in the ignition, and left the vehicle in gear, but did not inform Callis, who was around, of these facts. While Wrigglesworth was working on the front seat covers, Callis arranged samples in the car and brushed the cushions.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">After finishing the front seat, Wrigglesworth went inside the garage to work on the rear cushions. Callis then got into his automobile apparently to turn on the heater. According to several eyewitnesses, the automobile veered backward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>in a straight line at considerable speed and struck the metal bus stop sign. The plaintiff was knocked down by the metal pole of the sign which fell on her, and pinned her under the car. The car left skid marks as follows: right rear wheel 20 feet; left rear wheel 12 feet, leading eastward. After the accident, the automobile, which had a standard shift, was in reverse gear. Plaintiff sustained serious and critical injuries, including a skull fracture and other permanent brain injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">As the uncontroverted evidence shows that the vehicle was parked in violation of Vehicle Code, section 586, and plaintiff was clearly within the protection of that statute, the only question about the sufficiency of the evidence is whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was the proximate cause of the injury. <em>(Satterlee </em>v. <em>Orange Glenn School Dist., </em>29 Cal.2d 581 [177 P.2d 279].) Plaintiff maintains that defendant\u2019s conduct was a concurrent proximate cause of the accident.  \u201c \u2018The sequence of facts, one to another and the relation of negligent precipitous acts . . . and the determination of whether the causation was independent or concurrent are questions of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Burke </em>v. W. <em>R. Chamberlin &amp; Co., </em>51 Cal.App.2d 419 at 423 [125 P.2d 120].)  Defendant\u2019s negligent act need not be the sole cause of the injury; it is enough if it is a legal cause. <em>(Merrill </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>158 Cal. 499 [111 P. 534, 139 Am.St.Rep. 134, 31 L.R.A.N.S. 559].)  On the issue of proximate cause, our Supreme Court said in <em>McEvoy </em>v. <em>American Pool Corp., </em>32 Cal.2d 295 at 298 and 299 [195 P.2d 783]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-10\">\u201cThe following rules from the Restatement of Torts with respect to proximate causation have been approved in California <em>(Mosley </em>v. <em>Arden Farms Co., </em>26 Cal.2d 213, 219 [157 P.2d 372, 158 A.L.R. 872] ; <em>Stasulat </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>8 Cal.2d 631, 637 [67 P.2d 678]), and are applicable in the present situation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-11\">\u201cSection 447\u2014\u2018The fact that an intervening act of a third person is negligent in itself or is done in a negligent manner does not make it a superseding cause of harm to another which the actor\u2019s negligent conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about, if (a) the actor at the time of his negligent conduct should have realized that a third person might so act.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-12\">\u201cSection 449\u2014-\u2018If the realizable likelihood that a third person may act in a particular manner is the hazard or one of the hazards which makes the actor negligent, such an act whether innocent, negligent, intentionally tortious or criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>does not prevent the actor from being liable for harm- caused thereby. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">\u201cSection 453, comment (a): \u2018If the facts are undisputed, it is usually the duty of the court to apply to them any rule which determines the existence or extent of the negligent actor\u2019s liability. If, however, the negligent character of the third person\u2019s intervening act or the reasonable foreseeability of its being done is a factor in determining whether the intervening act relieves the actor from liability for his antecedent negligence, and under the undisputed facts there is room for reasonable difference of opinion as to whether such act was negligent or foreseeable, the question should be left to the jury. \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">In the light of the foregoing we cannot agree with the plaintiff that the defendant is liable as a matter of law. The question of proximate cause was one of fact properly left to the jury. <em>(Mosley </em>v. <em>Arden Farms, </em>26 Cal.2d 213 [157 P.2d 372, 158 A.L.R. 872]; <em>Fennessey </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>20 Cal.2d 141 [124 P.2d 51].) While the facts here present close questions on the matter of concurring cause and - proximate cause, the jury was thoroughly and properly instructed. We cannot agree that the finding of the jury was without evidentiary support or that there were any errors in the court\u2019s instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Plaintiff next argues that it was prejudicial error not to allow in evidence the coat worn by her at the time of the accident and not to permit the jury to inspect the scene of the accident. These matters were within the sound discretion of the trial court and we can find no abuse of such discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s final contention is that the following statement by defense counsel constitutes prejudicial error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-9\">\u201cNow Mr. Marlowe did these two things on this one point, and it is a misstatement and it is a misrepresentation, and I am going to show you why. He said, \u2018 The only reason I filed this action against Callis and the estate or joined him in this other action\u2019\u2014it doesn\u2019t make any difference\u2014was to get this statement in that the Judge twice ruled was inadmissible. The statement of Callis that Callis gave to the officer at the scene. And he referred to it and then he said, \u2018I doubt if that action against the estate of Callis will ever go to trial or will be tried. \u2019 Mr. Marlowe stood here and told you that when he knew that Mr. Callis was covered by insurance at the time of the accident, and that insurance inures to the benefit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>estate of Callis, and he told you the only reason he filed this action-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">\u201cMr. Marlowe: Just a moment. If I would say something like that would be a mistrial. You know you can afford to say something like that, and-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-7\">\u201cMr. Van Sicklen : Just a minute. You object to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-8\">\u201cMr. Marlowe : I sat here and listened to you do one thing after another that was wrong. There are some things I can\u2019t answer, and you know it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\">\u201cMr. Van Sicklen: Isn\u2019t that the truth, Mr. Marlowe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-10\">\u201cThe Court: Gentlemen-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-11\">\u201cMr. Van Sicklen: Isn\u2019t that the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-12\">\u201cMr. Marlowe: I-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-13\">\u201cThe Court: Wait a minute now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-14\">\u201cMr. Marlowe: I know we can't get beans out of that estate, if you want to know the truth about it, go check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-15\">\u201cThe Court: Don\u2019t-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-16\">\u201cMr. Van Sicklen : You know the name of the company and you know the coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-17\">\u201cMr. Marlowe : I know of no such company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-18\">\u201cMr. Van Sicklen: Pacific Employers, and I told you several times over the telephone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-19\">\u201cMr. Marlowe: There are more things than insurance companies. When I get through arguing this case you will be convinced to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-20\">\u201cThe Court: Gentlemen, let\u2019s proceed with the argument and not have this controversy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-21\">Aside from the above quoted colloquy plaintiff made no objection or request for an instruction that it be disregarded. She therefore waived the error if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-22\">The case relied upon by the plaintiff on this point, <em>Robinson v. Wada, </em>10 Cal.App.2d 5 [51 P.2d 171], involved the improper questioning of a juror on <em>voir dire </em>and indicating to the jury at that time the defendant was insured. While plaintiff\u2019s point that the rule can apply equally to improper references by defense counsel is well taken, we do not think the reference improperly influenced the jury here. The reference was not to the fact that the defendant in this action was indemnified for liability, but rather that the defendant in another action filed by the same plaintiff was insured. Plaintiff herself called the attention to the jury to the existence of the action against Callis. We do not think that the remarks of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>defense counsel were of that wilful or persistent nature which is necessary to constitute reversible error. <em>(Willoughby </em>v. <em>Zylstra, 5 </em>Cal.App.2d 297 [42 P.2d 685].) We must also give weight to the fact that plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied, indicating that the trial court did not think the jury was prejudicially influenced. <em>(Tellefsen </em>v. <em>Key System Transit Lines, </em>158 Cal.App.2d 243, 247 [322 P.2d 469].)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">In view of the foregoing it is clear that the verdict and judgment is supported by the record before us and that no prejudicial error appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Dooling, J., and Draper, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 29, 1958.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
