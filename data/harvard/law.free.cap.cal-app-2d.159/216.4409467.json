Clancy, a child of Merrill Coburn Clancy, who survived him but died prior to distribution of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">The decedent Merrill Coburn Clancy died in 1949, and his holographic will dated January 9, 1947, contained the following provisions :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-11\">\u201cThird: I give and bequeath to <em>my grand children </em>Mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>jorie, Sister, Bob, <em>Don </em>and my wife\u2019s grandchildren Jean and Peggy, each the sum of One Thousand ($1,000.00) in cash or securities to be selected by my Executors.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\"><em>\u201cEighth: G </em>Upon the death of my said wife, said Trustees shall pay deliver and convey all of the remainder of said trust estate in equal parts to my children Leslie, Marion, Prank and Louise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\"><em>\u201cD </em>In case of the death of any of my said children before the time of final distribution of my said trust estate leaving lawful issue surviving, such issue shall take the share of my said trust estate, which the parent would have taken, if the parent had survived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\"><em>\u201cE </em>In case of the death of any of my said children before the time of final distribution of my said trust estate leaving no lawful issue surviving, the share which one of my children so dying would have received, if he or she had survived shall go to enhance and increase the shares of the survivors of my said children and the lawful issue if any of my said children who may have died leaving lawful issue surviving, in equal shares per stirpes and not per capita.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">This will was admitted to probate and the decree of distribution establishing the trust which was to continue for the period of the natural life of Estelle W. Clancy, decedent\u2019s widow, was signed by Judge Stanley Mosk on April 22, 1952. The decree of distribution contained the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-10\"><em>\u201cD. </em>Upon the death of the said Estelle W. Clancy, the entire remainder of said trust estate shall be divided in four equal shares, one share each for Leslie M. Clancy, Marion C. Atherton, Prank Clancy and Louise Clancy, and said shares are to be conveyed and distributed to said persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-11\"><em>\u201cE. </em>In the event that any of said persons shall be deceased at the time of said final distribution of said trust estate, leaving lawful issue surviving them, such issue shall take the share of said trust estate which the parent would have taken had the said parent survived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-12\"><em>\u201cF. </em>In the event of the death of any of the four named persons: Leslie M. Clancy, Marion C. Atherton, Prank Clancy and Louise Clancy, before the time of final distribution of said estate, and their leaving no lawful issue surviving them, then the share which said deceased person would have received if he or she had survived, shall go to enhance and increase the shares of the survivors of said persons, and the lawful issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>of any of said persons, who may have died leaving lawful issue surviving, in equal shares per stirpes and not per capita.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Leslie M. Clancy died June 29, 1954, and Estelle W. Clancy died August 25, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The \u201cThird and Final Account . . . Petition for Distribution of Trust Estate . . .,\u201d signed by Frank B. Clancy and The Security-First National Bank of Los Angeles, as Trustees, was filed January 20, 1956, and contained the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">1 \u2018 That Leslie M. Clancy predeceased the life tenant, Estelle W. Clancy, and that in accordance with the last Will and Testament of the decedent and the decree establishing the trust therein the share which he would have taken shall go to his lawful issue surviving him and otherwise it shall go to increase proportionately the shares of the said Frank B. Clancy, Louise Clancy and Marian C. Atherton; that petitioners are informed and believe and therefore allege that Leslie M. Clancy left no blood issue surviving him but that one Donald Clancy represents and claims to be the adopted son of the said Leslie M. Clancy and entitled to take and receive the distributive share of the said Leslie M. Clancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">\u201cThat by reason of the claim of the said Donald Clancy to the share of the said Leslie M. Clancy a controversy has arisen between him and the other remaindermen and that petitioners are unable to determine to whom distribution of the share of Leslie M. Clancy should be made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Donald Clancy, (hereinafter called respondent) filed an answer thereto, and also filed a petition on February 15, 1956, alleging as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-11\">\u201cVI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-12\">\u201cTour petitioner, Donald Clancy is the person designated by the said Will, Exhibit <em>\u2018A\u2019 </em>hereof, and the Decree of Distribution, Exhibit \u2018 B \u2019 hereof, to receive the share of the trust estate which would have gone to Leslie M. Clancy, son of said decedent, had he survived Estelle W. Clancy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">Respondent prayed for distribution to him of one-fourth of the trust properties, together with one-fourth of the undistributed income, after payment of proper expenses and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">Appellants filed an answer to the affirmative statements in respondent\u2019s answer, and also filed an answer on April 25, 1956, to respondent\u2019s petition, which contained the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u201cI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201cIn answer to paragraph VI of said petition, these answering parties, deny that Donald Clancy is the person designated by the said Will or Decree of Distribution to receive the share of the trust estate which would have gone to Leslie M. Clancy, son of said decedent, had he survived Estelle W. Clancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">\u201cII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">\u201cYour petitioners further allege that upon the death of Leslie M. Clancy, he did not leave surviving him any \u2018lawful issue, \u2019 that there is therefore no \u2018 lawful issue \u2019 surviving Leslie M. Clancy to take the share which he would have taken under the Will of the late Merrill Coburn Clancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">\u201cIll</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">\u201cYour petitioners, Frank Clancy, Louise Clancy and Marion Atherton, named in the Will and Decree of Distribution of the estate of Merrill Coburn Clancy do in effect dispute and contest the right of Donald Clancy to take any portion of said trust estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">The matter was heard, and the following findings of fact were made by the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-11\">\u2018 \u2018 9. That said deceased Leslie M. Clancy left surviving him no natural children or other issue of his body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-12\">\u201c10. That Leslie M. Clancy left surviving him Donald Clancy whom Leslie M. Clancy believed to be his duly and lawfully adopted child. That Donald Clancy was reared by Leslie M. Clancy as his child and at all times said Leslie M. Clancy and Donald Clancy bore toward each other the relationship of father and son respectively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-13\">\u201c11. That said Merrill Coburn Clancy, deceased, in his lifetime and at the time of making his will, believed that Donald Clancy was the duly and lawfully adopted child of his son, Leslie M. Clancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-14\">\u2018 \u2018 12: That said Merrill Coburn Clancy, at all times, showed the same love and affection toward said Donald Clancy as if he were the natural child of his son, Leslie M. Clancy, and said Merrill Coburn Clancy in his will designated said Donald Clancy as his grandchild.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-15\">\u201c13. That Estelle W. Clancy died on or about the 25th day of August, 1955.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-16\">\u201c14. That Donald Clancy is the person intended by said Merrill Coburn Clancy, and is the person who by the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>of the said will of said Merrill Coburn Clancy, deceased, was intended by said Merrill Coburn Clancy, to take the share of the trust estate of said Merrill Coburn Clancy that would have gone to Leslie M. Clancy, son of said Merrill Coburn Clancy, had said Leslie M. Clancy survived distribution of said trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">\u201c15. That said Donald Clancy is the person designated by the will of said Merrill Coburn Clancy, deceased, and the Order of Distribution in the estate of said deceased, as the lawful issue of Leslie M. Clancy, deceased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">\u201c16. That at the date of death of said Estelle W. Clancy, the beneficiaries of the trust estate of Merrill Coburn Clancy, deceased, and their respective interests in said trust estate at said time were as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">\u201ca. Frank B. Clancy one-fourth (%) interest</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">\u201cb. Louise Clancy one-fourth (]4) interest</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">\u201ce. Marion C. Atherton one-fourth (]4) interest</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-11\">\u201cd. Donald Clancy one-fourth <em>(%) </em>interest\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">and on January 4, 1957, an order was made for distribution of the trust estate, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-13\">\u201cIt Is Further Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that the life tenant having died on August 25, 1955, the said trust terminated and the net estate upon such termination vested as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-14\">\u2018 \u2018 One-fourth thereof to Frank B. Clancy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-15\">\u2018 \u2018 One-fourth thereof to Louise Clancy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-16\">\u201cOne-fourth thereof to Marion C. Atherton; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMK\">1 \u2018 One-fourth thereof to Donald Clancy. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-17\">In this appeal it is contended that the decree of distribution and the will are clear and unambiguous; that it was error to permit extrinsic evidence to be introduced to disclose the intention of decedent; that the evidence was insufficient to support the findings of fact; and that respondent, in order to qualify under the will as the \u201clawful issue\u201d of Leslie M. Clancy had the burden of proving every element of a formal adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-18\">Appellants argue that \u201cTo reach the conclusion of the trial court that Merrill Coburn Clancy \u2018intended\u2019 and \u2018designated\u2019 Donald Clancy to take the share of the trust that would have gone to Leslie, it is necessary to impeach the decree of distribution which provides in plain language that a deceased \u2018parent\u2019s\u2019 share shall go to his or her \u2018lawful issue,\u2019 which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>under many decided cases would not have included an adopted child, if an adoption had been established.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">This argument assumes, as appellants contend, that the words \u2018 \u2018 lawful issue \u2019 \u2019 are clear and unambiguous, and include only actual physical offspring. Appellants have also set forth in their reply brief that \u201clawful issue\u201d was recently construed by an Illinois court in an inter vivos trust created in 1928 by the decedent Merrill Coburn Clancy as not to include respondent. Suffice it to say that a holographic will executed in California in 1947 by a domiciliary of California is to be construed according to the intention of the testator. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 101.) Inasmuch as the determination of the Illinois court had not been made at the time the will in question was executed, it cannot be considered for the purpose of ascertaining his intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The decree of distribution repeats the terminology used by decedent in his holographic will. Under such circumstances, it has been held to be the duty of the court, in construing the decree, to look to the will. (See <em>Estate of Lockhart, </em>21 Cal.App.2d 574, 579 [69 P.2d 1001], and cases cited thereat.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">It is fundamental in interpreting wills in California that when an uncertainty arises upon the face of a will, the testator\u2019s intention is to be ascertained from the words of the will, taking into view the circumstances under which it was made. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 105.)  That the use of the words \u201clawful issue\u201d may create such an uncertainty was established in <em>Estate of Pierce, </em>32 Cal.2d 265 [196 P.2d 1]. It was stated therein (at p. 273) : \u201cAs a layman using the words \u2018lawful issue\u2019 in a holographic will he may have intended to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate children, adopted from natural children, legitimate children of the blood of the testator from adopted or illegitimate children, or he may have intended to include children of his legatees that they regard as their lawful issue. In view of the uncertainty appearing on the face of the will, it was proper for the trial court to admit evidence of the circumstances preceding the execution of the instrument to determine what the testator meant by \u2018children <em>(lawful </em>issue) \u2019 in the first provision quoted above, and by \u2018grandchildren being the <em>lawful issue\u2019 </em>in the second provision quoted above.\u201d In the same ease, with reference to the inclusion of an adopted child within the meaning of \u201clawful issue,\u201d it was stated (at p. 271), \u201cMoreover, the meaning of the term has frequently been determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>by the circumstances surrounding the execution of the will, such as the testator\u2019s knowledge of the adoption and his approval or disapproval thereof (citing cases and authorities), or the testator\u2019s knowledge of the inability of persons, whose cissue\u2019 are provided for in the will to bear children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In considering whether adoption statutes may be considered in ascertaining whether \u201clawful issue\u201d includes adopted children, and in deciding recently in <em>Estate of Heard, </em>49 Cal.2d 514 [319 P.2d 637], that \u201cissue\u201d or \u201clawful issue\u201d may include adopted children, the court stressed the public policy to treat adopted children the same as blood children in the absence of some indication by the testator that an adopted child was to be excluded. In this case, the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Carter, discussed the genetic theory and the theory that \u201cnatural inclinations and affection\u201d derive from family experience and contact, and stated (at p. 521), \u201cOn the family experience and contact theory, the relatives of the adoptive parents, lineal and collateral, become the relatives of the adopted child. Normally, they are the only grandparents, uncles, aunts, brothers, sisters and cousins he knows. His genetic grandparents, uncles, aunts, brothers, sisters and other relatives in a sizable percentage of cases of illegitimate birth will not even have been aware of his existence; and in many other instances will have known him only very briefly prior to his surrender for adoption as a very young infant.\u201d In view of the uncertainty as to compliance by Leslie M. Clancy and Beatrice Clancy with the formalities required to effect a legal adoption of Donald Clancy, the problem of whether respondent could qualify for inclusion within the term \u201clawful issue\u201d is simplified by the recent decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Estate of Stanford, </em>49 Cal.2d 120 [315 P.2d 681].  In this ease, speaking through Mr. Justice Carter, the Supreme Court stated (at p. 135), \u201cIt has been the policy of this state, at least since the adoption of the Civil Code, to accord to adopted children the same status as natural children.\u201d  The effect of compliance or noncompliance with the statutory formalities pertaining to adoption was also considered, the court stating (at p. 142), \u201cWhile there may have been some irregularities in the proceeding they are not of sufficient importance upon which to base a collateral attack. . . . The adoption has stood for many years, since 1924, without attack by anyone. (See <em>Estate of Smith, </em>86 Cal.App.2d 456 [195 P.2d 842].)  <em>Stanford University has not established that the adoption </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>was void and it must be presumed to have been valid. (Estate of Smith, supra, </em>86 Cal.App.2d 456.) The effect of adoption under the New York law and construction of the will is not important. We are not here concerned with a question of inheritance but with the construction of a will, and, whether \u2018child or children\u2019 includes adopted persons. The construction of the will is governed by California law (see Prob. Code, \u00a7 100; Rest., Conflicts, \u00a7 308).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The evidence presented in this case indicates that at all times decedent knew that respondent was not the natural child of his son Leslie M. Clancy; that decedent was vitally interested and concerned about the custody of the child and was willing to make provision for him in 1929 when his son Leslie M. Clancy and his then wife were involved in divorce proceedings; that decedent referred to respondent as his grandson and treated him the same as the natural children of his other children; and that at all times up to decedent\u2019s death an affectionate and close relationship existed between decedent and respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The trial court heard the testimony and made express findings as to what decedent intended. There is substantial evidence to support the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">White, P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 30, 1958, and appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 4, 1958.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
