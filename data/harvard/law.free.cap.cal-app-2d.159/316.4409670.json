This assignment was made by the promisor of the note and consented to by respondent as holder of said note. Appellant, who is the assignee under the general assignment, demurred to the complaint and moved for change of venue to Los Angeles County, that being the county of appellant\u2019s residence. The motion for change of venue was heard and denied on July 5, 1957, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>and on July 16, 1957, appellant\u2019s counsel sent the following letter to the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">\u201cDear Judge Curtis:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">\u201cIn connection with the hearing on defendant\u2019s demurrer set for July 19, 1957, we wish to advise you that this office is willing to submit the matter on the demurrer and points and authorities in support thereof, without oral argument on the part of the demurring parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201cVery truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afi\">\u201cHerbert Golden.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">On July 19, 1957, the demurrer was submitted and overruled, appellant being granted 15 days within which to answer. Appellant did not file an answer, but instead, on August 9, 1957, 21 days after the ruling on the demurrer and 35 days after the order was entered denying change of venue, filed this appeal from the latter order.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Although the question of defendant\u2019s right to have the action tried in the county of his residence is raised in this appeal, it is apparent that the controlling question here is whether the error, if any, in denying change of venue was waived by later submission of the demurrer on behalf of appellant. In view of the conclusion we have reached that the error, if any, was waived, a discussion of the right to a change of place of trial is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">Counsel have not cited, nor have we been able to find, any case which decides the exact point here under consideration.  However, analogy and reasoning lead us to the conclusion that where, as here, an order appealable under section 963 of the Code of Civil Procedure is entered, later submission to rulings of the court constitutes a waiver of objection to the appealable order. Had the case been tried on its merits within the time allowed for appeal from the order, appellant would have been precluded from such appeal and further would have been foreclosed from raising the point on an appeal from the judgment. <em>(Chard </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>48 Cal.App.2d 475 [120 P.2d 125].)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">Upon denial of the motion for change of venue on July 5, 1957, appellant had the right to file his notice of appeal which would have stayed all further proceedings in the trial court. Had he desired more time to consider the advisability of an appeal, he could have asked that the demurrer be taken off calendar, and if such request had been refused, appellant could have declined to participate in the hearing on the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>murrer. Instead of following any of these courses, appellant chose to participate in the hearing by waiving oral argument and submitting the matter on the points and authorities then on file. By so doing appellant acquiesced in any error attending the denial of the motion for change of venue and thereby lost the right of objecting to it. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3516; <em>Allin </em>v. <em>International etc. Stage Employes, </em>113 Cal.App.2d 135 [247 P.2d 857].)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Had appellant\u2019s demurrer been sustained, respondent would have been bound by the court\u2019s ruling, and it would not be equitable to hold that appellant could profit by a favorable ruling on the demurrer without being bound by an unfavorable ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The order denying the motion for change of venue is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Barnard, P. J., and Griffin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-13\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
