The facts of the present case are almost identical with those of the case just referred to; the only difference being that one word of the entry in the present case was written across one word in the last line of the will. This word was in a sentence which stated merely that a word in the will had been changed before signing. It thus appears that no material portion of the will was obliterated, even if the mere writing across a word in a will, leaving the same perfectly legible, could be said to be an oblitera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>tion or cancellation within the meaning of the statute which provides that a will may be revoked by cancelling some material portion thereof. The case is upon its facts absolutely controlled by the decision in <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Hunter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"A8xP\">\n<em>All the Justices concurring, except Lewis,.
