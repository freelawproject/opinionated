J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajll\">An action was brought in the superior court of \u2018Cobb county by T. M. Brumby, as mayor of the City of Marietta, against B. E. Lawhon as principal, and Saxon A. Anderson and 6. S. Owen, as sureties, upon a bond given by Lawhon as clerk of the city council of Marietta, conditioned for the faithful performance of all of his duties as such clerk. It was made payable to \u201cD. W. Blair, Mayor of said City of Marietta for the time being, and to his successors in office.\u201d The plaintiff alleged in his petition that he was the \u201csuccessor in office\u201d of D. WvBlair, who was mayor at the time the bond was given, and upon this allegation predicated his right to sue on the bond for the breach thereof which he averred had been made. The sureties filed a demurrer based on numerous grounds, one of which was that \u201cthe bond sued upon and sought to be enforced is shown by said petition to have been made to an \u25a0obligee other than that designated by the charter\u201d of the City of Marietta, and \u201c for this reason said bond can not be sued upon by \u2022a successor.\u201d A wholly independent action was also brought by Brumby, in his representative capacity, against Lawhon as principal, and Anderson and A. Y. Leake as sureties, upon another bond reciting that it was given to \u201cR. N. Holland, Mayor of said City of Marietta for the time being, and to his successors in office,\u201d on condition that it was to become inoperative should Lawhon well and truly perform the duties devolving upon him as city clerk. This .action was met by a demurrer precisely like that above referred to. . Still another action, brought in the name of \u201c Thomas M. Brumby, Mayor of the City of Marietta,\u201d upon a similar bond, was instituted against Lawhon as principal, and Anderson and J. Paige as sureties. This bond was made payable to \u201c T. M. Brumby, Mayor of said City of Marietta for the time being, and his successors in office.\u201d The petition filed in this case specifically alleged that: \u201c Petitioner is Mayor of the City of Marietta, and in such representative capacity he brings this suit for the use of the Board of Education of the City of Marietta.\u201d To this petition Anderson and Paige demurred on the ground, among others, that \u201c the mayor of the City of Marietta <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>in his representative capacity has no authority in law to bring a suit, . . because the charter creating said office of mayor fails to confer such authority upon said officer.\u201d These three cases are now before this court for review, having been brought here by separate writs of error. Each calls for a determination of the question whether or not the court below erred in holding that Brumby,, in his representative capacity, was a proper party plaintiff. We entertain the view that he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">By an act approved January 22, 1852, the \u201ctownof Marietta\u201d' was incorporated as a city, and provision was made for the election of a governing body to consist of a mayor and six councilmen. Acts of 1851-2, p. 390. It was in the 5th section of this act declared \u201c That the mayor and members of the council, as before mentioned, shall be known, as the Mayor and Council of the City of Marietta, and by such, their corporate name, shall sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, and do all other acts relating to their corporate capacity.\u201d Provision was also made for the election of a marshal, treasurer, and clerk of council; and in the 10th section it was declared that these officers should be required to \u201cgive bond and security to the Mayor and Council of the City of Marietta, in a sum each to be fixed by the Mayor and Council, for the faithful performance of his or their duties.\u201d So it will readily be perceived that the official bond which Lawhon, as city clerk, was legally called upon to make was one payable, not to the mayor of the city, but to the duly incorporated governing body \u2014 \u201cthe Mayor and Council of the City of Marietta.\u201d Indeed, it was very frankly conceded by the able counsel who appeared in this court in behalf of Mayor Brumby that the instruments upon which these suits were instituted could not properly be regarded as valid stat-. utory bonds; and the sole contention upon which counsel based the alleged right to sue thereon was that they were, under the rules of the common law, enforceable as voluntary bonds. In this connection the Political Code, \u00a7 263, was cited and relied on. It declares that: \u201c Whenever any officer required by law to give an official bond acts under a bond which is not in the penalty payable and conditioned, nor approved and filed as required by law, such bond is not void, but stands in the place of the official bond, subject, on its condition being broken, to all the remedies, including the several recoveries, which the persons aggrieved might have maintained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>on the official bond.\u201d It does not, however, undertake to prescribe at whose suit such a defective bond is to be enforced. Granting, then, for the sake of the argument, that the provisions of this section were intended to apply to bonds required of municipal officers, it furnishes no aid in determining whether or not Brumby had any right, in his official character, to maintain any one or all of the actions instituted by him in that capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">It is undoubtedly true that a bond given by a public officer is not to be considered void merely because it is made \u201cpayable to an obligee other than as required by statute.\u201d \u2022 2 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. L. 467. On the contrary, \u201c all such bonds are good as common-law bonds, and may be enforced by suit in the name of the obligees or their personal representatives.\u201d Ibid. 467a, note. But \u201cwhere a bond purporting to be official is made payable to official persons whom the statute does not authorize to become the obligees, the successors of such obligees can not maintain an action on the bond.\u201d Ibid. 467, note 10. In support of the proposition last stated numerous authorities are cited. Of these we select as especially pertinent the following: In Stuart <em>v. </em>Lee, 3 Call (Va.), 422, it appeared that a statute of Virginia prescribed that the official bonds required of sheriffs should be made payable \u201c to the Justices.\u201d The bond sued on was made payable to Governor Randolph. His successor in office, Governor Lee, sought to enforce it, but the court held that he had no right to sue thereon. It was in the case of White <em>v. </em>Quarles, 14 Mass. 451, ruled that a bond given to a probate judge and his successors in office could not be enforced by the prohate judge who succeeded him, the reason assigned being, that, as the bond was not executed in conformity to statute, the plaintiff had no legal interest therein. The Supreme Court of Alabama, in the case of Calhoun <em>v. </em>Lunsford, 4 Porter, 345, held that: \u201cNo action can be maintained by the successor of a judge of the county court upon the bond of an assessor and collector of taxes, made payable to the judge \u2014 such bond, by statute, being required to be made payable to the Governor.\u201d The bond sued on was made payable to \u201c Richard S. Clinton, Judge of the County Court of Dallas county, or his successors in office.\u201d In discussing the question whether his successor, Judge Calhoun, could lawfully maintain an action upon such a bond, Chief Justice Hopkins, who pronounced the judgment of the court, said (pp. 346-7): \u201cA judge of a county court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>corporate powers so far as to enable him to discharge his official duties. The successor in office of such a judge would be entitled to an action upon any contract that the judge was authorized to make, and had entered into in his official capacity, and upon which the judge would have a right of action if he had continued in the office. But it was not necessary for Judge Clinton to take the bond in this case payable to himself to enable him to perform any official duty which was required of him. His duties in relation to the official bond of the assessor and tax-collector were definite. He was required to fix the penalty of the bond, to approve it, and cause it to be recorded in the office of the clerk of his court. In taking the bond payable to himself, he acted in his natural capacity; and although the bond was made payable to him as the judge of the county court of Dallas county, or his successors in office, yet, as he had no authority to take it to himself in his official capacity, the legal effect of the bond is the same that it would be if his official character had been omitted in the bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In Hibbits <em>v. </em>Canada, 10 Yerg. 465, a suit brought by the personal representatives of one James Hibbits, upon a bond made payable to him and to his successors in office, was held by the Supreme Court of Tennessee to be maintainable, the conclusion reached by that court being stated as follows: \u201cAn administration bond made payable to the chairman of the county court and his successors in office, instead of the Governor of the State as required by law, can not be sued upon b,y the successor in office, but is a good voluntary bond, and suit may be brought upon it in the name of the original payee, or his personal representative, if he be dead.\u201d A similar ruling was announced in the case of Jones <em>v. </em>Wiley, 4 Humph. 145. The Supreme Court of Maine had under consideration, in Lord <em>v. </em>Lancey, 21 Me. 468, an obligation like that referred to immediately above, and seems to have entertained no doubt that the successor in office of the payee named therein had no right to sue upon it. Another case directly in point is that of Stevens <em>v. </em>Hay, 6 Cush. 229, in which Metcalf, J., reviews the leading authorities on the subject. See, also, Governor <em>v. </em>Twitty, 1 Dev. (N. C.) 153. Clearly, where a bond required by statute is improperly made payable to a public officer who is without power in his official capacity to sue thereon, his successor in office can, in his official capacity, have no greater authority in the premises. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>is to be borne in mind that, as a general rule, a public official has no right, as such, to maintain a suit of any character. Accordingly, it is only where, by express statute, he is constituted a corporation sole, and is given the right to sue or is made subject to suit, that he can properly be regarded as having any standing whatever in a court of justice. Overseers <em>v. </em>Sears, 22 Pick. (Mass.) 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">As remarked above, an official bond is not void merely because given to an officer other than the one to whom, under the provisions of a statute, it should have been made payable; and where such obligee has authority to institute legal proceedings in his representative capacity, such a bond is enforceable at his instance. The Justices <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 J. J. Marsh. 472; Sweetser <em>v. </em>Hay, 2 Gray, 49. But this is necessarily otherwise when he is clearly without such authority and therefore can not become a proper party plaintiff. In that event the bond may, perhaps, be construed as an obligation given to the payee in his individual capacity, and enforceable by a suit brought in his name and right \u00a3,s a private citizen for the use of the person or persons aggrieved by a breach thereof. See Iredell <em>v. </em>Barbee, 9 Ired. 250; Fitts <em>v. </em>Green, 3 Dev. 291, 296 ; Williams <em>v. </em>Ehringhaus, Id. 297; Hibbits <em>v. </em>Canada, 10 Yerg. 465. This is, however, a matter which we are not now called upon to decide. Suffice it to say that all three of the actions instituted by Brumby were avowedly brought by him in his representative capacity as mayor of the City of Marietta. The act incorporating that city certainly did not confer upon its mayor any of the powers incident to a corporation sole; and, so far as we are informed, there is no law of force in this State authorizing that official to maintain an action of any sort under any circumstances whatever. This court is fully committed to the proposition that no suit can be lawfully prosecuted save in the name of a plaintiff having a legal entity, either as a natural or as an artificial person. See <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Inman Park Church, </em>111 <em>Ga. </em>677, and cit.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The views above expressed in no way conflict with the decision Tendered in <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>1 <em>Ga. </em>574, and followed in another case between the same parties, reported in 3 <em>Ga. </em>499. The bond then under consideration was, as it should have been, made payable to the Governor of this State and his successors in office; and it was in all respects a good statutory bond, save that it was not given within the time prescribed by law. Suit thereon was inr <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>stibuted in the name of Governor Crawford as the successor of Governor McDonald, who was in office at the time it was executed. The court held that, as this bond was properly made payable to the Governor and his successors in office, an action thereon by Crawford was maintainable, he having in his representative capacity authority to prosecute suits of this character, and the makers of the bond being therefore estopped from questioning his right to sue thereon in accordance with its express terms. It was further held that, as it was enforceable only as a voluntary bond, the rules of the common law applied, and accordingly there could be but one recovery thereon. This is now otherwise under the Political Code, \u00a7 263, the provisions of which we have hereinbefore quoted, which expressly authorizes \u201cthe several recoveries\u201d which might formerly be had upon an official bond executed in strict conformity to statutory requirements. The doctrine established by the two decisions last above mentioned is simply this: A bond made payable to a public official who is authorized by law to enforce by suit obligations of that character may likewise be enforced by his successor in office, if the bond so stipulates; but the remedy to be pursued in case the bond does not conform to all statutory requirements is, not that pointed out by statute as applicable to obligations given in strict compliance therewith, bub that afforded by the rules of the common law. This doctrine was recognized and given effect by the Supreme Court of Tennessee in the case of Polk <em>v. </em>Plummer, 2 Humph. 500, in which Reese, J., filed an elaborate and well-reasoned opinion. When the obligee of a voluntary bond is a public official who has been by law constituted a corporation sole, there can be no impropriety in entertaining a suit thereon instituted by him or by his successor in office; but it is quite another thing for a court to ignore the settled policy of the law by giving countenance to a suit filed-in the name of a public servant who is legally incapable, as such, of maintaining an action of any description. Accordingly, we do not feel authorized to give our sanction to the further prosecution of the legal proceedings instituted in the court below with a view to recovering on the three bonds under consideration, which, because of apparently inexcusable ignorance and neglect of duty on the part of the municipal authorities, have given rise to useless, annoying, and expensive litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">\n<em>Judgment in each case reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"A1t\"><em>All the Justices concurring, except </em>Lewis, <em>J., absent.</em></judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
