J.</author>\n<p id=\"APh\">It is very clear that there was evidence sufficient to submit to the jury as to whether the contract was made with the defendant to carry him and his baggage from Hamburg. If a part of the carriage was performed by other corporations, the plaintiff was justified in inferring that they were, the agents of the defendant in the matter, not his agents. He had not made any contract with the subordinate carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">New trial refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
