The word \u201csame,\u201d in section 153 of the Code, refers to the word \u201c answer,\u201d and not to \u201c new matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">I think, also, that the answer is insufficient. The complaint alleges that defendant \u201c assaulted the plaintiff, and seized him by his collar and shook him violently.\u201d The answer \u201c denies that he did assault the said plaintiff, <em>and </em>seize him by his collar, <em>and </em>shook him violently.\u201d The defendant has grouped three of the charges and denied them under oath in such a manner that if he</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>should he guilty of two and not guilty of any one, his answer would not be literally untrue. This is not good pleading within the Code. The object of the special pleading, and the oath adopted by the code, is to require the defendant to admit so much of the charge as he can not conscientiously deny, and thus narrow the issues to those points which are really in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The denial in this case should have been of each charge disjunctively, if the defendant intended to put the whole of them in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Judgment for plaintiff on demurrer, with leave to defendant to amend on the usual terms.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
