(\u201cAFC\u201d), Samaras\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and interest awarded in a state lawsuit. Concluding that the bankruptcy court\u2019s holding is correct, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-13\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">In 1990, Samaras sued A1 Copeland Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cACE\u201d) in Texas state court for breach of contract. ACE subsequently filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, and Samaras filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding. The bankruptcy court approved a reorganization plan for the debtor ACE. As part of the reorganization, AFC was incorporated as a separate, on-going enterprise. The parties then agreed to return the case to state court to liquidate Samaras\u2019s contract claim, substituting AFC as the defendant. In 1993, the bankruptcy court entered an order (\u201c1993 Order\u201d) permitting them to do so. The 1993 Order provided that \u201cupon the exhaustion of any appeals or writs of certio-rari or in the event of settlement, the liquidated amount, if any, or [sic] such judgment ... shall be deemed allowed\u201d under ACE\u2019s reorganization plan and \u201cshall be paid in accordance with\u201d the plan\u2019s provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-17\">Samaras prevailed on his contract claim in state court. In addition to actual damages of $1,522,586, Samaras was awarded $686,178.70 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Under Texas law, the entire judgment is subject to interest of 10% per annum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although AFC argued that the award of attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and interests was not allowable under bankruptcy law, the Texas trial court refused to consider the issue, holding that it had no jurisdiction to decide the question of federal law. AFC then returned to the bankruptcy court seeking clarification of that court\u2019s order, specifically whether the bankruptcy court intended the state court to decide such subsidiary questions of federal law. In 1995, the bankruptcy court entered an order (\u201c1995 Order\u201d) clarifying that it had intended just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-18\">Thus armed, AFC argued to the Texas appellate court that the lower court incorrectly refused to consider the allowability of the attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and interest under federal law. Following the trial court\u2019s lead, however, the appellate court too refused to address the bankruptcy law question, and simply affirmed the award. The Texas Supreme Court denied AFC\u2019s application for a writ of error. Thus rebuffed again, AFC returned to the bankruptcy court for a third time, filing a motion to disallow the contested aspects of the award, as (1) they were clearly not recoverable under federal law, and (2) the Texas courts had incorrectly refused to consider the issue. In September, 1997, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>bankruptcy court granted AFC\u2019s motion (\u201c1997 Order\u201d), and Samaras timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">A <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">The issues presented in this appeal are questions of law, which we review <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">B. <em>Applicable Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">The bankruptcy court did not explicitly state the basis for the 1997 Order that disallowed the contested aspects of Samaras\u2019s claims. Samaras characterizes the 1993 Order as an abstention order and argues that the bankruptcy court, having turned over to the state court all aspects of Samaras\u2019s claim in that abstention order, lacked jurisdiction to enter the 1997 Order. Samaras further contends that, even assuming that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to enter the 1997 Order, AFC waived its right to have the federal court determine the bankruptcy issue when AFC freely agreed to remove all aspects of the parties\u2019 dispute to the state court system. Finally, again assuming jurisdiction, Samaras asserts that, as the 1993 Order was a final order, the bankruptcy court abused its discretion when it granted AFC relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> AFC, like Samaras, frames its arguments in terms of abstention and Rule 60(b), albeit that AFC disagrees with Samaras\u2019s contentions on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">1. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">A bankruptcy court may \u201cin the interest of justice, or in the interest of comity with State courts or respect for State law\u201d abstain from hearing a Title 11 controversy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Samaras argues that once a federal court enters an abstention order relinquishing jurisdiction over a case, the abstaining court cannot .reclaim the case unless it has explicitly retained jurisdiction in the abstention order. We need not assess the merit of Sa-maras\u2019s position because in the 1993 Order the bankruptcy court did reserve jurisdiction over the Samaras\u2019s claim. The order provided that, once liquidated, Samaras\u2019s claim would be deemed allowed under AFC\u2019s reorganization plan and would be paid accordingly. The bankruptcy court indisputably had jurisdiction over the administration of the reorganization plan, including the processing of Samaras\u2019s liquidated claim thereunder. Although Samaras is likely correct when he notes that the bankruptcy court did not envision having to do anything more than \u201cplugging\u201d the claim back into the reorganization plan, the court\u2019s expectation cannot somehow void the jurisdiction it retained over the matter in the 1993 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-15\">2. <em>Waiver</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-16\">Samaras\u2019s second contention \u2014 that, by consenting to.the 1993 Order permitting the parties to return to state court, AFC waived its right to have the allowability of the fees, costs, and- interest determined by a federal court \u2014 is somewhat more meritorious. Samaras rests his argument primarily on <em>England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical </em>Examiners,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>England, </em>the Supreme Court addressed whether a party may, within the context of abstention, waive his right to return to federal court for final determination of his claim. Relying on its earlier decision in <em>NAACP v. </em>Button&gt;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Court held that \u201cif a party freely and without reservation submits his claims for decision by the state courts, litigates them there, and has them decided there, then \u2014 whether or not he seeks direct review of the state decision in this Court \u2014 he has elected to forgo his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>to return to the District Court.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court made clear, however, that a party cannot be denied his right to return to federal court unless he \u201cfully litigated\u201d his claims in state court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Not surprisingly, Samaras contends that AFC voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the state courts of Texas, and that, as both parties briefed and argued their positions at every stage of the litigation, the federal question at issue was \u201cfully litigated.\u201d AFC responds that the federal question manifestly was not \u201cfully litigated\u201d because the Texas courts\u2014trial, appellate, and Supreme\u2014refused to consider the issue at all. In <em>Front Royal Industrial Park Corporation v. Town of Front Royal </em>Virginia,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a case not cited by either party, the Fourth Circuit addressed this exact issue. There, as here, the state courts refused to consider the federal claims presented. The <em>Front Royal </em>court held that the plaintiffs federal claims had not been fully litigated as required by <em>England, </em>stating \u201c[w]e can see no warrant for finding-voluntary waiver of <em>England-type </em>rights where ... the state court expressly refuses to reach the federal claims presented to it out of concerns for comity.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We agree with this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Federal courts take very seriously the strict duty to exercise jurisdiction conferred on them, relinquishing that jurisdiction only under specified circumstances.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, abstention is viewed as an extraordinary measure\u2014\u201cthe exception, not the rule.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although, as <em>England </em>instructs, a party may voluntarily waive his right to avail himself of the federal court system, such a waiver is no light matter. The Supreme Court has specified strict limitations on this kind of waiver, including the requirement that the federal claim be fully litigated and decided by the state court. More generally, waiver is defined as \u201cthe intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-12\">In no way can AFC be said to have intentionally relinquished or abandoned its right to have its federal claim heard in federal court. In short, we, like the Fourth Circuit, see no merit in the proposition that a litigant can be deprived of his access to federal court simply because the state courts, through no fault of that litigant, refuse to entertain and dispose of the federal claims presented. When, following a federal court\u2019s entry of an abstention order, the cognizant state courts expressly refuse to consider the federal issues in the case, those issues have neither been fully litigated nor decided. We hold that, under such circumstances, the litigant has not waived his right to return to federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-13\">3. <em>Rule 60(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-14\">Thus, Samaras is left with only his Rule 60(b)(6) argument. We review a trial court\u2019s grant of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under Rule 60(b)(6), which is made applicable to bankruptcy proceedings by Bankruptcy Rule 9024,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>has the authority to reheve a party from a final order for any \u201creason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>Seven Elves, Incorporated v. Eskenazi,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em>\u2019\u2019 </em>we set forth several factors relevant to considering a motion under Rule 60(b)(6), including (1) whether the motion was made within a reasonable time, (2) whether the movant had a fair opportunity to present his claim or defense, and (3) whether granting relief would be equitable.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Here, each of these factors weighs heavily in favor of sustaining the bankruptcy court\u2019s grant of AFC\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion. AFC first pursued relief in state court all the way from the trial court to the Texas Supreme Court, and then made its Rule 60(b)(6) motion only after relief in state court was no longer available. AFC could not have anticipated that the Texas state courts would refuse to hear its claim. In fact, when AFC was first alerted to such a possibility, it returned to the bankruptcy court to have the matter clarified. Under these circumstances, AFC\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion was timely and providently made. Moreover, as the foregoing discussion regarding waiver indicates, because the state courts refused to hear its arguments, AFC did not have a fair opportunity to present them to the state courts. For the same reason, we conclude that to deny AFC a federal determination of the allowability of the fees, costs, and interest portion of Sa-maras\u2019s claim would be inequitable. As such, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion when it granted AFC\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">The bankruptcy court did not lack the jurisdiction to disallow the contested portion Samaras\u2019s claim, given that court\u2019s indisputable retention of jurisdiction over the administration of AFC\u2019s reorganization plan. Moreover, AFC did not waive its right to have the bankruptcy court make that determination because \u2014 through no fault of AFC \u2014 the federal issue was not fully litigated in the courts of Texas. Finally, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in granting AFC\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion, as the refusal of the Texas courts to consider the federal issue provided the bankruptcy court with ample justification for revisiting Samaras\u2019s claim. Accordingly, the ruling of the bankruptcy court, affirmed by the district court, is in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1024-15\">. Tex.Rev.Civ.
