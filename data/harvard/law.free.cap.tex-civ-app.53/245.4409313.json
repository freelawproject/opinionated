A bank, creditor of the beer company, was a party to the contract, by which it received the consideration for the sale. The manager had personally advanced $600 of the cost of this beer, which fact was overlooked in the sale, and he sued the bank to recover that amount on the ground that by mistake his own property, to that extent, had been included in the sale to him. Held that by such advancement he had not become part owner of the beer, but a creditor of the beer company to that amount; and that such mistake did not entitle him to a rescission of the sale or to recover such debt of the company to him from the bank.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-8\">Appeal from the District Court of Travis County.

The only item in controversy was a certain carload of bottled beer of the value of $1104. Plaintiff claimed that he was the owner in fact of $600 worth of said beer at the time of said alleged sale, but that his said ownership was lost sight of by both parties to this cause at said time, with the result that plaintiff paid and defendant received $600 as purchase price for property already belonging to plaintiff, for which said sum and legal interest plaintiff sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">\u201cDefendant answered by general demurrer, general denial, a special denial that it made a contract for the sale of said property or that it was a party to any mistake; a plea that if any mistake was made, plaintiff\u2019s remedy was by suit for a rescission of any contract that may have been made, at or within a reasonable time after said alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>mistake occurred, plaintiff having been at all times since he bought said property -in full possession of all accounts and other detailed information about the subject matter of said sale; and a further plea of estoppel on the ground that the alleged sale was made to plaintiff by the Austin Ice &amp; Bottling Works, a large debtor of defendant, under an agreement that the proceeds of such sale should be paid to defendant as a credit on said debt against said Austin Ice &amp; Bottling Works; that shortly after said alleged sale, said Austin Ice &amp; Bottling Works was put into bankruptcy and its affairs there administered; that defendant could and would have proved up its claim in said bankruptcy proceeding, but for the delay of plaintiff in making his claim, if such were in fact well grounded, and would have received a dividend thereon, but that said estate in bankruptcy had been closed long before the filing of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u201cDefendant also pleaded by way of setoff and as a counterclaim a cause of action on a certain promissory note executed- by plaintiff, on which there was claimed a b\u00e1lance of $100, with interest and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u201cIt is believed that the following brief statement of matters established by uncontroverted evidence will be of assistance to the court in reaching an understanding of the facts shown by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u201cThe defendant, the City National Bank of Austin, Texas, was a national banking corporation, located at Austin, Texas, of which Mr. A. P. Wooldridge was president and Mr. Geo. W. Walling, Jr., was cashier. On August 3, 1905, said defendant closed its doors, its entire assets and business were taken over by the Austin National Bank, and no banking business was done at the City National Bank building after said August - 3, 1905. The Austin Ice &amp; Bottling Works was a private corporation, located at Austin, Texas, of which Jasper Wooldridge, his brother and plaintiff were the only stockholders, plaintiff owning only a nominal amount of stock. The Austin Ice &amp; Bottling Works owned the Schlitz Beer Agency at Austin, Texas, at the time said agency was bought by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u201cPlaintiff Y. A. Fenner was secretary of said Austin Ice &amp; Bottling Works, and was a stockholder in said corporation. The Schlitz Beer Agency at Austin, 'Texas, was conducted in the name of Y. A. Fenner, agent, though owned by said Austin Ice &amp; Bottling Works. At the date of said sale the Austin Ice &amp; Bottling Works owed .plaintiff $2000 on a note, and it owed defendant a large sum of money on unsecured notes, as well as $2500 and interest on a note purporting to be \u2018secured by the stock, accounts and other properties of the Schlitz Beer Agency in the city of Austin, Texas.\u2019 After defendant closed its doors on August 3, 1905, Mr. Walling became its executive officer, and as such looked after all its collateral, including the properties of said Austin Ice &amp; Bottling Works. On and a few days prior to August 9, 1905, there were some negotiations between plaintiff and Geo. Walling, Jr., with reference to settlement of the affairs of Schlitz Beer Agency, and these negotiations led up to the execution and delivery by the Austin Ice &amp; Bottling Works, defendant, the City National Bank of Austin, Texas, and plaintiff Y. A, Fenner of the following contract in writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\u201c'The State of Texas,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-2\">County of Travis.

The carload of beer in question was all of the bottle beer on hand at said date, and it was worth $1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">\u201cThe specific transaction giving rise to plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause of action was as follows: Said car of beef had been ordered of the Schlitz Brewing Co., Milwaukee, some time previous to the alleged sale of the beer business at Austin to plaintiff, and had been paid for to the extent of $504 by a credit given for bottles returned. Said credit left a balance of $600 due the Schlitz Co., of Milwaukee, on said beer, and said car was shipped according to the usual custom under bill of lading with draft attached. Plaintiff explains the manner of shipment in such cases as follows: \u201cThe cars of beer always came consigned to the Schlitz Company and so endorsed that I got the bill of lading when I paid the draft. It was necessary in every instance to produce the bill of lading in order to get the car. The car of beer involved in this case came in the usual way, and that was the reason I paid the $600/</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">\u201cThe payment by plaintiff of said drafts is described by him as follows: \u2018The fact was that I paid $600 of that out of my own money, for which I never had any credit. That car of beer, $1104 worth, was received about the time the City National Bank closed its' doors. The car remained on the track a day or two and I went to see Mr. A. P. Wooldridge, the president of the City National Bank, and told him that the contract with the brewery would be forfeited and the business lost if they were not able to take up the draft and get the car of beer that was on the track. He told me they were not in situation to do it at that time, and I went then and raised the money myself out of my personal funds/</p>\n<p id=\"b274-16\">\u201cPlaintiff never made demand upon defendant, nor any of its agents for repayment of said $600 until this suit was filed two years after said sale, and defendant had no notice of such payment by plaintiff or of any claim asserted against it by him by reason thereof until the filing of his original petition herein on August 8, 1907.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-17\">\u201cThe trial was had before the court and judgment was rendered for plaintiff for $600 with six percent interest from August 10, 1905, and in favor of defendant on its cross-action for $133.72, which was ordered allowed as a credit on said judgment in favor of plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-18\">Appellee\u2019s right to recover is based upon the supposed existence at the date of the sale of a mutual mistake as to the ownership of the car of beer described in plaintiff\u2019s petition, his contention being that he was the owner of $600 worth of the beer, and that the sale was made, as shown by the written contract, upon the theory that the entire carload of beer belonged to the Austin Ice &amp; Bottling Works. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The testimony fails to sustain appellee\u2019s contention as to the ownership of the beer. He was the agent of the Austin Ice &amp; Bottling Works, and, according to his own testimony, the most that can be said in his behalf is that he advanced or loaned to his principal $600, with which to pay the balance due on the beer. That transaction constituted him an unsecured creditor of the Austin Ice &amp; Bottling Works, but it did not vest in him any title to the beer. Such being the case, in the sale referred to there was no mistake as to the ownership of the beer. In making that sale appellee may have overlooked the fact that he had loaned the Austin Ice &amp; Bottling Works $600 to pay for the beer, but his oversight in that regard would not entitle him to a rescission of the sale or to recover anything from appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The case having been fully developed, and there being no conflict in the testimony, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed and -judgment here rendered to the effect that appellee take nothing as to the suit against appellant, and that appellant recover against appellee on its cross-action $133.73 and all the costs in both courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\n<em>Reversed and rendered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
