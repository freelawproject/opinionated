Thereafter, the trial court sentenced defendant to concurrent terms of two years and eight months to four years\u2019 imprisonment for each of the three counts. On appeal, this Court affirmed her convictions. <em>People v Jensen, </em>222 Mich App 575; 564 NW2d 192 (1997). Defendant filed her application for leave to appeal with the Supreme Court.

We believe that defendant\u2019s constitutional challenges on these grounds fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">MCL 333.5210; MSA 14.15(5210) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">(1) A person who knows that he or she has or has been diagnosed as having acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome related complex, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>or who knows that he or she is mv infected, and who engages in sexual penetration with another person without having first informed the other person that he or she has acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome related complex or is hiv infected, is guilty of a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">(2) As used in this section, \u201csexual penetration\u201d means sexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse, or any other intrusion, however slight, of any part of a person\u2019s body or of any object into the genital or anal openings of another person\u2019s body, but emission of semen is not required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">As we begin our overbreadth analysis, we are mindful that a statute is accorded a strong presumption of validity and that we have a duty to construe it as valid absent a clear showing of unconstitutionality. <em>People v White, </em>212 Mich App 298, 309; 536 NW2d 876 (1995). Moreover, the constitutionality of a statute is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Mahaffey v Attorney General, </em>222 Mich App 325, 334-335; 564 NW2d 104 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The overbreadth doctrine is primarily applied to First Amendment cases where an overbroad statute prohibits constitutionally protected conduct. <em>People v Cavaiani, </em>172 Mich App 706, 711; 432 NW2d 409 (1988). The overbreadth of a statute must be real and substantial; it must be judged in relation to the legitimate sweep of the statute where conduct and not merely speech is involved. <em>Broadrick v Oklahoma, </em>413 US 601, 614-615; 93 S Ct 2908; 37 L Ed 2d 830 (1973). In <em>Broadrick, supra </em>at 610, the United States Supreme Court recognized that a person to whom a statute may be constitutionally applied may not challenge that statute as overbroad on the grounds that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>conceivably </em>may be unconstitutional when applied to others in situations not before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">In <em>People v Russell, </em>158 Ill 2d 23; 196 Ill Dec 629; 630 NE2d 794 (1994), the Illinois Supreme Court was faced with a similar overbreadth argument when the defendant challenged Illinois\u2019 criminal statute prohibiting the knowing transmission of mv to another through intimate contact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upholding the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>against the defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge, the Illinois Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">In one of the cases before us, the criminal complaint charges that the defendant Caretha Russell knew that she was infected with the hiv virus when she engaged in consensual sexual intercourse with Daren Smith without telling Smith of her infection. In the other case, defendant Timothy Lunsford is charged with raping a woman at a time when he knew he was infected with the mv virus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">Neither the statute nor the cases before us have even the slightest connection with free speech. <em>Consequently, pursuant to constitutional interpretations of the United States Supreme Court, defendants\u2019 overbreadth argument and their argument of facial vagueness are inapplicable. Bates v State Bar, </em>433 US 350, 380; 97 S Ct 2691, 2707; 53 L Ed 2d 810, 833 (1977); <em>Smith v Goguen, </em>415 US 566; 94 S Ct 1242; 37 L Ed 2d 605 (1974); <em>Broadrick, [supra </em>at 611-617]; <em>Grayned v City of Rockford, </em>408 US 104; 92 S Ct 2294; 33 L Ed 2d 222 (1972). <em>[Russell, supra </em>at 25-26 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">In the case at bar, defendant specifically argues that the statute is overbroad because it fails to limit the offense to consensual sexual acts but instead seemingly also compels victims of nonconsensua! sex who happen to be mv or aids carriers to inform their attackers of that status. In formulating her argument, however, defendant fails to differentiate between the speech of a consensual partner versus a nonconsensua! partner, other than by suggesting that to compel speech from the latter is unfair. Because defendant does not establish how the statute in question improperly sweeps within its inclusion both protected and unprotected conduct, this facet of the defendant\u2019s overbreadth analysis is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>More importantly, however, defendant\u2019s conduct, i.e., engaging in sexual intercourse with the victim without previously telling him that she was mv positive, is clearly encompassed by the language of the statute. Accord <em>State v Gamberella, </em>633 So 2d 595, 603 (La App, 1993) (upholding the constitutionality of Louisiana\u2019s statute criminalizing the intentional exposure of individuals to aids or mv without their informed consent).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because a person to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied will not be allowed to challenge that statute on the ground that it conceivably may be applied unconstitutionally to others in situations not before the court, <em>Broadrick, supra; Gamberella, supra, </em>we find no merit in defendant\u2019s overbreadth claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Moreover, because the present case does not involve a victim of nonconsensuai sexual acts, this Court\u2019s exploration of any policy arguments regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>whether a sexual assault victim should be held criminally responsible for not informing the attacker is also inappropriate. Although defendant does not question whether the Legislature truly intended to implicate both consensual and nonconsensual sexual partners within the ambit of the statute, defendant\u2019s behavior in this case fell squarely within the contemplation of the statute. Moreover, defendant was found competent to stand trial and criminally responsible for her behavior. The evidence established that she understood the dangers of having unprotected sexual relations with another person and that she had a duty to warn them, but she disregarded both. The evidence also established that defendant consensually engaged in sexual relations with the victim and purposefully withheld the fact she was mv infected because she did not want to \u201ckill the relationship,\u201d and wanted people to like her. We therefore believe that because the statute squarely applies to defendant, she is also precluded from engaging in this overbreadth analysis. <em>Broadrick, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Defendant further argues that the statute is unconstitutional because it does not contain an intent, or mens rea, requirement. More specifically, defendant asserts that because the statute does not require a specific intent to harm, persons who do not understand or appreciate the consequences of their acts can be found criminally responsible. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">In light of defendant\u2019s repeated argument that mentally deficient individuals will be prosecuted under this statute, we reiterate and remind defendant that, even though the evidence in the instant case does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>support such a factual situation, if a \u201cperson lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law,\u201d a finding of criminal responsibility will be precluded under the legal insanity defense statute, MCL 768.21a(l); MSA 28.1044(1)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">With respect to defendant\u2019s mens rea argument, we note that fewer than half the states have criminal statutes penalizing the exposure of others to mv, and only a few of those contain an explicit mens rea requirement. See Idaho Code 39-608 (\u201cAny person who exposes another in any manner with the <em>intent to infect </em>or, knowing that he or she is or has been afflicted with [aids, aec, or mv], transfers or attempts to transfer any of his or her body fluid, body tissue or organs to another person is guilty of a felony\u201d); Okla Stat tit 21, 1192.1 (it is unlawful for a person who knows he or she has aids or mv \u201cand with <em>intent to infect </em>another\u201d to engage in sexual penetration with another where the other person did not consent to the penetration or had not been informed of the AIDS or mv); ND Cent Code 12.1-20-17 (a person with mv or AIDS who \u201cwillfully transfers\u201d any of that person\u2019s body fluid to another person is guilty of a felony unless the risk was fully disclosed and an \u201cappropriate prophylactic device\u201d was used). The others, including Michigan\u2019s statute, are silent on this topic except to make it a crime for a person with a known mv or AIDS infection to fail to reveal that condition before donating blood, engaging in sexual penetration, or engaging a prostitute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Unfortunately, neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>the court in <em>Russell, supra, </em>nor the courts in any of the other states with similar statutes have resolved this mens rea dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Notably, however, in <em>People v Lardie, </em>452 Mich 231, 256; 551 NW2d 656 (1996), our Supreme Court recently upheld the constitutionality of the statute that criminalizes causing death by operating a vehicle while intoxicated. The statute was challenged after the trial court held that it unconstitutionally precluded the jury from determining the defendant\u2019s mental state or intent, but this Court upheld the statute as creating a \u201cstrict liability, public welfare offense\u201d without requiring the prosecutor to prove mens rea. <em>Lardie, supra </em>at 235-236.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In upholding the constitutionality of that statute, our Supreme Court, <em>id. </em>at 239-241, 246, made the following observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">In order to determine whether a statute imposes strict liability or requires proof of a mens rea, that is, a guilty mind, this Court first examines the statute itself and seeks to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>People v Quinn, </em>440 Mich 178, 185; 487 NW2d 194 (1992). In interpreting a statute in which the Legislature has not expressly included language indicating that fault is a necessary element of a crime, this Court must focus on whether the Legislature nevertheless intended to require some fault as a predicate to finding guilt. <em>Id. </em>In this statute, the Legislature did not expressly state that a defendant must have a criminal intent to commit this crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">Criminal intent is ordinarily an element of a crime even where the crime is created by statute. <em>People v Rice, </em>161 Mich 657, 664; 126 NW 981 (1910). Statutes that create strict liability for all of their elements are not favored. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>Quinn, supra </em>at 187. Nevertheless, a state may decide under its police power that certain acts or omissions are to be punished irrespective of the actor\u2019s intent. <em>Id. </em>at 186-187; <em>People v Hatinger, </em>174 Mich 333, 335; 140 NW 648 (1913). Many of the crimes that impose strict liability have been termed \u201cpublic welfare regulation.\u201d <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 187; see also <em>Morissette v United States, </em>342 US 246, 255; 72 S Ct 240; 96 L Ed 288 (1952) (public-welfare offenses). . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">Specific intent is defined as a particular criminal intent beyond the act done, whereas general intent is merely the intent to perform the physical act itself. <em>People v Beaudin, </em>417 Mich 570, 573-574; 339 NW2d 461 (1983); <em>People v Langworthy, </em>416 Mich 630, 639, 644; 331 NW2d 171 (1982). For a strict liability crime, the people need only prove that the act was performed regardless of what the actor knew or did not know. <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 188. On this basis, the distinction between a strict-liability crime and a general-intent crime is that, for a general-intent crime, the people must prove that the defendant purposefully or voluntarily performed the wrongful act, whereas, for a strict-liability crime, the people merely need to prove that the defendant performed the wrongful act, irrespective of whether he intended to perform it. Under MCL 257.625(4); MSA 9.2325(4), the distinction is important only in the rare circumstances where a defendant was driving when he honestly did not know he had consumed alcohol, which subsequently caused him to be intoxicated, or where he was forced to drive for some reason despite his intoxication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">. . . Where a statute is a codification of the common law and that common-law crime includes a mens rea as an element, this Court will interpret that statute to require a mens rea even if the statute is silent regarding knowledge as a necessary element. See <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 185-186.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">Where the offense in question does not codify the common law and omits reference to the element of intent, this Court will examine the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the legislation to determine whether there is a mens rea requirement. <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 196.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Our Supreme Court in <em>Lardie </em>concluded that the Legislature intended to eliminate the gross negligence requirement that attended common-law involuntary manslaughter, the crime with which intoxicated drivers who killed were charged before the statute was enacted. <em>Id. </em>at 250-251. Rather, the Legislature essentially presumed gross negligence as a matter of law from a person\u2019s voluntarily driving while knowing of the possibility of being intoxicated. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the Court believed that the Legislature presumably intended to require proof of a criminal intent for the criminal act of intoxicated driving.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]e conclude that the statute requires the people to prove that a defendant, who kills someone by driving while intoxicated, acted knowingly in consuming an intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, and acted voluntarily in deciding to drive after such consumption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Applying the rationale of <em>Lardie </em>to the case at bar, we believe it likely that the Legislature intended to require some type of intent as a predicate to finding guilt under MCL 333.5210; MSA 14.15(5210), but that here the requisite intent is inherent in the mv-infected person\u2019s socially and morally irresponsible actions. <em>Lardie, supra. </em>Moreover, the Legislature could reasonably have presumed that it is grossly negligent for an mv-infected person to engage in <em>any </em>sexual penetration with another person without full disclosure of the existence of the mv infection. What does nondisclosure achieve? Only further dissemination of a lethal, incurable disease in order to gratify the sexual or other physical pleasures of the already infected individual.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Disclosure would permit the other person to either refuse sexual contact or consent with knowledge of the risks that are being taken. We also believe that the Legislature\u2019s primary concern is stemming the spread of mv and aids throughout the population (similar to curtailing people from voluntarily driving while under the influence, as in <em>Lardie, supra).</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Failure to disclose not only places the unwit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>ting participant but also that participant\u2019s other sexual partners at serious risk of premature death. Indeed, the probable results accompanying nondisclosure are fairly predictable: death to innocent third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Moreover, in <em>Lardie, supra </em>at 264, 267, our Supreme Court also found that the death caused by intoxicated driving statute required a \u201ccausal relationship\u201d between the defendant\u2019s culpable state of mind, i.e., intentionally driving while intoxicated, and the other person\u2019s resulting death. Here, the same causal connection exists despite the variety of methods by which one may contract aids or mv or a myriad of other diseases that could end one\u2019s life. Knowingly engaging in sexual conduct capable of transmitting mv without informing a partner of being mv infected is the culpable state of mind that can cause the partner\u2019s resulting infection and eventual death.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Accordingly, although MCL 333.5210; MSA 14.15(5210) contains no express mens rea requirement, we presume that the Legislature intended to require that the prosecution prove that the defendant had a general intent to commit the wrongful act, i.e., to engage in sexual penetration with another person while failing to disclose that the defendant has aids or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>is HIV infected. See <em>Lardie, supra </em>at 267. Thus, the statute does not require strict liability because if a defendant admits being mv infected and the other person consents to the physical contact despite the risks associated with such contact, there is no criminal liability. Finally, the statute requires that the culpable mental state have a causal relationship to the harm that the statute seeks to prevent, <em>id., </em>i.e., requiring disclosure of being mv infected will reduce the unwitting spread of aids and mv-related diseases. We therefore find that MCL 333.5210; MSA 14.15(5210) is not constitutionally infirm on the basis that it lacks an explicit mens rea requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Finally, defendant asserts that MCL 333.5210; MSA 14.15(5210) violates her constitutional right of privacy and her right to be free from compelled speech by making it a crime to fail to inform a sexual partner of having aids or being mv infected. On review de novo, we disagree. See <em>Mahaffey, supra </em>at 334-335.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">In <em>Hobbins v Attorney General, </em>205 Mich App 194, 205-206; 518 NW2d 487 (1994), this Court discussed the \u201cright of privacy\u201d founded in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s concept of personal liberty and restrictions on state action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">The Court [in <em>Roe v Wade, </em>410 US 113; 93 S Ct 705; 35 L Ed 2d 147 (1973)], however, expressly stated that this \u201cprivacy right . . . cannot be said to be absolute,\u201d and noted that it has consistently \u201crefused to recognize an unlimited right of this kind in the past.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154. <em>Essential to the analysis in the case at bar is the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition and affirmation of the state\u2019s compelling interest in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number><em>protecting life </em>.... <em>Furthermore, \u201ca State [has] an unqualified interest in the preservation of human </em>life.\u201d <em>Cruzan v Director, Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>497 US 261, 282; 110 S Ct 2841; 111 L Ed 2d 224 (1990). <em>The constitutionality of legislative enactments to protect life is clearly established in our law.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">When individuals assert constitutional rights against state regulation, whether encompassed by the \u201czones of privacy\u201d recognized in <em>Roe </em>or acknowledged as a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a court must balance the individual interest against the state\u2019s interest.

Despite the guarantee of personal privacy extended to procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and child education, we disagree that defendant\u2019s asserted right to privacy falls within any of these categories. Defendant has not supported her mere assertions that her actions implicate procreation, contraception, or family relationship issues, and we will not search for authority to support this position. See, e.g., <em>In re Toler, </em>193 Mich App 474, 477; 484 NW2d 672 (1992). Rather, defendant\u2019s actions merely involve one individual\u2019s decision to have unfettered or unencumbered sexual relations with others. We will not read these constitutional guarantees of personal privacy so broadly as to render them meaningless. To the contrary, we defer to the state\u2019s overriding, legitimate, and compelling interest in preserving the life of its citizens, thereby permitting it to preclude defendant from remaining silent and knowingly exposing others to an incurable disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">In <em>Gamberella, supra </em>at 603-604, the Louisiana Court of Appeals rejected a similar privacy claim where the defendant argued that the statute interfered with his right as an mv-infected person to engage in sexual activities. The court recognized that the Louisiana Constitution, like the Michigan Constitution, guarantees every individual has the right to be secure in his person against \u201cunreasonable searches, seizures, or invasions of privacy\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">The right of privacy is not absolute; it is qualified by other rights. <em>Furthermore, the right of privacy does not shield all private sexual acts from state regulation. No one can seriously doubt that the state has a compelling interest </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number><em>in discouraging the spread of the hn virus. Forcing an infected person to inform, all of his sexual partners so the partner can make an informed decision prior to engaging in sexual activity furthers the state\u2019s interest in preventing the spread of the virus. . . . </em>[M]erely because the statute does not go as far as it could to discourage the spread of the virus does not result in the current version\u2019s being viewed as an invasion of privacy. Moreover, to the extent the statute criminalizes sexual conduct which might be incapable of spreading the virus, considering the uncertainty of the medical community concerning all aspects of this disease, the statute is narrowly drawn to further the state\u2019s compelling interest. <em>[Id. </em>at 604 (citations omitted, emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Although we are not bound to follow the reasoning in <em>Gamberella, </em>we agree with the conclusion that the right of privacy does not shield defendant\u2019s private sexual acts from state regulation. Michigan has an undeniable compelling interest in discouraging the spread of mv.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Requiring an infected person to so inform sexual partners so they can make an informed decision before engaging in sexual penetration is narrowly tailored to further this compelling state interest. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Defendant\u2019s right to privacy argument has been defeated not only in the context of criminal statutes relating to the transmission of AIDS but also in cases where unwitting sexual partners contracted a venereal disease and sued in tort for damages. In a tort action, <em>Kathleen K v Robert B, </em>150 Cal App 3d 992, 996; 198 Cal Rptr 273 (1984), the defendant argued that his right of privacy would be violated if he were compelled to disclose that he had genital herpes. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>that case, Cal Health and Safety Code 3198 made it a misdemeanor to expose any person or to infect any person with any venereal disease. Although the California Court of Appeals recognized that the government may not without warrant intrude into private matters relating to marriage, family, and sex, the court found that the right to privacy is not absolute \u201cand in some cases is subordinate to the state\u2019s fundamental right to enact laws which promote public health, welfare and safety, even though such laws may invade the offender\u2019s right of privacy.\u201d <em>Kathleen K, supra </em>at 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Thus, the <em>Kathleen K </em>court recognized that the right of privacy did not insulate a person from judicial inquiry into the person\u2019s sexual relations where one sexual partner intentionally engaged in conduct that causes or could cause serious physical injury to another. <em>Id. </em>The court therefore concluded that the serious and incurable nature of the defendant\u2019s ailment, coupled with the state\u2019s interest in preventing and controlling the spread of contagious and dangerous diseases, outweighed the defendant\u2019s constitutional right of privacy, and it rejected the argument that the right to privacy insulated a defendant who either negligently or deliberately infects someone with a venereal disease. <em>Id. </em>at 996-997. Accord <em>Doe v Roe, </em>218 Cal App 3d 1538, 1546-1547; 267 Cal Rptr 564 (1990) (the duty to disclose to his sexual partner the fact that the defendant had a sexually transmissible contagious disease arises out of a strong public policy to prevent the spread of serious and incurable diseases, and this duty, aimed at protecting the public health, safety, and welfare, was sufficient to overcome the defendant\u2019s privacy rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Other states have recognized similar tort causes of action and rejected the defendants\u2019 assertions that their privacy interests are superior to the risk of their spreading incurable \u201csocial\u201d diseases. See <em>Mussivand v David, </em>45 Ohio St 3d 314, 319; 544 NE2d 265 (1989) (there is no duty to disclose this private information to everyone); <em>Berner v Caldwell, </em>543 So 2d 686, 688-689 (Ala, 1989) (Ala Code 22-11-21 [c] made it a misdemeanor to knowingly transmit or do any act likely to transmit sexually transmitted diseases); <em>Maharam v Maharam, </em>123 AD2d 165; 510 NYS2d 104 (1986) (NY Pub Health Law 2307 makes it a misdemeanor if you have sex with another knowing that you have a sexually transmissible disease); <em>Long v Adams, </em>175 Ga App 538, 539-541; 333 SE2d 852 (1985); see also <em>Russell, supra </em>at 26 (finding that Illinois\u2019 criminal transmission of mv statute does not infringe on any alleged right of intimate association where the victim did not know that his sexual partner had AIDS).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In light of the foregoing, we find that despite the constitutional guarantees of liberty that include privacy considerations, defendant\u2019s right to privacy is not absolute, and the state\u2019s overwhelming need to protect its citizens from an incurable, sexually transmissible disease is a compelling state interest. Moreover, the requirement that infected individuals disclose their status to their potential partners before engaging in sexual penetration is narrowly defined so as to further that compelling interest. The Legislature has properly balanced the privacy rights of mv- and AIDS-infected persons against the general public\u2019s interest and need for protection from a fatal disease. <em>Hobbins, supra </em>at 205-206; <em>Gamberella, supra </em>at 603-604.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Most notably, the statute neither forbids rnvinfected persons from engaging in sexual penetration nor requires general public disclosure of the person\u2019s health status. To the contrary, MCL 333.5210; MSA 14.15(5210) simply acknowledges that an individual who contemplates sexual penetration with an mvinfected person is entitled to make an informed decision regarding potential health and safety concerns. Thus, while the statute intrudes somewhat on the privacy of an Hiv-infected individual, this intrusion is significantly outweighed by the devastating result that could ensue from unwitting participation in unprotected sexual penetration with the infected individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We therefore find that MCL 333.5210; MSA 14.15(5210) does not unconstitutionally deprive defendant of her right to privacy regarding the fact that she was mv infected, and that any right to privacy involving her mv infection is subordinate to her sexual partner\u2019s right to either avoid sexual penetration or to engage in sexual penetration only after being informed that defendant was mv infected.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">With respect to defendant\u2019s allegations that the statute violates her right against compelled speech, defendant is asserting a \u201cnegative First Amendment right\u201d or one of nonexpression. More specifically, defendant argues that MCL 333.5210; MSA 14.15(5210) violates her First Amendment rights because it compels her to disclose information about which she would otherwise wish to remain silent. The United States Supreme Court has clearly indicated that the state may sometimes curtail freedom of speech when necessary to advance a significant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>legitimate state interest. <em>Members of City Council of City of Los Angeles v Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 US 789, 804; 104 S Ct 2118; 80 L Ed 2d 772 (1984). While the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions exemplify that under certain circumstances a constitutional right to be free from compelled association or expression exists, the Court has yet to completely articulate the exdent of that right. <em>Falk v State Bar of Michigan, </em>418 Mich 270, 287; 342 NW2d 504 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">\u201cHowever, it is clear that the Supreme Court <em>does not </em>consider the strict scrutiny applied in other First Amendment cases to be appropriate in cases involving negative First Amendment rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">[I]n resolving [such] claims the Court has balanced the severity of the injury to the individual interest against the magnitude of the government interest sought to be served by the requirement or regulation. In this manner, the Court has decided whether the complained-of government action constitutes an impermissible First Amendment infringement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">\u201cWhenever a government requirement is challenged on the basis that it compels expression the initial inquiry must be whether the requirement does in fact infringe upon negative First Amendment interests and if so how seriously. The judicial task does not end here, however. It is also necessary to consider what government interests may be served by the requirement in question, and under what circumstances advancement of a government interest might outweigh the concomitant infringement of individual negative First Amendment interests.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 288, quoting Gaebler, <em>First Amendment Protection Against Government Compelled Eocpression and Association, </em>23 BC L R 995, 1014 (1982).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">When applying these tests to the instant negative First Amendment interest, MCL 333.5210; MSA 14.15(5210) obviously requires persons to expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>inform their sexual partners that they are HIV infected. Thus, the statute indeed infringes defendant\u2019s right against compelled expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Consequently, this Court must next determine the severity of the infringement of defendant\u2019s negative First Amendment interest, looking to \u201cthe intimacy of the connection between [defendant] and the compelled expression.\u201d <em>Falk, supra </em>at 289. Despite an individual's interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters, <em>Whalen v Roe, </em>429 US 589, 598-600; 97 S Ct 869; 51 L Ed 2d 64 (1977), \u201ca governmental intrusion into medical matters has been permitted after a finding that the societal interest in disclosure outweighs the individual\u2019s privacy interest.\u201d <em>Swickard v Wayne Co Medical Examiner, </em>184 Mich App 662, 667; 459 NW2d 92 (1990), aff\u2019d 438 Mich 536; 475 NW2d 304 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Here, requiring defendant to disclose that she has a sexually communicable disease involves a very personal matter and implicates issues regarding her sexual life; thus, the expression directly relates to defendant. \u201c[T]he more directly the compelled expression relates to the individual, the more important must be the government interest advanced to justify it.\u201d <em>Falk, supra </em>at 289. \u201c \u2018The question in each case must be whether the compelled participation in expression infringes unduly upon individual interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292, quoting Gaebler, <em>supra, </em>at 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">From the plain language of MCL 333.5210; MSA 14.15(5210), it is evident that the Legislature enacted the statute to stop the spread of aids and mv by punishing the carriers of these illnesses who, with their silence, spread an incurable disease. Considering the ease of transmitting AIDS and mv through sexual pene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>tration and the absence of any \u201ccure,\u201d the state\u2019s interest in protecting the public health, safety, and. general welfare of its citizenry becomes extremely significant. Although the statute may significantly infringe defendant\u2019s individual interests in remaining silent, the state\u2019s interest to compel her to disclose that she is mv infected before engaging in sexual penetration is undeniably overwhelming. <em>Falk, supra </em>at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We reiterate that MCL 333.5210; MSA 14.15(5210) does not prohibit defendant from engaging in sexual penetration but only requires her to inform her potential sexual partners, individually and privately, that she has this communicable disease.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The statute does not require or imply that she need publicize the fact that she is mv positive. It merely compels her to <em>privately </em>divulge this health status to those with whom she intends to engage in sexual penetration. Hence, we do not agree that the statute requires public disclosure; rather, it requires <em>private disclosure </em>only to those who are immediately in danger of exposure to the virus because they are contemplating the opportunity to engage in sexual penetration with defendant. See <em>Falk, supra </em>at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Accordingly, in weighing the infringement of defendant\u2019s negative First Amendment right against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>compelled speech by requiring private disclosure that she is mv infected against the magnitude of the state\u2019s interests in controlling the spread of this currently incurable disease, the state\u2019s interests outweigh defendant\u2019s right against compelled speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We therefore affirm the constitutionality of MCL 333.5210; MSA 14.15(5210) and defendant\u2019s convictions pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-12\"> Aids is defined as \u201ca syndrome that involves a compromised immune system that renders the [person] highly susceptible to\u201d communicable diseases. <em>Sanchez v Lagoudakis (After Remand), </em>458 Mich 704, 709; 581 NW2d 257 (1998).

There is no discrimination or criminalization in that context. Where, however, persons with aids and mv become the agents of their own incurable epidemics, we believe that the Legislature has the ability to protect the public health, welfare, and safety through legislation such as MCL 333.5210; MSA 14.15(5210).
