In <em>Glancy, </em>the Court recognized that under the separation of powers courts may not adopt arbitrary rules, such as the two-inch rule, to circumvent the Legislature\u2019s decision to abolish governmental immunity for the failure to keep municipal sidewalks in \u201creasonable repair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590-591. The Court also reaffirmed its decision in <em>Rule v Bay City, </em>387 Mich 281; 195 NW2d 849 (1972), abolishing the two-inch rule. <em>Glancy, supra </em>at 587-589. In <em>Rule, </em>the Court adopted Justice Adams\u2019 dissent in <em>Harris v Detroit, </em>367 Mich 526, 531, 535-536; 117 NW2d 32 (1962), in which he reasoned that courts may not determine \u201cactionable negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>gence\u201d by an arbitrary measurement, but, rather, must consider the circumstances of each case to determine whether a question of fact exists regarding the defendant\u2019s negligence. The half-inch rule of <em>Zielinski </em>is precisely such a rule of arbitrary measurement.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">We expressly overrule <em>Zielinski </em>because this Court\u2019s adoption of the half-inch rule constituted both the improper adoption of a bright-line rule to change a statute on the basis of policy arguments and improper interference with the trier of fact\u2019s evaluation of factual issues. <em>Glancy, supra. </em>Although the trial court cannot be faulted for following controlling precedent, <em>Hackett v Ferndale City Clerk, </em>1 Mich App 6, 11; 133 NW2d 221 (1965), it erred in granting summary disposition on the basis of the half-inch rule. Further, even if the half-inch rule was valid, a question of fact existed whether it applied in this case. Plaintiffs submitted two affidavits by a registered professional engineer indicating that the sidewalk defect was either ll/16ths or 15/16ths of an inch. The trial court should not have resolved this factual issue on a motion for summary disposition. <em>Spectrum Mfg Corp v Bank of Lansing, </em>118 Mich App 25, 32; 324 NW2d 523 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Reversed and remanded. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
