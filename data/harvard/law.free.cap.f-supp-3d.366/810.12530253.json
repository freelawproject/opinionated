FITZWATER, SENIOR JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On cross-motions for summary judgment in this ERISA\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   action, plaintiff Stephanie Taylor (\"Stephanie\") and defendant Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (\"MetLife\") disagree on the question whether MetLife wrongly denied Stephanie certain benefits under a portable life insurance policy on her husband's life. For the following reasons, the court grants MetLife's motion for summary judgment, denies Stephanie's motion for summary judgment, and dismisses this action by judgment filed today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Stephanie's late husband, Jonathan H. Taylor (\"Jonathan\"), was an employee of Cardinal Health, Inc. (\"Cardinal Health\") who participated in basic and optional life insurance benefits under Cardinal Health's Group Life Insurance Plan (the \"Plan\"), which is governed by ERISA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the terms of the Plan, Jonathan had $ 136,000 in Basic Employee Life Insurance and $ 271,000 in Supplemental Employee Life Insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a result of a disability, the last day Jonathan worked at Cardinal Health was October 20, 2015, and his employment with Cardinal Health ended on or about April 19, 2016. In accordance with the terms of the Plan, Jonathan's life insurance benefits were to end the date his employment ended. Under certain circumstances defined in the Plan, a plan participant has the option to port or to convert his life insurance coverage. Moreover, if the plan participant's employment ends as the result of a disability, he can apply for the continuation\n   of certain insurance. If the plan participant's claim for continuation is approved, his insurance coverage will be continued under the Plan, and no premium payment will be required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March 2016 Jonathan applied for the continuation of certain insurance while totally disabled. Before MetLife issued a decision on Jonathan's claim for continuation, Jonathan also elected to port his optional life insurance. According to the Plan and an April 2016 letter, because Jonathan's employment ended due to a reason other than retirement, he had the option of porting-or continuing under another group policy-his optional life insurance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a result of Jonathan's choice to port his optional life insurance, MetLife issued a new certificate of insurance for $ 273,000, effective June 2, 2016 (the \"Portable Policy\"). Jonathan and Stephanie paid monthly premiums on the Portable Policy from June to September 2016. In September 2016 MetLife informed Jonathan that he met the requirements for total disability under the Plan and that MetLife approved his claim for continuation of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , his basic and optional life insurance, at no cost to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jonathan died in October 2016. The next month, Stephanie submitted a life insurance claim form to MetLife on the Plan and the Portable Policy. MetLife approved and paid Stephanie's claim for benefits under the Plan, but denied her claim under the Portable Policy. Stated in monetary terms, MetLife approved and paid Stephanie's claim for $ 407,000 in basic and optional life insurance benefits due under the Plan ($ 136,000 in basic life plus $ 271,000 in optional life), but denied Stephanie's claim for $ 273,000 in optional life insurance benefits under the Portable Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   MetLife sent Stephanie a denial letter explaining that \"insured person[s] cannot have two benefits stemming from the same insurance coverage,\" and that she had a right to appeal MetLife's decision. D. App. 154.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2017 Stephanie's counsel sent an appeal letter to MetLife. Shortly thereafter, MetLife sent another denial letter, this time including notice that Stephanie's claim is governed by ERISA. Stephanie, through counsel, submitted an administrative appeal to MetLife in June 2017. She contended that she was entitled to $ 273,000 in optional life insurance benefits under the Portable Policy in addition to the benefits that MetLife paid because\n   MetLife sent Jonathan an \"Election of Portable Coverage\" form, Jonathan completed the form, MetLife issued the Portable Policy to Jonathan with an effective date in June 2016, and Jonathan and Stephanie paid premiums on the Portable Policy through September 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, MetLife upheld the denial of Stephanie's claim. Via letter to Stephanie's counsel, MetLife stated that, according to the Plan, \"Portable insurance ends when continuation of coverage due to disability is approved.\" D. App. 126. MetLife also stated that \"coverage is not a guarantee\" and \"premium payments are not a guarantee of coverage as premiums can be refunded,\" which, in this case, MetLife attempted to do.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Stephanie filed suit against MetLife in January 2018 in Texas state court, alleging that MetLife had wrongfully denied her claim and appeals. MetLife timely removed the action to this court. Both parties now move for summary judgment on Stephanie's ERISA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   MetLife is moving for summary judgment on a claim for which Stephanie will have the burden of proof at trial. Because Stephanie will have the burden of proof, MetLife's burden at the summary judgment stage is to point the court to the absence of evidence of any essential element of Stephanie's claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Here the Plan grants MetLife discretionary authority to determine eligibility for Plan benefits and to interpret the terms of the Plan, meaning that abuse of discretion is the proper standard of review. The Texas Legislature, however, enacted a statute that renders discretionary clauses unenforceable in several insurance contexts, including life and group life insurance policies, meaning that\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   is actually the proper standard of review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201701.62\">\n    Tex.

If You are so approved, all Ported insurance continued under this Portability subsection will end, including Life Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   D. App. 20. The undisputed summary judgment evidence shows that Jonathan was totally disabled on the date his employment ended, that he elected to port his optional life insurance, and that, after porting, he became approved for the continuation of his insurance. Accordingly, all of Jonathan's ported insurance ended as of the date of approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Moreover, under the section discussing eligibility for continuation, entitled \"EFFECT OF PREVIOUS ELECTION TO PORT COVERAGE,\" the Plan explicitly states that MetLife \"will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   pay insurance under both this [Plan] and the [ported] policy.\" D. App. 26 (emphasis added). These terms are not ambiguous. Recovery under both the Plan and another coverage that stems from the Plan is prohibited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The same result is mandated by the unambiguous terms of the Portable Policy. The Portable Policy provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   In the event that: (a) You are disabled; (b) as a result of Your being disabled,\n   You are approved under the Former Plan for continuation of Insurance; and (c) as a result of that approval, premiums are waived under the Former Plan; then the corresponding insurance under this certificate will end on the date You become approved for that continuation of Insurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   D. App. 49. \"Former Plan\" is defined as \"the policy of group insurance under which You were provided the option of Porting certain insurance provided under such plan.\" D. App. 45. Because the option of porting arose as a result of the insurance Jonathan had under the Plan, it is the \"Former Plan\" as the term is used in the Portable Policy. It is evident based on the language in the Portable Policy that it \"was intended to provide fallback coverage only if [Jonathan] was not granted a waiver for his premiums under [the Plan].\"\n   <em>\n    Metro.

She does not contest the validity of the Plan or Portable Policy, argue that their provisions are inapplicable, or cite any evidence that suggests that their provisions are inapplicable. Instead, she contends that \"fundamental insurance contract principles\" preclude summary judgment in MetLife's favor. P. Resp. Br. 10. In effect, Stephanie is asking the court to consider the fact that she and Jonathan paid premiums on the Portable Policy without regard to the existence of the Plan or the express terms of the Portable Policy. But her contention is unsupportable. The Portable Policy itself acknowledges that it does not exist in isolation. Without the Plan, Jonathan would have had no insurance to port. And without the written terms of the Plan and Portable Policy, there would be no way to know what the coverage was-or to know the parties' intent with respect to that coverage.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201102\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (\"Every employee benefit plan shall be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument.\").

In the instant case, MetLife mistakenly accepted at most a single premium that was billed prior to MetLife's determination of Jonathan's claim for continuation of insurance while disabled. Upon discovering that Stephanie had not surrendered the Portable Policy but that it had ended by its own terms and the terms of the Plan, MetLife attempted to refund the premiums paid by Jonathan and Stephanie. Neither MetLife's actions nor any other evidence presented indicates that MetLife intentionally relinquished any rights under the Plan or Portable Policy.

Stephanie's brief in support of her motion for summary judgment states that her husband \"accepted\" MetLife's offer for \"Conversion Life insurance benefits,\" and that it was the converted benefits that were paid and \"are not in dispute.\" P. Br. 5. As evidence, Stephanie cites a page in the record titled \"Notice of Group Life Insurance Conversion Privilege.\" But the notice expressly states: \"[t]his Notice is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    a conversion application or policy.\" P. App. 190 (emphasis added). Thus based on this evidence, no reasonable trier of fact could find that Jonathan\n    <em>\n     converted\n    </em>\n    his plan to a permanent individual life insurance policy.

Jonathan's elected optional life benefits were for three times his basic annual income, rounded to the next higher $ 1,000.
