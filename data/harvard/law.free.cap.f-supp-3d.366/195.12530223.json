The arrangement with GHP, TargetSmart alleges, was a scheme to induce TargetSmart to disclose confidential and proprietary information to benefit its competitor, the Defendant, Catalist, LLC (\"Catalist\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   TargetSmart brought this action against GHP and Catalist under both federal and state law for misappropriation of trade secrets, unjust enrichment, and breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Remaining before me following the filing of an amended complaint is the motion [Dkt. No. 38] by Catalist to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction, or in the alternative, to transfer the case to the District of Columbia, and to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Parties.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   TargetSmart Holdings, LLC is a technology and consulting company that specializes in providing campaigns, candidates, and organizations with data and software to expand their audience base. [Dkt. No. 36 at \u00b6 11]. It is a Delaware Limited Liability Company with its principle place of business in Washington, DC. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1]. TargetSmart Communications, LLC, is a wholly owned subsidiary of TargetSmart Holdings and is also a Delaware Limited Liability Company with its headquarters in Washington, DC. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   GHP is a Massachusetts Limited Liability Company headquartered in Boston. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Catalist, LLC is a Delaware Limited Liability Company headquartered in Washington, DC. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4]. Like TargetSmart, Catalist specializes in helping Democratic and progressive candidates reach wider audiences. [\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, Introduction Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 35].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This case can be said to have been brought pursuant to this court's federal question jurisdiction,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because TargetSmart's claim of violation of the Federal Defend Trade Secrets Act appears to predominate. [Dkt. No. 36 at \u00b6 82]. Since the state law claims arise out of the same set of factual circumstances, I may exercise supplemental jurisdiction to hear those claims, even in the absence of complete diversity of the parties.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As reflected in the operative pleading, the Second Amended Complaint, the facts are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Agreement Between GHP and Catalist\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 3, 2017, GHP entered into an agreement with Catalist to advise the company \"in connection with the potential acquisition of a specified, pre-identified target company.\" [Dkt. No. 36 at \u00b6 13; Dkt. No. 39-1, Exhibit 1, GHP Engagement Letter (hereinafter \"Letter Agreement\"), at 2]. The \"target company\" was TargetSmart, [Dkt. No. 36 at \u00b6 14], and the agreement provided that GHP would conduct due diligence of the target company as \"mutually determined to be appropriate.\" [Dkt. No. 39-1, Letter Agreement at 2, \u00a7 2(a) ]. It also required GHP to keep Catalist \"informed of the activities undertaken by GHP ... and all performances of Services required of GHP\" under the terms of the Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, \u00a7 6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Letter Agreement stated that GHP was not an employee or agent of Catalist,\n   and instead was working as an \"independent contractor.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, \u00a7 6]. TargetSmart alleges that Catalist entered into the agreement with GHP in order to acquire its confidential business information, [Dkt. No. 36 at \u00b6 18], and that it directed, ratified, or otherwise had a right to control GHP's interactions with TargetSmart. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    GHP Approaches TargetSmart\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In December 2017, GHP approached TargetSmart about a potential \"business opportunity.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21-24]. During the initial call on December 13, 2017, GHP represented to TargetSmart that it had been retained by individual political donors who wanted to combine TargetSmart and other companies to improve and streamline the data infrastructure available to Democratic and progressive candidates. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24]. As a result of the conversation, TargetSmart and GHP entered into a Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement (\"Mutual NDA\") to allow the parties to exchange non-public, confidential, and proprietary information. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 39-2, Exhibit 2, Form Nondisclosure Agreement from TargetSmart]. The Mutual NDA prevented both parties from using or disclosing confidential information without the other's prior written consent. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30]. In its amended motion to dismiss, Catalist provided this court with a copy of a form Nondisclosure agreement listing TargetSmart as one of the parties. [Dkt. No. 39-2, Exhibit 2]. However, I observe this copy of the NDA does not include the name or signature of the other party to the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At GHP's request, and in anticipation of a meeting on December 21, 2017 in Boston, TargetSmart sent GHP a memorandum which included confidential and proprietary information about its data, products, services, platforms, and software, as well as information about its finances and possible growth opportunities. [Dkt. No. 36 at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32]. The memorandum stated that the information was protected by the Mutual NDA. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the December 21st meeting, GHP again told TargetSmart that it represented wealthy donors, and indicated that its clients were interested in combining TargetSmart and Catalist, its competitor. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 33-35]. TargetSmart informed GHP that it would only consider a merger if the funders acquired both companies, if TargetSmart remained in control, and if the Catalist leadership team was not part of the management of the combined entity. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35]. GHP then indicated that it would like to proceed with the necessary due diligence for such a transaction and sought more information from TargetSmart about its book of business, its relationships with third parties, its vendor agreements, and its financial information. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On January 3, 2018, TargetSmart told GHP that it was uncomfortable with the request and asked for GHP to provide a rough approximation of the proposed purchase price for its \"political business\" in exchange for access to TargetSmart's financials. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37-39]. For its part, TargetSmart ultimately provided further information to GHP, including information about its financials. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Information Is Acquired by Third Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On February 8, 2018, TargetSmart learned that a writer with ties to the CEO of Catalist was contacting TargetSmart's employees and asking for information about its relationships with particular clients. [Dkt. No. 36 at \u00b6 41]. TargetSmart contacted GHP about the inquiries, and GHP represented that the inquires were not part of its due diligence and that \"they\n   would be 'shocked' if Catalist was behind the writer's inquiries.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44]. TargetSmart also contacted a member of the Board of Directors for Catalist, who promised that the inquiries would stop. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 21, 2018, TargetSmart discovered that a third-party source had told its client that \"Catalist was in the process of buying TargetSmart.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46]. It reported the leak to GHP, which reassured TargetSmart that it took the confidentiality of its clients very seriously. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    4.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Transaction Falls Through\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On March 14, 2018, TargetSmart met with GHP and Catalist in the District of Columbia to discuss the proposed transaction. [Dkt. No. 36 at \u00b6\u00b6 49-51]. During the meeting, Catalist indicated that it was not under an NDA and offered to leave the room while TargetSmart discussed the NDA with GHP. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51]. At that meeting, GHP told TargetSmart that it had not raised enough money to fund the acquisition, but also indicated that GHP had shared information about TargetSmart with at least two representatives of Catalist and that one of Catalist's funders had broken the Mutual NDA. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 52-56].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On April 10, 2018, TargetSmart, taking the position that GHP had violated the Mutual NDA, sought several assurances from GHP. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59]. GHP responded on April 13, denying that it had breached the NDA but admitting that it had shared information with two individuals at Catalist. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60]. GHP also attached a letter that purported to show that Catalist was under an NDA with TargetSmart. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   TargetSmart alleges that GHP altered the Mutual NDA by including signatures from individuals at Catalist, though Catalist itself never signed or received copies of the NDA. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61]. TargetSmart further alleges \"Catalist knew or should have known that TargetSmart did not request that Catalist or any of its representatives sign an NDA.\" [Dkt. No. 28; Dkt. No. 36 at \u00b6 61].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On April 13, 2018, TargetSmart contacted Catalist to assert that Catalist was using TargetSmart's proprietary information without consent. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65]. Catalist responded on April 19, 2018, certifying that it received proprietary information from GHP, that GHP never shared or distributed the information to other investors, and that it had destroyed the information. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67-71]. It did not make the same representations about its CEO. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68]. Despite this denial, TargetSmart alleges that Catalist continues to use TargetSmart's proprietary information to take clients away from it. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 79-81].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   TargetSmart filed suit against both GHP and Catalist on June 28, 2018. [Dkt. No. 1]. In its original complaint, TargetSmart alleged that the agreement between GHP and Catalist, and their subsequent negotiations with TargetSmart, violated the Federal Defend Trade Secrets Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201836\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . [Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6 67]. It also alleged that the Defendants had misappropriated trade secrets, violating both the Massachusetts Trade Secrets Act, the Massachusetts Unfair and Deceptive Practices Act, and Massachusetts common law, [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 77-91, 128-133], and were liable for damages for unjust enrichment under Massachusetts common law. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 115-121]. TargetSmart raised claims for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraudulent misrepresentation by GHP, [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 92-107, 122-27], and for tortious interference with contract by Catalist. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 108-114].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On September 11, 2018, GHP filed an Answer, [Dkt. No. 12], and Catalist filed its motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction for failure to state a claim and on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds. [Dkt. No. 15]. The same day, Catalist filed a motion asking this court to admit its counsel, Attorneys Adam S. Caldwell and Patrick J. Curran of Davis Wright Tremaine LLP,\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice.\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. No. 14]. On September 17, 2018, TargetSmart filed an opposition to the admission of Attorneys Caldwell and Curran\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   on the grounds that the law firm had a conflict of interest and could not represent Catalist consistent with its obligations under the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct. [Dkt. No. 19]. After a hearing, I rejected TargetSmart's opposition to the proposed Catalist counsel, and admitted Attorneys Caldwell and Curran\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   on December 10, 2018. [Dkt. No. 34].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Meanwhile, on October 2, 2018, TargetSmart filed its First Amended Complaint. [Dkt. No. 22]. Though the factual allegations in the two complaints were substantially identical, in the First Amended Complaint, TargetSmart dropped its claim for tortious interference of contract against Catalist and instead added a claim for defamation. [Dkt. No. 22 at \u00b6\u00b6 142-147].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On October 16, 2018, GHP again submitted an Answer to the First Amended Complaint, [Dkt. No. 26], and Catalist again submitted a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim and a memorandum in support thereof. [Dkt. No. 24; Dkt. No. 25]. On October 30, 2018, TargetSmart filed its opposition to the motion to dismiss. [Dkt. No. 29].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On October 25, 2018, a few days prior to filing its opposition, TargetSmart filed another motion to amend its complaint, in this instance to correct what was characterized as a scrivener's error. [Dkt. No. 28]. The motion indicated that Paragraph 61 of the First Amended Complaint mistakenly referred to GHP, instead of Catalist, and sought to correct that one word. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Catalist filed an opposition to this motion to amend on November 6, 2018. [Dkt. No. 31]. I granted the motion on December 10, 2018, [Dkt. No. 34], and TargetSmart filed the Second Amended Complaint on December 13, 2018. [Dkt. No. 36].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Catalist thereafter again responded with a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, to transfer, [Dkt. No. 38] on December 20, 2018. The memorandum in support of Catalist's suggested transfer of the case to the District of Columbia, but otherwise presented the same arguments regarding personal jurisdiction and failure to state a claim as the motion filed in October 2018. [\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 25; Dkt. No. 39]. On January 4, 2019, GHP filed its opposition to Catalist's motion to transfer, but took no position with regard to personal jurisdiction or failure to state a claim. [Dkt. No. 40]. TargetSmart submitted its opposition to the motion to dismiss on January 11, 2019. [Dkt. No. 41].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On January 23, 2019, I held a hearing on the present motion, during which GHP for the first time indicated that it would object to personal jurisdiction in the District of Columbia if the case were to be transferred there in its entirety. It had not raised this objection or argued that it would not be subject to the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia in its original opposition to the motion to transfer. [Dkt. No. 40]. TargetSmart indicated during the hearing that it would not oppose a transfer of the case to the District of Columbia if I found that personal jurisdiction over Catalist was unavailable in the District of Massachusetts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On January 30, 2019, GHP filed a supplemental opposition, with leave of the court, to Catalist's motion to dismiss. This\n   opposition indicated only that GHP \"did not waive its defenses under F.R.C.P. 12(b)(1), (2) and (6),\" but offered nothing by way of factual assertion or legal argument about personal jurisdiction in the District of Columbia. [Dkt. No. 46 at 2]. On February 4, 2019, Catalist filed a letter with the court indicating that its position had been adequately briefed in its original memorandum, and that it had nothing further to add. [Dkt. No. 48]. That same day, TargetSmart also filed a response to GHP's Supplemental Opposition, arguing that its case against GHP should not be transferred to the District of Columbia because such a transfer would further delay TargetSmart's ability to adjudicate the merits of its underlying claim. [Dkt. No. 49 at 2]. Instead, TargetSmart argued that some kind of coordination between the District of Massachusetts and the District of Columbia should be fashioned for separate cases against GHP (in Massachusetts) and Catalist (in the District of Columbia).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Specific Jurisdiction Over Catalist\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Catalist seeks to dismiss TargetSmart's complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction over it in the District of Massachusetts. [Dkt. No. 38].

Under the statute, there are two possible avenues through which this court may exercise jurisdiction over Catalist. First, since GHP's transactions with TargetSmart took place, at least in part, in the Commonwealth and gave rise to this cause of action, I may exercise jurisdiction over Catalist if GHP is an agent of Catalist under Massachusetts law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.G.L. c. 223A \u00a7 3(a). Second, I may exercise jurisdiction if Catalist's transactions with TargetSmart fall within the scope of the \"transacting any business\" prong of the long-arm statute.

GHP as an agent of Catalist\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As a preliminary matter, GHP has not objected to the court's exercise of personal jurisdiction, beyond a blanket denial to TargetSmart's assertion of jurisdiction. [Dkt. No. 26 at \u00b6 6]. Because it is headquartered in Boston, GHP certainly transacts business within the Commonwealth, [Dkt. No. 36 at \u00b6 3], and at least some part of TargetSmart's claims arise out of its transactions and meetings with GHP in the Commonwealth. [\n   <em>\n    See e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31-40]. As a result, jurisdiction over Catalist under the long-arm statute is proper if GHP was acting as Catalist's agent when transacting business with TargetSmart.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Under Massachusetts law, \"[a]n agency relationship is created when there is mutual consent, express or implied, that the agent is to act on behalf and for the benefit of the principal, and subject to the principal's control.\"\n   <em>\n    Theos &amp; Sons, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mack Trucks, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286823\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/431/736/\">\n    431 Mass. 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=729%20N.E.2d%201113\">\n    729 N.E.2d 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1119 (2000). \"The essence of the principal-agent relationship is the right of power or control by the alleged principal over the conduct of the alleged agent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth Aluminum Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Baldwin Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1135224\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/980/598/#p611\">\n    980 F.Supp. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 611 (D.

It is not enough for the\n   <em>\n    agent\n   </em>\n   to make representations to a third party in the absence of the principal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Here, there is no indication that the Letter Agreement between GHP and Catalyst that formed the basis of their contractual relationship empowered GHP to act as Catalyst's agent. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 39-1, Exhibit 1, GHP Engagement Letter (hereinafter \"Letter Agreement\") ]. Though the agreement stated that GHP would provide Catalist \"with financial advice and assistance\" and gave Catalist the authority to determine the objectives and strategies used to approach TargetSmart, [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2, \u00a7 2], the agreement specifically characterized GHP as an \"independent contractor\" and not an \"employee or agent\" of Catalist. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4, \u00a7 6]. It also does not subject GHP to control by Catalist, [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2, \u00a7 2 (\"In connection with this engagement, GHP will provide [Catalist] with financial advice and assistance ... including, as\n   <em>\n    mutually\n   </em>\n   determined to be appropriate ...\" (emphasis added) ) ], even if GHP is obligated to \"keep [Catalist] informed of the activities undertaken by GHP\" in connection with the Letter Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4, \u00a7 6]. The Letter Agreement, therefore, does not evidence an intent by either Catalist or GHP to form an agency relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   There is also no allegation in the complaint that\n   <em>\n    Catalist\n   </em>\n   made any representations to TargetSmart that GHP was acting as its agent. Indeed, though TargetSmart knew that GHP was acting to further the interests of another party, [Dkt. No. 36 at \u00b6 24], it did not discover that GHP was, in fact, working with Catalist until March, 2018, when the transaction fell through. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 52-53]. Thus, there is nothing in the complaint to indicate Catalist took any action to cause TargetSmart to believe that GHP was acting on its behalf. Consequently, I cannot imply an agency relationship between GHP and Catalist, and Catalist is not otherwise \"estopped from denying the agency is authorized.\"\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20N.E.2d%20155\">\n    436 N.E.2d at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Since the record before me does not support the proposition GHP is an agent of Catalist under Massachusetts law, GHP's contacts with Massachusetts cannot form the basis for the exercise of jurisdiction as to Catalist under the Massachusetts long-arm statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    b. \"Transacting any business in this Commonwealth\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Catalist may alternatively be held to have submitted to jurisdiction in this Court under the Long Arm Statute if the cause of action arose from its \"transacting business in this commonwealth.\" M.G.L. c. 223A \u00a7 3(a). \"Both federal and state courts have regularly construed the 'transacting any business' language of the statute in a generous manner.\"\n   <em>\n    United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    163 Pleasant Street Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524033\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/960/1080/#p1087\">\n    960 F.2d 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1087 (1st Cir. 1992).

It is difficult to see what actions of significance, if any, Catalist took in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Its meeting with TargetSmart and GHP took place in Washington, D.C., [Dkt. No. 36 at \u00b6 50], and any further contact with TargetSmart, as well as its alleged misuse of confidential information, appear also to have taken place in the District of Columbia, in light of the fact that it is headquartered there. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 65-74]. It is unclear where the reporters and clients who inquired about potential transactions were located, or where any alleged misrepresentations or defamatory statements by Catalist were made. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 41-48, 75-80]. Importantly, Catalist was not present at, or involved in GHP's initial meeting with TargetSmart in Boston in December 2017. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31-33].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The only contact that Catalist clearly had with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was its relationship with GHP. [Dkt. No. 39-1, Letter Agreement]. But it is difficult to say that this litigation is \"founded directly on\" that relationship and the Letter Agreement, even if they together provide context and explanation for how Catalist was able to access TargetSmart's trade secrets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weinberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275361\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/891/228/#p240\">\n    891 F.Supp.2d at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is especially true since GHP is not an agent of Catalist, and Catalist did not retain enough control over GHP for this contractual relationship to support Catalist's relationship to the forum state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The litigation is therefore not sufficiently related to Catalist's contacts with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, exercise of personal jurisdiction in this court is inappropriate on lack of relatedness grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   ii. Purposeful Availment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Even if the litigation was \"founded directly on\" the Letter Agreement and the relationship between Catalist and GHP, the record does not demonstrate that Catalist purposefully availed itself \"of the privilege of doing business\" in Massachusetts.\n   <em>\n    Jet Wine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11448034\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/298/1/#p7\">\n    298 F.3d at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The purposeful availment requirement ensures that the exercise of jurisdiction [by the forum] is essentially voluntary and foreseeable, ... and is not premised on a defendant's random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts\" with the forum state.\"\n   <em>\n    Knox\n   </em>\n   , 914F.3d at 691,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20364021\">\n    2019 WL 364021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4 (internal citations and quotations omitted). To satisfy this aspect of minimum contacts, the defendant's conduct must evidence \"something more\" than the \"regular flow [of commerce] or regular course of sales\" into the forum state.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 691, at *5. There must be some action taken by the defendant that is specifically directed to, or establishes a direct link with, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 693-94, at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   This condition also is not met here. Catalist certainly could reasonably foresee being hailed into court in Boston to defend against litigation with GHP over a breach of the Letter Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 39-1, Letter Agreement]. However, Catalist's relationship with TargetSmart was centered in the District of\n   Columbia. Even though it voluntarily engaged GHP, Catalist did not engage in a \"voluntary act\" in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts from which it was liable to suit\n   <em>\n    by TargetSmart\n   </em>\n   in Massachusetts; nor did its conduct\n   <em>\n    vis a viv\n   </em>\n   TargetSmart establish a direct link with Massachusetts. This is especially true since GHP was not Catalist's agent and GHP was not involved in a joint venture, partnership, or similar relationship with Catalist.\n   <em>\n    See supra.\n   </em>\n   It served only as an independent advisor and consultant. [Dkt. No. 39-1, Letter Agreement at 4, \u00a7 6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   TargetSmart does not allege any other action that would directly tie Catalist to Massachusetts, and instead rests its argument entirely on the fact that Catalist hired GHP as an agent. [Dkt. No. 29 at 10]. As I have already rejected this argument, I do not see how else Catalist has purposefully availed itself of the laws of Massachusetts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   iii. Reasonableness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Finally, the First Circuit directs me to consider the Gestalt factors, which include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   (1) the defendant's burden of appearing, (2) the forum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute, (3) the plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, (4) the judicial system's interest in obtaining the most effective resolution of the controversy, and (5) the common interests of all sovereigns in promoting substantive social policies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    Foster-Miller, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7409614\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/46/138/#p144\">\n    46 F.3d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   I consider these factors briefly. First, Catalist is based in Washington, D.C., and though GHP is headquartered in Boston, allowing the case to go forward in Boston as opposed to the District of Columbia places a greater burden on Catalist and similarly on TargetSmart, which seems indifferent to this burden, having initially chosen the District of Massachusetts as the forum for resolving this dispute. [Dkt. No. 36 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4; Dkt. No. 39 at 16-17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Second, Massachusetts has an interest in adjudicating disputes relating to its citizens, [Dkt. No. 36 at \u00b6 3], and arising under its laws. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 100-106, 136-141]. It does not, however, necessarily have a strong interest in adjudicating disputes between foreign parties, [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2, 4]. Nor does its interest in adjudicating disputes relating to its citizens outweigh the fact that the majority of the events of significance underlying the dispute took place in the District of Columbia and outside the borders of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. [\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22 at \u00b6\u00b6 41-80]. For the same reason, the fifth factor counsels against exercising personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts, especially since Massachusetts law would not apply to TargetSmart's pendent state-law claims under the Commonwealth's own choice of law analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The third and fourth factors both weigh in favor of having the claims against GHP and the claims against Catalist heard together. Both sets of claims arise out of the same factual circumstances and rest on the same allegations. However, these factors do not suggest that Boston is a more appropriate place to hear the case than Washington, D.C., and instead counsel in favor of transferring the dispute to the District of Columbia, if personal jurisdiction against Catalist does not otherwise lie in Massachusetts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    c. Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The three factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Foster-Miller, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7409614\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/46/138/#p144\">\n    46 F.3d 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 1995), all indicate that the exercise of personal jurisdiction as to Catalist by this court would be improper under the Due Process Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Lacking personal jurisdiction over the entire dispute, but bearing in mind the need for judicial efficiency and seeking the prompt resolution of the matter in its entirety, I turn to consider the question whether to transfer the case to the District of Columbia, rather than dismiss it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

[Dkt. No. 41 at 12-13]. There, TargetSmart argues that, if there is ambiguity regarding the relationship between Catalist and GHP, \"the Court should ... allow TargetSmart to take limited jurisdictional discovery.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].

I note that, at this stage, TargetSmart says it wants to move forward to the merits of the case as soon as possible, [Dkt.

No. 36 at \u00b6 6], and its conduct largely took place in Boston. Consequently, they have argued, the center of gravity for the case is in the District of Massachusetts, meaning the case is properly before this court. However, TargetSmart has also indicated that it would consent to a transfer if I found that I lacked jurisdiction to hear its claims against Catalist, as I have done here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In seeking a transfer, Catalist specifically invokes my authority under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which presumes that I have jurisdiction to hear the case, but nevertheless allows me to transfer the case to another district \"[f]or the convenience of the parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

No. 41 at 13-15].\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   GHP contends that it would be inconvenienced by a transfer, since it is headquartered in Boston, many of the relevant documents and materials are physically present in the District of Massachusetts. [Dkt. No. 40 at 3]. GHP also adds that Massachusetts law would govern pendent state law claims and, consequently, should be heard in Massachusetts. GHP argues in its supplemental opposition that this court, because of its familiarity with the laws of the Commonwealth, is \"far better suited to preside over TargetSmart's claims brought specifically under Massachusetts law\" than the courts of the District of Columbia. [Dkt. No. 46 at 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   These arguments are unpersuasive. While the District of Massachusetts may be marginally more convenient for GHP, wholesale transfer of the entire matter would hardly inconvenience it. GHP may have relevant documents at its headquarters in Boston, rather than in the District of Columbia, but it is unclear that a transfer would materially raise the cost of production. [Dkt. No. 40 at 3]. With the exception of the former President of Catalist, Laura Quinn, [Dkt. No. 41 at 14], none of the parties identify witnesses who may be in one city or another, or make any allegations regarding convenience or cost to the witnesses or the availability of process to\n   compel their presence in a court in the District of Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Instead, opposition to transfer seems to center on the background presumption in favor of a plaintiff's choice of forum imposed by section 1404(a). However, that presumption does not apply with as great a force here, because TargetSmart is not a Massachusetts citizen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sinochem Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553796\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/422/#p425\">\n    549 U.S. at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553796\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/422/#p425\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Most fundamentally, concern about judicial efficiency powerfully supports transfer in order for the entire case to be adjudicated in one proceeding in a single forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   GHP's opposition based on this court's familiarity with the laws of Massachusetts is essentially a make-weight. While this circumstance may caution against transfer - for example, if the case arises out of some particularly complex or intricate area of state law or state regulatory structure - it is not, in and of itself, a reason to deny transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Island View Residential Treatment Center, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bluecross Blueshield of Mass., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204589335\">\n    2007 WL 4589335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *8 (D.

I decline to address that portion in Catalist's motion that seeks dismissal on grounds of failure to state a claim, a matter which should be addressed, if necessary, in further proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which is - unlike this court - authorized to exercise jurisdiction over all parties brought into this litigation by TargetSmart's operative complaint.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    The Letter Agreement between GHP and Catalist forms the basis of the relationship between these two parties.

Since TargetSmart has not alleged that Catalist's violations of the two statutes took place in Massachusetts, Massachusetts statutory law does not appear to apply.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    Under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a), a district court may exercise \"supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within [the district court's] original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).

It has since restated this position in its response to GHP's supplemental opposition to transfer. [Dkt. No. 49]. In that filing, TargetSmart stated that its position \"was and continues to be that this case should move forward to the merits as soon as possible,\" even if it means that its claims against GHP and Catalist proceed separately in two different fora. [Dkt. No. 49 at 2]. TargetSmart's current opposition to the transfer of its claims against GHP rests on GHP's representation that it intends to challenge the personal jurisdiction in the District of Columbia, and TargetSmart's desire to avoid further motion to dismiss practice on the question of jurisdiction. As is apparent, I do not find GHP's undeveloped contention that the District of Columbia would lack personal jurisdiction over it to be colorable. Thus, TargetSmart's anxious apprehensions about further meaningful motion to dismiss practice in the District of Columbia seem less than truly threatening to the orderly travel of the entire case to conclusion in that District.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
