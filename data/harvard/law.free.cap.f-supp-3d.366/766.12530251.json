Many, if not most, recreational and aesthetic uses of national forests are rooted in personal lifestyles and traditions. The Forest Service's attempt to position these two categories as mutually exclusive is unconvincing. The Forest Service's second argument, that NEPA's zone of interests does not encompass recreational activities it has deemed to have a negative impact on the environment, would inappropriately preempt challenges to agency action affecting interests recognized by the Supreme Court. Notably, the Forest Service does not cite to any case in which a court has adopted such a view.

The Forest Service was careful to caution, however, that the total number of Forest Service violations issued during a dog-deer hunting season were not exclusively issued to dog-deer hunters, and that it lacked a method of accurately identifying the type of KNF user (dog-deer or non-dog-deer) that committed each violation because the violation notices did not as a matter of course include such information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   It further warned that \"[a]lthough data suggests that violations were influenced by the additional presence of dog-deer hunters in the area, [LDWF] citations and warnings that specifically differentiate dog-deer hunters from other Forest users during the KNF dog-deer season is unavailable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notwithstanding these limitations, the Forest Service concluded that as a result of a dog-deer hunting ban, \"[t]raffic-related violations and confrontations with other recreationists and adjacent landowners would be expected to decrease during the time of year that dog-deer hunting typically occurs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Forest Service's decision to enact the ban was based on inaccurate or incomplete data, and they specifically challenge the Forest Service's violations data.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   They argue that most of the violations are incident reports, which are merely unconfirmed alleged reported incidents that do not identify a specific person. Plaintiffs further assert that none of the actual \"citations,\" as opposed to incident reports, are specifically attributable to dog-deer hunters. Finally, they note that some of the violations are for issues not clearly related to deer-dog hunting, such as broken taillights or nonoperational turn signals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   These attempts to call into question the overall validity of the Forest Service's violations data are unpersuasive. The dog-deer hunting at issue in this case, which by its very nature involves the dog-deer hunters and their dogs constantly changing locations, occurred around approximately 369,000 acres in KNF.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is little surprise that when Forest Service agents responded to complaints from KNF users or nearby landowners about dog-deer hunters, often times those dog-deer hunters and their dogs had already left the area. Given this backdrop, it is difficult to understand what Forest Service agents were expected to do other than document the complaints in the form of incident reports. The fact that many of these incident reports will inevitably be unconfirmed allegations that do not name specific persons may limit, but does not destroy, their probative value. The substantial amount of these incident reports, many of which contain similar complaints, further lend them credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Similarly unavailing is Plaintiffs' position that the incident reports largely document allegations not related to dog-deer hunting, such as minor traffic violations. The Forest Service's analysis of violations data did not suggest that\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   dog-deer hunting violations occurred during dog-deer hunting season. The analysis indicated that when the average daily violations for the total hunting seasons is used as a baseline, then roughly twice as many daily average violations are issued during dog-deer hunting seasons. Thus, one would expect that some of the violations issued during the dog-deer hunting seasons would be \"ordinary,\" non-dog-deer hunting violations in line with the overall hunting seasons violations baseline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Furthermore, a significant number of the violations issued during the dog-deer hunting seasons appear to be related to dog-deer hunting. A review of the 2009\n   incident reports,\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   for example, reveals that many of them remark that they are related to dog-deer hunting or describe deer-dog hunting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other 2009 incident reports document complaints of behavior generally associated with dog-deer hunting, such as standing on a public road with a firearm while dogs are running or running dogs too close to residential areas or through private property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Forest Service's violations data and its analysis of that data was subject to limitations, which the Forest Service acknowledged, as a whole the violations data is both reliable and relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   An analysis of violations issued by the Forest Service over several years revealed that on average more than twice as many violations were issued daily during the relatively brief dog-deer hunting seasons compared to the general deer hunting seasons. These figures were corroborated in part by LDWF citations and warnings data. Forest Service Investigative Reports from the 2006 to 2010 dog-deer seasons further supplemented the violations data. As discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , testimony from Forest Service agents in the Errata provided further context for the significant increase in violations issued during dog-deer hunting seasons. These convergent threads of data together constitute substantial evidence supporting the Forest Service's tempered conclusion that as a result of the ban on dog-deer hunting \"[t]raffic-related violations and confrontations with other recreationists and adjacent landowners would be expected to decrease during the time of year that dog-deer hunting typically occurs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   2. The Forest Service's Decision is not Arbitrary or Capricious\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As stated\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , there is a presumption that the agency's decision is valid, and Plaintiffs have the burden to prove the decision is arbitrary, capricious or not in accordance with the law.

In support of this argument, they cite a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia remanded a rule issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (\"Safety Administration\") that banned the storage of flammable-gas fuel cell cartridges in the checked baggage of airline passengers and crew but allowed medicinal and toilet articles containing flammable gas to be so stored.\n   <em>\n    Lilliputian Sys.

Cir. 2014). In determining that the Safety Administration needed to provide further explanation, the D.C. Circuit explained that \"[a]s a general matter, an agency cannot treat similarly situated entities differently unless it 'support[s] th[e] disparate treatment with a reasoned explanation and substantial evidence in the record.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323978,3897581\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/1309/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323978,3897581\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/1309/\">\n    at 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs' principal argument is that the dog-deer hunting ban is arbitrary and capricious because the Forest Service permits dog-deer hunting in other similarly situated Region 8 National Forests. Specifically, they note that dog-deer hunting is allowed in National Forests in Mississippi and Arkansas. While they acknowledge that dog-deer hunting is not allowed in seven of the fifteen Region 8 National Forests, they argue that these bans are the result of state laws against dog-deer hunting. Plaintiffs emphasize that KNF is the only Region 8 National Forest in which dog-deer hunting is permitted by the state government but banned by the Forest Service, and they conclude that the Forest Service has failed to provide a reasoned explanation for this disparate treatment of similarly situated entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs do not cite any authority stating that the Forest Service is required to compare the management plans of every National Forest in the same region when creating an EA, or that it must explicitly justify any differences between such management plans every time a new amendment is proposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   The case they repeatedly cite in support of their argument,\n   <em>\n    Lilliputian Systems Inc.\n   </em>\n   , is easily distinguishable from the present matter. In\n   <em>\n    Lilliputian Systems Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit took issue with the disparate treatment of extremely similar products, flammable gas cartridges and medicinal and toilet articles containing flammable gas, all of which contain the same class of hazardous materials, in the narrow context of airline safety. While KNF and the National Forests in Mississippi and Arkansas may reside in the same bureaucratic subcategory, they\n   each possess unique habitats and wildlife, geographical characteristics, access and roadways, neighboring lands, and available recreational activities. They cannot be so effortlessly determined to be similarly situated as flammable gas cartridges and medicinal and toilet articles containing flammable gas may be in the context of airline safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Forest Service carefully analyzed KNF in evaluating the propriety of the ban. Among other factors, the Forest Service considered features unique to KNF such as documented conflicts from KNF's neighboring landowners dating back to the 1990s, the road system in KNF and how dog-hunting related to KNF's access roads and traffic levels, and the make-up of communities surrounding KNF and the impact the prohibition would have on those economies and cultures. Plaintiffs do not explain how exactly the National Forests in Mississippi and Arkansas share these characteristics to such a degree that they would be considered similarly situated, other than mentioning in passing that both KNF and the National Forest in Mississippi are segmented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs further argue that the Forest Service failed to explain why dog-deer hunting should be treated differently than other types of hunting with dogs (ex. squirrel, game bird, raccoon, and rabbit). The Forest Service responds that it did distinguish dog-deer hunting from other types of dog hunting in the 2012 EA, which states that: \"Dog hunting for other game species, which typically does not require large contiguous blocks of land, and involves only one or two dogs or hunters, was not considered to be a significant issue and was therefore not addressed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   It further explains that the ban was pursued as a result of complaints about dog-deer hunters,\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   not other types of hunting with dogs. The Forest Service has sufficiently explained why dog-deer hunting was treated differently than other types of hunting with dogs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Thus, the Court finds that the Forest Service appropriately distinguished dog-deer hunting in KNF from other types of dog hunting and dog-deer hunting in other National Forests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    The Forest Service Adequately Considered the Social and Cultural Impact of the Dog-Deer Hunting Ban\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that the 2012 Decision Notice was arbitrary and capricious because it did not consider an important aspect of the problem, namely the social and cultural impact of the ban. The 2012 Decision Notice provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   The selected alternative will not preserve the tradition and culture of dog-deer hunting. It will however position the agency to respond to the greater demands of the non-hunting public while preserving still-hunting opportunities, and the opportunity to hunt other types of game with dogs. Due to still hunters requiring less land area, this alternative may allow the KNF to absorb an additional influx of still hunters without adding additional conflict or displacement to the non-hunting public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The 2012 EA, which formed the basis for the 2012 Decision Notice, includes an in-depth analysis of the social and cultural impacts of the ban.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Forest Service is not tasked with evaluating the social and cultural impact of the ban\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   as it affects dog-deer hunters, but as it affects all KNF users. In the 2012 EA, the Forest Service explained that only between 660 (0.0146%) and 983 (0.0217%) of Louisianans hunted deer with dogs on KNF during the 2009-2010 season.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   Far from not considering the social and cultural impact of the ban, the Forest Service concluded that the vast majority of people who utilize KNF would benefit socially and culturally from the ban. Thus, the Forest Service appropriately considered the social and cultural impact of the dog-deer hunting ban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the Forest Service's decision to implement the dog-deer hunting ban was neither arbitrary nor capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   3. The Forest Service's 2012 FONSI is not Arbitrary and Capricious, Contrary to Law, or Otherwise not in Accordance with Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs challenge the 2012 FONSI. \"The threshold determination of whether the effect of the proposed action is sufficiently 'significant' to necessitate the production of an [environmental impact statement ('EIS') ] is made by the preparation of an Environmental Assessment ('EA').\"\n   <em>\n    Spiller v.

Thus, they reason, if the Forest Service finds that a ban is justified, it necessarily follows that the ban will have a significant environmental impact. Clearly, Congress did not intend for an EA finding an issue significant enough to justify agency action to automatically mandate the issuance of an EIS or it would not have passed the provisions allowing a FONSI. There is no inherent contradiction in the Forest Service finding that dog-deer hunting causes issues sufficiently significant to merit a ban while also finding that the\n   <em>\n    overall\n   </em>\n   environmental impact of that ban is not significant enough to require the creation of an EIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiffs then argue that in addressing the human environment factor the Forest Service did not afford appropriate weight to the roughly thousand comments insisting that the ban would have a significant impact on the human environment.

Some of the incident reports include notations that they were \"related to deer dog hunting.\" In Plaintiffs' view, the Forest Service could have instructed Forest Service agents to make such notations on all violation notices so that there would be no uncertainty about whether the two-fold increase in violations during the dog-deer hunting seasons was caused predominantly by dog-deer hunters. Plaintiffs conclude that \"it appears that the missing data is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    unavailable but rather that the Forest Service has chosen not to collect it.\" Mot. for Summ. J. (Doc. 27-1) at 19. While the benefit of hindsight has revealed that the collection of such data would have provided great clarity as to the driving force behind the increase in violations during dog-deer hunting seasons, the Forest Service is obviously unable to retroactively remedy this lack of information. Again, the fact that the Forest Service did not collect perfectly complete data is not \"fatal,\" as Plaintiffs posit - only substantial evidence is required.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201502.22\">\n     40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"50\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    2012 EA (G001-EA-2012-02-13.pdf) at 26.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"51\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201502.22\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201502.22\">\n     at 28\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"52\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    The cases cited by Plaintiffs in this section are inapposite to the present case.\n    <em>\n     Friends of Boundary Waters Wilderness v.
