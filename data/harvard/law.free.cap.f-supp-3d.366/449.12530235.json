(Dkt. 1). Presently before the Court is Defendant's motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 42). For the following reasons, Defendant's motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Employment as an Asbestos Handler\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff began his employment with Defendant as an asbestos handler in February\n   2015. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 21;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 44-45, 50).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   An asbestos handler removes asbestos and performs limited interior demolition, worksite cleaning, \"work area plasticizing,\" water filtration procedures, and \"hot work\" on abatement projects. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 22;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 52-53, 60-63). These responsibilities generally require the use of both hands. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 23;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   , e.g., Dkt. 43-1 at 55-57, 59, 61-62). For example, work area plasticization requires both hands to hang plastic sheets securing the area, and an asbestos handler's demolition duties entail the operation of power drills and the use of sledgehammers. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 26-28;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 56-57, 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff was primarily charged with using a \"power-washer\" machine, which is a device that \"sprays high pressure water from a hose\" and requires both hands to operate. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 33, 43;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 64-65; Dkt. 44 at \u00b6 22). One hand must continuously grip the trigger on the machine's \"wand\" to release the flow of water, while the other hand maneuvers the wand to direct the water at the desired target. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 64-65; Dkt. 44 at \u00b6 22). Plaintiff's other duties included the removal of asbestos, lead, mercury, batteries, certain light fixtures, and different types of chemicals. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 35;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 53-56). When removing mercury, Plaintiff was at times required to scale ladders and scaffolding and use both his hands to unscrew lamps, cut cables, and apply sealant. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 36;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 53-56). Plaintiff used the power-washer to spray pressurized water at the worksite asbestos, and then placed the asbestos into disposal bags. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 38;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 57-59). Asbestos handlers also changed the hoses and filters on the water treatment system that filtered water at the worksite, which required the use of both hands as well. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 39;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 60-61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Additionally, asbestos handlers were assigned \"hot work,\" which entails using a \"flaming gas pressurized tool to cut though\" train rails and requires the operator to use both hands in doing so. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 41;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 61-62; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 33). After hot work is completed, another employee is required to watch the gas tool for about one hour to make sure it does not reignite, but this secondary task, denoted as \"fire watching,\" is \"only required when someone performed hot work\" to begin with. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 42;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 44 at \u00b6 31; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 33;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     The Onset of Plaintiff's Disability\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Between February 2015 and August 2015, Plaintiff had full use of each of his arms and hands and could perform all the essential functions of an asbestos handler. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 44;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 66). Starting in August 2015, Plaintiff began to experience pain in his right arm, which he attributed to his use of the power-washer. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 45-46;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 20). Plaintiff subsequently opened a Workers'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Compensation claim and was examined by a medical physician before being placed on \"restricted duty.\" (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 46-48;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 21; Dkt. 45-1 at 6). At this point, Plaintiff was directed not to use his right arm or right hand. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 46-48;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45-1 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a result of Plaintiff's limited use of his extremities, he was unable to perform certain essential functions of an asbestos handler. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 49;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 45-49, 97-99; Dkt. 44 at \u00b6 14; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 57). Initially, Defendant offered Plaintiff \"light duty tasks\" to permit his continued employment despite these physical limitations. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 50;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 44 at \u00b6\u00b6 26-28; Dkt. 45 \u00b6\u00b6 25, 30). Because Defendant's employees had difficulty finding applicable light duty tasks to assign Plaintiff, Plaintiff was permitted to watch safety trainings and clean an on-site office trailer, which were not tasks assigned to asbestos handlers. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 51;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 44 at \u00b6 26; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 31, 2015, a physician examined Plaintiff for a second time. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 52;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 24). The physician concluded that Plaintiff's restrictions had not changed, and Plaintiff was advised to refrain from using his right hand and right arm; limitations that continued to undermine his ability to perform all essential functions of an asbestos handler. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 52-53;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 45-49, 97-99; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 24; Dkt. 45-1 at 9). On September 18, 2015, Plaintiff supplied a doctor's note from the New York Physical Medicine Center, LLC, which dictated that Plaintiff restrict the use of his upper right extremities for eight weeks. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 57; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 27; Dkt. 45-1 at 12). On September 22, 2015, Plaintiff was diagnosed with mild carpal tunnel syndrome in his left side and moderate carpal tunnel syndrome in his right side. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 124;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 152). Plaintiff subsequently received another doctor's note from the same facility, dated September 23, 2015, which directed Plaintiff to limit any \"gripping, grasping or lifting [of] more than 10 pounds with his right hand.\" (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 57; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 28; Dkt. 45-1 at 14). On October 9, 2015, Plaintiff submitted a third doctor's note, indicating that Plaintiff should avoid \"repetitive gripping and grasping\" and \"lifting more than 15 pounds\" with his upper right extremities for ten weeks. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 59; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 29; Dkt. 45-1 at 16). On November 20, 2015, Plaintiff secured a fourth doctor's note, indicating that Plaintiff should \"avoid writing paperwork, avoid repetitive gripping and grasping,\" and avoid lifting \"more than 10 pounds\" with his upper right extremities for about 12 weeks. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 61;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 123).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's New Job Assignments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In light of Plaintiff's restrictions, Defendant created \"new light duty assignments for Plaintiff\" between September and October of 2015 to keep him employed, which included the decontamination of tools utilized at the worksite. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 63-64;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 68-69; Dkt. 44 at \u00b6\u00b6 26-28). When Plaintiff \"complained\" that this task \"required him to use his right hand,\" Defendant assigned other light duty tasks to Plaintiff, which included \"sweeping and picking up garbage, picking up loose nails with a magnetic broom, fire watching, tracking the entry and exit time of vehicles and their license plates as they exited and entered the [worksite], inspecting and measuring fences and monitoring the water treatment system for leaks.\" (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 65;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 71, 84, 86, 88-90; Dkt. 44 at \u00b6 28; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Asbestos handlers were not generally responsible for performing such tasks, with the exception of fire watching. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 64, 66-67;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 44 at \u00b6 28;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 30). Asbestos handlers performed fire watching duties after \"hot work\" on a \"boiler casing\" because \"disposing of the boiler was part of the asbestos removal process,\" but this task was conducted about 200 feet above the worksite and required the worker to climb ladders and scaffolding. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 67-68;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 44 at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 33). Since Plaintiff was unable to safely scale ladders and scaffolding to reach these elevated positions, Plaintiff was assigned to \"fire watch\" after hot work was performed on train rails on the ground; an assignment not usually tasked to asbestos handlers because it is not related to asbestos abatement. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 68-69;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 44 at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Subsequently, Plaintiff complained that the task of logging vehicular license plates and the entry and exit times of vehicles coming and going from the worksite was \"unsafe\" and stated that he would no longer perform this task. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 71;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 94; Dkt. 44 at \u00b6\u00b6 33-34; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35). Plaintiff also became \"dissatisfied\" with the task of inspecting and measuring fences because the measuring tool, which was \"similar to a measuring tape connected to a wheel,... required him to use his right hand.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 72-74;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 89-91; Dkt. 44 at \u00b6 35; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 35). On November 2, 2015, Plaintiff was tasked with monitoring the water treatment system at the worksite for leaks, which was also not a task required of asbestos handlers. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 75-76;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 85, 88-89, 91; Dkt. 44 at \u00b6 36; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 37). The water treatment system is located outdoors, and, as the seasonal temperature began to drop, the system would often freeze, requiring that the hoses, pumps, and filters be disconnected to prevent the system from bursting. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 76-77;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 85, 88-89, 91; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As a result of his new light duty assignments, Plaintiff's schedule was altered so that he was to report to work at 8:00 A.M., instead of 7:00 A.M., and would sometimes depart early when no more light duty tasks needed to be completed. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 78;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 87; Dkt. 44 at \u00b6 37; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 38). Plaintiff's lunch hour was also altered in order for him to complete his fire watching duties, requiring him to monitor the relevant tools after \"hot work\" was completed while the other workers had their lunch. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 80;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 87 Dkt. 44 at \u00b6 39; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Work Absences and Further Medical Complications\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant requires its employees to contact their direct supervisors before their shift starts if they plan to be absent. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 81;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 41). Although Plaintiff called his supervisor, Jeffrey Beckingham (\"Beckingham\") on October 21, 2015, to inform him that he would be absent on October 21st, Plaintiff failed to indicate that he would also be absent on October 22nd and October 23rd as well. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 82-84;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 42;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45-1 at 18-20). As a result of Plaintiff's failure to comply with Defendant's employee protocols, he was issued a written warning on October 26, 2015. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 86;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 43). On October 27, 2015, Plaintiff was again absent from work and again failed to notify his supervisor of this absence prior to the start of his shift; although he did call the Site-Safety Officer, Raymond Cox (\"Cox\"), later that day to inform Cox that he was in the hospital with \"high blood pressure.\" (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 88;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 44). Plaintiff was not disciplined for this action. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 89;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On October 28, 2015, Plaintiff called \"911\" while at work logging entry and exit\n   times for vehicles and was transported to Rochester General Hospital. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 91;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 86; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 46). Plaintiff testified that he called 911 on this occasion because he had been working \"under water and it was snowing,\" and that he lost consciousness when his \"pressure went up.\" (Dkt, 43-1 at 94). When Plaintiff returned to work on November 2, 2015, he had a doctor's note dated October 29, 2015, from Rochester General Hospital, indicating that he could \"participate in all duties\"-despite the conflicting doctor's note from New York Physical Medicine Center, LLC, dated October 9, 2015, which limited Plaintiff's physical capabilities for ten weeks. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 93-94;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 48; Dkt. 45-1 at 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the time, Cox was not aware why Plaintiff had called the ambulance or whether the physician who provided Plaintiff with the November 2, 2015, doctor's note was aware of Plaintiff's physical condition and his work environment. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 95-96;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 48). As a result, Defendant suspended Plaintiff from work until Cox could consult with Defendant's Director of Health and Safety, Gary Thibodeaux (\"Thibodeaux\"), to reconcile the conflicting medical notes. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 97;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 49). During his suspension, Plaintiff confirmed that \"the previous restrictions were still in place,\" and that the \"911\" call was unrelated to his right-hand limitations. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 98;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 50). After receiving this information, on November 5, 2015, Cox told Plaintiff that he could return to work on November 9, 2015, and Plaintiff did, in fact, report to work that day to continue his light duty tasks. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 99-100;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 50-51; Dkt. 45-1 at 28). However, by December 2015, Cox and Beckingham were experiencing some difficulty in finding light duty tasks to assign Plaintiff, at least in part because the water treatment system had been dissembled to prevent the system from freezing in the cold weather, and the \"hot work\" performed on the train rails had been completed. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 101-03;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 44 at \u00b6 41; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 51;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt 45 at \u00b6 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's December 21, 2015 Meeting\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On December 14, 2015, Plaintiff walked by a co-worker and told him that he had \"the smile of Judas,\" noting that \"Judas was the man who sold Jesus to the Romans for money,\" and further stated that he had a \"surprise\" for everyone. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 104;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 95-96; Dkt. 44 at \u00b6 42; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 52). Plaintiff testified that he made these statements to his co-worker because he believed that what the co-worker had \"said to the Human Rights Division ... was a lie and he knows it was a lie.\" (Dkt. 43-1 at 95-96). Although Plaintiff references a declaration of sorts, the details of exactly what the co-worker previously stated and to what agency he submitted any such statements is not clear from Plaintiff's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After Plaintiff's comments were reported to Cox and Beckingham, Beckingham met with Plaintiff who admitted to having made the statements to his co-worker. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 105-07;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 95-96; Dkt. 44 at \u00b6\u00b6 42-43). On December 21, 2015, Plaintiff participated in a meeting with Beckingham, Philip Piedmont, an Environmental Project Coordinator (\"Piedmont\"), and Adbiel Pereira (\"Pereira\"), an asbestos handler who translated the conversations held at the meeting for Plaintiff. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 110;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 44 at \u00b6 45; Dkt. 50-1 at 2-8).

(Dkt. 1 at 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 100). However, Plaintiff has failed to substantiate this assertion with any evidence in admissible form other than his own conclusory testimony. Indeed, what Plaintiff describes as discrimination is, in fact, attempts by Defendant to accommodate his physical condition where that condition undisputedly prevented him from performing all of the essential functions of an asbestos handler. Because Plaintiff has failed to identify any accommodation that would have allowed him to satisfy the essential functions of his position, and the record reveals that Plaintiff still struggled even after Defendant went beyond its ADA obligations to accommodate him with light-duty tasks, summary judgment is mandated\n   in favor of Defendant dismissing Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Upon the onset of his disability in August 2015, Plaintiff was unable to perform several essential functions of an asbestos handler. Plaintiff testified that lifting up to 40 pounds frequently, lifting over 40 pounds occasionally, \"grasping with hands frequently,\" \"repetitive hand motion continuously,\" and \"fine dexterity occasionally\" were all essential functions of his job that he could perform when he began work in February 2015. (Dkt. 43-1 at 45-49). Plaintiff's duties as an asbestos handler did not change between February 2015 and the onset of his alleged disability in August 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66). During that time, he was primarily tasked with removing asbestos by using a power washer, which required the use of both his hands. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 33, 43;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 64-65; Dkt. 44 at \u00b6 22). Plaintiff had to maintain a firm grasp on the power-washer wand and remain in a stable position to continuously direct the flow of water. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 64-65). Plaintiff was unable to perform this task after August 2015 because of his disability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff's other duties as an asbestos handler also required the use of both hands to scale ladders and scaffolds, change hoses and filters on the water treatment system, and remove chemicals and other compounds from various fixtures at the worksite. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, 38-39; Dkt. 43-1 at 53-56, 57-61). Once Plaintiff was placed on restricted duty because of the pain he experienced in his right arm, he could not perform any of the above-listed essential functions with his right hand, which also happened to be his dominant hand. (Dkt. 43-1 at 97-99).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Furthermore, Plaintiff testified that the only accommodation he ever requested from Defendant was that he be removed from his power-washing assignment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 106). Defendant complied with this request (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and then made numerous attempts to provide Plaintiff with tasks not normally attendant to his position as an asbestos handler in order to permit his continued presence on the worksite (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 63-67; Dkt. 43-1 at 68-69, 71, 84-90; Dkt. 44 at \u00b6\u00b6 26-28; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 30). While Plaintiff also testified that he could perform \"[a]ll\" the duties required of an asbestos handler as of the date of his alleged termination (Dkt. 43-1 at 108-09), this self-serving testimony is given no weight given that it flatly contradicts Plaintiff's testimony that he was unable to use his dominant arm to perform a number of the \"essential functions\" of an asbestos handler,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deebs v.

Similarly, Plaintiff was assigned to perform fire watch duties while his co-workers ate lunch because that was one of the tasks he could perform with his physical limitations, and it was required to ensure that the gas-powered tools did not reignite. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 44 at \u00b6 39; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The undisputed evidence demonstrates that Defendant provided Plaintiff with a number of light-duty tasks to perform after relieving him from power-washing duty to accommodate for his disability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43-1 at 71, 84, 86, 88-90; Dkt. 44 at \u00b6\u00b6 26-28; Dkt. 45 \u00b6\u00b6 25, 30). Plaintiff testified that many of these tasks still required some use of his right arm, and thus, resulted in at least some discomfort or an inability to safely complete them. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 43-1 at 69-71, 91-92). Defendant supplied unrebutted evidence that by late December, it had run out of additional light-duty tasks to offer Plaintiff that would account for his physical limitations and be satisfactory to him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 44 at \u00b6\u00b6 44-45; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6\u00b6 38, 54; Dkt. 50-1 at 3). As a result of the limited number of tasks available to Plaintiff due to his disability, seasonal constraints, and the completion of the projects at the worksite, Defendants were unable to find tasks sufficient to fill Plaintiff's regular working hours and thus, Plaintiff was unable to seek overtime and was asked to\n   work different hours from his co-workers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 44 at \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39; Dkt. 45 at \u00b6\u00b6 38, 40). Plaintiff offers no evidence to suggest that these reasons were pretextual for retaliation due to his alleged disability. Indeed, Plaintiff's self-serving and conclusory testimony simply that he was fired as a result of his disability (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 43-1 at 101-02, 105, 108), and his generic and nondescript assertions that he was no longer assigned overtime and had his work assignments and work schedule altered, are insufficient to demonstrate that Defendant's reasons were pretextual and avoid summary judgment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trane v.

Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiff's Complaint alleges an ADA retaliation cause of action, Defendant is granted summary judgment on that claim as well and it too is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     The Claims Arising from Plaintiff's NYSDHR Complaints\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiff's Complaint does not make any reference to the NYSHRL and appears to only allege claims for disability discrimination, harassment, and retaliation arising under the ADA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 at 1, 4). However, Plaintiff does attach to his Complaint a \"Determination After Investigation\" issued by the NYSDHR, indicating that Plaintiff filed a verified complaint with the NYSDHR on December 24, 2015, which alleged violations of the NYSHRL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-13). Plaintiff also attaches a \"Final Investigation Report and Basis of Determination\" to his Complaint, indicating that the NYSDHR found \"probable cause to support the allegations of the [NYSHRL] complaint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status, the Court will assume that Plaintiff intended to assert NYSHRL claims alongside his ADA causes of action, at least as they pertain to the allegations within the December 24, 2015, NYSDHR complaint referenced by Plaintiff's attachments. Because the record demonstrates that Plaintiff also filed earlier NYSDHR complaints referenced by Defendant in its motion papers, the Court will also determine the vitality of any claims asserted in those complaints for the sake of completeness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    A. This Court Lacks Jurisdiction over Plaintiff's NYSHRL Allegations Asserted in His First and Second NYSDHR Complaints\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Defendant argues that \"[t]o the extent Plaintiff purports to assert claims under the [NYSHRL], ... any such claims are procedurally improper since all NYSHRL claims are barred by the election of remedies doctrine.\" (Dkt. 48 at 11). New York Executive Law \u00a7 297(9) contains an election of remedies provision which provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Any person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful discriminatory practice shall have a cause of action in any court of appropriate jurisdiction ...\n   <em>\n    unless such person had filed a complaint hereunder or with any local commission on human rights\n   </em>\n   ... provided that, where the division has dismissed such complaint on the grounds of administrative convenience, on the grounds of untimeliness, or on the grounds that the election of remedies is annulled, such person shall maintain all rights to bring suit as if no complaint had been filed with the division.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   (emphasis added).

In regards to the first two administrative complaints, the NYSDHR found \"no probable cause\" to conclude that the alleged wrongful conduct had occurred, and it dismissed both complaints.
