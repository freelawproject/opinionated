BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This Court again takes up a challenge to the federal approval of Kentucky HEALTH, an experimental project proposed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky intended to \"comprehensively transform\" its Medicaid program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has authority to approve such experimental proposals - or \"demonstration projects\" - as long as they promote the objectives of the Medicaid Act. Kentucky HEALTH, which the Secretary initially approved on January 12, 2018, would condition Medicaid eligibility for a large portion of its beneficiaries on work or community-engagement requirements and impose several additional obligations intended to make Medicaid more like commercial insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs, Kentucky residents currently enrolled in the Commonwealth's Medicaid program, believed HHS's approval unlawful. In a ruling last summer, this Court agreed. Finding that the \"Secretary never adequately considered whether Kentucky HEALTH would in fact help the state furnish medical assistance to its citizens\" and thus promote a central objective of the Medicaid Act, the Court concluded that this \"signal omission render[ed] his determination arbitrary and capricious.\"\n   <em>\n    Stewart v. Azar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/#p243\">\n    313 F.Supp.3d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 243 (D.D.C. 2018). In particular, it found that the Secretary had not grappled with Kentucky's estimate that a substantial number of people were likely to lose coverage under Kentucky HEALTH.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/#p243\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/#p243\">\n    at 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court, consequently, vacated the approval and remanded to HHS for further review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The bell now rings for round two. Following the Court's remand and an additional notice-and-comment period, the Secretary reapproved the program last November, this time relying on somewhat different reasoning. Plaintiffs now challenge the reapproval, contending principally that the Secretary has not remedied the defects that rendered his prior action unlawful. Specifically, they maintain that he has still not adequately considered Kentucky HEALTH's likelihood to cause significant coverage loss. The Secretary, by contrast, believes that this time around he has cured any critical omission. Defendants now rely primarily on a new argument to that effect - namely that, although Kentucky HEALTH may cause nearly 100,000 people to lose coverage, that number will be dwarfed by the approximately 450,000 people who would suffer that fate if Kentucky ends its coverage entirely of those who have joined the Medicaid rolls via the Affordable Care Act, as it has threatened to do if this project is not approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Supreme Court, in holding that Congress could not require states to adopt that Medicaid expansion by conditioning all their Medicaid funding on a decision to do so, explained that the states could not be compelled to engage in a program they had not bargained for with \"a gun to the head.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Fed. of Indep. Business v. Sebelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p581\">\n    567 U.S. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 581,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p581\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p581\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). Kentucky, it seems, has now picked up that gun by threatening to de-expand Medicaid. Defendants urge the Court to adopt the proposition that the Secretary need not grapple with the coverage-loss implications of a state's proposed project as long as it is accompanied by a threat that the state will de-expand - or, indeed, discontinue all of Medicaid. By definition, so this argument goes, any number of people covered by an experimental Medicaid program would be greater than the number if there were no Medicaid at all; as a result, any demonstration project that leaves any individual on a state's Medicaid rolls promotes coverage. The Court cannot concur that the Medicaid Act leaves the Secretary so unconstrained, nor that the states are so armed to refashion the program Congress designed in any way they choose. As a consequence, once again finding the reapproval was both contrary to the Act and arbitrary and capricious, the Court will vacate it and remand to HHS for further review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Because, as the Court explained previously, the Secretary must determine under \u00a7 1115 \"whether a\n   <em>\n    project\n   </em>\n   would promote the Act's objectives, not whether each component, viewed in isolation, would,\" it will again limit its analysis to Count VIII.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stewart I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/#p243\">\n    313 F.Supp.3d at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As they did last time, Plaintiffs also assert several additional causes of action, including that the Secretary acted in excess of statutory authority, that the SMD Letter ought to be vacated as an improperly promulgated substantive rule, and that Defendants violated the Take Care Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

Defendants here offer no more than a brief objection. They assert, in a handful of paragraphs, that Plaintiffs lack standing to level specific challenges at particular components of the Kentucky HEALTH program, including the waiver of retroactive eligibility, the lockouts, the waiver of non-emergency medical transportation, and deductions from the\n   <em>\n    MyRewards\n   </em>\n   account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HHS MSJ at 35, 37, 38, 39.

While granting the Government's contention that some of the named Plaintiffs may be exempt from the premium requirement, the Court found that at least some of them would indisputably be required to pay.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/#p243\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is all that is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Animal Legal Def.

The Secretary, nevertheless, appears to renew in a single sentence the Government's position that the language of \u00a7 1115 \"commits these determinations to the Secretary's discretion as a matter of law.\" HHS MSJ at 14. There is no further analysis, however, much less a proffered reason that the Court should revisit its prior thorough treatment of this issue. As a result, it has little trouble concluding once again that the approval is judicially reviewable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Having cleared the ground, the Court can now move to Plaintiffs' main beef: the Secretary's reapproval of Kentucky HEALTH is, they contend, arbitrary and capricious primarily because he did not adequately consider whether his \u00a7 1115 waiver promotes the objectives of the Medicaid Act. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Secretary can only approve demonstration projects that are \"likely to assist in promoting the objectives\" of the Medicaid Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201315\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Specifically, he explains that one \"important objective of the Medicaid program is to furnish medical assistance and other services to vulnerable populations,\" but because \"there is little intrinsic value in paying for [those] services if [they] are not advancing the health and wellness of the individual receiving them, or otherwise helping the individual attain independence,\" another \"objective of the Medicaid program ... is to advance the\n   <em>\n    health and wellness\n   </em>\n   needs of its beneficiaries.\" AR 6719 (emphasis added).

As before, it finds his consideration of the program's effects on medical assistance inadequate. His examination of the other three aims, two of which the Court finds are not stand-alone objectives of the statute in the first instance, cannot make up for that failure. This is especially true where the Secretary made no attempt to weigh any of those three aims against the coverage-loss consequences of the program.

Coverage Loss\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In the original approval, the Secretary \"never provided a bottom-line estimate of how many people would lose Medicaid with Kentucky HEALTH in place,\" an \"oversight\" that was especially \"glaring\" since, \"[i]n its application, Kentucky estimated that the project would cause\" a substantial number of people to leave its Medicaid rolls - the equivalent of 95,000 people losing coverage for a year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266261\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/914/#p932\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the Court noted before, \"\n   <em>\n    Amici\n   </em>\n   maintain that such number is conservative and peg the real figure as between 175,000 and 297,500\" people losing coverage in the first year of the program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266261\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/914/#p932\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing ECF No. 44 (Amicus Brief of Deans, Chairs, and Scholars) at 18). Whatever the precise calculation, the number is undoubtedly substantial. While the Secretary has now nominally acknowledged that estimate, none of his responses evinces the kind of \"reasoned decisionmaking\" that arbitrary-and-capricious review requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Michigan v.

The Court will, accordingly, address this point in its discussion of fiscal sustainability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section B.2.d,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . For now, it will note only that the argument is inconsistent with and relies on an unreasonable reading of the Secretary's \u00a7 1115 authority. It cannot, as a result, satisfy his obligation to analyze coverage loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendants next make two arguments questioning the extent of his obligation to consider coverage losses. The Secretary first contends that \u00a7 1115 contemplates that demonstrations may result in an impact on eligibility, meaning coverage loss does not necessarily render a project unlawful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 6726, 6729-30. That is certainly true: the Act expressly provides for a \"demonstration project ... that would result in an impact on eligibility.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201315\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). That acknowledgment does not, however, sanction a demonstration that would result in significant coverage loss, nor does it relieve the Secretary of his obligation to consider the magnitude of coverage loss here. Indeed, the limitation remains that demonstration projects can only be approved it they \"promote the objectives\" of the Act. Here, the coverage loss is sufficiently significant - even at the low end of the estimated range - that it cannot be waved off by the rejoinder that\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   amount of coverage loss is legally permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, the Secretary protests that he has no obligation to provide an exact estimate of the number of people who will lose coverage, particularly because demonstration projects are experiments intended to gather data and \"predictive calculations are a murky science in the best of circumstances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 6730; HHS MSJ at 22-23 (citing\n   <em>\n    Cablevision Sys.

As an initial matter, the experimental nature of the project cannot relieve the Secretary of the obligation to do the analysis that \u00a7 1115 itself demands -\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , whether a demonstration project promotes the objectives of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Of course, the exact number of people who will lose coverage under Kentucky HEALTH is admittedly subject to some uncertainty. As the D.C.

He offers two broad sets of arguments. The first quibbles with the nature of the estimate. The second concerns safeguards in Kentucky HEALTH meant to assist beneficiaries in avoiding coverage loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Secretary first explains that the 95,000 number is misleading. It represents the number of member months Kentucky projected will be reduced by Kentucky HEALTH, divided by twelve to reach a figure representing one year's worth of coverage for a given individual. He argues that, rather than commenting on the number of member months, \"Plaintiffs incorrectly assume, with no foundation for doing so, that every member month of coverage lost under the demonstration is part of a full year of coverage for a person who never regains coverage.\" HHS MSJ at 24. In addition, the Secretary elaborates, the people who do leave Medicaid permanently may have lost their eligibility for a variety of reasons, including transitioning to commercial coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 6730-31;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Kentucky MSJ at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   This argument is unpersuasive and is, ultimately, legerdemain intended to undercut the significance of the number. 95,000 is one way to represent the annualized number of member months of lost coverage under Kentucky HEALTH, as commenters plainly understood.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 16707-08. There are, as the Secretary acknowledges, multiple ways to slice the number of lost months: 95,000 people may lose coverage for a year; a larger number may lose coverage for shorter periods of time; or fewer people may be deprived of coverage for lengthier periods. Regardless of how the number of lost member months is distributed among Medicaid beneficiaries, it indisputably reflects that a substantial number of people will lose coverage. As such, the Secretary cannot avoid addressing that number. This is especially so\n   where commenters detailed the widespread predicted nature of coverage loss and its devastating effects,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 13175, 15482, 19489, including the destructive effects of coverage gaps.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 12918, 12967, 15486, 19388-89, 19985-86;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 99 (Amicus Brief of American Academy of Pediatrics) at 10-15, 19-20. In other words, understanding of the loss estimate was baked into their analysis of the magnitude of coverage loss, and the Secretary is not relieved of his obligation to consider the significance of the number - whether it represents primarily permanent losses of coverage or a high incidence of gaps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   He makes no effort, moreover, to cite evidence or otherwise provide a reasoned basis for the assertion that some number of people will transition to commercial coverage and, if so, how many he might expect. Once again, \"[w]hile the agency spoke generally of 'creating incentives for individuals to obtain and maintain coverage through private, employer-sponsored insurance,' it cited no research or evidence that this would happen, nor did it make concrete estimates of how many beneficiaries might make that transition.\"\n   <em>\n    Stewart I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/#p243\">\n    313 F.Supp.3d at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, he made no effort to explain how - given that Kentucky HEALTH contains community-engagement rather than work requirements - beneficiaries could reasonably expect to get commercial insurance from \"education, job skills training, job search activities, and community service.\" AR 6730;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 12823-24, 12858, 12973-75, 14044-45, 16716-18 (explaining beneficiaries unlikely to get coverage on labor market).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Second, the Secretary emphasizes that the coverage-loss \"projections were made prior to the inclusion of changes made to the demonstration at approval, including additional beneficiary guardrails expected to help beneficiaries maintain enrollment.\" AR 6731;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   HHS MSJ at 24. He elaborates that there are a number of exemptions from program requirements - for the medically frail, pregnant women, former foster youth, and domestic-violence survivors - and also several guardrails - including a good-cause exemption to certain penalties, an opportunity for re-enrollment after coming back into compliance with program requirements, screening beneficiaries for other eligibility possibilities before the lockout, full appeal rights prior to eligibility loss, and maintaining a system for \"reasonable modification[ ]\" of the requirements for persons with disabilities, \"among other assurances.\" AR 6729;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 6725-26; 6727-28; 6734-35; HHS MSJ at 25-27; Kentucky MSJ at 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Yet, again, this \"response ... is no answer at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Stewart I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/#p243\">\n    313 F.Supp.3d at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Commonwealth's original application provided all of these exemptions, except that for domestic-violence survivors, which is now an exemption rather than a good-cause exception. It also included opportunities for beneficiaries to come back into compliance before the end of a penalty period. \"Even with those reforms baked in, Kentucky estimated that 95,000 people would lose coverage,\" and the \"commenters, too, expressed their concerns about coverage losses with those features in mind.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/#p243\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing AR 3694-95, 3937).

To begin, for the reasons discussed in Section B.1,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Court is dubious that the ACA altered the objectives of Medicaid at all. None of the Commonwealth's specific arguments here alters that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   It first contends that because the ACA amended the definition of \"medical assistance\" to include care itself as well as the payment for that care, the Act's objectives must now include health as well as furnishing medical assistance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kentucky MSJ at 7.

Neither of those statutory features suggests that promoting health as a stand-alone objective has replaced furnishing\n   medical assistance as the statute's primary aim. Medical care is not health; health may be the result of medical care.

Even if health were such an objective, approving Kentucky HEALTH on this basis would still be arbitrary and capricious. The Secretary, most significantly, did not weigh health gains against coverage losses in justifying the approval. Because the provision of Medicaid coverage is indisputably a central objective of the Act, the Secretary's consideration of the separate objective of health does not excuse him from addressing an \"important aspect of the problem.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    463 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is especially true where the Secretary himself acknowledged that there is a conflict between his reasoning for why the program promotes health and the possibility that it will cause widespread coverage deprivation: \"To create an effective incentive for beneficiaries to take measures that promote health and independence, it may be necessary for states to attach penalties to failure to take those measures,\" which \"may mean that beneficiaries who fail to comply will lose Medicaid coverage, at least temporarily.\" AR 1631.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Even solely in the realm of health, moreover, the agency fell short. That is because it did not consider the health benefits of the project relative to its harms to the health of those who might lose their coverage. Commenters made clear that those health effects were significant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 12918, 12967, 13175, 15482, 15486, 19388-89, 19985-86. Even if health were an appropriate consideration under \u00a7 1115, therefore, these oversights demonstrate why it would be necessary to weigh purported health benefits against the coverage losses and resulting health consequences. This the Secretary did not do, rendering his decision arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    c. Financial Independence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Secretary also posits that the project will \"test[ ] measures designed to help adults transition from Medicaid to greater financial independence and other forms of health coverage,\" including by preparing them for the commercial health market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HHS MSJ at 2; AR 6724-25. As the Court found before, financial self-sufficiency is not an independent objective of the Act and, as such, cannot undergird the Secretary's finding under \u00a7 1115 that the project promotes the Act's goals. This is so even where the Court accords\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference to his interpretation of financial independence as an \"objective\" contemplated in \u00a7 1115.

The Commonwealth acknowledges that the Court previously found that financial independence was not a stand-alone objective of the Act, but reasons that it may make sense as an objective for the\n   <em>\n    expansion\n   </em>\n   population, if not the traditional one. This is so, it believes, because \" Section 1396-1 makes clear that it does not list the universe of 'purposes' for appropriations for expanded Medicaid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"364156\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/318/80/#p87\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For the reasons already explained, the Court does not find that the objectives for the expansion are different.

The Medicaid Act does not. The Court is not suggesting a waiver application approving work requirements in some form could never be lawful because the Medicaid Act does not contain work requirements. Rather, the point is only that the existence of work requirements in the AFDC statute is probative of their compatibility with that Act's objectives and the possibility that additional similar requirements would promote those aims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Even if financial independence were an objective of the Act and thus a proper consideration for \u00a7 1115 approval, the Secretary's invocation of it cannot support the approval here for a separate reason. That is because, absent any attempt to estimate the number of people who will gain employment and move onto commercial coverage or otherwise attain financial independence - or any analysis of the mechanism by which they are likely to do so - his assertion that some significant number of people would migrate is insufficient. As the Court pointed out before, \"[I]t is not obvious that the community-\n   engagement requirement alone would help a person shift to private insurance,\" particularly given that \"individuals can meet it, for example, by volunteering in the community\" - an activity that \"may have long term benefits\" but would not come with health coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stewart I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/#p243\">\n    313 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   264 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 12823-24, 12858, 12973-75, 14044-45, 16716-18 (explaining beneficiaries unlikely to get coverage on labor market). Even if some number of beneficiaries were to gain independence, the Secretary does not weigh the benefits of their self-sufficiency against the consequences of coverage loss, which would harm and undermine the financial self-sufficiency of others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 12916-17, 13547, 16723-24, 17464-65, 19985-87, 26311. These deficiencies render his determination arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    d. Fiscal Sustainability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Long diverted into myriad other byways, the Court now arrives at the broad avenue that constitutes Defendants' key position. Fiscal sustainability is, in fact, the primary rationale on which the Secretary relied in approving this demonstration. In his view, \"Demonstration projects that seek to improve beneficiary health and financial independence\" improve well-being and \"at the same time, allow states to maintain the long-term fiscal sustainability of their Medicaid programs.\" AR 6720. The Secretary explained that \"Kentucky expects that the reforms included in the demonstration will enable the Commonwealth to continue to offer Medicaid to the ACA expansion population,\" since Kentucky \"has repeatedly stated that if it is unable to move forward with its Kentucky HEALTH demonstration project, it will discontinue coverage for the ACA expansion population.\" AR 6726. \"[E]ven assuming\" that the program would result in the estimated eligibility losses, he posits that the number of people who lose coverage under Kentucky HEALTH \"is likely dwarfed by the 454,000 newly eligible adults who stand to lose coverage if Kentucky elects to terminate the non-mandatory ACA expansion.\" AR 6732. And because \"the demonstration provides coverage to individuals that the state is not required to cover[,] [a]ny potential loss of coverage that may result from a demonstration is properly considered in the context of a state's substantial discretion to eliminate non-mandatory benefits or to eliminate coverage\" altogether for the expansion population.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 6731.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In this explanation, the Secretary does not make entirely clear whether he interprets fiscal sustainability to be an independent objective of the Act, or whether making the program more fiscally sustainable is essentially a point about coverage promotion - that is, whether saving money by covering fewer people is ultimately coverage promoting because any number of people Kentucky still covers under the demonstration would be greater than the number of people covered if it terminated the ACA expansion. Based on federal Defendants' representations during oral argument, it seems that the Government primarily presses the latter iteration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 8, 53. The Court, nevertheless, will address each in turn, finding that either way the argument is sliced, it cannot support the Secretary's reapproval here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   i. Fiscal Sustainability as Independent Objective\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The first issue is whether the Secretary could reasonably conclude that the approval of Kentucky HEALTH was justified because it advanced, as an independent objective of the Act, the fiscal sustainability of the safety net. The Court preliminarily considers under the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   framework whether the Secretary permissibly interpreted the Act to contain fiscal\n   sustainability as a stand-alone objective; finding in the affirmative, it next addresses whether the agency's conclusion that the program would advance that objective is arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Commonwealth is the party that most clearly contends that fiscal sustainability is an independent objective of the Medicaid Act. It maintains first that, as a textual matter, specific language in \u00a7 1396-1 supports this position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kentucky MSJ at 10. Although the Secretary did not clearly rely on this rationale in the reapproval letter - and does not do so in his briefing here - the letter does at least understand \"Section 1115 demonstration projects ... [to] provide an opportunity for states to test policies that ensure the fiscal sustainability of the Medicaid program, better 'enabling each [s]tate, as far as practicable under the conditions in such [s]tate,' to furnish medical assistance.\" AR 6719 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201396-1\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Federal Defendants, at oral argument, offered that portion of the letter in support of this contention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 50-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As discussed previously, the Court finds at\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   step one that the word \"objectives\" as it appears in \u00a7 1115 is ambiguous. It therefore proceeds to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   's second step and asks whether the Secretary's interpretation is reasonable. The statutory text on which Defendants rely provides that the Act aims to \"enabl[e] each State, as far as practicable under the conditions in such state, to furnish\" first, medical assistance and second, rehabilitation and other services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201396-1\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In context, practicability is at least a qualifier of the extent to which states must furnish medical assistance. Given that the Act stipulates mandatory floors for benefits and coverage populations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396a, 1396a(a)(10)(A), the Court believes the qualifier is as easily understood as establishing a ceiling as it is lowering the floor. That said, it cannot find his interpretation unreasonable under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   . Defendants may, as a result, take into account fiscal sustainability in determining under \u00a7 1115 whether a demonstration project promotes the objectives of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Identifying an objective of the Act is just the first step, however. The Secretary must also give an adequate explanation for why Kentucky HEALTH advances that objective and why, if it is adverse to other Medicaid objectives, he could reasonably conclude that, on balance, it promotes the objectives of the Act as required by \u00a7 1115. On these fronts, he fell short. First, he made no finding, supported by substantial evidence, that Kentucky HEALTH would improve the sustainability of Kentucky's Medicaid program - either by accruing savings to the state or by any other mechanism. Second, he unreasonably prioritized program savings without weighing those against the consequences of lost coverage, rendering his determination arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Beginning with the first, the Secretary made no finding that Kentucky HEALTH would save the Commonwealth any amount of money or otherwise make the program more sustainable in some way. In the last round of litigation, the Court isolated some confusion about savings attributable to the program: Defendants \"repeatedly highlight[ed] that the program could save $ 2.2 billion,\" but the \"Commonwealth's own records show that ... the state's actual savings would be $ 331 million.\"\n   <em>\n    Stewart I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/#p243\">\n    313 F.Supp.3d at 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While not a trivial number, the back-and-forth highlights the importance of analyzing the evidence to come to some reasonable conclusion. The Court is not suggesting here that the Secretary must quantify some exact amount of savings, but he must make some finding that supports his\n   conclusion that the project would actually advance Kentucky Medicaid's fiscal sustainability. This is especially so where - although the Court does not pass on the persuasiveness of the evidence - the record contains some reason to believe that full administration of the expansion will\n   <em>\n    save\n   </em>\n   the Commonwealth money, while reducing coverage of the expansion population would cost the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 4970, 4974-75 (study determining Kentucky will experience significant \"positive fiscal impact\" from expansion through 2021).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The point is not to evaluate how Kentucky ought to spend its money.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 29 (maintaining that Kentucky's \"budgetary priorities\" are \"[its] prerogative\"). The Commonwealth, moreover, may well be free to pull out of the expansion entirely (or, indeed, all of Medicaid) if it chooses not to spend its money that way. The central point is that - without a finding about the savings that Kentucky HEALTH could be expected to yield - the Secretary could not make a reasoned decision that it would promote fiscal sustainability. If he is to rely on that rationale, he must so find. Otherwise, as here, he has not marshaled substantial evidence for that position and, indeed, has ignored contrary evidence in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fred Meyer Stores, Inc. v.

The Ninth Circuit has twice invalidated similar approvals, holding that the agency acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in approving a \u00a7 1115 waiver that - as here - derived cost savings from shrinking a state's Medicaid rolls without adequately considering the program's coverage consequences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newton-Nations v.

Kentucky HEALTH, Defendants argue, is not a simple \"benefit cut.\" Tr. at 7, 10-11. That distinction, however, is not convincing. As a technical matter, Kentucky HEALTH does not, on its face, simply cut benefits. But the Secretary's analysis of the program was defective precisely because he did not adequately consider the significant number of people for whom the program would entail a loss of all benefits. Their loss of coverage appears, from the record in this case, to be how the Commonwealth would save money. That is precisely what the Ninth Circuit said states cannot do with a \u00a7 1115 waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendants rejoin with several cases that they claim stand for the proposition that the manner in which they considered fiscal sustainability here was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HHS MSJ at 15-18 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pharm.

If anything, they illuminate how the project in this case - and the reasoning given to support it - departs from previous ones. Most importantly, the programs in those cases involved only incidental burdens on Medicaid recipients. Specifically, the drug-rebate programs at issue in\n   <em>\n    Walsh\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   made certain drugs, but not others, more difficult to obtain and in so doing provided reduced-cost medication to all individuals in the state. Neither program entirely stripped coverage or a mandatory benefit from Medicaid recipients. Language in those opinions addressed this very concern. As\n   <em>\n    Walsh\n   </em>\n   noted, \"[P]roviding benefits to needy persons and ... curtailing the State's Medicaid costs ... would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   provide a sufficient basis for upholding the program if it severely curtailed Medicaid recipients' access to prescription drugs.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031303\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/644/#p663\">\n    538 U.S. at 664-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031303\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/644/#p663\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   reasoned similarly, pointing out \"the absence of any demonstrable significant impediment to Medicaid services from [the challenged] prior authorization requirement.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723048,9268602\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/817/\">\n    362 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   826 (citing\n   <em>\n    Walsh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031303\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/644/#p663\">\n    538 U.S. at 664, 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031303\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/644/#p663\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Those disclaimers make eminently clear that a project that enhances financial sustainability may not advance the objectives of Medicaid if it significantly impedes or curtails Medicaid services or coverage. Important to both the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court was the fact that neither program threatened the entirety of beneficiaries' Medicaid coverage - or even an aspect of their coverage, like that for prescription drugs - in the name of cost savings. Rather, both of those cases explicitly sanctioned an\n   <em>\n    incidental\n   </em>\n   burden on Medicaid recipients. They do not suggest that Medicaid recipients can be significantly burdened - that is, for example, their eligibility significantly restricted or benefits significantly cut - in the name of saving money. That there are limits on the extent to which fiscal sustainability can justify cuts like those outlined in these cases makes sense. Most cuts to Medicaid services would reduce the cost of Medicaid and thus advance the sustainability of the program to some extent. But it would be nonsensical to conclude that any cut therefore always promotes the Act's objectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Perhaps the most important takeaway from these cases is what the Court has been saying all along: the Secretary must engage in considered analysis of the fiscal-sustainability concern, both alone and relative to the issue of coverage loss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723048,9268602\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/817/\">\n    362 F.3d at 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Fiscal Sustainability as Coverage Promoting\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Defendants' alternative fiscal-sustainability position is that Kentucky HEALTH is coverage promoting because, absent its approval, the Commonwealth will - given fiscal strain - simply de-expand Medicaid. This coverage-promotion argument, in fact, does not depend on fiscal sustainability at all. Rather, all that matters is that a state, like Kentucky, has threatened to de-expand Medicaid if its proposed demonstration is not approved. The underlying reason for the threat - whether budgetary priorities, fiscal crisis, or other policy goals - is of no moment. This route is legally permissible, Defendants assert at multiple points, because the expansion population is optional and therefore need not receive\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   coverage. As the Secretary indicated in the reapproval letter, Kentucky HEALTH should be viewed \"in the context of a state's substantial discretion\" to eliminate coverage for the expansion population.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 6731;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 18, 52. A demonstration that shrinks coverage may thus be coverage promoting for the purposes of \u00a7 1115 as long as the state threatens that if the demonstration is not approved, it will discontinue coverage entirely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HHS MSJ at 18-20; AR 6729.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   This contention is both inconsistent with the Medicaid Act and arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Agape Church, Inc. v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235372,3694663\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/397/\">\n    738 F.3d 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 410 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (\"The analysis of disputed agency action under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   Step Two and arbitrary and capricious review is often 'the same, because under Chevron Step Two, [the court asks] whether an agency interpretation is arbitrary or capricious in substance.' \"). As an initial matter, Defendants are incorrect that a state has additional discretion to diminish or condition eligibility for the expansion - as opposed to the traditional - population. Relying in part on\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   , they repeatedly assert that Kentucky has the prerogative to de-expand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HHS MSJ at 4, 6, 18, 19-20; Kentucky MSJ at 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 13, 18, 54. That may well be correct. But the privilege Kentucky seeks to exercise here is not to de-expand, but rather to implement the ACA expansion as an\n   <em>\n    \u00e0 la carte\n   </em>\n   exercise, picking and choosing which of Congress's mandates it wishes to implement.\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   did not sanction that. Rather, the Court was very clear: \"Nothing in [\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   ] precludes Congress from offering funds under the Affordable Care Act to expand the availability of health care, and requiring that States accepting such funds comply with the conditions on their use.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p581\">\n    567 U.S. at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p581\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The case held only that Congress was \"not free ... to penalize States that choose not to participate in [the expansion] by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p581\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is, the Court held that, as with traditional Medicaid, Congress may impose requirements on the states for the use of expansion funds. Nothing in that analysis allows for \"additional discretion\" in how the states comply with Medicaid requirements for the expansion population as compared to the traditional one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   While Defendants thus err in positing that their treatment of the expansion population is undergirded with any greater discretion than their administration of any other part of the Medicaid program, their arguments about flexibility\n   <em>\n    vis-\u00e0-vis\n   </em>\n   the expansion population are ultimately a red herring. That is so because the\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   Medicaid program is optional for states. The Court does not see why - if Defendants are correct that threats to terminate the expansion program can supply the baseline for the Secretary's \u00a7 1115 review - that argument would not be equally good as applied to\n   <em>\n    traditional\n   </em>\n   Medicaid. Their argument must thus posit that any \u00a7 1115 program that maintains\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   coverage\n   for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   set of individuals promotes the objectives of the Medicaid Act as long as the state threatens to terminate all of Medicaid in the absence of waiver approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Taken to its logical conclusion, the Secretary's position thus makes little sense. Under his reasoning, states may threaten that they wish to de-expand, or indeed do away with all of Medicaid - for fiscal reasons or no reason at all - if the Secretary does not approve whatever waiver of whatever Medicaid requirements they wish to obtain. The Secretary could then always approve those waivers, no matter how few people remain on Medicaid thereafter because\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   waiver would be coverage promoting compared to a world in which the state offers no coverage at all. Remarkably, when asked for a limiting principle to this proposition during oral argument, Defendants did not give one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 9-11, 13-14. Could a state decide it did not wish to cover pregnant women? The blind? All but 100 people currently on its Medicaid rolls? The Secretary offers no reason that his position would not allow for any of those results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Not only does Defendants' position entail radical results, but it is also inconsistent with the text of \u00a7 1115. The statute requires the Secretary to evaluate whether the\n   <em>\n    project\n   </em>\n   will promote the objectives of the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201315\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 35, 38-39. Against what baseline is he supposed to evaluate the project? The structure of the waiver provision assumes the implementation of the Act. It confirms that the relevant baseline is whether the waiver will still promote the objectives of the Act as compared to compliance with the statute's requirements, not as compared with a hypothetical future universe where there is no Act. This is so because the overarching provision authorizing these waivers stipulates that, if the Secretary makes a judgment that a demonstration promotes the objectives of the Act, he may then waive compliance with certain of its provisions \"to the extent and for the period necessary\" to carry out the project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201315\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (a)(1). That is, the provision contemplates a limited waiver. It would make little sense to have such waiver authority and limitations where the relevant consideration was not full compliance with the Act's requirements but instead no engagement whatsoever in the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The Court, furthermore, need not exclude the possibility that fiscal considerations are ever permissible in any context to reject the staggering breadth of the argument that Defendants present here. To summarize, their central contention is that, where a state threatens to discontinue Medicaid coverage entirely, any waiver approval would promote coverage. The argument does not depend on dealing with the expansion population; it is equally applicable to traditional Medicaid. It does not depend on a state's being in a fiscally precarious position because it does not take into account the reason the state wants to discontinue participating in the Medicaid program. It is not subject to any kind of limiting principle. The Secretary's interpretation constitutes \"an impermissible construction of the statute ... because [it] is utterly unreasonable in\" its \"breadth\" - \"nothing in this record ... indicate[s] that Congress empowered the agency to effect\" such a sweeping authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aid Ass'n for Lutherans v. U.S. Postal Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9366225,5872137\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/321/1166/\">\n    321 F.3d 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1178 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Its interpretation is therefore \"arbitrary [and] capricious in substance.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Agape Church\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235372,3694663\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/397/\">\n    738 F.3d at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That provision of the Act does not turn the comprehensive Medicaid program that Congress designed into a buffet for states. Defendants' remarkable interpretation of Section 1115 thus cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In finding the Secretary's position unreasonable, the Court does not suggest that the agency may\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   consider the fiscal sustainability of the Medicaid program. He very well might properly assess whether a more efficient way of administering a state's Medicaid program would save resources or whether, as in\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   , a state might save money by continuing to deliver mandatory care to mandatory populations while restricting precisely which kinds of tests or medications are available, for example. Those considerations are not incompatible with the prime objective of the Act being the furnishing of medical assistance. But that is not the exercise the Secretary engaged in here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Where a court concludes that an agency's action is unlawful, \"the practice ... is ordinarily to vacate the rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Ill. Pub. Telecomms. Ass'n v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707886,12007110\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/123/693/\">\n    123 F.3d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 693 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Defendants, however, protest that any relief should be limited to Plaintiffs here, rather than all Kentuckians who would lose coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HHS MSJ at 41-42. In support, they contend that \"[t]here is no equitable reason to disrupt the statewide implementation of Kentucky HEALTH and thus jeopardize the expansion coverage for hundreds of thousands of individuals who are not before this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707886,12007110\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/123/693/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The cases Defendants cite, however, merely concern equitable discretion in fashioning remedies or the need, for standing purposes, for a plaintiff's remedy to be tailored to her injury. While the Court does retain discretion in granting relief under the APA, Defendants offer no reason that, in this case, it should depart from the ordinary practice of vacating the agency action found unlawful under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Even weighing the harms, as Defendants suggest, the balance does not net out in their favor. Indeed, while vacatur is warranted based on\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   deficiencies in the approval, as opposed to the Court's analysis of the merits of Kentucky HEALTH, it is worth noting here that many of Plaintiffs' objections to the program hinge on their concern that the demonstration project would cause a great deal of harm. In other words, the Court's holding turns on the Secretary's inadequate analysis of the likelihood of coverage loss and its consequences. In light of that, it is likely that vacatur would inflict less harm than allowing the project to take effect. As the Court explains in its Opinion today in\n   <em>\n    Gresham v. Azar\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-1900, Slip Opinion at 27-28, 32 (Mar. 27, 2019), the loss of Medicaid coverage is a substantial burden on Plaintiffs and others like them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   There is another exception to the ordinary course of vacatur under the APA, which Defendants do not press but the Court nevertheless considers. \"[A]lthough vacatur is the normal remedy, [courts] sometimes decline to vacate,\"\n   <em>\n    Allina Health Servs. v.

Rather than\n   follow that direction, the Secretary doubled down on his consideration of other aims of the Medicaid Act. Given a second failure to adequately consider one of Medicaid's central objectives, the Court has some question about HHS's ability to cure the defects in the approval. Vacatur would not, moreover, be especially disruptive. Unlike in Arkansas, Kentucky HEALTH has yet to take effect.

Other Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Plaintiffs raise a number of other issues, including that the Secretary acted in excess of statutory authority; that the SMD letter is an improperly promulgated substantive rule that should have been subject to notice and comment; and that they have a claim for relief under the Take Care Clause. As before, where Plaintiffs alleged a nearly identical set of additional claims, the Court \"need not tackle Plaintiffs' alternative bases for vacating some or all of the components\" of Kentucky HEALTH or the SMD letter \"[b]ecause [it] invalidates [the entire] approval\" of Kentucky HEALTH.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/#p243\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/#p243\">\n    at 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Vacating the reapproval will give Plaintiffs all the relief they seek. \"While those [other] questions may resurface on remand, they will not trouble the Court now.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/#p243\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   For these reasons, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment on Count VIII. It will also deny Defendants' Cross-Motions, vacate the Secretary's approval of Kentucky HEALTH, and remand to the agency.
