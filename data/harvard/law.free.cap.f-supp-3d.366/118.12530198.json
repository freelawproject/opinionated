McFADDEN, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Siqing Wang invested $ 500,000 in a U.S. business to qualify for an investor visa, but the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") declared her ineligible. The central issue was-and is still-whether proceeds from a loan are either \"cash\" or \"indebtedness\" under the regulation. Both USCIS and Ms. Wang filed motions for summary judgment. After a motions hearing, the Court finds that USCIS's interpretation of its own regulation is plainly erroneous because it conflicts with the language of the regulation and is unsupported by the regulation's history and USCIS's own precedent. So the Plaintiff's motion will be granted in part, and the Defendants' motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ms. Wang is a Chinese graduate student who wishes to become a permanent resident of the United States. CAR 207. She invested $ 500,000 in a U.S. business because she believed that this investment would make her eligible for permanent residency under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CAR 4-7. The $ 500,000 came from proceeds of a loan secured by property that Ms. Wang alleges that she owned jointly with her father. CAR 375-79, 395-411. Ms. Wang then invested $ 500,000 in a commercial enterprise designed to finance the renovation of the Jung Hotel, a historical hotel in New Orleans, Louisiana. CAR 562, 574.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Next, Ms. Wang filed an I-526 visa petition. CAR 4-6. In October 2015, USCIS approved the petition, concluding that she satisfied the requirements for an EB-5 immigrant investor visa. CAR 1257. But two months later, USCIS issued her a Notice of Intent to Revoke. CAR 1258-62. Upon further review, USCIS classified Ms.\n   Wang's EB-5 investment as \"indebtedness\" and determined that Ms. Wang failed \"to establish that she has an ownership interest in the asset used to secure the loan that is equal to the minimum capital investment of $ 500,000.\" CAR 1262. So it suggested that she had not invested enough capital to satisfy Section 1153(b)(5).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Responding to the Notice, Ms. Wang clarified that her father had given her his share of the loan proceeds. CAR 1264-65. Ms. Wang argued that because her interest in the property used to secure the loan was worth more than her own half of the loan proceeds, it was \"sufficient to secure her share\" of the loan. CAR 1265. USCIS was unconvinced. CAR 1283-88. Again, USCIS categorized Ms. Wang's $ 500,000 as indebtedness under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.6\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) because the money was from a loan.

But to what should the Court to defer? At the motions hearing, USCIS implied that the Court should defer to remarks made during USCIS's April 22, 2015 telephonic meeting with EB-5 stakeholders. Transcript of Motions Hearing (\"Tr.\") at 4. Then USCIS clarified and urged the Court to defer to its precedential decision,\n   <em>\n    Matter of Soffici\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20158\">\n    22 I. &amp; N.

In defining \"capital,\" Section 204.6(e) does make one distinction based on the means of acquisition: it expressly provides that \"[a]ssets acquired, directly or indirectly, by unlawful means (such as criminal activities) shall not be considered capital ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.6\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). So if the means of acquisition are unlawful, the assets are not capital under this statute. First, this unlawfully-acquired-assets provision is significant because it underscores the fact that the regulation makes no distinction based on whether an asset is acquired by a loan. This provision also contradicts USCIS's protestations that Ms. Wang's interpretation of \"cash\" would prevent USCIS from inquiring into how a petitioner acquired the invested assets. Petitioners must prove the lawful source of their investment funds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 204.6(j)(3). USCIS may investigate how a petitioner acquired the invested assets, as it did here, but it may not now impose additional requirements just because the assets are proceeds from a loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   USCIS suggests that its interpretation is necessary to ensure that investors comply with the regulation's requirement that Ms. Wang's own capital is placed \"at risk.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'
