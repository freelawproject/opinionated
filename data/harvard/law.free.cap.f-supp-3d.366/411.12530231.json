(Dkt. 1).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's mild respiratory complaints and depression were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-30). With respect to Plaintiff's representations that she suffered from right knee pain and left ankle pain, the ALJ concluded that these were not medically determinable impairments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 2.07, 11.03, and 1.02B in reaching his conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a range of light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.967\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), with the additional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   cannot work in hazardous environments, such as around heights or dangerous machinery; can do frequent but not constant reaching, handling, or fingering with right dominant upper extremity; can accomplish only routine and repetitive tasks, that would no[t] change much from day to day and would not require [Plaintiff] to remember or carry out complex or complicated types of activities; and can tolerate no more than occasional contact with the public either in person or over the phone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age. education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of price marker, cafeteria attendant, printed circuit board screener, and toy stuffer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act.

(Dkt. 6-1 at 1). For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the ALJ erred in failing to obtain any opinion evidence from an acceptable medical source, and decided the RFC based on his own interpretation of the medical record. This error necessitates remand for further administrative proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The RFC Finding is Unsupported by Substantial Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In deciding a disability claim, an ALJ is tasked with \"weigh[ing] all of the\n   evidence available to make an RFC finding that [is] consistent with the record as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Matta v.

For example, an April 2012 treatment note from Ellis Gomez, M.D., Plaintiff's primary care physician, noted that Plaintiff \"cannot lift, pull, push or carry. She cannot lift her arm above her head.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 311). Further, in May 2013, a physical examination by Dr. Gomez revealed that Plaintiff was unable to lift her right arm above shoulder level. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 318). The ALJ did not address these statements in the written determination. This evidence is favorable to Plaintiff and contrary to the assessed RFC, which requires Plaintiff to perform frequent reaching, handling, or fingering with her right dominant upper extremity. In other words, the record does not contain information relevant to Plaintiff's functional limitations sufficient to support the RFC finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant contends that \"[d]epending on the circumstances, such as where the evidence shows relatively minor impairments,\" an ALJ may assess the RFC without a medical assessment. (Dkt. 10-1 at 22). Defendant does not identify any specific evidence evincing that Plaintiff's severe impairments were \"minor.\" The Court is cognizant that \"when the medical evidence shows only minor physical\n   impairments,\" an ALJ may assess the RFC using \"common sense judgment about functional capacity even without a physician's assessment.\"\n   <em>\n    Jaeger-Feathers v.

The ALJ identified multiple severe impairments, including fibromyalgia with headaches and labyrinthitis and right shoulder tear post-surgical repair, and assessed an RFC with both physical and mental components. (Dkt. 5 at 27, 32-34). The record demonstrates that Plaintiff's shoulder pain was ongoing. Plaintiff underwent surgery - a right shoulder rotator cuff repair - in 2007 to address her shoulder pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28). Thereafter, an x-ray taken on May 19, 2016, revealed \"[p]ostsurgical changes of rotator cuff repair.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 407). Specifically, the x-ray showed that Plaintiff's \"AC joint [was] slightly widened,\" which \"may represent ligamentous injury.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ also found that the evidence supporting Plaintiff's diagnosis of fibromyalgia - which under the regulations must meet certain requirements to qualify as a medically determinable impairment - was favorable enough to qualify as a severe impairment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28). The record reveals that Plaintiff was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in October 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 307). In other words, Plaintiff's severe impairments were ongoing problems for which she received significant treatment, and a medical opinion relating to Plaintiff's functional limitations is required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zayas v.
