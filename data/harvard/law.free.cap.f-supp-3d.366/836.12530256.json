HANEN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case concerns the interpretation of an insurance contract. Plaintiffs Balfour Beatty Construction, LLC (\"Balfour Beatty\") and Milestone Metals, Inc. (\"Milestone\") sued Defendant Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company (\"Liberty Mutual\") in Texas state court, and Liberty Mutual removed the case to this Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship. Plaintiffs have pleaded claims for breach of contract (Count One) and violations of Section 541 and Section 542 of the Texas Insurance Code (Count Two). Presently before the Court are Plaintiffs' Partial Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 11] and Liberty Mutual's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 21]. For the reasons set forth below, the Court hereby grants Liberty Mutual's Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs' breach of contract claim. The Court denies Plaintiffs' Partial Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Undisputed Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In October 2015, Milestone completed welding work near the 18th floor of Energy Center 5, an office building then under construction in Houston.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The work consisted of welding a two-inch plate onto the existing building. Several months later, Milestone learned that welding slag\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   from its operations had fallen down the side of the building and damaged the glass on windows below. Milestone had not installed the windows. The windows had to be replaced, and this case concerns who is obligated to pay for that replacement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   With respect to the Energy Center 5 construction project, TCH Energy Corridor Venture, LLC (\"Trammell Crow\") was the developer. Balfour Beatty was the general contractor. Milestone was a subcontractor. Trammell Crow contracted with Balfour Beatty in July 2014. Balfour Beatty subcontracted with Milestone in August 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Trammell Crow-Balfour Beatty contract required Trammell Crow to acquire \"builder's risk\" insurance that would include the interests of Balfour Beatty and subcontractors in the project. Trammell\n   Crow procured such insurance from Liberty Mutual (the \"Insurance Policy\"). The Insurance Policy contains the following coverage provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    PROPERTY COVERED\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"We\" cover the following property unless the property is excluded or subject to limitations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Course of Construction --\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1.\n   <strong>\n    Coverage\n   </strong>\n   -- \"We\" cover direct physical loss or damage caused by a covered peril to \"buildings or structures\" while in the course of construction, erection, or fabrication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    PERILS COVERED\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"We\" cover risks of direct physical loss or damage\n   unless the loss is limited or caused by a peril that is excluded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After learning of the window damage, Trammell Crow, Balfour Beatty, and Milestone tendered a claim to Liberty Mutual, who denied the claim. As the basis for its denial, Liberty Mutual cited the following exclusion in the Insurance Policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    PERILS EXCLUDED\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   2. \"We\" do not pay for loss or damage that is caused by or results from one or more of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   c.\n   <strong>\n    Defects, Errors, And Omissions --\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   1)\n   <em>\n    \"We\" do not pay for loss or damage\n   </em>\n   consisting of,\n   <em>\n    caused by, or resulting from an act\n   </em>\n   , defect, error, or omission (negligent or not)\n   <em>\n    relating to\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   a) design, specifications,\n   <em>\n    construction\n   </em>\n   , materials,\n   <em>\n    or workmanship\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   b) planning, zoning, development, siting, surveying, grading, or compaction;\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   c) maintenance,\n   <em>\n    installation\n   </em>\n   , renovation, remodeling, or repair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    But if an act, defect, error, or omission as described above results in a covered peril, \"we\" do cover the loss or damage caused by that covered peril.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Emphasis added). The Court will refer to section 2(c)(1), except for the final sentence, as the \"Defects, Errors, and Omissions\" clause. The Court will refer to the final sentence (\"But if an act, defect, error, or omission as described above results in a covered peril, 'we' do cover the loss or damage caused by that covered peril.\") as the \"exception\" to the Defects, Errors, and Omissions clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II. Summary Judgment Standard\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Summary judgment is warranted \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The \"interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law for a court to determine.\"\n   <em>\n    Am. Home Assurance Co. v. Cat Tech L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3844180\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/660/216/#p220\">\n    660 F.3d 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 220 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Am.

The Insurance Policy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Since the Insurance Policy broadly covers \"risks of direct physical loss or damage unless the loss is limited or caused by a peril that is excluded,\" the dispute in this case centers around an exclusion from that broad coverage and an exception from the exclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is the Defects, Errors, and Omissions exclusion-the exclusion on which Liberty Mutual based its denial of coverage-that is at issue. Plaintiffs argue that the Defects, Errors, and Omissions exclusion does not exclude their claim. Even if it did exclude their claim, according to Plaintiffs, the exception to the exclusion would reinstate coverage. This Court reluctantly disagrees. The Court finds that the Defects, Errors, and Omissions clause excludes coverage for Plaintiffs' claim and that the exception does not reinstate coverage. Liberty Mutual's denial of Plaintiffs' claim was accordingly proper, and Liberty Mutual is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A. Interpreting Insurance Contracts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The parties agree that Texas law governs this diversity suit. \"Texas law provides that insurance policies are construed according to common principles governing the construction of contracts....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3782474\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/620/558/#p562\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Under Texas law, \"[i]nsurance policy interpretation principles emphasize a policy's plain language in determining its intended coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Gilbert Tex.

According to Plaintiffs, if an insured's work damages other parts of the construction site on which the insured was not working, then the Defects, Errors, and Omissions exclusion does not apply.

The Supreme Court held that it could not, stating that \"few ordinary people would imagine that [the ensuing loss clause] changes the meaning of the first sentence to read 'We\n   <em>\n    do too\n   </em>\n   cover loss caused by mold.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8463857\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/202/744/#p746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8463857\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/202/744/#p746\">\n    at 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in the original). While the exception in the Insurance Policy does not contain the words \"ensuing loss\" (although both parties nonetheless refer to it as an \"ensuing loss\" clause), the principle that the exception ordinarily will not be taken to negate or swallow the exclusion is still relevant. Few ordinary people would imagine that the exception changes the meaning of the exclusion to read \"We\n   <em>\n    do too\n   </em>\n   cover loss ... caused by, or resulting from an act ... or omission (negligent or not) relating to ... construction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   There is only one instance of loss or damage in this case: the damage to the windows. The language of the exception, however, suggests that there needs to be at least two loss events. Parsing the exclusion, we find: \"But if an act, defect, error, or omission as described above\"-that is, an excluded peril-\"\n   <em>\n    results in\n   </em>\n   a covered peril,\" then the loss or damage caused by the covered peril is covered (emphasis added). The language, then, calls for (1) an excluded peril that (2) \"results in\" a covered peril. Since a peril cannot be simultaneously excluded and covered, the clause must be referring to two separate perils, one excluded and one covered. The Court finds that the \"results in\" language is not ambiguous and is capable of being given a definite meaning, although the Court acknowledges that there is a recent decision, albeit vacated pursuant to an agreed motion of the parties, reaching the contrary conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204026346\">\n    2018 WL 4026346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (finding a nearly identical exception ambiguous \"[b]ecause the phrase 'results in' is susceptible to more than one interpretation\"). In this case, there is only the excluded peril, namely the act relating to construction. Liberty Mutual suggests an apt example of when there might be a resulted-in, covered peril. If \"an act, defect, error, or omission (negligent or not) relating to ... construction\" caused holes in the windows, and a subsequent rainstorm caused water to enter through the holes and damage the interior finishes,\n   then there would be an excluded peril (the act relating to construction) resulting in a covered peril (water entering through the holes and damaging the interior).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiffs rely on\n   <em>\n    Bartram\n   </em>\n   to explain their theory, but\n   <em>\n    Bartram\n   </em>\n   in reality illuminates why Liberty Mutual prevails.

In\n   <em>\n    Nay\n   </em>\n   , the court first found that a nearly identical Defects, Errors, and Omissions exclusion applied where a subcontractor removed or slackened guy wires attached to a grain elevator that was under construction, causing the grain elevator to fall over in the wind.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1, *4.

First, as mentioned above, the court found the \"results in\" language ambiguous, allowing the insured's interpretation to prevail as long as it was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, the court found that the policy's protections would be \"largely illusory\" under the insurance company's interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.

The Court has not found it necessary to rule upon Lozano's affidavit because its ruling on the pending motions would be the same whether it granted or denied Liberty Mutual's objections.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    note 9. Instead, the Court has recited the facts that the parties have all agreed to in their briefing.

The facts of the case at bar, however, make the application of\n    <em>\n     North American Shipbuilding\n    </em>\n    somewhat dubious. This is not a case of faulty workmanship leading to a second, separate loss event (in fact, the Defects, Errors, and Omissions exclusion applies whether the act was \"negligent or not,\" so there need not even be any fault or negligence). Under the current record, there was no faulty workmanship like the poor-quality welds in\n    <em>\n     North American Shipbuilding\n    </em>\n    or twisted vessel hull in\n    <em>\n     Trinity Industries\n    </em>\n    (a case quoted at length by\n    <em>\n     North American Shipbuilding\n    </em>\n    ) at all.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022612\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/930/829/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 831 ;\n    <em>\n     Trinity Indus., Inc. v.

Even if the Court assumes\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    that Lozano's affidavit is admissible, the affidavit at best implies that high winds were a factor in causing the loss-i.e., that while the slag was free falling, wind blew it into the windows (as opposed to a scenario where the slag dropped directly on the windows as a result of the welding). Lozano Aff. 1.
