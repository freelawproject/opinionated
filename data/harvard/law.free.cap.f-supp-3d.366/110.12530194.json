Federal regulations require valid permits to import these reptiles. One of Global's permits was invalid, so the U.S. Department of the Interior (the \"Department\") directed the company to pay a $ 15,000 penalty. Global now challenges that fine. Because the Court finds that the decision to fine Global complied with applicable laws, it will grant the Defendants summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (\"CITES\") is a multilateral treaty that seeks to protect plants and animals at risk of extinction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   27 U.S.T. 1087 (1973).

And it was strictly liable for any resulting legal violations. Because it sought to import animals covered by CITES into the United States, the company was required by law to present a valid permit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2023.20\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). That it was Majoka's action that rendered the permit invalid is irrelevant. Global was no less responsible for the permit than if the company had itself made an error on the form.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2013.50\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 13.50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Global also argues that the Department inappropriately relied on a vicarious liability theory to hold the company liable for Majoka's actions. Pl.'s Mot. at 6. Not so. As Global notes, vicarious liability is liability that a \"supervisory party bears for actionable conduct of a subordinate or associate because of the relationship between the two parties.\" Pl.'s Opp. at 5 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   927 (7th ed. 1999) ). Vicarious liability rules ordinarily require a principal-agent or employer-employee relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meyer v. Holley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191020\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/280/#p285\">\n    537 U.S. 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 285,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191020\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/280/#p285\">\n    123 S.Ct. 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191020\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/280/#p285\">\n    154 L.Ed.2d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Department did not find or even allege such a relationship. Nor did it suggest that Global was vicariously liable for another party's violation of the applicable laws. For instance, the Notice of Assessment states that \"[c]ommercial respondents, such as Respondent, are held to a\n   <em>\n    strict liability\n   </em>\n   standard under the ESA.... Therefore, Respondent is liable.\" J.A. 226 (emphasis added). Similarly, the ALJ noted that it is \"Global that 'holds' the permit\" and \"[c]onsequently, by regulatory imputation, the violator for this failure is not Majorca [sic]; rather, the legal violator is Global.\" J.A. 47. In other words,\n   because it held the export permit, \"Global became strictly liable for the ensuing violation.\" J.A. 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Next, the company argues that the Court should not use \"judicial gap-findings\" to read into the ESA a vicarious liability provision. Pl.'s Mot. at 9. While the ESA does not specifically address the Department's ability to impose fines based on vicarious liability, it is unambiguous on strict liability. Thus, the Court need not read any language into the statute to confirm that the Department's decision was permissible and sufficiently justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The rest of Global's arguments fail for the same reasons. It claims that the Department violated the company's \"substantive due process right and privilege by imputing a legal wrong committed by Majoka and assessing a civil penalty upon Global.\" Compl. 5 (alleging violations of the Constitution and of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(B) ). It also suggests that the fine was \"unsupported by substantial evidence\" and \"unwarranted by the facts.\" Compl. 6 (alleging violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(E-F) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   But again, nothing in the record supports the contention that the Department imposed vicarious liability on the firm. Instead, the evidence shows that the Department faulted Global for its own act-trying to import the reptiles without a valid form. The ESA and the Department's regulations authorized this finding. And in assessing the fine, the Department considered the CITES permit, the applicable law, and Global's arguments.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 224-240. Its decision was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, Global \"requests joinder of Majoka under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1)(B)(ii).\" Pl.'s Mot. at 12. The company believes that since Majoka was the \"applicant\" of the permit, and since it was the party that failed to sign the form, it is a required party in the litigation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    at 12-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This argument misunderstands Rule 19. That rule would require adding Majoka to the case only if Majoka's absence would create a \"substantial risk\" that Global would incur \"inconsistent obligations\" because of Majoka's interest in the case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a). But Majoka has no interest at stake. As explained above, the Department did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   fine Global because of Majoka's failure to sign the permit. It imposed the penalty because of Global's failure to present a valid permit at the airport. More, Global is the plaintiff. As the master of its Complaint, Global could have named Majoka as a co-defendant if it so wished. Rule 19 is not the appropriate tool for arguing that the Department ought to have assessed its penalty against Majoka.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In sum, the Department's decision to impose a fine on Global was reasonable, sufficiently explained, and permissible under applicable law.
