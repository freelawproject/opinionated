They did. Two years later, Jane Roe complained to GW that she had been sexually assaulted because she had obviously been too drunk to consent. After a hearing before a panel convened by GW, Mr. Doe was found responsible for sexual assault and suspended for one year. Mr. Doe appealed and was rebuffed. He then sued GW in this Court for gender-based discrimination in violation of Title IX and the D.C. Human Rights Act, as well as for breach of contract and negligence. The parties have already navigated motions for preliminary injunction and partial summary judgment, as well as a Court-mandated appeal before a GW appeals panel. The appeals panel having affirmed the hearing panel's decision, Mr. Doe has now filed an amended complaint. GW moves to dismiss all claims. That motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Apr. 28, 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For the purposes of GW's motion to dismiss, the Court does not need to address whether GW's initial investigation of Ms. Roe's complaint was adequate or whether the decision of the Hearing Panel was correct, since on appeal any defects could have been addressed and remedied. Instead, the question now is whether the decision by GW's Appeals Panel, which considered the new evidence and decided that a new hearing was not appropriate, was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Complicating this analysis is the ambiguous standard of review applied by the Appeals Panel. GW exhorts the Court to defer to the factual findings of the Appeals Panel, but the Hearing Panel was the factfinder in this case, not the Appeals Panel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. at 10 n.3 (arguing that \"credibility determin[ations] are left solely to the discretion of the finder of fact, which in this case was the hearing panel\"). Indeed, that the Appeals Panel was not itself a factfinder is emphasized by the limited remedies available to it: even with new evidence, it could not make a factual finding\n   <em>\n    contrary\n   </em>\n   to the Hearing Panel but could only remand to the Hearing Panel or a new panel for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00b6 35. While the Appeals Panel did receive written statements from both Mr. Doe and Ms. Roe concerning the new evidence, the Appeals Panel did not itself hear directly from any witness, new or otherwise; it could not properly make credibility determinations as between or among witnesses. The Code does state that \"[a]ppeals must be based on new information that ... significantly alters the finding of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. But without a factfinding function, or insight into credibility, the Appeals Panel could not be tasked to decide whether the new evidence did, in fact, significantly alter the finding of fact (that would be the role of a hearing panel on remand), and reading the Code in this way would seem to frustrate the entire appeals process and deny appellants meaningful review. Rather, this standard can only be reconciled with the authority and practice of the Appeals Panel if the Appeals Panel was actually tasked with determining whether the new evidence\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   significantly alter the facts, given the totality of the cold evidence under review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mr. Doe describes his count for breach of contract as six different claims. Three of the claims, related to incapacity (Count III.A), SAC \u00b6\u00b6 309-13, the preponderance standard (Count III.B),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 314-18, and the adequacy of the investigation (Count III.D),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 323-26, deal with infirmities in the investigative and hearing panel process which have been mooted by the Appeals Panel's superseding decision, and so\n   will be dismissed. Mr. Doe's retaliation claim (Count. III.F),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 333-38, argues that GW failed to punish Ms. Roe for statements she made related to the case. This claim is sparsely pled, however, and Mr. Doe does not allege that he has a contractual right to have GW enforce the confidentiality provisions of the Code against Ms. Roe. It, too, will be dismissed. However, to the extent these claims overlap with Mr. Doe's claim that the Appeals Panel's ultimate decision was improper (Count III.E),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   327-32, they are consolidated and addressed with that claim below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mr. Doe also claims that he had insufficient opportunity to challenge Hearing Panel member Ms. Witkowicki, the Director of Greek Life, for bias (Count III.C).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 319-22. The Code states that \"[a]ny party may challenge a Board member on the grounds of personal bias before the hearing commences.\" Code \u00b6 27.g. Mr. Doe alleges that Ms. Witkowicki has a background which evidences biased thinking and would have objected to her presence on the panel. SAC \u00b6 134. Mr. Doe further alleges that he was only told the identities of the members of the Hearing Panel when he arrived for the hearing itself and that he had no meaningful opportunity to review their backgrounds or object.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 133. This Court does not infer that Ms. Witkowicki's background showed any bias or whether she should have been disqualified as panelist. It is sufficient that Mr. Doe alleges that the University failed to give him a meaningful opportunity to challenge the members of the panel, contrary to the Code. GW's motion to dismiss this claim will be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Only Count III.E-Mr. Doe's claim that the Appeals Panel improperly denied his appeal-remains to be addressed. Giving Mr. Doe, as plaintiff, the benefit of his factual allegations and all reasonable inferences therefrom, the Court cannot reconcile the facts of this case with the Appeals Panel's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   First, the Appeals Panel considered the phone records belonging to Ms. Roe and her friend E.E. and determined that they \"did not significantly alter the finding of fact because the phone records supported [E.E.]'s statement that a phone call occurred in the Uber ride.\" Appeals Decision at 1. However, the phone records showed that Ms. Roe had neither called nor received a call from E.E. SAC \u00b6 219. Ms. Roe may have called her roommate A.C., but, as alleged, A.C. had already left the party for their dorm and was not with E.E. at the time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, E.E. could not possibly have known whether any phone call occurred during the Uber ride, much less actually had a conversation with Ms. Roe during that ride.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Ms. Roe may have placed a call to A.C. during the Uber ride, which the Appeals Panel believed \"directly contradicted [Mr. Doe's] testimony that no phone call occurred during the Uber ride.\" Appeals Decision at 1. But as described by Mr. Doe,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [w]hen a Verizon subscriber's call goes unanswered for under a minute before hanging up, it is recorded on the subscriber's bill as a one-minute outgoing call. The 12:06 a.m. call to A.C. would thus be recorded on Ms. Roe's records in exactly the same way whether or not A.C. ever answered, and therefore whether or not Ms. Roe ever said a word.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   SAC \u00b6 119. At the point of a motion to dismiss, Mr. Doe is also entitled to all reasonable inferences that may be drawn\n   from his factual allegations. Together with Mr. Doe's allegation that Ms. Roe did not speak with anyone during the Uber ride,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73, the Court gives him the benefit of the reasonable inference that Ms. Roe's call to A.C. went unanswered and that no conversation took place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Hearing Panel's decision gave significant credit to E.E.'s testimony regarding Ms. Roe's state of notable intoxication during the Uber ride. The totality of the evidence before the Appeals Panel indicates that E.E. never spoke to Ms. Doe; certainly, a one-minute or unanswered call to A.C. does not corroborate E.E.'s testimony. The Appeals Panel excused the failure of evidence as a mere memory lapse by Ms. Roe, who, it concluded (contrary to the Hearing Panel), may have been confused about whom she called from the Uber. However, there is no evidence that Ms. Roe had any recollection of talking to anyone during the Uber ride, at least not prior to the hearing when she heard E.E.'s statements asserting that E.E. had talked with Ms. Roe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 143. If there were other bases for the Appeals Panel to dismiss the potential impact of E.E.'s erroneous testimony, it did not state them. GW's motion to dismiss fails to explain how the Appeals Panel could reasonably scramble the facts and ignore the errors in E.E.'s testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, the Appeals Panel reviewed Dr. Milman's expert toxicology report. Advised by Mr. Doe that Ms. Roe was approximately 65 inches tall and weighed somewhere between 140-150 pounds, Dr. Milman estimated that Ms. Roe's BAC would have been between 0.26 and 0.37. He opined that at the midpoint BAC of 0.32, she would have had total memory loss and substantial motor impairment. The Appeals Panel discounted Dr. Milman's opinion, however, because he received the wrong height and weight for Ms. Roe-she is actually 70 inches tall and estimates she weighed around 170 pounds at the time of the alleged assault.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 226.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After finding that Dr. Milman's calculations were based on incorrect assumptions, the Appeals Panel was not required to calculate a new BAC based on its own lay knowledge. That said, the Appeals Panel only decided that Dr. Milman's assumptions were incorrect because Ms. Roe was permitted to submit supplemental statements in response to Mr. Doe's appeal. GW argues that no provision of the Code was violated when it invited Ms. Roe to file supplemental statements. The Code states, however, that the \"decision to grant or deny the appeal will be based on information supplied in the written appeal and, when necessary, the record of the original proceedings.\" Code \u00b6 34;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 189, 192-97. Ms. Roe's actual height and weight were not in the record prior to the appeal or supplied in Mr. Doe's written appeal. Further, the pleadings do not state that GW provided Mr. Doe with a chance to respond to Ms. Roe's supplemental statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without more information on how appeals are normally conducted, this apparent irregularity is glaring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Third, the Appeals Panel discounted the statement of Mr. Roe's witness, Q.W., because the statement was submitted after the hearing and \"did not outweigh other evidence offered by the parties.\" Appeals Decision at 1. By definition, some evidence before an appeals panel will always be new and thus \"late.\" Further, Q.W. had a reason for submitting his statement late: he was studying abroad when the Hearing Panel convened. In any event, it is not the place of either this Court or the Appeals\n   Panel to weigh the Q.W.'s credibility relative to the other witnesses on a cold record. That factfinding is reserved for a hearings panel. GW does not address the roles of the Hearing and Appeals Panels in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Fourth and finally, the Appeals Panel addressed newly-discovered text messages between Ms. Roe and A.C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the texts, A.C. had no recollection of talking to Ms. Roe either during the Uber ride or in the bathroom of the dorm after Ms. Roe returned. Without explanation, the Appeals Panel found that this evidence \"generally corroborate[d]\" Ms. Roe's statements that she had spoken with someone on the phone during the Uber ride and that she had spoken to A.C. about the assault when she got back to the dorm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. This conclusion is divorced from the evidence and not explained by GW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   To put a finer point on the matter, the Code required two determinations: (1) Ms. Roe did not have the capacity to consent; and (2) Mr. Doe should reasonably have known that she was incapacitated. The Appeals Panel was presented with direct contradictions in the evidence and appears to have strained to overlook such contradictions, leaving no trail of reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Of course, members of the Appeals Panel are neither lawyers nor judges, and their decisions may not require much explanation. Nonetheless, to warrant deference, such a decision must provide enough reasoning to avoid being arbitrary and capricious. The bar Mr. Doe must clear on a motion to dismiss is low. The motion to dismiss will be denied on the breach of contract claim to the extent it relates to the denial of his appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Title IX\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Title IX provides, in pertinent part, that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any education program or activity\" that receives federal funding.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

As discussed above, Mr. Doe has cast \"articulable doubt\" on the outcome of disciplinary proceeding; the remaining question is whether there was a relationship between that outcome and gender bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Second and Sixth Circuits have identified possible indicia of gender bias that may affect the outcome of a disciplinary proceeding. In\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Columbia University\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit found that local criticism of the school's prior tolerance of sexual assaults against female students, combined with an alleged motivation to demonstrate that the school was \"serious about protecting female students from sexual assault by male students,\" was sufficient\n   to support an inference of discriminatory intent.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055185\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/46/#p57\">\n    831 F.3d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57 (2d Cir. 2016). By comparison, in\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Baum\n   </em>\n   the Sixth Circuit found that alleged public attention and an ongoing federal investigation that \"put pressure on the university to prove that it took complaints of sexual misconduct seriously\" provided only background context for a Title IX claim.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518564\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/575/#p586\">\n    903 F.3d 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 586 (6th Cir. 2018). However, because that context included an additional allegation-that the university's hearing panel had credited all testimony by women and no testimony by men-the Sixth Circuit found sufficient basis to support an inference of discriminatory intent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518564\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/575/#p586\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518564\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/575/#p586\">\n    at 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

This allegation is fatal to his claim because without showing that women go through the same disciplinary process and receive disproportionately different outcomes, there is no showing of disparate impact; there is no comparator group.
