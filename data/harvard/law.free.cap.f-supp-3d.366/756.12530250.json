Oct. 17, 2016) (unpublished).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As for Cape Fear's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, Cape Fear argues that Boney fails to plausibly allege that it took any adverse action against her or that it acted on the basis of her sex.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 20] 12-15. Boney, who is a member of a protected class, focuses on three allegations: (1) Lakhavani disregarded her suggestions on at least two occasions but not similar suggestions made by a male coworker, (2) Lakhavani increased his supervision of Boney, and (3) Boney was the only female manager in Cape Fear's IT department and the only manager who was \"discharged\" after Lakhavani became director.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2dAm. Compl. [D.E. 11] \u00b6\u00b6 46-48. The second allegation is conclusory, and the court need not accept it as true. The first and third allegations, while possibly \"consistent with discrimination,\" do not \"alone support a reasonable inference that\" sex discrimination motivated these actions.\n   <em>\n    McCleary-Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072687\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/582/#p585\">\n    780 F.3d at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted). Moreover, the third allegation assumes that Cape Fear actually or constructively discharged Boney. Boney does not allege the former, and the latter is a legal conclusion that is not entitled to an assumption of truth. Thus, the court grants the motion to dismiss Boney's Title VII sex discrimination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Alternatively, Boney has not plausibly alleged an adverse employment action. Under Title VII, an \"adverse employment action is a discriminatory act that adversely affects the terms, conditions, or benefits of the plaintiff's employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Holland v. Wash. Homes, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3106998\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/208/#p219\">\n    487 F.3d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219 (4th Cir. 2007) (alteration and quotation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9244231\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/371/#p375\">\n    368 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   375 ;\n   <em>\n    Coleman v. Altec, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-CV-954-D, 2018 WL4289610, at *6 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 7, 2018) (unpublished) (collecting cases). As discussed, Boney has not plausibly alleged that Cape Fear's actions had a material adverse effect on the terms, conditions, or benefits of her employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McDougal-Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3103335\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/427/595/#p611\">\n    427 F.Supp.2d at 609-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, Boney has not plausibly alleged constructive discharge. Accordingly, the court grants Cape Fear's motion to dismiss Boney's Title VII sex discrimination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Boney alleges a Title VII retaliation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Compl. [D.E. 11] \u00b6\u00b6 51-57. Cape Fear did not move to dismiss this claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 19] 1. In Cape Fear's reply, Cape Fear argues that Boney's claim is not plausible because Boney has failed to allege that any decisionmaker knew of her meeting with Smith to discuss her fear that Lakhavani was discriminating against her on the basis of her age and sex.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 23] 6-8. Whatever the merits of this argument, Cape Fear did not move to dismiss Boney's Title VII retaliation claim. Thus, the claim survives. Whether the claim will survive a motion for summary judgment is an issue for another day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In sum, the court DENIES as moot Cape Fear's motion to dismiss [D.E. 16], GRANTS Cape Fear's amended motion to\n   dismiss [D.E. 19], and DISMISSES Boney's ADEA and Title VII sex discrimination claims.
