(Dkt. 1). This Court has jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Presently before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Dkt. 17; Dkt. 22), and Plaintiff's reply (Dkt. 23). For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiff's motion (Dkt. 17) is granted in part, the Commissioner's motion (Dkt. 22) is denied, and the matter is remanded to the Commissioner for further administrative proceedings consistent with this Decision and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff protectively filed her application for DIB on November 18, 2015.

A second hearing was held before the ALJ in Buffalo, New York, on March 7, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22, 44-96). On June 26, 2017, the ALJ issued an unfavorable decision.

If so, the claimant is not disabled.

Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff meets the insured status requirements of the Act through December 31, 2020. (Dkt. 7 at 24). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff engaged in substantial gainful work activity from January 3, 2017, through at least the date of the March 7, 2017 administrative hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, the ALJ further concluded that there was a continuous twelve-month period during which Plaintiff did not engage in substantial gainful activity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of: \"stage III breast cancer with chemotherapy induced neuropathy ; Wolf Parkinson White syndrome ('WPW'); lumbago; obesity ; borderline personality disorder ; and adjustment disorder.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairment of right lateral femoral cutaneous nerve paresthesia was non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 1.04, 4.05, 13.10, 12.04, and 12.08 in reaching his conclusion, as well as considering the effect of Plaintiff's obesity as required by Social Security Ruling (\"SSR\") 02-1p. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a range of light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), with the additional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   could lift and carry 20 pounds occasionally, 10 pounds frequently, sit for six hours in an eight-hour workday and stand or walk for four hours in an eight-hour workday.

She is limited to frequent handling of objects bilaterally and frequent fingering of objects bilaterally. [Plaintiff] could tolerate no direct exposure to chemicals, no concentrated exposure to irritants such as odors, fumes, dusts, gases and poor ventilation and no exposure to hazards such as unprotected heights or moving machinery.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of office helper, mailroom clerk,\n   and ticket taker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act.

Bauer, M.D. and Jennifer Hydeman, Ph.D.; and (4) the ALJ failed to properly assess Plaintiff's \"symptom intensity.\" (Dkt. 17-1 at 1). In her reply brief, Plaintiff raises another argument; that is, the ALJ failed to identify and resolve a conflict between the VE testimony and the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. (Dkt. 23 at 8). For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the ALJ erred in evaluating the opinion evidence of Dr. Bauer, and that this error necessitates remand for further administrative proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Assessment of Treating Physician Opinions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because Plaintiff's claim was filed before March 27, 2017, the ALJ was required to apply the treating physician rule, under which a treating physician's opinion is entitled to \"controlling weight\" when it is \"well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the] case record[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

Dr. Bauer explained that Plaintiff had severe impairments that were expected to last for at least twelve months due to the fact that she was \"undergoing chemotherapy with severe side effects and now is undergoing surgery that will have post op limitations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The ALJ gave \"limited weight\" to Dr. Bauer's opinion that Plaintiff is \"very limited\" in \"lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, bending and in stairs or other climbing.\" (Dkt. 7 at 32). The ALJ explained that Dr. Bauer's report does not define the meaning of \"very limited,\" which rendered his assessment \"not particularly helpful.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Further, the ALJ noted that Dr. Bauer completed the assessment while Plaintiff was undergoing chemotherapy, \"during which her condition was presumably its worst but had improved significantly several months later.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ elaborated that \"[e]ven while undergoing chemotherapy, claimant reported to Dr. Zali, that she was independent with dressing and bathing, grooming, cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, shopping, managing money and driving.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The RFC, which requires Plaintiff to lift and carry twenty pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently, occasionally climb ramps or stairs, and frequently stoop, appears to conflict with Dr. Bauer's opinion that Plaintiff is \"very limited\" in her ability to lift, carry, bend, and do stairs or other climbing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because the ALJ did not afford controlling weight to Dr. Bauer's opinion, he was required to consider certain factors - including the frequency of examination and the length, nature, and extent of the treatment relationship; the evidence in support of Dr. Bauer's opinion; the consistency of Dr. Bauer's opinion with the record as a whole; whether Dr. Bauer is a specialist; and any other factors brought to the Social Security Administration's attention that tend to support or contradict the opinion - in determining what weight to afford Dr. Bauer's opinion.\n   <em>\n    Halloran,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263224\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/28/#p32\">\n    362 F.3d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The ALJ did not explicitly discuss these factors in the written determination, nor is it apparent to the Court that the ALJ\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   considered these factors when evaluating Dr. Bauer's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For example, the written determination does not discuss that Plaintiff began seeing Dr. Bauer in November 2015, soon after her cancer diagnoses in September 2015, and six months before Dr. Bauer assessed her functional limitations. Therefore, Dr. Bauer would have been familiar with the scope of Plaintiff's medical conditions and the extent of her limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schisler v. Heckler,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1560753\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/787/76/#p81\">\n    787 F.2d 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 81 (2d Cir. 1986) (the opinion of a treating physician is entitled to some extra weight because \"the treating physician is usually more familiar with a claimant's medical condition than are other physicians[.]\"). Likewise, the ALJ failed to consider Dr. Bauer's surgery specialty. Dr. Bauer's specialty was important in his ability to assess her limitations, given that Plaintiff underwent a mastectomy - performed by Dr. Bauer - as a part of her cancer treatment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7 at 815, 824). Dr. Bauer's April 2016 opinion specifically states that Plaintiff's surgery would cause post-operative limitations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 359). Nor does the written determination discuss the evidence supporting Dr. Bauer's opinion, or the consistency of Dr. Bauer's opinion with the record as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court is cognizant that an ALJ is not required to engage in a \"slavish recitation\" of each of the above-mentioned factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atwater v.

However, in this case, it is not apparent from the written determination that the ALJ considered any of the requisite factors in determining the weight to be afforded to Dr. Bauer's opinion.

Mar. 30, 2017) (remand required where ALJ failed to acknowledge or consider consistency between findings of treating source and those of other sources).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Further, the ALJ failed to give \"good reasons\" for discounting the opinion of Dr. Bauer. One of the reasons identified by the ALJ for affording less than controlling weight to Dr. Bauer's opinion - that Plaintiff was undergoing chemotherapy at the time Dr. Bauer completed the April 2016 assessment and she improved thereafter - is not a \"good reason,\" when examined in light of the entire record. The other opinion evidence in the record relevant to Plaintiff's physical limitations was offered by Donna Miller, D.O. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7 at 668-71). Dr. Miller opined that Plaintiff had mild to moderate limitations for heavy lifting, bending, carrying, reaching, pushing, and pulling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 671). The ALJ gave Dr. Miller's opinion \"some weight,\" as his opinion was \"generally consistent with the claimant's treatment history,\" and because Dr. Miller's \"objective findings on physical examination ... generally support his conclusion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32). Like Dr. Bauer's opinion, Dr. Miller's assessment appears to have been completed at the time Plaintiff was undergoing chemotherapy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 668 (\"She states presently she is in chemotherapy.\") ). However, the ALJ did not find that Plaintiff's chemotherapy treatment somehow exacerbated the results of Dr. Miller's assessment. In other words, the ALJ's presumption regarding the effect of Plaintiff's chemotherapy on her physical functional limitations is inconsistently applied across the opinion\n   evidence in the record, and it therefore cannot constitute a good reason for discounting the opinion of Dr. Bauer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The other reason given by the ALJ for discounting the opinion of Dr. Bauer is that his assessment does not define the meaning of the term \"very limited,\" rendering the assessment \"not particularly helpful.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32). Dr. Bauer found that Plaintiff was \"very limited\" in several areas of functioning - including lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, bending, and in doing stairs or other climbing. Given that Dr. Bauer found Plaintiff to be \"very limited\" in three of eight areas of physical functioning, and the only other opinion evidence relevant to Plaintiff's physical functional limitations was from a consultative examiner, who did not have the benefit of Plaintiff's treatment history, the ALJ should have re-contacted Dr. Bauer to gain clarification on the meaning of the term \"very limited.\" In other words, the ALJ's finding that almost half of the functional limitations identified by Dr. Bauer were vague, or \"not particularly helpful,\" creates a gap in the record that the ALJ was required to develop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fontanez v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-CV-01300 (PKC),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204334127\">\n    2017 WL 4334127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20160048\">\n    2017 U.S. Dist.
