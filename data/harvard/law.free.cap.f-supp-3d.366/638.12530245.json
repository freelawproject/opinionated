(Doc. 1.) Four motions are pending before the Court: a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendants Robyn Novitsky and Village Auto Sales (Doc. 9); a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Patricia Novitsky (Doc. 44); and cross-motions for summary judgment (Docs. 17, 47) filed by Plaintiff in response to Defendants' filings. With their motions, Defendants request a declaration that the amount of underinsured motorist coverage under their policy with Selective Insurance Company of America at the time of the accident which occurred on May 24, 2017, is $ 1,000,000 combined single limit. (Doc. 9 at 11; Doc. 44 at 10.) In the Complaint and cross-motions (Docs. 1, 17, 47), Plaintiff seeks a declaration that the available underinsured motorist coverage is $ 35,000. For the reasons discussed below, the Court concludes that Plaintiff's cross-motions are properly granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     II.

Robyn Novitsky is the executrix of the Estate of Kevin Novitsky. (Doc. 10 \u00b6 2; Doc. 20 \u00b6 2.) Patricia Novitsky is the executrix of the Estate of Clement Novitsky. (Doc. 44-1 \u00b6 2; Doc. 50 \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 17, 2017, decedents Clement and Kevin Novitsky (father and son) purchased a vehicle on behalf of their business, Village Auto Sales, Inc., at the ABC Auction of Lancaster. (Doc. 10 \u00b6\u00b6 19-20; Doc. 20 \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.) After they purchased the vehicle, a 2008 Nissan Rogue, the dealer tags/license plates for Village Auto Sales, Inc., were placed on it for transport back to Village Auto Sales, Inc., in Scott Township, Pennsylvania. (Doc. 10 \u00b6 22; Doc. 40 \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While traveling north on Interstate 81 in the 2008 Nissan Rogue, driver Kevin Novitsky stopped the car behind several stopped vehicles ahead of him when the car was hit from behind by a tractor-trailer driven by Brian Barrett and owned by Jason J. Barry. (Doc. 10 \u00b6 24; Doc. 20 \u00b6 24.) The Nissan Rogue was pushed forward into the car in front of it and both the tractor trailer and Nissan Rogue became engulfed in flames. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Both Clement and Kevin Novitsky were trapped in the Nissan Rogue and burned alive. (Doc. 10 \u00b6 25; Doc. 20 \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The tractor trailer operated by Brian Barrett and owned by Jason J.

(Doc. 10 \u00b6\u00b6 29, 30; Doc. 20 \u00b6\u00b6 29, 30.) The \"Garage Coverage Declaration\" for the policy indicates the \"Covered Auto Symbol\" for \"Underinsured Motorists\" Coverage is 22. (Doc. 10 \u00b6 32; Doc. 20 \u00b6 32.) The 2008 Nissan Rogue was a \"covered auto\" under the operative policy for purposes of underinsured motorist coverage.

We note that Black's Law Dictionary defines \"application\" in the context of\n   insurance as \"[t]he preliminary request, declaration, or statement made by a party applying for an insurance policy....\" Black's Law Dictionary 90 (5th ed. 1979).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   The record is clear that the insured never applied for original coverage with Pennland. That is, she never made a preliminary request, declaration or statement in regard to the insurance policy at issue after it was transferred to Pennland. In fact, it would have been impossible for the insured to have done so because the policy held by Pennland was exactly the same policy held by Harleysville. It is undisputed that the insured's policy remained in effect and unchanged when it was transferred to Pennland. In addition, the record is clear that she was provided with notice as to the available UM/UIM coverage prior to her first renewal after October 1, 1984, when the policy at issue was held by Harleysville. Therefore, we find that based on the express language of Section 1791, the legislature did not intend for another \"Important Notice\" to be sent to the insured by Pennland in this situation. Accordingly, we reject the insured's argument that Pennland was required to provide her with an \"Important Notice\" form pursuant to Section 1791.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Considering all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the insured, we find that the evidence proved waiver as a matter of law in regard to her UM/UIM coverage. Accordingly, we find that the lower court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the insured knowingly and voluntarily reduced her UM/UIM coverage in writing and granted summary judgment in favor of Pennland.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7860949,736358\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/675/353/\">\n    675 A.2d at 358-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In its Complaint for Declaratory Judgment (Doc. 1), Plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    Breuninger\n   </em>\n   in support of the assertion that \"[i]t is settled law in Pennsylvania that the transfer of motor vehicle insurance from one company to another affiliated company does not constitute a new policy\" and further asserts that, pursuant to federal and state courts addressing the issue, new \u00a7 1734 sign down forms are not required to be obtained by the new affiliate (Doc. 1 \u00b6 41). As discussed below, Defendants disagree with this analysis, contending that here Selective Insurance Company of America was required to obtain new forms and, because they did not, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment in their favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

In support of this assertion, Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot rely on the 2001 written reduction between Village Auto Sales, Inc., (\"Village Auto\") and Selective Insurance Company of South Caroline (\"Selective-South Carolina\") because the two are separate companies, the Selective-America policy was a \"new\" policy that created a new contract between new parties requiring a new written reduction form under \u00a7\u00a7 1731 and 1734, and the new written reduction was never obtained.

On the basis of Pennsylvania contract principles and the MVFRL, Defendants conclude that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   [t]he July 2012 \"Notice\" made it clear that a \"new\" policy was being delivered to Village Auto by a \"new\" insurer and that the \"new policy\" was being \"rewritten,\" \"reissued\" and \"offered\" to Village Auto by Selective-America. The common dictionary definition of \"issue\" is \"The action of supplying or distributing an item for use, sale, or official purposes.\" en.oxfordictionaries.com/definition/issue accessed on 1/17/18. \"Reissue\" is defined as \"Make a new supply or different form of (a product, especially a book or record) available for sale.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"724019,7868053\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/664/559/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Selective-America also delivered the new policy to Village Auto and requested payment of premiums.... Thus, the new Selective-America policy was either \"delivered or issued for delivery in this Commonwealth ...\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1731. Thus, in July 2012, when Selective-America unilaterally decided to terminate the prior policy between Village Auto and Selective-South Carolina, and \"rewrite\" and \"reissue\" and \"offer\" a \"new\" policy to Village Auto and/or deliver the new policy to Village Auto, \u00a7\u00a7 1731 and 1734 and corresponding\n   case law required a new UM/UIM reduction form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   (Doc. 11 at 23-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The crux of Defendants' position is that \u00a7 1731 is triggered by the issuing of a policy which is what happened here with the Selective-America policy. Under that section, the UIM limits are equal to the bodily injury limits unless the insured sent a written request for lower limits which did not happen here. Defendants cite no Pennsylvania or Third Circuit cases applying the cited general contract principles to the MVFRL at issue here. Rather, they rely primarily on\n   <em>\n    Weilacher\n   </em>\n   for its general pronouncements concerning \u00a7\u00a7 1731 and 1734, focusing on the insurer's obligation to\n   <em>\n    issue\n   </em>\n   a policy with UIM coverage in an amount equal to the bodily injury liability coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 11 at 13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Weilacher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310259\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/65/976/#p983\">\n    65 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   983 ).

Neither\n   <em>\n    Muhammad\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Herman\n   </em>\n   involved insurance policies generally or the operation of the MVFRL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1825864\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/526/541/\">\n    526 Pa. 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1825864\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/526/541/\">\n    587 A.2d 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1896840\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/419/272/\">\n    419 Pa. 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=213%20A.2d%20594\">\n    213 A.2d 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While general contract principles are worthy of consideration in many instances, where a specific legislative scheme in a heavily regulated industry is at issue and state court decisions specific to insurance policies are abundant, Defendants' broad-brush argument is not persuasive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Importantly, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania has not attached significance to the issuance of a new policy by a new insurer affiliated with the insurer under the expiring policy. In\n   <em>\n    Weilacher\n   </em>\n   , the insureds' policy of insurance was transferred from State Farm Fire and Casualty Company to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company in September 1999.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310259\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/65/976/#p983\">\n    65 A.3d at 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nothing in the Superior Court opinion suggests that the transfer was the event which triggered the new insurer's need to provide UIM benefits equal to bodily injury benefits under \u00a7 1731 unless the insured sought lower limits in writing under \u00a7 1734. Rather,\n   <em>\n    Weilacher\n   </em>\n   found the insurer ran afoul of the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1731 and 1734 which \"plainly state that an insurance policy must provide UM/UIM coverage limits that are equal to bodily injury limits unless the insured completes a proper request for reduction of the UM/UIM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   coverage limits\" because the insureds \"did not request any reduction of the UM/UIM coverage limits after the UM/UIM coverage was added to their policy.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310259\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/65/976/#p983\">\n    65 A.3d at 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, it was the change in policy provisions and not the issuance of a policy by a new affiliated insurer which provided the basis for the court's conclusion that the insureds were entitled to UIM coverage equal to the bodily injury limits of $ 500,000 in the policy rather than the $ 25,000/$ 50,000 UIM coverage indicated in the policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310259\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/65/976/#p983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Here there is no analogous change in policy provisions and, unlike the insureds in\n   <em>\n    Weilacher\n   </em>\n   , the insureds in this case completed a valid request for UM/UIM benefits in 2001. The parties do not dispute that when Robyn Novitsky signed the \"Commercial Automobile Pennsylvania Coverage Selection Form IMPORTANT NOTICE\" on July 30, 2001, a form which identifies \"Selective Insurance\" at the top of the page, she was apprised of the benefits she must be offered under the policy pursuant to \u00a7 1791. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 19-4 at 2.) Nor do the parties dispute that the \"Commercial Automobile Pennsylvania Coverage Selection Form\" indicates she chose $ 1,000,000 liability insurance coverage, $ 35,000 uninsured motorist coverage, and $ 35,000 underinsured motorist coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) Ms. Novitsky signed the form indicating that she fully understood the coverages she had made and that \"[t]hese coverages will remain in effect as outlined above until such time I execute another Coverage Selection Form.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) These coverage amounts remained in effect in the July 13, 2011, to July 13, 2012, Selective-South Carolina policy as indicated in the Coverage Schedule therein (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 19-2 at 161), and are indicated in the Coverage Schedule of the policy issued by Selective-America for the July 13, 2012, to July 13, 2013, period (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 19-3 at 154). Identical coverages are indicated in the Coverage Schedule found in the Selective-America policy in place at the time of the accident, i.e., the policy for the term July 13, 2016, to July 13, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 19-1 at 169.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Although\n   <em>\n    Weilacher\n   </em>\n   did not discuss the affiliation between State Farm Fire and Casualty Company and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, the court states that the insureds' policy \"was transferred\" between the two entities.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310259\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/65/976/#p983\">\n    65 A.3d at 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As set out above, the court considered what came before the transfer and what came after it in terms of changes made to the policies' provisions rather than attaching legal significance to the issuing entity.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310259\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/65/976/#p983\">\n    65 A.3d at 985-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though Defendants' argument hinges on the fact that Selective-South Carolina and Selective-America are separate corporations, they do not deny the affiliation between the two. Importantly, they cite no authority to support the proposition that affiliated subsidiaries of a parent company should be distinguished such that a change in insurer should not be deemed a transfer. Further, they cite no authority to support the proposition that a change in the policy provider, rather than a change in the policy provisions, is the event of legal significance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   For these reasons the Court concludes Defendants have not shown that the execution of the 2001 selection form did not remain viable when Selective-America became their insurer.

Specifically, Plaintiff points to the following language on the Coverage Selection Form signed by Village Auto: \"These coverages will remain as outlined above until such time [sic] I execute another Coverage Selection Form.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Commercial Automobile Pennsylvania Coverage Selection Form, Ex.

Plaintiff adds that the terms and coverage provided by Selective-America remained exactly the same as that provided by Selective-South Carolina, the policy number remained the same, and the transfer from one Selective Insurance Group, Inc., subsidiary to another was \"seamless and was effectuated upon the 2012-2013 Selective renewal of Village Auto's expiring Selective-SC policy.

The determining issue under \u00a7 1731 and 1734 is whether the 2012-2013 policy was \"delivered or issued for delivery in the Commonwealth ...\" (which it was) and thus required a UM/UIM selection/reduction (which was never obtained).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   (Doc. 11 at 28.)

Therefore, the question is whether\n   <em>\n    Breuninger\n   </em>\n   is indicative of how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would interpret the relevant provisions of the MVFRL in the context presented here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buffetta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1094352\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/230/634/#p637\">\n    230 F.3d at 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the reasons discussed below, the Court concludes that the Superior Court's\n   <em>\n    Breuninger\n   </em>\n   decision points to how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would interpret whether a \u00a7 1734 valid election for reduced UIM benefits would continue to apply when the insurer identified in the policy under which it was executed was replaced by an affiliated insurer. The Court further concludes that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would conclude that the UIM benefits chosen under the valid election remained in effect upon transfer with the result in this case that the UIM benefits available under the policy in place at the time of the May 2017 accident are $ 35,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   As in this case, in\n   <em>\n    Breuninger\n   </em>\n   the lower court had been presented with \"an action for declaratory judgment instituted to interpret coverage provided by a policy of automobile insurance.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7860949,736358\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/675/353/\">\n    675 A.2d at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The lower court granted summary judgment for the insurer, finding that the insured was entitled to $ 35,000 UIM coverage (the amount indicated in the relevant policy) rather than the $ 100,000 claimed by the insured (an amount equal to the policy's bodily injury coverage).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7860949,736358\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/675/353/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Superior Court affirmed the lower court's decision, noting that \"the only issue to be resolved by the lower court was 'whether the insured knowingly and voluntarily selected $ 35,000 in UM/UIM coverage as a matter of law.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7860949,736358\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/675/353/\">\n    675 A.2d at 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the issue presented to the lower court is similar to that presented here in that this Court considers whether the insureds' selection of $ 35,000 UIM coverage in 2001, the amount of coverage reflected on the policy in place at the time of the accident, is the amount of UIM coverage they are entitled to as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   While Defendants focus on distinctions between\n   <em>\n    Breuninger\n   </em>\n   and the case at bar, their attempt to undermine the viability of\n   <em>\n    Breuninger's\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1734 determination in the current context is not persuasive for several reasons. The Superior Court's ultimate determination that the insureds were not entitled to UIM benefits equal to the bodily injury coverage in the applicable policy\n   logically encompasses a conclusion that the insureds' knowing and voluntary election of $ 35,000 UIM coverage in 1990 under the Harleysville policy applied to the Pennland policy in place at the time of the accident. To conclude otherwise, would disregard the Superior Court's expertise in analyzing relevant issues of state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <em>\n    Breuninger's\n   </em>\n   careful consideration of whether the insured had validly executed a \u00a7 1734 reduction in benefits shows that the Superior Court analyzed all relevant MVFRL provisions.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7860949,736358\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/675/353/\">\n    675 A.2d at 356-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This analysis preceded the court's \u00a7 1791 analysis, and the opinion provides no basis to conclude that\n   <em>\n    Breuninger\n   </em>\n   did not rely on its \u00a7 1734 determination in reaching its ultimate conclusion that the insured was entitled to the $ 35,000 UIM coverage indicated in the policy. This is particularly so given the Superior Court's July 1995\n   <em>\n    Emig\n   </em>\n   opinion where the Superior Court analyzed the relationship between the conclusive presumption of \u00a7 1791 and UM/UIM coverage reductions under \u00a7 1734 and concluded that compliance with the former does not indicate a valid selection under the latter.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"724019,7868053\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/664/559/\">\n    664 A.2d at 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because a valid \u00a7 1734 reduction in benefits requires that the insured \"have actually selected coverages ... in conformity with the law,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"724019,7868053\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/664/559/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Breuninger\n   </em>\n   would not likely have failed to address the issue if the transfer of the policy to Pennland invalidated the insured's 1990 \u00a7 1734 election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Further, the Court cannot distinguish\n   <em>\n    Breuninger\n   </em>\n   based on underlying facts.

However, with no basis to factually distinguish\n   <em>\n    Breuninger\n   </em>\n   and the determination set out above that\n   <em>\n    Breuninger's\n   </em>\n   failure to discuss \u00a7 1734 in its transfer analysis is not a genuine distinction, the Court concludes the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would decide the precise \u00a7 1734 issue presented here in a manner consistent with\n   <em>\n    Breuninger\n   </em>\n   , i.e., that the transfer of the policy did not create a new relationship which invalidated previously executed statutorily mandated documents, including the insureds' 2001 \u00a7 1734 election. Reading the provisions\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   as directed in\n   <em>\n    Emig\n   </em>\n   , because both \u00a7\u00a7 1734 and 1791\"relate\n   to insureds who are faced with the decision whether to purchase UM/UIM coverages, and, if so, in what amounts,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"724019,7868053\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/664/559/\">\n    664 A.2d at 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it is logical to conclude that, when there is no policy change other than the name of the insurer who is an affiliated entity, a new \u00a7 1734 election would not be required where no \u00a7 1791 notice is required. The Court's conclusion is consistent with and supported by\n   <em>\n    Weilacher's\n   </em>\n   finding that the event of legal significance related to \u00a7\u00a7 1731 and 1734 was the change in policy coverage rather than the change in the named insurer.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310259\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/65/976/#p983\">\n    65 A.3d at 986-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, policy renewals contain language that could be construed to provide an offer, acceptance, and consideration as seen in Selective-South Carolina and Selective-America renewal policies where the insured is instructed that \"[i]n return for payment of the premium, and subject to all the terms of this policy, we agree with you to provide the insurance indicated in the schedule above.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Doc. 19-1 at 25; Doc. 19-2 at 24.) Second, pursuant to Defendants' definitions of relevant terms (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Doc. 11 at 18-24), renewal policies are \"delivered or issued for delivery in this Commonwealth,\" 75 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1731. To the extent the language in renewal policies satisfies contract requirements and said policies are delivered or issued for delivery, in Defendants' contractual scheme the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1731 and 1734 would have to be satisfied with each renewal. Yet Defendants do not suggest that each renewal contract issued or delivered to an insured requires the insurer to again offer UM/UIM coverage in amounts equal to the bodily injury liability coverage pursuant to \u00a7 1731 unless the insured again elects to limit that coverage in writing pursuant to \u00a7 1734.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    To the extent Defendants distinguish\n    <em>\n     Breuninger's\n    </em>\n    discussion of the transfer issue and argue that Plaintiff's reliance on the case is misplaced (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Doc. 11 at 26-29; Doc. 26 at 16-22), their arguments will be addressed in conjunction with Plaintiff's motions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    Despite Defendants' argument that\n    <em>\n     Snyder\n    </em>\n    should not be considered (Doc. 26 at 20-21) and their correct assertion that\n    <em>\n     Snyder\n    </em>\n    was decided in the context of a limited tort election under a different statutory provision (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 21), this Court is free to consider the decision as a non-precedential Superior Court opinion decided in a different context than that presented here.
