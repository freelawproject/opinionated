Parsons fired him in 2018, and he sued, alleging discrimination and retaliation in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Parsons has moved to stay proceedings and compel arbitration. According to Parsons, Mr. Jin assented to an arbitration agreement by remaining at Parsons after being told that continued employment constituted acceptance of the agreement. Under D.C. contract law, however, an agreement is enforceable only if both parties \"have the distinct intention to be bound.\"\n   <em>\n    Jack Baker, Inc. v. Office Space Dev.

Mutuality of assent was not even before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   True, this case has important factual differences from\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Parsons sent Mr. Jin several emails, explaining that Parsons had revised its Employee Dispute Resolution program, requesting that he sign the Agreement, and telling him that his \"continued employment with Parsons\"\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   count as acceptance of the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 8.

Under Parsons' own version of the facts, Mr. Jin never signed the Agreement even after receiving four emails requesting him to do so. Considering the facts in the light most favorable to Mr. Jin, this is evidence that he did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   intend to be bound. Sure, he could have voiced his disagreement, but by the same token, he repeatedly refused to show his acceptance of the Agreement. As discussed, Parsons has the burden of proving that Mr. Jin intended to accept the Agreement. Parsons could have required him to sign the Agreement at the risk of termination or confronted him in person about the Agreement, but Parsons chose not to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Parsons cites\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Def.'s Mem. at 7-8. In that case, the trial court had not admitted a lease into evidence because it was not signed by the landlord. 664 A.2d at 838. The D.C. Court of Appeals explained that this was \"not determinative of the validity or existence of the contract\" and remanded for a new trial to determine, among other things, whether there was a legally binding agreement, despite the lack of the landlord's signature.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   But this case does not save Parsons. In\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , the landlord had accepted the renters' partial performance, removed the house from the market, prepared to turn over the keys, and initialed various handwritten changes to the lease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By contrast, Parsons points to no change in Mr. Jin's behavior that would signify acceptance. While the\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   landlord's specific actions make sense only if she intended to form a contract with the renters, Mr. Jin's continued employment accords with his alleged\n   ignorance that such an Agreement even existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The facts presented by Parsons are ambiguous. It is possible that Mr. Jin read the emails about the Agreement, but perhaps he did not. And if he did not know about the Agreement, there was no meeting of the minds no matter what the Agreement says.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11452640,3674759\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/209/740/\">\n    209 F.3d at 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[U]nder District law, an enforceable contract does not exist unless there has been a 'meeting of the minds' as to all material terms.\"). There is also a third plausible scenario: that Mr. Jin read the emails and did not want to accept the Agreement but was reluctant to voice his disagreement to his employer. Mr. Jin may have continued working at Parsons with no intention of arbitrating his disputes with Parsons. All three scenarios are compatible with the fact that he never replied to the arbitration emails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mr. Jin submitted a sworn declaration denying that he \"intend[ed] to be bound by the Agreement to Arbitrate.\" Jin Decl. at 1. He attested that he did not recall receiving the emails produced by Parsons, and he never reviewed the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11452640,3674759\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/209/740/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even though a self-serving affidavit on its own will not ordinarily create a fact issue,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carter v.

Cir. 2004), Mr. Jin's affidavit is, at least, not inconsistent with the established facts here. Everyone agrees that Mr. Jin did not acknowledge the Agreement, and his affidavit gives one explanation: because he did not know about it. True, a jury may not believe Mr. Jin, given the email documentation and business records presented by Parsons. A jury may credit Parsons' evidence and discredit Mr. Jin's sworn declaration, but for now there is a genuine factual dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

Def.'s Reply Mem. ISO Mot. (\"Def.'s Reply\") at 3, ECF No. 12. Parsons argues that \"a mere denial of receipt is insufficient to rebut the presumption accorded the sender under the mailbox rule.\" Def.'s Reply at 4 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lepre v.

The real issue is not whether Mr. Jin\n   <em>\n    received\n   </em>\n   the emails but whether he\n   <em>\n    read\n   </em>\n   them. If Mr. Jin did not know about the Agreement, it is impossible that he intended to be bound by it. By contrast, in\n   <em>\n    Lepre\n   </em>\n   , the issue was whether the plaintiff, who was bringing a due process challenge, had notice before the suspension of his benefits.\n   <em>\n    Lepre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9453986,3726391\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/275/59/\">\n    275 F.3d at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unfortunately for Parsons, proving Mr. Jin's intention to be bound is harder than proving mere constructive notice. Parsons' mailbox rule argument is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Parsons also insists that Mr. Jin's decision not to read the Agreement does not relieve him from the Agreement's terms, citing\n   <em>\n    Booker v.

Reply at 5. But had Parsons read the next three words beyond the quote it offered to this Court, it would have seen the glaring difference between that case and this one. The party objecting to the arbitration agreements in\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   had already\n   <em>\n    signed\n   </em>\n   the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Booker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9236885\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/315/94/#p101\">\n    315 F.Supp.2d at 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And under D.C. law, \"a signature on a contract indicates 'mutuality of assent' and a party is bound by the contract unless he or she can show special circumstances relieving\n   him or her of such an obligation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Emeronye v.
