The Court held a hearing on October 29, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Transcript -- Day 1 at 1:4-6 (Court)(\"Trial Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The primary issue is whether the Court should admit hearsay statements contained in oral tradition evidence pursuant to the Federal Rules of Evidence, or, in the alternative, pursuant to four hearsay exceptions: (i) rule 803(19), Reputation Concerning Personal or Family History; (ii) rule 803(20), Reputation Concerning Boundaries or General History; (iii) rule 803(21), Reputation Concerning Character; and (iv) rule 807, the Residual Exception. Oral Evidence Memo. at 1-8. The Court concludes that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not permit admission of out-of-court statements contained in American Indian oral tradition evidence when offered for the truth of the matter asserted, because the rule against hearsay prohibits such statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 802 (\"Hearsay is not admissible unless any of the following provides otherwise: a federal statute; these rules; or other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court.\"). The Court may\n   adopt oral tradition evidence for non-hearsay purposes, if Jemez Pueblo can establish a non-hearsay purpose, such as background, for why Jemez people believe things, do things, draw or paint things. The Court also will admit hearsay statements in oral tradition evidence for the truth of the matter asserted pursuant to the hearsay exceptions enumerated in rule 803, provided such statements conform to the limited scope of each enumerated exception, as the Federal Rules of Evidence define the exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 803. The Court will not admit hearsay, however, in oral tradition evidence pursuant to rule 807, the residual exception to the rule against hearsay, because the Court concludes that oral tradition evidence is not sufficiently exceptional to warrant admission pursuant to this rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conoco Inc. v. Dep't of Energy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650283\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/99/387/#p392\">\n    99 F.3d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392 (Fed.

During the first trial day, Jemez Pueblo elicited oral tradition evidence testimony from Jemez Pueblo Tribal Council member Paul Tosa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 136:25 (Solimon). Tosa provided extensive testimony regarding historical Jemez Pueblo activity in and around the Valles Caldera; for example, Tosa stated that \"in the fall it was time to collect [medicinal herbs,] that's what grandpa told us[,] that the obsidian valley[,] the campsite at the entrance to the gate[,] that's where that big area was....\" Trial Tr. at 165:23-166:5 (Tosa). In response to such testimony, the United States raised a hearsay objection, arguing that \"the case law is fairly clear [that] oral histories are hearsay[.] [I]t's plain hearsay and doesn't come in if under any exception.\" Trial Tr. at 166:10-16 (Dykema)(citing\n   <em>\n    Bonnichsen v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7345461,9248510\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/367/864/\">\n    367 F.3d 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 881-82 (9th Cir. 2004) ;\n   <em>\n    Sokaogon Chippewa Cmty. v.

Specifically, according to the United States, what Tosa learned \"at his grandfather's knee\" is inadmissible hearsay. Trial Tr. at 167:5-7 (Dykema). Jemez Pueblo responded that oral traditional evidence \"has been held admissible in ... federal Indian law cases including cases within the Tenth [Circuit Court of Appeals].\" Trial Tr. at 167:9-12 (Solimon). Moreover, Jemez Pueblo asserts that it is aware of no \"case right now that would ... exclude this type of testimony where we are dealing with a dispute involving things like migration, land use, traditions involving land use.\" Trial Tr. at 167:13-16 (Solimon). Jemez Pueblo argued that, \"in cases that have considered oral\n   tradition regarding [ancient] migration, sacred landmarks, shrines which have continuing importance in Tribal lifestyles, courts have [consistently] ... accepted it.\" Trial Tr. at 168:2-6 (Solimon)(citing\n   <em>\n    Zuni Tribe of N.M. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5633330\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cl-ct/12/607/#p608\">\n    12 Cl. Ct. 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 608 (Ct. Cl. 1987) ). Jemez Pueblo adds that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   the way courts typically accept this evidence is it's to be read in context with other issues that are presented, including objective evidence such as expert witness testimony. In terms of it being hearsay ... there is a hearsay exception specifically concerning customs affecting lands in a community. That's 803[ (20) ]. That exception reads reputation in a community arising before the controversy as to boundaries of or customs affecting lands in the community and reputations show events of general history important to the community or state or nation in which it is located.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Trial Tr. at 168:10-21 (Solimon).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court acknowledged that it is \"not an expert in [ rule] 803 [20],\" but expressed skepticism that rule 803(20) would \"cover all the history that ... Mr. Tosa is going to want to testify about. He's not going to testify just about the boundaries, but he's going to talk about something much more extensive.\" Trial Tr. at 169:6-9 (Court). The Court then inquired whether the cases that Jemez Pueblo cites address an objection or merely rely on unopposed oral history. Trial Tr. at 169:9-14 (Court). In response, Jemez Pueblo directed the Court to\n   <em>\n    Pueblo De Zia v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10817661\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ct-cl/165/501/\">\n    165 Ct. Cl. 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1964), in which, according to Jemez Pueblo,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   the [Indian Claims Commission] Court was reversed because it did not consider oral history, oral evidence that was not corroborated by written documents. And that was in itself hearsay[.] [W]e haven't found a case indicating that a hearsay objection to oral evidence or oral testimony, [or] Tribal traditions that are passed down orally ha[s] been accepted and sustained to prevent a witness from testifying. I think what courts have done is they've given the appropriate ... amount of weight based on the other objective evidence in the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Trial Tr. at 169:15-170:2 (Solimon)(citing\n   <em>\n    Pueblo De Zia v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10817661\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ct-cl/165/501/\">\n    165 Ct. Cl. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   501 ). The Court reiterated its skepticism that \"oral history can pass a hearsay objection\" and proposed that the Court will take such evidence subject to making a formal ruling. Trial Tr. at 170:3-11 (Court). The United States assented to the Court's proposal and stated its understanding that the Court of Claims in\n   <em>\n    Pueblo De Zia v. United States\n   </em>\n   held that oral traditional evidence was not necessarily worthless when corroborating evidence supports the oral testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 170:12-171:3 (Dykema).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court inquired about the quantity of oral traditional evidence that Jemez Pueblo intends to introduce during trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 171:7-9 (Court). Jemez Pueblo responded that the Court \"will be hearing information about societies that use the Valles Caldera. And part of their testimony will involve oral traditions within those societies.\" Trial Tr. at 171:10-13 (Solimon). Moreover, Jemez Pueblo expressed that such oral traditional evidence \"provides ... context to understand ... the testimony that both sides will be presenting about [how] it is that Jemez people came to this area and why they settled in this area.\" Trial Tr. at 171:20-24 (Solimon).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court inquired whether the United States saw any use for oral traditional evidence \"other than it being offered for the truth of the matter asserted.\" Trial Tr. at 172:23-25 (Court). The United States responded that it is \"happy to hear\" Jemez Pueblo's migration story, despite relevance\n   concerns, but objects to testimony regarding Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use as learned from Tosa's grandfather, which the United States argues is relevant only for its truth. Trial Tr. at 173:1-13 (Dykema). The Court instructed the United States to object to what the United States considers offensive testimony, and the Court stated that it will likely conclude that it will not consider such testimony for the truth of the matter asserted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 173:14-18 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Jemez Pueblo asserted that, because \"it's going to ... cover many witnesses on this exact same issue,\" it had prepared a bench memorandum further delineating its position on the oral traditional evidence issue. Trial Tr. at 173:21-25 (Barnhouse). The Court accepted the bench memorandum and instructed Jemez Pueblo to file its bench memorandum on the docket.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 174:2-3 (Court). The United States responded that it would also file a bench memorandum on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 174:4-6 (Dykema). The United States, however, ultimately decided not to file a bench memorandum,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 275:6-8 (Dykema), and instead directed the Court to four cases that, according to the United States, discuss the relevancy and admissibility of oral traditional evidence:\n   <em>\n    Pueblo De Zia v. United States\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Bonnichsen v.

Jemez Pueblo asserts that courts have admitted such evidence \"with and without considering corroborating evidence\" to support factual findings, thereby \"essentially ignor[ing] any application of the hearsay rule in their factfinding.\" Oral Evidence Memo. at 3. For example, according to Jemez Pueblo, the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma in\n   <em>\n    Comanche Nation v.

According to Jemez Pueblo, the United States Claims Court in\n   <em>\n    Zuni Tribe of New Mexico v. United States\n   </em>\n   stated that it \"considered all the evidence including testimony by several expert witnesses, source material relied upon by witnesses and accompanying their written reports, and the documentary evidence, and considered the lay\n   testimony in that context.\" Oral Evidence Memo. at 3 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Zuni Tribe of N.M. v.

Moreover, according to Jemez Pueblo, the Honorable Edward J.

Chief Judge Fox expressed, for example, significant animus towards one of the treaties at issue: \"[T]his court, would, on the record before it, identify this as an invalid treaty because it was the product of fraud, duress, conflicts of interest, coercion, and was very likely produced by the alcohol of liquor peddlers who sought to keep the Indians from knowing what they were doing.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078593\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/471/192/#p219\">\n    471 F.Supp. at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such animus indicates that Chief Judge Fox was inclined to rule in the American Indians' favor based on documentary evidence and not on oral tradition evidence alone. Chief Judge Fox ultimately concluded that neither of the two nineteenth-century treaties at issue ceded the Tribes' water rights, and, moreover, that United States' approval of the Tribal constitutions and subsequent Tribal fishing regulations preempt state authority to regulate the Tribal members' fishing activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court cannot disregard that, in this case, there is no such \"solemn promise\" that could compel the Court to consider hearsay in oral tradition evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Hence, because the opinion in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Michigan\n   </em>\n   indicates that the oral tradition evidence was uncontroverted, because Chief Judge Fox does not discuss whether he relied on such evidence, and because the matter before Chief Judge Fox involved two treaties with the United States and attendant canons of treaty construction, the Court is not persuaded that\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Ultimately, however, and similar to Chief Judge Fox in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Exxon Corporation\n   </em>\n   , no further description is necessary, as the concerns attendant to the rule against hearsay are self-evident. The Court notes, however, that Judge Posner's comment regarding form indicates that oral tradition evidence is admissible under certain circumstances. The Court concludes that circumstances warranting admissibility exist only when oral tradition evidence is cast in accordance with one of the enumerated exceptions to the rule against hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     THE COURT WILL ADMIT HEARSAY IN ORAL TRADITION EVIDENCE PURSUANT ONLY TO APPLICABLE RULE 803 HEARSAY EXCEPTIONS\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Court will admit hearsay statements in oral tradition evidence pursuant only to the hearsay exceptions that rule 803 enumerates, provided such statements conform to each enumerated exception's limited scope, as the Federal Rules of Evidence define the exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 803. Jemez Pueblo asserts, without providing further argument, that the Court should admit such evidence pursuant to rule 803(19), 803(20), and 803(21). Rule 803(19) provides that reputation evidence within hearsay is admissible to prove personal or family history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 803(19). The Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules notes that this exception contemplates, as proper subjects of proof, marriage, legitimacy, relationship, adoption, birth, and death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 803(19) advisory committee's note;\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jean-Baptiste\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397137\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/102/#p110\">\n    166 F.3d 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110 (2d Cir. 1999) (\"[ Rule 803(19) ] plainly contemplates that members of a family may testify with regard to the common understanding as to the birth of another family member.\"). The Advisory Committee further notes that \"the 'world' in which the reputation may exist may be family, associates, or community.\" Fed. R. Evid. 803(19) advisory committee's note. The Court will thus admit hearsay in oral tradition evidence when such evidence concerns personal and family history as the Advisory Committee contemplates. The Court has just not seen this reputation evidence in this case. This case does not involve reputation about birth. While the Court will keep an open mind, it is doubtful that rule 803(19) is available to get much, if any, oral tradition into the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Rule 803(20) codifies two related hearsay exceptions based on reputation within a community: first, property boundary locations; and, second, general history matters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 803(20). As to the first, both United States and English\n   courts historically have admitted hearsay evidence to prove ancient boundaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boardman v. Reed &amp; Ford's Lessees\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439673\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/31/328/#p340\">\n    31 U.S. 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 340,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439673\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/31/328/#p340\">\n    6 Pet. 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439673\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/31/328/#p340\">\n    8 L.Ed. 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1832) (\"That boundaries may be proved by hearsay testimony, is a rule well settled.\");\n   <em>\n    Nicholls v. Parker\n   </em>\n   , 104 Eng. Rep. 629 (K.B. 1805). The Court will adhere to precedent and admit hearsay that speaks to historic property boundary locations, as evidenced by community reputation. To qualify for admission under the second prong, reputation concerning \"general historical events,\" the offeree must show that the matter is one of general concern within the community, as such concern indicates that the evidence has passed through the crucible of community debate and emerged as generally accepted truth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 803(20) advisory committee's note. The Advisory Committee further notes that this prong \"is designed to facilitate proof of events when judicial notice is not available.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 803(20) advisory committee's note. The Court will thus admit oral tradition evidence when the Court is persuaded that such evidence consists of historical-event testimony that the Court concludes is of sufficient interest to the community.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ute Indian Tribe v. Utah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3326648\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/521/1072/#p1149\">\n    521 F.Supp. at 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that reputation in a non-Indian community as to American Indian boundaries is inadmissible under 803(20), because the subject matter was not one of general concern sufficient to warrant consideration within the community). Rule 803(20) is not a gate through which all American Indian oral tradition evidence may enter. First, the evidence must be about boundaries. American Indians do not always, if ever, talk about boundaries, so the fuzzy evidence about \"perimeters\" may not cut in. Second, the community in this case is probably no more than the Jemez Pueblo. While Jemez Pueblo is laboring hard to get in this hearsay, it is not worth much. It is little more than one Jemez Pueblo member after another stating the Jemez Pueblo's position. It would be more probative if it was the Zia Pueblo's, Santa Clara Pueblo's, or the Anglo community's reputation regarding Jemez Pueblo's boundaries, but just Jemez Pueblo stating what the reputation in Jemez Pueblo is regarding its boundaries, while admissible, is not worth much given Jemez Pueblo's interest in the outcome of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   While \"general historical events\" may get in some hearsay, it cannot get in much. It has to be a historical event, not legend or myth. If it involves gods or spirits, that is probably not a historical event. If it involves how Jemez Pueblo dealt with the Spanish, that probably qualifies. The Spanish wrote things down; the American Indians did not. The Court will allow Jemez Pueblo's reputation evidence on that event. But it also must be an \"event.\" If it is just stories, legends, or myth, the Court will not admit it for the truth of the matter asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Rule 803(21) excepts from the hearsay rule reputation concerning character similar to the evidence that rule 405(a) contemplates,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 803(19) advisory committee's note, which states that reputation\n   testimony may prove a person's character or character trait when character evidence is otherwise admissible,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 405(a). Notably, this exception does not contemplate instances of specific conduct, which 405(b) addresses and is relevant only when \"character is, in the strict sense, in issue and hence deserving of a searching inquiry.\" Fed. R. Evid. 405 advisory committee's note. The Advisory Committee's Note to rule 405 describes character evidence \"primarily in moral overtones of good and bad: chaste, peaceable, truthful, honest,\" as well as nonmoral considerations, such as \"the case of the incompetent driver.\" Fed. R. Evid. 405 advisory committee's note. In summary, character as rule 405 contemplates, and, by extension, rule 803(21), \"is defined as the kind of person one is.\" Fed. R. Evid. 405 advisory committee's note. Hence, the Court will admit oral tradition evidence containing reputation and opinion evidence that speaks to a given individual's general character, such as good or bad, or specific character trait, such as incompetence, provided that such evidence is not offered to prove that a person acted in accordance with that particular character or trait.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 404(a). Although character evidence is admissible when character is in issue in a civil case, [e]vidence of a person's character or character trait is not admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character or trait.\" Fed. R. Evid. 404(a). Hence, in a case such as this, rule 803(21) is not available to Jemez Pueblo except on the issue of truthfulness, which is not an issue here. No one is really ripping witnesses in this case on credibility; much of this case involves honorable people and highly-qualified experts testifying the best they can. It is doubtful that rule 803(21) is going to be a conduit for any hearsay in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     THE COURT WILL NOT ADMIT ORAL TRADITION EVIDENCE PURSUANT TO RULE 807, BECAUSE THE COURT IS NOT CONVINCED THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SUFFICIENTLY EXTRAORDINARY\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The Court will not admit hearsay contained in oral tradition evidence pursuant to rule 807, because the Court concludes that oral tradition evidence is not sufficiently extraordinary to warrant admission pursuant to this rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conoco Inc. v.

As discussed above, the Court will admit hearsay in oral tradition evidence, provided such evidence is admissible pursuant to rule 803. The Court concludes, however, that this case's circumstances are not sufficiently exceptional to warrant admission pursuant to rule 807.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Within the Tenth Circuit, exceptional circumstances occur when hearsay evidence is relevant and reliable, and no other evidence, or little other evidence, is available on the same point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marsee v.

The most relevant oral tradition evidence in this case consists of testimony regarding Valles Caldera land use boundaries, which the Court concludes may be admissible, as reputation evidence, pursuant to rule 803(20). Furthermore, much of this oral tradition evidence is coterminous with expert opinion evidence, which is admissible pursuant to rule 702.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R.

The Court maintains its skepticism of these cases, not only because the Court of Claims' opinions do not bind the Tenth Circuit and, without the Tenth Circuit's directive, this Court, but also because, at most, they are merely persuasive authority and, on a clean slate, they are not very persuasive; the issue whether a taking occurred was neither contested nor adjudicated. The Court further agrees with Jemez Pueblo that the attorneys before the ICC had no incentive to litigate whether a taking occurred, and a stipulation to that effect \"suit[ed] their mutual objectives -- resolution of the claim for the lawyers for the United States, and payment of fees to counsel for the plaintiff tribe.\" MIL 1 at 12. Adopting similar rationale, the Court concludes that the attorneys also lacked incentive to litigate admission of oral tradition evidence. While the Court must rely on the Court of Claims' cases that the Tenth Circuit found persuasive, the Tenth Circuit did not discuss or comment on the Court of Claims admission of evidence, and the Court concludes that the Tenth Circuit's approval of these Court of Claims cases does not include approval of everything that the Court of Claims did and the Tenth Circuit did not approve.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b) states: \"A judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" Fed.
