DE 1-1 (State Court Record). The suit stems from Combs's arrest of Plaintiff on December 21, 2016. DE 1-1, at 4. Combs, in his official capacity, noticed removal on January 26, 2018. DE 1 (Notice).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defense moved to dismiss the individual (DE 9) and official (DE 10) capacity claims. The Court subsequently dismissed Combs in his official capacity on immunity grounds, but reserved decision on the individual capacity claims pending resolution of service concerns. DE 23 (Order). Subsequently, Defendant Combs mooted any Rule 4(m) issues by waiving service and entering a full appearance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court returns to the individual capacity dismissal effort. DE 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The motion is fully briefed, DE 11 (Response), DE 17 (Reply), and stands ripe for review. For the following reasons, and under the applicable standards, the Court finds only partial dismissal warranted.

Mrs. Estep advised that Defendant Combs was harassing Plaintiff's son, Tim, at his home and was refusing to leave. She requested Plaintiff's assistance. Plaintiff arrived at his son's residence and found Defendant standing at the front door. Plaintiff told Combs that he needed to leave unless he had a warrant. Defendant then arrested Plaintiff. Combs tightly handcuffed Plaintiff. Estep claims the cuffs caused significant pain and suffering and resulted in\n   bruising on his wrists. He alleges that he asked Combs to remove or loosen the cuffs due to the pain and that Defendant refused. Plaintiff claims Combs left him in his vehicle outside the Harlan County Detention Center for an excessive period despite knowing the cuffs were causing pain. Plaintiff contends he was not engaged in any illegal activity when Combs arrested him, that he did not resist, and that there was no probable cause to justify the arrest. Nonetheless, Combs booked Plaintiff on charges of menacing, resisting arrest, and obstruction/interference with an officer. Ultimately, the Harlan District Court, on February 13, 2017, dismissed all charges for lack of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff now pursues recovery, under \u00a7 1983, for Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment violations and, under state law, for false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, negligence, gross negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant pursues dismissal on three bases; Combs argues: (1) each claim, excepting IIED, is time-barred, DE 9-1, at 4, (2) he is entitled to qualified immunity,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and (3) Estep fails to state a claim upon which the Court could grant relief,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Having reviewed the applicable record under the appropriate standards, for the reasons that follow, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

CR 3.01 requires not simply 'the issuance of the summons;' it requires 'the issuance of the summons\n   <em>\n    in good faith.\n   </em>\n   ' ... The good faith essential for the commencement of the action has long been construed to require a contemporaneous intention on the part of the initiating party to diligently attend to the service of the summons.\" (emphasis in original) ). Per Combs, the initial summons, issued December 19, 2017 (DE 1-1, at 3), could not have been issued in good faith because it was directed to Combs at the KDFW headquarters in Frankfort, Kentucky. DE 9-1, at 7-8. The Complaint, Defendant notes, explicitly alleged that Combs was a Harlan County resident. DE 1-1, at 4 (\"The Defendant ... is believed by the Plaintiff to be a resident of Harlan County, Kentucky.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Similarly, Combs contends the March 29, 2018, generic federal summons, stating that Defendant's \"Specific Address [was then] undetermined\" also failed to commence the action for limitations purposes. DE 8 (Summons).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, Defendant argues that the claims arising out of the December 21, 2016, arrest are time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Estep contends that the initial summons \"was issued with the address of the main office ... with the good faith belief that the Defendant ... would be notified by his supervisory office of attempted certified mail service so that he could elect to receive the mailing and be informed of the litigation.\" DE 11, at 2. Plaintiff also details ultimately unavailing efforts-both pre-and post-Complaint filing-to ascertain Defendant's address.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 11, at 2. The record (indeed, the dismissal effort itself) indicates that Combs was, in fact, ultimately advised of the pending litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The determinative question is whether Estep pursued a summons with \"a bona fide, unequivocal intention to have it served or proceeded on presently or in due course or without abandonment.\"\n   <em>\n    Louisville &amp; N.R.

Yet, the Court, at the 12(b)(6) dismissal stage, considers only the pleadings. Combs's theory, that the Complaint facially establishes an absence of good faith, makes too much out of a factual discrepancy. The fact that Estep sent the summons to a county where he did not believe Combs resided hardly is conclusive for the \"good faith\" inquiry. Combs, at least implicitly, acknowledges this by submitting an affidavit related to the issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"[T]he taking out of the summons ... was presumptive evidence of an intention to have it served in due course.\"\n   <em>\n    Rucker's Adm'r v.

The pleading itself, the Complaint, shows filing within one year of the earliest accrual date. The summons and mailing receipt are part of the removal papers. They show summons issuance by the Harlan Circuit Clerk with certified mailing to Combs at the supplied address, the Department's office in Frankfort. DE 1-1, at 2-3. The clerk and initiating plaintiff each have duties under CR 4.01, but the clerk must issue the summons and mail it appropriately.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CR 4.01(1) (\"Upon the filing of the complaint ... the clerk shall forthwith issue the required summons and, at the direction of the initiating party .... [p]lace a copy of the summons and complaint ... to be served in an envelope, address the envelope to the person to be served at the address set forth in the caption ..., affix adequate postage, and\n   place the sealed envelope in the United States mail as registered mail or certified mail return receipt requested with instructions to the delivering postal employee to deliver to the addressee only and show the address where delivered and the date of delivery.\"). Here, Combs's complaint is that Estep requested service by mail to Combs at Department HQ, rather than at a residential address. The Court sees no prohibition on that effort by Estep, which might or might not be successful to actually effect service.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   CR 5.02 (defining \"[d]elivery of a copy\"-for service purposes-to include \"leaving [a copy] at the office of the ... party with the person in charge thereof; or, if there is no one in charge, leaving it in a conspicuous place therein\"). An employee could sign for a certified mailing at his company workplace, and at most, the Court sees any inaccuracy as but potential negligence regarding service mechanics.

Here-as to both the handcuffing and false arrest allegations-the Court answers both prongs of the inquiry affirmatively and rejects immunity-based dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The answer to the first question is yes. The facts alleged, viewed in the light most favorable to Estep, would show two Fourth Amendment violations. Estep alleges-and the Court, as it must, accepts this as true at this point in the case-that Combs arrested him, essentially, because he told Combs he needed to leave his son's residence unless he had a warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 1-1, at 5 \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Those allegations-describing a warrantless arrest based only on a simple statement-alone are likely sufficient to clear the low-slung dismissal bar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff further claims (1) he was not doing anything illegal, (2) that he did not actively resist arrest, (3) that Combs had no probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe any illicit activity was afoot, and (4) that the Harlan District Court ultimately dismissed all charges against Estep for lack of evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925704\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/194/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 6 \u00b6 14, 8 \u00b6\u00b6 24- 25. Estep had, at a minimum, a \"Fourth Amendment right to be arrested only upon probable cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Crockett v. Cumberland College\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377766\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/316/571/#p580\">\n    316 F.3d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 580 (6th Cir. 2003). If the Court assumes, as it must, that Estep paints an accurate picture of the December 21, 2016, events, Combs would not have had probable cause to arrest Estep, and the seizure violated Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights. Combs surely disputes this account, but the Court now considers only Estep's narrative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Likewise, Estep's handcuffing allegations state a valid Fourth Amendment excessive force claim. Plaintiff contends that Combs: (1) handcuffed him tightly enough to cause significant physical pain and bruise his wrists, (2) declined to remove or loosen the cuffs despite Plaintiff's request, and (3) deliberately extended Estep's suffering by leaving him cuffed in Defendant's vehicle outside the Harlan County Detention Center for a lengthy period.

However, officers may not, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, use excessive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"[E]xcessively forceful or unduly tight handcuffing is a constitutional violation under the Fourth Amendment[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Courtright v. City of Battle Creek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175882\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/513/\">\n    839 F.3d 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 518- 19 (6th Cir. 2016) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The Sixth Circuit has identified three elements for an unreasonably tight handcuffing claim: (1) the plaintiff \"complained the handcuffs were too tight; (2) the officer ignored those complaints; and (3) the plaintiff experienced 'some physical injury' resulting from the handcuffing.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrison v.

Per the pleading, Estep complained about overtightened cuffs, and Combs ignored Plaintiff's protests (and worse, prolonged exposure unnecessarily). Consequently, Estep suffered bruising and significant pain. In short, Estep's factual allegations, accepted as true, adequately support two Fourth Amendment violations-for false arrest and for excessive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The answer to the second question is also yes. Estep's rights to be free from excessively forceful handcuffing and arrests absent probable cause were pellucidly established long before the events in question. Defendant's attempt to dispute the clarity of a prohibition against an utterly baseless arrest rings hollow. \"[I]t is clearly established that an arrest without probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Thacker v.

DE 9-1, at 9 (\"The Plaintiff's Complaint Is Not Pled With Sufficient Specificity.\").

Defendant claims the Complaint \"is very vague and consists mostly of conclusory allegations.\" DE 9-1, at 10. Ironically, Defendant's argument, itself, suffers from the very deficiency it claims the Complaint presents. That is, Defendant expends little (or no) effort in developing any specific elemental criticisms regarding the Complaint language. Combs does not identify\n   the material elements for any of Plaintiff's claims or point to any purportedly missing essentials. Indeed, the section of Defendant's memorandum that pursues dismissal for lack of Complaint specificity contains not one citation to a\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   portion of the pleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 9-1, at 9-11. This alone is a denial basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Combs paints the Complaint with a broad brush, generally arguing that Estep's claims are rooted in generalities or mere boilerplate. Yet, Defendant bears the dismissal burden; it was up to Combs to take aim at specific infirmities in Plaintiff's claims. \"It is not enough for a party to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way and leave the court to put flesh on its bones.\"\n   <em>\n    Brenay v.

For instance, Combs states that a \"complaint that simply names a person as a defendant without alleging specific conduct by that individual is subject to summary dismissal as frivolous.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 9-1, at 10. True enough, as a general proposition, but Defendant fails to explain why that general statement applies to a pleading that alleges numerous Combs acts. Instead, Defendant \"leave[s] it to the court to seek out the relevant law, identify the relevant [factual allegations], and develop the argument for him.\"\n   <em>\n    Brenay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12408136\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/709/331/#p336\">\n    709 F.

The Court could, based on Defendant's motion, extend this finding to the full claim slate. Yet, the Court, in an effort to avoid needless discovery, has reviewed all claims for viability. As detailed below, the Court finds that Estep's abuse of process, IIED, negligence, and gross negligence claims fail as a matter of law. As for the remaining claims, the Court finds 12(b)(6) motion denial independently warranted on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   i.

As discussed in the qualified immunity analysis above, the Complaint allegations (as to lack of probable cause) suffice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Similarly, Plaintiff has adequately claimed excessive force. Based on the Complaint allegations, \"none of the specific [\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ] factors ... weigh in favor of a greater use of force.\"\n   <em>\n    Kostrzewa v.

Estep's arrest was, under the pleadings, essentially baseless. Thus, the purported crime severity was irrelevant, Plaintiff did not resist arrest, and nothing indicated that Plaintiff was violent. As further explained in the qualified immunity analysis above, Estep's allegations satisfy the Sixth Circuit's handcuffing claim elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   ii. False Arrest / Imprisonment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Complaint includes state false arrest and false imprisonment theories.

The Court\n   will not belabor a point already addressed. The Complaint allegations viewed in the light most favorable to Estep belie the existence of probable cause and state a valid false imprisonment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   iii. Malicious Prosecution\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A Kentucky malicious prosecution claim has five elements: \"1) the defendant initiated, continued, or procured a criminal ... proceeding ... against the plaintiff; 2) the defendant acted without probable cause; 3) the defendant acted with malice, which, in the criminal context, means seeking to achieve a purpose other than bringing an offender to justice; ... 4) the proceeding ... terminated in favor of the person against whom it was brought; and 5) the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

The Complaint explicitly alleges facts to satisfy the first, fourth, and fifth elements. Estep paints Combs as the only involved officer, claims Estep committed no crime, and contends that Combs initiated proceedings (causing him emotional distress, humiliation, and shame, DE 1-1, at 10 \u00b6 38) that the state court dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Estep also alleges malice and absence of probable cause, but legal conclusions are not entitled to a presumption of truth. Nonetheless, the Court, under the circumstances, views the prior analysis regarding arrest probable cause as determinative for the prosecution probable cause inquiry. The same allegations that underlie the Court's finding as to the false arrest claim's viability also support, at this early stage, a plausible malicious prosecution claim. An arrest without probable cause followed by a prosecution (on the same charges) with nothing in the pleadings to suggest additional proof of illicit conduct justifies, to the Court, an inference that the proceedings were initiated in the absence of probable cause. The cited dismissal for lack of evidence cinches the finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Further, \"[u]nder Kentucky law, 'malice can be inferred from a lack of probable cause.' \"\n   <em>\n    Phat's Bar &amp; Grill v.

Specifically, Estep failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted for any Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment \u00a7 1983 claim, any claim under \u00a7 1985 or \u00a7 1986, or any state law claim for false arrest (though the claim collapses into the false imprisonment claim), abuse of process, negligence, gross negligence, or IIED.
