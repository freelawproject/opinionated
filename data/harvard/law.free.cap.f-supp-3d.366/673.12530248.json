Scanlan is a resident of Doylestown, which is located in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. He generally flies as a pilot for American Airlines based out of LaGuardia Airport in New York. Both defendants are Delaware Corporations with their headquarters in Fort Worth, which is in the Northern District of Texas. Philadelphia, where this court sits, is one of defendants' ten \"hubs.\" American Airlines, as the country's largest domestic airline with over 100,000 employees, has over 7,474 employees in this city and has between 7 and 9 daily non-stop flights each way between Philadelphia and Forth Worth, Texas.

We first consider the preferred forum of the parties. Plaintiff, of course, prefers this district where the action was filed. Defendants prefer the Northern District of Texas and bear the burden of demonstrating the need for a transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties disagree over how much weight we should afford plaintiff's forum preference. Plaintiff's choice would typically \"not be lightly disturbed,\" especially considering that he has chosen his home forum.\n   <em>\n    Jumara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414882\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/55/873/#p879\">\n    55 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   879 ;\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525515\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/618/#p622\">\n    313 F.Supp.3d at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Koster v. (Am.) Lumbermens Mut. Cas.

Pa. 1978). Defendants contend that we therefore should afford little weight to plaintiff's preference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff counters that the special venue provision in USERRA affords greater weight to his forum choice. Courts have held that liberally allowing transfers in cases with special venue provisions would undermine Congressional intent to minimize the burden on plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    In re Laidlaw Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1991%20WL%20170837\">\n    1991 WL 170837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 27, 1991).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Special venue provisions and class actions therefore cut in opposite directions over how much weight to afford the choice of plaintiff's home forum. Both parties have identified cases where the courts have given more or less weight to plaintiff's preference in light of these competing considerations. In\n   <em>\n    Wellens v. Daiichi Sankyo Co.\n   </em>\n   , for example, the court weighed plaintiff's preferred forum choice more heavily that it normally would in a class action brought under Title VII because it has a special venue provision.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203242294\">\n    2013 WL 3242294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D. Cal. June 25, 2013). Similarly in\n   <em>\n    In re Laidlaw\n   </em>\n   , the court granted plaintiff's preferred forum choice greater deference than it otherwise would because the securities statute that gave rise to the cause of action contained a special venue provision, even though the plaintiff brought the case as a class action.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1991%20WL%20170837\">\n    1991 WL 170837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. By contrast, the courts in\n   <em>\n    Duffer v. United Cont'l Holdings, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202147802\">\n    2013 WL 2147802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D. Cal. May 16, 2013) and\n   <em>\n    Carder v. Continental Airlines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:09-cv-01448-DMS-BLM, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 28, 2009) granted plaintiffs' forum choices little deference in USERRA cases brought as class actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In light of these different approaches, we will afford plaintiff's choice of his home forum in the presence of a special venue provision some weight, but not\n   as much as we otherwise would because he brings his complaint as a class action. In order to warrant transfer, defendants still bear the burden of demonstrating that the other factors, on balance, outweigh plaintiff's choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The second private factor, the convenience of the parties when considering their \"relative physical and financial condition,\" does not help defendants meet their burden. If anything, it weighs in favor of remaining in this district. The court acknowledges that defendants are headquartered in Fort Worth and would be at least somewhat inconvenienced by sending their employees to Philadelphia for a trial or other court proceedings. However, plaintiff would be similarly inconvenienced by having to travel to the Northern District of Texas. While designated as a class representative, plaintiff of course also has a personal interest in the litigation. Since a jury trial has been demanded, it will be imperative for the jury to see in the courtroom someone representing the class other than the lawyers, just as defendants will assuredly have their representatives present. Transfer is not warranted when the effect would be to shift inconvenience from defendants to plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525515\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/618/#p622\">\n    313 F.Supp.3d at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants' financial condition, compared to that of plaintiff, clearly allows them to afford more easily the inconveniences associated with travel. Defendants are the nation's largest domestic airline and a Fortune 500 company with billions of dollars in assets. They maintain a \"hub\" in Philadelphia with thousands of employees and operate 7 to 9 daily flights from Fort Worth to Philadelphia. Defendants simply cannot maintain that inconvenience would be greater to them than to an individual plaintiff, notwithstanding that they may need to fly a number of individuals to this district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The third factor, the convenience of the witnesses, does not weigh in favor of transfer. We are only required to consider the convenience of witnesses \"to the extent that they may actually be unavailable for trial in one of the fora.\"\n   <em>\n    Jumara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414882\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/55/873/#p879\">\n    55 F.3d at 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though more witnesses may be located in Fort Worth than Philadelphia, there is no indication that any would be unavailable in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This factor therefore is neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants' argument regarding the location of books and records is similarly unpersuasive. While the relevant documents may be located in the Fort Worth, defendants do not suggest that any documents cannot easily be produced in Philadelphia. Moreover, technological advancements significantly reduce the weight of this factor as files can be easily reproduced and provided in electronic format.\n   <em>\n    Coppola v. Ferrellgas, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5761876\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/250/195/#p200\">\n    250 F.R.D. 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200 (E.D. Pa. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   VI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We next consider whether the claims arose elsewhere. Defendants argue that the claim arose in Fort Worth because plaintiff's cause of action arose from strategic policy decisions of defendants made at their headquarters in Fort Worth.\n   <em>\n    Theresa Ayling v.

Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20994403\">\n    1999 WL 994403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 28, 1999). Plaintiff counters that his home forum of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania is where the claim arose because \"a breach that results from plaintiffs being denied benefits occurs where the benefits are to be received.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Keating v.

Pa. 1997). Because plaintiff brought this suit as a class action, the class members would suffer harm wherever they are located. Accordingly, we do not give much weight to this factor and consider it to be neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   VII\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We now turn to the last private factor, \"practical considerations that could make the trial easy, expeditious, or inexpensive.\" Defendants assert that this factor weighs in favor of transfer because Fort Worth is the center of discovery with witnesses and documents. We must be careful to not interpret this factor so as to \"double count\" any considerations that we made in the context of other factors.\n   <em>\n    Carnegie Mellon Univ. v. Marvell Tech.

It has a slightly faster median time from filing to disposition and from filing to trial. Moreover, our district has no \"judicial emergencies\" resulting from vacancies while the Northern District of Texas has five vacancies considered \"judicial emergencies,\" including three vacancies of over three years. Perhaps most relevant, the undersigned, to whom the matter is assigned, is current in his work.

The\n   <em>\n    Woodall\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hoefert\n   </em>\n   lawsuits therefore have significant overlap, with the same American Airlines Inc. defendant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   nearly identical classes, and many of the same causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Hoefert\n   </em>\n   lawsuit and the present lawsuit are less similar. We first consider the parties. While the defendants are the same in both cases, the plaintiff classes have notable differences. Plaintiff in the present case seeks to represent fellow employees who took military leave while participating in the Global Profit Sharing Plan whose award under the Plan did not include imputed earnings for periods of military leave. By contrast, plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Hoefert\n   </em>\n   sought to represent 3 classes: (1) all current and former pilots who did not accrue sick time due to military absence between July 2012 and trial, (2) all current and former pilots who did not accrue vacation time due to military absence, and (3) all current and former pilots who took military absence during the time of a monthly bonus program, all between July 2012 and trial. While there could be some overlap in these two classes, namely, pilots who did not receive various benefits purportedly owed to them while on military leave, the present litigation class is not limited to pilots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We next consider whether the issues in\n   <em>\n    Hoefert\n   </em>\n   and the present case are the same or similar. Notably, both allege violations of \u00a7 4316(b)(1) of USERRA because defendants purportedly treat military leave differently than other types of leave. Both involve interpretation of various Collective Bargaining Agreements. However, the benefits at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hoefert\n   </em>\n   , leave accrual and a particular bonus program, are distinct from the benefits of the Global Profit Sharing Plan. Plaintiff in this case also alleges additional allegations, including violations of \u00a7 4318 of USERRA because the Global Profit Sharing Plan qualifies as an employee benefit pension plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The present lawsuit involves class members and issues with notable differences from\n   <em>\n    Hoefert\n   </em>\n   . Significantly,\n   <em>\n    Woodall\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hoefert\n   </em>\n   were not assigned to the same judge as related cases in the Northern District of Texas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This undermines any contention that transfer to the Northern District of Texas would ensure that the present case would proceed more efficiently than if it remained here. There would be no benefit to having this case in the Northern District of Texas if it were in front of a different judge. We also note that we are dealing here with federal and not state claims for relief. The presence of the\n   <em>\n    Hoefert\n   </em>\n   case in the Northern District of Texas is not a persuasive reason for transfer under \u00a7 1404(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   X\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The defendants, as noted above, have the burden to establish the need for transfer \"for the convenience of the parties and witnesses, in the interests of justice.\" Most factors are neutral, while others weigh slightly in favor of plaintiff. Defendants have not met their burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Accordingly, the defendants' motion to transfer this action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas under \u00a7 1404(a) will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Hoefert\n    </em>\n    litigation also named American Airlines Group, Inc. as a defendant. It has since been dismissed.\n    <em>\n     Hoefert v. American Airlines Inc.\n    </em>\n    , No. 4:18-cv-00466, Doc. # 45 (N.D Tex.
