(\"Optum\") have sued defendant David Smith for allegedly violating his contractual obligations concerning unfair competition and trade secrets, and the federal and Massachusetts statutes that protect trade secrets as well. An Arbitration Policy that is part of Smith's contract with Optum requires that this dispute be resolved by binding arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 25-1 at 2 of 8. However, it also provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   [T]his Policy does not preclude either an employee or [Optum] from seeking emergency or temporary injunctive relief in a court of law in accordance with applicable law. However,\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the court has issued a ruling concerning the emergency or temporary injunctive relief, the employee and [Optum] are required to submit the dispute to arbitration pursuant to this Policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 of 8 (emphasis added). In addition, the Arbitration Policy provides that disputes concerning its interpretation and arbitrability are to be decided by an arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Optum moved for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") that would, among other things, prohibit Smith from working for a company known as \"ABC,\" which Optum alleges is a competitor, and from disclosing or using Optum's confidential information to benefit ABC. Smith responded by moving to have this case immediately ordered to arbitration on all issues, including whether this court has the authority to issue a TRO before compelling arbitration on the merits, which Optum agrees will be required after the court decides its request for temporary injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At a hearing on January 30, 2019, the court found that it had the authority to issue a TRO before compelling arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 30, 2019 Tr. at 18-21. Although no order had entered, later that day Smith filed a notice of appeal and a motion to stay proceedings in this court pending a decision of its appeal. Optum opposed the request for a stay, arguing in part that it\n   will be irreparably harmed if the court does not decide its motion for a TRO or at least impose conditions on the stay that are comparable to the TRO it is seeking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 5, 2019, the court issued a Memorandum and Order amplifying the reasons stated in court on January 30, 2019 for its finding that it has the authority to decide the pending motion for a TRO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 48. Accordingly, the court denied Smith's motion to compel arbitration immediately.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   There is, therefore, now an appealable order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; Fed. R. App. P. 4(a) (2). For the reasons explained below, the court is staying this case pending appeal and not imposing any conditions on the stay. However, in view of the contention that Optum will suffer ongoing irreparable harm during the pendency of the appeal, the court suggests that the First Circuit decide\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   whether the stay should be continued or lifted, or attempt to decide the appeal expeditiously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    etseq.\n   </em>\n   , authorizes a party to pursue an interlocutory appeal of a district court's denial of a motion to compel arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (1) (B).
