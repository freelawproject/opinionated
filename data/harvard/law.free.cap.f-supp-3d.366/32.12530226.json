The issue now before the Court is the lawfulness of the Secretary's actions on remand following the Court's earlier decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As the Court explained in its prior opinion, in August 2013, the Secretary of Health and Human Services\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   adopted a new policy-known as the \"2-midnight policy\"-to distinguish between inpatient and outpatient hospital visits. In the Secretary's view, that change in policy came with significant budgetary consequences; the Department's actuaries estimated that adoption of the 2-midnight policy would cause a net utilization shift of approximately 40,000 \"encounters ... from outpatient to inpatient\" status and, because inpatient stays typically cost the Medicare program more than outpatient visits, it would increase Medicare expenditures by approximately $220 million in 2014.

In light of the \"magnitude and breadth\" of this \"utilization shift,\" the Secretary concluded that it was appropriate to exercise her exceptions and adjustments authority to offset the cost to the program, and she thus adopted the 0.2 percent rate reduction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2050%2C496\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2050%2C496\">\n    at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,953 -54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In response, an array of hospitals brought suit under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   They argued that the Secretary lacked statutory authority to adopt the rate reduction; that the FY 2014 rule failed to comply with the procedural requirements of the APA; and that the 0.2 percent rate reduction was arbitrary and capricious. Although the Court rejected the hospitals' challenge to the Secretary's statutory authority and declined to reach their arbitrary and capricious challenge, it held that the Secretary did not reveal key actuarial assumptions until after the close of the comment period and thereby deprived the hospitals of a meaningful opportunity to comment on the rate reduction.\n   <em>\n    Shands I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197277\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/240/\">\n    139 F.Supp.3d at 260-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Reg. 75,107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Dec. 1, 2015) (\"December 2015 notice\"). Then, after receiving and considering those comments, the Secretary did an about-face, abandoning the Department's effort to sustain the 0.2 percent reduction for FY 2014 (and other years) and, instead, proposing that the Department no longer impose the rate reduction going forward and adopt a one-time 0.6 percent rate increase for FY 2017 \"to address the effect of the 0.2 percent reduction to the rates in effect for FY 2014,\" FY 2015, and FY 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Medicare Program,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2024%2C946\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. 24,946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 25,138 (proposed April 27, 2016) (\"FY 2017 proposed rule\"). Four months later, the Department finalized that rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Medicare Program,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2056%2C762\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. 56,762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Aug. 22, 2016) (\"FY 2017 rule\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The matter has now returned to this Court, where two groups of plaintiffs raise separate challenges to the Secretary's actions on remand. The first group-the \"\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs\"-argue that the Court in\n   <em>\n    Shands I\n   </em>\n   remanded the matter to the Secretary to provide her with an opportunity \"to cure the [FY 2014] rule's deficiencies\" and, because the Secretary did not do so, the Court should vacate that rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 82 at 8. The Secretary's adoption of the 0.6 percent increase for FY 2017, in their view, did not redress this problem for two reasons. First, the administrative record fails to establish that the 0.6 percent rate increase made the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs whole; a decline in inpatient visits to a particular hospital over the FY 2014 to FY 2016 period, for example, would mean that the rate increase in later years would not fully compensate that hospital for the rate decrease in earlier years. Second, and more importantly, the FY 2017 rule is only \"forward-looking\" and did not \"repeal, amend, or supersede the FY 2014 [r]ule.\" Dkt. 82 at 25. The FY 2014 rule, they therefore argue, remains in effect and, because it was neither adopted in conformity with APA procedural requirements nor remedied on remand, it must be set aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The second group of hospitals-the \"\n   <em>\n    Athens\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs\"-take a different tack.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs treat the FY 2017 rule as immaterial-and, indeed, suggest that the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider that separate rulemaking-the\n   <em>\n    Athens\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs engage with the FY 2017 rule and acknowledge that the Secretary took a step in the right direction by adopting the 0.6 percent rate increase. But that step, in their view, was far too small. They contend that the data that was before the Department did not merely show that the Secretary erred in hypothesizing that the 2-midnight rule would result in a net increase in inpatient encounters; it actually showed that the 2-midnight policy would decrease inpatient encounters and would, accordingly, decrease Medicare payments to hospitals. Dkt. 84-2 at 23. For this reason, they argued in the administrative process that the Secretary should have adopted an across-the-board rate increase to compensate hospitals for the reduced payments. Because the Secretary failed to consider the data and comments supporting a rate increase, they contend that the Court should once again remand the matter but, this time, should vacate the FY 2014 rule and direct that the Secretary (1) consider Plaintiffs' comments and data and (2) \"budget neutralize any replacement rule.\" Dkt. 84-2 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Both the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Athens\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs have moved for summary judgment, and the Secretary has cross-moved for summary judgment. For the reasons explained below, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the Plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment and will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   the Secretary's cross-motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

As explained above, the Department's actuaries concluded that approximately 40,000 hospital discharges would shift to inpatient status in 2014 due to the change from the 24-hour benchmark to the 2-midnight policy and presumption. In the view of various commenters, that was a remarkable and counterintuitive conclusion. It was not until the Secretary announced the final FY 2014 rule that the commenters came to understand that the actuaries examined only \"outpatient claims for observation or a major procedure\" when they estimated the likely shift from outpatient to inpatient encounters, and that they examined only \"claims containing a surgical MS-DRG\" in estimating the likely shift from inpatient to outpatient encounters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 262-63.

In short, because the Secretary did not timely disclose the assumptions that the Department's actuaries applied, commenters did not have the opportunity to explain to the Secretary why the Department's analysis was flawed, and the Secretary did not have the opportunity to consider and to respond to those comments. As a result, the administrative record was insufficiently developed to permit the type of arbitrary and capricious review that Plaintiffs raised.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, the Court considered the question of remedy.

more expansive measure of length of care, which-when combined with the more expansive definition of \"observation care\"-would have resulted in an estimate of \"570,000 cases shifting from the

The\n    <em>\n     Bakersfield\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs' Challenge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   According to the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs, the proper disposition of the case follows from a simple syllogism: First, a rule that is adopted in violation of the APA must be set aside. Second, the Court has already concluded that the FY 2014 rulemaking violated the APA because the Secretary failed to provide a meaningful opportunity for public comment on the 0.2 percent rate reduction. Third, although the Court provided the Secretary with the opportunity to cure this deficiency on remand, that opportunity has now \"come and gone,\" and the Secretary not only failed to cure the deficiency but affirmatively \"abdicated any claim to the rate reduction's legitimacy.\" Dkt. 82 at 8; 17. Thus, because the procedurally-deficient FY 2014 rate reduction remains in effect, the Court must set it aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Anticipating the Secretary's response, the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs go on to argue that the one-time, 0.6 percent rate increase that the Secretary adopted in FY 2017 does not forestall this conclusion. As an initial matter, they argue that the FY 2017 rate increase did not moot their challenge because the administrative record does not establish that the 0.6 percent rate increase \"will make Plaintiffs whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. Then, turning to the substance of the issue, they stress that the FY 2017 rule did not \"repeal, amend, or supersede the FY 2014 rule\" and argue that nothing short of a repeal of the FY 2014 rule-and certainly not an adjustment in the rates set for a different fiscal year-is legally sufficient to remedy the APA violation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. But, even if the Court declines to vacate the FY 2014 rate reduction, the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs continue, they are at least entitled to \"make whole\" relief, which will require that the Secretary \"compare\" the loss to each of the plaintiff-hospitals resulting from the 0.2 percent reduction adopted in FYs 2014-2016 with the gain to each hospital realized from the FY 2017 0.6 percent adjustment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. Finally, they argue that the FY 2017 final rule is not currently before the Court and that, as a result, the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider whether the \"0.6 percent positive adjustment\" adopted in that rulemaking \"was an appropriate response to the botched FY 2014 rulemaking.\" Dkt. 82 at 23 n.6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 93 at 14-15;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (\"The Plaintiffs in the instant case are not challenging whether the Secretary's method for addressing the deficient payment reduction is proper.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Before turning to these contentions, it is worth clarifying what is, and what is not, in dispute. First, and most importantly, the Secretary no longer defends the FY 2014 adjustment. To the contrary, after receiving comments in response to its December 2015 notice, the Department \"changed its mind,\" Dkt. 65 at 7, and elected \"to remove the 0.2 percent adjustment\" going forward and to \"address the effect of that adjustment\" for past years by adopting a one-time 0.6 percent increase in the rates, 81 Fed. Reg. at 57,060. Second, although the parties have spilled much ink on the question of mootness, the Secretary concedes that the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' challenge is not moot: The Department's \"position is not that the issue has been mooted, but rather, ... simply that the remedial approach [it] has chosen is lawful.\" Dkt. 89-1 at 22 n.11. The Court, of course, has an independent duty to determine whether it has Article III jurisdiction to consider the challenge,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LeFande v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174524\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/485/#p492\">\n    841 F.3d 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 492 (D.C. Cir. 2016), but it agrees that mootness is a red herring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Although the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs recognize that the Secretary has \"abandoned [the Department's] defense of the rate reduction,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Dkt. 82 at 16, they stress that the FY 2014 rate reduction nonetheless remains in effect. That premise is correct-and indeed undisputed. The next step in their argument, however, is more problematic. In their view, not only does the FY 2014 rate reduction remain in effect, but it stands alone, wholly apart from any action the Secretary took in the FY 2017 rulemaking. Had the Secretary \"withdrawn, cancelled, amended, or superseded\" the FY 2014 rate reduction in the FY 2017 rule, they argue, that chasm might have been bridged. Dkt. 82 at 26. But according to the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs, the Secretary merely \"address[ed]\" the 0.2 percent rate reduction in the FY 2017 rulemaking-a word that the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs contend signals the Secretary's recognition that the Department \"could not claim that the 0.6 percent adjustment removed the effects of the 0.2 percent negative adjustment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174524\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/485/#p492\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 26 n.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The distinction between \"removing\" and \"addressing\" the 0.2 percent adjustment, however, cannot bear the weight that the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs suggest.

As the Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Shands I\n   </em>\n   , the Secretary's failure to disclose the critical assumptions relied upon by the Department's actuaries deprived Plaintiffs and \"other members of the public\" of the \"opportunity to offer meaningful comments on the ... propos[ed] ... 0.2 percent reduction.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197277\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/240/\">\n    139 F.Supp.3d at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Dkt. 82 at 15. That contention, however, conflates the APA obligation to provide the public with a meaningful opportunity to comment on a proposed rule and the APA obligation to offer a reasoned and rational explanation for the action the agency ultimately takes. When considered separately, Plaintiffs' argument founders. With respect to the first obligation, as explained above, the administrative record establishes that the Secretary did, in fact, provide the public with a meaningful opportunity to comment on the 0.2 percent rate reduction. And, with respect to the second obligation, the Secretary was not required to provide a reasoned and rational explanation for a conclusion that the Department declined to defend. To be sure, had the Secretary decided to stand by the 0.2 percent reduction after considering the comments that the Department received, she would have been required to explain that decision. But that is not what she did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Secretary Was Not Required to Rescind the FY 2014 Rate Adjustment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs, of course, do not concede the premise of this analysis-they maintain that Secretary did not abandon the FY 2014 (or FY 2015 and FY 2016) rate reduction but, rather, left the rule in place. That argument, however, has nothing to do with whether the Secretary provided the public with a meaningful opportunity to comment on the rate reduction or whether she offered a reasoned explanation for the actuarial assumptions the Department applied. Rather, it implicates a second, distinct set of questions that focus on whether, having lost confidence in the actuarial assumptions underlying the FY 2014 rule, the Secretary was required formally to rescind the FY 2014 rate adjustment or whether she could, instead, \"address\" any concerns regarding the FY 2014 rate adjustment (and any similar concerns about the FY 2015 and FY 2016 rate adjustments) by adopting a 0.6 percent prospective rate adjustment in FY 2017. Cleared of the preceding underbrush, this is the central issue presented by the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' challenge, and none of the arguments that they press is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs first argue that the administrative record does not show that the 0.6 percent rate increase was sufficient to make them whole-that is, it did not completely undo the FY 2014 rate reduction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 82 at 21-23. In support of this contention, they point to comments that were submitted in response to the FY 2017 proposed rule indicating that hospital admissions declined over the relevant period, and they note that the Department has not disputed the accuracy of these comments.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2075%2C107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 22-23 and n.6. Declining hospital admissions are relevant because, roughly stated, the dollar value of each of the adjustments at issue is a product of the IPPS standardized amount (or hospital-specific or Puerto Rico-specific amount), which varies based on the adjustment at issue, times the number of hospital discharges in the relevant fiscal year. Accordingly, a 0.6 percent rate increase in FY 2017 would not make a hospital whole for 0.2 percent rate decreases in FYs 2014-2016, if the hospital discharged fewer\n   patients in FY 2017 than it did, on average, in FYs 2014-2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   And, even if the FY 2017 0.6 percent rate increase was sufficient to compensate\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Medicare hospitals for their\n   <em>\n    aggregate\n   </em>\n   losses, the Department's approach failed even to consider \"the specific circumstances of each and every Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2075%2C107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2075%2C107\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . From this, the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs conclude that the FY 2017 0.6 percent adjustment \"is neither solace nor sufficient legal redress for any Plaintiff that was shorted by the 0.2 percent payment reduction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2075%2C107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Although the factual premise of this argument is convincing, its conclusion is not. As the Secretary explained in the FY 2017 final rule, the Department did not intend for the 0.6 percent increase precisely to mirror the 0.2 percent reductions for FYs 2014-2016 or to make whole each individual hospital that had been subject to those reductions. The Secretary, instead, adopted the 0.6 percent FY 2017 rate adjustment as \"the most transparent, expedient, and administratively feasible method to\" address \"the effect of the 0.2 percent reduction to the rates in effect for FY 2014, the 0.2 percent reduction to the rates in effect for FY 2015, ... and the 0.2 percent reduction to the rates in effect for FY 2016.\" FY 2017 rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 57,059. The Secretary added that, although the Department does not generally believe that \"it is appropriate in a prospective system to retrospectively adjust rates,\" it was prepared to \"take this action in the specific context of this unique situation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   With respect to the \"small number of hospitals\" that \"would not benefit from the adjustment to the FY 2017 rates\"-such as those that \"closed\" or \"converted to a different type of hospital\" by FY 2017-moreover, the Secretary agreed to provide \"a process to address\" their losses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57,060.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Notably, although the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs contend that the Secretary was required to provide each Medicare hospital with \"make whole\" relief, they fail to cite a single statutory or regulatory provision in support of that contention. Nor is it the Court's role to engage in its own review of what is, by any measure, a \"complex statutory and regulatory regime,\"\n   <em>\n    Good Samaritan Hosp. v.

To the extent Plaintiffs purport to find the \"make whole\" obligation in the APA, moreover, they also fail to explain the basis for their argument. To be sure, an APA violation might, at least at times, require \"make whole\" relief. But, as explained above, the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' contention that the Secretary violated the APA by failing to provide a reasoned explanation for the Department's initial reliance on the actuaries' assumptions attacks a strawman; the Department no longer stands by the 0.2 percent reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   For present purposes, the more apt question is whether the Secretary's decision to \"address\" that about-face by adopting a prospective 0.6 percent rate increase-a question that has not previously been presented to the Court-was adopted in violation of the APA or failed sufficiently to undo the 2014 rate reduction. With respect to that question, however, the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs offer little more than\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, in response to the Department's contention that the D.C.

As an initial matter, there is no question that the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs, along with an array of other providers, presented their challenge to the FY 2014 adjustment to the Board and that the Board rendered decisions with respect to each of those appeals.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 14-976, Dkt. 1-1 at 7-9. In each case, moreover, the Board granted the relevant providers' request for \"expedited judicial review\" pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The expedited-judicial-review provision permits the provider to institute a judicial action involving a \"question of law or regulations relevant to the matters in controversy\" within sixty days of obtaining a determination from the Board \"that it is without authority to decide the question.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f)(1). Accordingly, by granting expedited review, the Board necessarily determined that it was \"without authority to decide the legal sufficiency of the Final Rule.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ. No. 14-976, Dkt. 1-1 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court does not understand the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs to contend that it would lack jurisdiction had the Secretary addressed the deficiencies in the FY 2014 adjustment in a proceeding devoted to FY 2014, nor could they successfully press such an argument. The statutory requirements for jurisdiction were satisfied: an array of providers\n   <em>\n    presented\n   </em>\n   claims to the Board regarding the FY 2014 0.2 percent reduction, and the Board\n   <em>\n    decided\n   </em>\n   that it lacked authority \"to decide the legal sufficiency of the Final Rule.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 14-976, Dkt. 1-1 at 8. The proceedings on remand, moreover, did not operate to divest the Court of jurisdiction to address that issue or to require further proceedings before the Board. To the contrary, the Court's remand order contemplated only that the Secretary would provide the public with a further opportunity to comment on the actuarial assumptions she relied upon in adopting the FY 2014 0.2 percent reduction and that she would, to the extent necessary, conduct further \"rulemaking\" proceedings relating to that issue. Dkt. 53. The Court did not contemplate that the parties would return to the Board, which had already decided that it lacked authority to review the validity of the 0.2 percent reduction, and, indeed, doing so would have frustrated the Court's direction that the Secretary \"expedite proceedings on remand.\"\n   <em>\n    Shands I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197277\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/240/\">\n    139 F.Supp.3d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (indicating that the Secretary's failure to comply with the expedited schedule \"may counsel in favor of vacatur of the rule\"). All of this is more than sufficient to sustain the Court's jurisdiction to consider the lawfulness of the FY 2014 rule, in light of the proceedings on remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1877\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(3) (noting that Board review should not occur \"to the extent ... inconsistent with the court's remand order or any other order of the court regarding the civil action\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs do not question the Court's jurisdiction to entertain such a challenge. They, instead, take aim at the Court's jurisdiction to consider the substance of the FY 2017 rule, which was not subject to the Board's earlier expedited judicial review determination. Dkt. 93\n   at 14-15. To this, the Court might add that the substance of the FY 2017 rule also falls beyond the scope of the lawsuits that are at issue in the pending cross-motions; all that is currently at issue is the lawfulness of the FY 2014 rule.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 14-976, Dkt. 1 (challenge to FY 2014 rule);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Civ. No. 14-263 (consolidated actions), Dkt. 53 (remanding matter for further consideration of 0.2 percent reduction used \"for fiscal year 2014\"). Plaintiffs are therefore correct that any challenges that any providers may want to bring with respect to the FY 2017 rule are not currently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   But that does not answer the relevant question, which is whether the Court may consider whether the 0.6 percent rate increase the Secretary adopted in the FY 2017 rule adequately \"addresses\" any deficiencies in the FY 2014 rule. Plaintiffs fail to identify any statute, regulation, or case law that precludes the Court from doing so. The jurisdictional provisions that Plaintiffs invoke speak only to when a provider may seek judicial review of a regulatory action; they say nothing about which regulatory actions the Secretary may invoke in defending an earlier action that is properly before the Court. Nor is the Court convinced that agency proceedings are hermetically sealed in the manner that Plaintiffs suggest. As the Secretary made clear, she decided to address the problem posed by the FY 2014 rate increase in the context of the FY 2017 rulemaking. FY 2017 rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 57,059. There is no reason the Court cannot, or should not, consider what the Secretary said and did in the context of evaluating the FY 2014 rule, regardless of the proceeding in which she did so. Or, put differently, the Secretary expressly considered and addressed this Court's remand of the FY 2014 rate adjustment in the course of finalizing the FY 2017 IPPS rule, and there is no reason an agency cannot do multiple things-addressing multiple years-in a single proceeding. Here, there is no question that the Secretary addressed the FY 2014 rate adjustment at the same time as setting the FY 2017 rates, and absent constitutional or regulatory restraints, agencies are \"free to fashion their own procedure[s] and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties,\"\n   <em>\n    Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v.

Armed with these two premises, they then contend (1) that the Secretary has failed to consider an important aspect of the problem-that is, the evidence showing \"that the two-midnight rule would result in a substantial net decrease in inpatient admissions far greater than the net increase CMS predicted;\" (2) that she failed to consider reasonable alternatives-that is, the upward adjustment to the FY 2014 IPPS rates that they urged in the comment process; and (3) that she failed to respond to significant comments-that is, the comments that they submitted challenging the actuaries' assumptions and purporting to show that the 2-midnight rule \"would actually cost hospitals billions of dollars.\" Dkt. 84-1 at 7-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Department responds that the sovereign immunity of the United States bars this challenge because the Secretary's \"adjustment\" authority to grant the rate increase that Plaintiffs seek is \"committed to agency discretion by law,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), and thus review of the Secretary's decision whether to exercise that authority lies beyond the reach of the APA.

At first blush, that argument carries some force. Under the Medicare Act, the Secretary is required to follow a series of complex statutory instructions to derive \"the standardized amount that is used to calculate inpatient prospective payments for most hospitals.\"\n   <em>\n    Shands I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197277\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/240/\">\n    139 F.Supp.3d at 250-251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \" Section 1395ww(d)(5) authorizes her to make additional payments, exceptions, and adjustments, most of which relate to atypical circumstances or particular types of hospitals.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197277\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/240/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197277\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/240/\">\n    at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, the subparagraph at issue here- \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(I)(i) -provides the Secretary with a \"broad-spectrum grant of authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Adirondack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826793,4324449\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/692/\">\n    740 F.3d at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike the more cabined authorities that precede it, \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(I)(i) simply provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   The Secretary shall provide by regulation for such other exceptions and adjustments to such payment amounts under this subsection\n   <em>\n    as the Secretary deems appropriate.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(I)(i) (emphasis added). This delegation of authority, according to the Secretary, has only one limit-the exception or adjustment must be one that the Secretary \"deems appropriate\"-and that direction \"is precisely the sort of vague statutory formulation that courts have routinely held to be unreviewable.\" Dkt. 89-1 at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Athens\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs disagree for several reasons. They first argue that, if the Secretary's view of \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(I)(i) were correct, \"this Court's earlier decision remanding for further proceedings would have been unlawful.\" Dkt. 95 at 17. That argument, however, incorrectly equates review of the Secretary's decision to exercise her discretion to make an adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(I)(i) -that is, her decision to act-with her decision\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to make an adjustment-that is, her decision to refrain from acting. An analogy to a slightly different exercise of administrative discretion highlights why \u00a7 701(a) does not necessarily require the symmetry that Plaintiffs' suggest: Courts have long recognized that an agency's decision not to bring an enforcement action is presumptively unreviewable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Batchelder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531927\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/114/#p123\">\n    442 U.S. 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 123-24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531927\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/114/#p123\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531927\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/114/#p123\">\n    60 L.Ed.2d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979). But once an agency brings an enforcement action, that action is generally subject to review. That is, as the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Heckler v. Chaney\n   </em>\n   , once an agency acts to enforce the law, \"that action itself provides a focus for judicial review.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p828\">\n    470 U.S. at 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p828\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For similar reasons, the Court cannot reject the Secretary's \u00a7 701(a) argument here based on the stand-alone contention that the Court's prior review of the Secretary's previous decision to exercise her adjustment authority necessarily means that her decision not to make an adjustment is also subject to review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   That, however, does not end the matter.

Dkt. 89-1 at 18-19. She first argues that the D.C.

That contention is difficult to fathom.

The government was perhaps confused because \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(C)(iii) no longer appears in the U.S. Code. The reason it is no longer there, however, is because in 1989 Congress transferred that subsection to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(I)(i) -that is, the very provision that is at issue in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub.

Circuit considered in\n   <em>\n    Marshall County\n   </em>\n   and the language at issue in this case is identical. That language provides that the \"Secretary shall provide by regulation for such other exceptions and adjustments to such payment amounts under this subsection as the Secretary deems appropriate.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(I)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   This, then, leads to the Secretary's second theory for distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Marshall County\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Marshall County\n   </em>\n   , the Secretary's decision whether to grant an exception was guided by a separate, substantive provision of the Medicare Act, which directed that she define \"urban areas\" by reference to Metropolitan Statistical Areas, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, or \"such similar area as the Secretary has recognized.\" 988 F.2d at 1223. The D.C. Circuit, accordingly, held that \"[w]ith respect to the particular provisions relevant to [that] case, ... Congress [had] provided a rather specific norm-the OMB model-to guide the Secretary's judgment concerning the definition of urban areas\" and whether to employ her exceptions authority to modify the governing definition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1224.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Court is not convinced, however, that\n   <em>\n    Marshall County\n   </em>\n   can be so easily distinguished. In addition to pointing to the \"OMB model\" as a \"specific norm\" to \"guide the Secretary's judgment,\" the D.C. Circuit held that the Secretary's \u00a7 701(a) argument \"puts too much emphasis on the word 'deem;' \" that the statute's use of \"the mandatory 'shall' ... might be thought to add at least some obligation to consider exceptions;\" that the government's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Webster v.

Finally, the Court of Appeals recognized that, although the action/inaction distinction might counsel in favor of \"quite narrow\" review of a failure to grant a \"waiver[ ] or exception[,]\" \"[e]xtremely narrow review is not ... conceptually\n   equivalent to ... no review at all,\" even if, \"in practical effect,\" the ultimate result is the same.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1225.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Nor can the Court accept the Secretary's premise that\n   <em>\n    Marshall County\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable on the grounds that Congress provided the Secretary with an underlying norm to apply and that a similar norm is absent in this case. That may well be true, but it goes to the merits of the\n   <em>\n    Athens\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' challenge, not to the threshold inquiry required by \u00a7 701(a). According to the\n   <em>\n    Athens\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs, the FY 2014 rule \"recognized that basic principles of budget neutrality require ensuring that hospitals be adequately compensated for the financial impact of the two-midnight policy,\" and the Secretary has not \"disavow[ed] [these] budget-neutrality principles.\" Dkt. 95 at 8-9. The\n   <em>\n    Athens\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs may face an uphill battle in pressing that claim, but nothing in \u00a7 701(a) precludes them from trying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Whether the Secretary's Actions on Remand Complied With the APA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Although\n   <em>\n    Marshall County\n   </em>\n   clears the way for the\n   <em>\n    Athens\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs to obtain judicial review, the decision also teaches that judicial review of the Secretary's refusal to invoke her \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(I)(i) adjustments and exceptions authority is \"[e]xtremely narrow.\" 988 F.2d at 1225. Consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Athens\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' challenge must start with the uncontested premise that nothing in the Medicare Act requires that the Secretary ensure that the rule at issue remains budget neutral.

Dkt. 95 at 8-9.

This description, however, substantially overstates what the Secretary actually did in the FY 2014 rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The best description of what the Secretary did is captured in her own words. In the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding the FY 2014 adjustment, the Secretary wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   In light of the widespread impact of the proposed policy discussed in [the proposed rule] on the IPPS and the systemic nature of the issue as demonstrated above, we believe it is appropriate to propose to use our exceptions and adjustments authority ... to offset the estimated $200 million in additional IPPS expenditures associated with the proposed policy. This special exception and adjustment authority authorizes us to provide \"for such other exceptions and adjustments to [IPPS] payment amounts ... as the Secretary deems appropriate.\" We are proposing to reduce the standardized amount, the hospital-specific rates, and the Puerto Rico-specific standardize amount by 0.2 percent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   FY 2014 proposed rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 27,650 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27,651. Then, in the final rule, the Secretary responded to comments opposing the 0.2 percent reduction. Among other things, the Secretary noted that \"[i]n 2012 ... the [Department's Comprehensive Error Rate Testing] Contractor found that inpatient hospital admissions for 1-day stays or less has a Part A improper payment rate of 36.1 percent;\" that Recovery auditors had \"recovered more than $1.6 billion in improper payments because of inappropriate beneficiary status;\" and that \"the magnitude of these national figures demonstrates that issues surrounding the appropriate determination of a beneficiary's payment status are not isolated to a few hospitals.\" FY 2014 rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 50,953. Although agreeing \"with commenters that [the] exceptions and adjustment authority should not be routinely used in the IPPS system,\" the Secretary concluded \"that the systemic and widespread nature of this issue justifie[d] an overall adjustment to the IPPS rates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And, finally, in the portion of the FY 2014 rule that the\n   <em>\n    Athens\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs cite, she wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   For similar reasons, while we generally agree with commenters that it is not necessary to routinely estimate utilization shifts to ensure appropriate IPPS payments, this is a unique situation. Policy considerations such as this do not usually result in utilization shifts of sufficient magnitude and breadth to significantly impact the IPPS. In this situation, we believe it would be inappropriate to ignore such a utilization shift in the development of the IPPS payment rates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50,953 -54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Understood in this context, it is fair to conclude that the Secretary was concerned about the cost that the 2-midnight policy would impose on the Medicare program. The Secretary believed-regardless of whether she was correct-that Medicare program had routinely made \"improper\" payments to hospitals for inpatient admissions, and she believed-regardless of whether she was correct-that the 2-midnight policy would increase Medicare payments for inpatient care. Notably, she did not say \"that basic principles of budget neutrality require ensuring that\n   <em>\n    hospitals be adequately compensated\n   </em>\n   for the financial impact of the two-midnight policy.\" Dkt. 95 at 8-9 (emphasis added). She did not adopt a general principle in favor of budget neutrality. She did not even conclude that, whenever a utilization shift is of \"sufficient magnitude and breadth,\" the Department would ensure budget neutrality. FY 2014 rule, 78 Fed. Reg. at 50,953 -54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Rather, the Secretary merely determined that-\"[i]n this situation\"-an adjustment was warranted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, it is not at all clear that it would have been proper for the Secretary to have adopted a sweeping principle requiring budget neutrality in circumstances that were not identified\n   in the notice of proposed rulemaking (or the final rule) without first providing notice and an opportunity for public comment on whether she should do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sugar Cane Growers Coop. of Fla.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9432440,3698698\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/289/89/\">\n    289 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   95 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Plaintiffs' suggestion that the Secretary's reference to \"this situation\" should be read to encompass any significant utilization shift resulting from the 2-midnight rule is simply too thin a reed to support such a significant step. If anything, moreover, the Secretary's decision on remand from this Court's order in\n   <em>\n    Shands I\n   </em>\n   confirms this understanding of the FY 2014 rule. In responding to comments urging the Department to adopt a rate increase, the Secretary emphasized that the only relevant question posed by the notice of proposed rulemaking on remand was whether the Department should abandon the 0.2 percent rate decrease. To the extent commenters sought a rate increase, the Secretary observed that they had \"mischaracteriz[ed] [the] proposal.\" FY 2017 rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 57,060. As the Secretary further explained, she was not proposing to adopt a new \"adjustment to the rates for the net effect of\" the 2-midnight policy, but merely sought comments on whether to remove the -0.2 percent adjustment the Secretary adopted in FY 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In light of (1) the absence of any statutory command that the Secretary ensure budget neutrality; (2) the fact that the Secretary did not \"recognize[ ] that basic principles of budget neutrality require ensuring that hospitals be adequately compensated for the financial impact of the two-midnight policy,\" Dkt. 95 at 8-9; and (3) the \"[e]xtremely narrow\" scope of review applicable to the Secretary's \"refusal\" to grant an exception or adjustment under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(I)(i),\n   <em>\n    Marshall County Health Care Authority\n   </em>\n   , 988 F.2d at 1225, the Court concludes that the\n   <em>\n    Athens\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' challenge must fail. At its core, their challenge asserts that compelling evidence showed that the 2-midnight rule was likely to result in a significant utilization shift from inpatient to outpatient status and that the Secretary never meaningfully engaged with that evidence. But the Secretary did explain the basis for her decision: What was at issue in the FY 2014 and FY 2017 rulemakings was whether the Department should adopt-and adhere to-the 0.2 percent rate decrease. The Secretary never proposed a rate increase and never invited public comments on that question. Moreover, with respect to the issue on which the Secretary did seek input-whether to adhere to the 0.2 percent rate decrease-she concluded that, \"[f]or many of the reasons comments presented ... in prior rulemaking,\" she was \"no longer ... confident that the effect of the 2-midnight policy on the number of discharges paid under the IPPS may be measured in this context.\" FY 2017 rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 57,060.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   An agency can hardly be faulted for failing to respond in detail to comments regarding an action that the agency never proposed. But, even putting that difficulty aside, the record demonstrates that the Secretary engaged in reasoned decisionmaking when she concluded that she could not predict the effect of the 2-midnight policy with sufficient confidence to support a rate adjustment. As the Secretary explained in the final FY 2017 rule, \"[t]he 2-midnight policy itself and [the Department's] implementation and enforcement of it have ... evolved over time as a result of a combination of statutory, regulatory, and operational changes.\" 81 Fed. Reg. at 57,058. The Department, for example, hosted or supported various programs designed to educate \"stakeholders\" about the rule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition, Congress enacted the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which, among other things, prohibited Recovery\n   Auditors from reviewing patient status for claims with dates of admission up to March 31, 2015, \"absent evidence of systematic gaming, fraud, abuse, or delays in the provision of care by a provider of services,\" and Congress subsequently extended that prohibition through September 30, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Secretary, moreover, modified the 2-midnight policy itself to allow \"Part A payment on a case-by-case basis for inpatient admissions that do not satisfy the 2-midnight benchmark.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57,059. The Secretary also concluded that the Department's ability to estimate \"utilization changes\" resulting from the policy was less certain than it had previously believed, principally because \"relatively small changes\" in utilization \"would have a disproportionate effect on the estimated net costs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the Secretary explained that, \"in reviewing the public comments ... received on the December 1, 2015 notice and comment period,\" the Department \"also considered the fact that [its] actuaries' most recent estimate of the impact of the 2-midnight policy varie[d] between a savings and a cost over the FY 2014 to FY 2015 time period.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In response, the\n   <em>\n    Athens\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs argue that \"even when it is 'difficul[t] [to] determin[e] whether a model produces estimates so inaccurate as to be invalid ... that does not mean the [agency] [i]s free to choose methods ... without any apparent rigor in its analysis.' \" Dkt. 84-1 at 24 (quoting\n   <em>\n    AEP Texas N.

Cir. 2010) ). As a result, in their view, the Department was required to engage with the commenters' data and to explain, if possible, why they were wrong to posit that the policy would result in a substantial utilization shift toward outpatient status.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692347,3550703\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/432/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But that contention ignores the substantial deference due to an agency's \"judgments about data insufficiency, at least in the absence of further information or explanation ... regarding why deference in inappropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Mexichem Specialty Resins, Inc. v.

Cir. 2015). It ignores the fact that the Medicare Act does not require budget neutrality in this context, and the Secretary never proposed adopting an adjustment to make hospitals-as opposed to the public fisc-whole in the face of utilization shifts. And it ignores the fact that review of the Secretary's\n   <em>\n    decision not to exercise\n   </em>\n   her \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(I)(i) authority is \"[e]xtremely narrow\" and, in \"practical effect,\" may often \"be the same as ... no review at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Marshall County Health Care Authority\n   </em>\n   , 988 F.2d at 1225.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Finally, although barely touched upon in their briefs, the\n   <em>\n    Athens\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs tried a fallback approach at oral argument. Rather than arguing that the Secretary had committed herself to a standalone principle of budget neutrality, they argued that the validity of the 2-midnight policy itself turns on the question of whether the Secretary considered the financial consequences of the policy to participating hospitals and whether she offered a reasoned explanation for concluding that the policy should stand, even if it imposes substantial\n   losses on those hospitals. Oral Arg. Tr. (Rough at 8-11). The problem with this argument, however, is that the\n   <em>\n    Athens\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs have not challenged the validity of the 2-midnight policy. Count One of their complaint alleges that \"the 0.2 percent downward adjustment to IPPS payment rates\" adopted in the FY 2014 rule \"violates the\" APA. Civ. No. 14-503, Dkt. 1 at 13 (Compl. \u00b6 28). Count Two alleges that \"[t]he Secretary's decision not to increase or enact an upward adjustment in the IPPS payment rates violates the\" APA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (Compl. \u00b6 31). Count Three alleges that the Secretary violated the APA by failing to provide a meaningful opportunity for public comment when she adjusted the IPPS payment rates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33-35). Count Four alleges that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(I)(i) did not provide the Secretary with the statutory authority to adopt the 0.2 percent rate decrease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-38). And, finally, Plaintiffs' prayer for relief asks that the Court set aside the Secretary's calculation of the relevant payment rates and compel \"the Secretary to recalculate\" those rates \"in order to offset the aggregate decrease in the IPPS payments resulting from adoption of the two-midnight rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (Compl. Relief Requested). Because the\n   <em>\n    Athens\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs have not challenged the 2-midnight rule itself, they cannot now argue that the rule is deficient because the Secretary failed to consider whether to adopt a rate increase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The Court, accordingly, is unpersuaded that the Secretary violated the APA by failing to consider evidence purporting to show that the 2-midnight policy would result in a substantial decrease in inpatient admissions, failing to consider reasonable alternatives to the rate reduction she did adopt, or by failing to respond to comments purporting to show that the 2-midnight policy would result in a substantial decrease in inpatient admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   For the reasons given above, the Court will deny the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Athens\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment, Dkt. 82; Dkt. 84, and will grant the Secretary's cross-motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   A separate order will issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    A number of different agency actions, undertaken from 2013 to 2016, are relevant to the issue currently before the Court.
