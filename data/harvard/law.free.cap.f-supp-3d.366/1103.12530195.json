In this putative class action, Plaintiffs Jennifer Abrams (\"Abrams\") and others similarly situated (\"Plaintiffs\") are purchasers of such iDevices and allege that Apple Inc.'s (\"Defendant\") mitigation efforts to patch the vulnerability within the iDevices substantially slowed its processors, bringing a degradation in value and damage to their property.

Plaintiffs' argument, however, is premised on a self-serving and selective reading of Defendant's test results. Although Plaintiffs' CAC purports to rely on Defendant's own testing, it omits Defendant's finding that its \"testing with public benchmarks has shown that the changes in the December 2017 updates \"resulted in no measurable reduction in the performance of ... iOS as measured by\" multiple tests.

The CERT report relied upon by Plaintiffs is also inconclusive, reporting that \"in many cases\"-not all cases-the software updates for Spectre and Meltdown \"will have a negative effect on system performance.\" CAC \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Even if the GeekBench 4 benchmark test results and CERT report are construed liberally in Plaintiffs' favor, these reports only support an inference that some users, not most and certainly not all users, experienced slower performance in their iDevices.

In response, Plaintiffs argue that overpaying for goods based upon alleged misrepresentations by a manufacturer satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement for Article III.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pirozzi v.

App'x 720 (9th Cir. 2017). The consumers alleged that they had been injured because their vehicles were worth less than what they paid for them. The Ninth Circuit found plaintiffs' economic loss theory was not credible and insufficient to establish standing because plaintiffs alleged no facts to show their cars were worth less.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 723. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that plaintiffs had not, for example, alleged a demonstrable effect on the market for their specific vehicles based on documented recalls or a decrease in Kelly Bluebook values.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nor had plaintiffs\n   alleged that the risk of hacking was so immediate that they were forced to replace or discontinue using their vehicles, and thus incurred out-of-pocket expenses stemming from the alleged defect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the Ninth Circuit observed that nearly 100% of cars on the market include technologies potentially vulnerable to hacking.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In sum, the Ninth Circuit concluded that plaintiffs had failed to plead sufficient facts to establish Article III standing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 724.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Cahen\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs here do not allege facts to show their iDevices are worth less than what they paid for them. Plaintiffs do not allege any facts about the market for their iDevices. Plaintiffs do not allege that Meltdown and Spectre posed such an immediate risk that they were forced to replace or discontinue use of their iDevices. Nor do Plaintiffs allege that they were forced to replace or discontinue use of their iDevices due to the alleged degradation in performance. Instead, Plaintiffs assert conclusory allegations that they \"would not have purchased [their] iDevices, or paid the prices they did.\" CAC \u00b6 46.
