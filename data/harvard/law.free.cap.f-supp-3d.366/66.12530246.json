In response, the United States Forest Service and the Department of Agriculture (collectively, the \"Government\") produced hundreds of emails and photographs, several videos, and thousands of pages of responsive records. Relying on FOIA Exemptions 4, 5, 6, and 9, the Government withheld some records and produced others with significant redactions. The Project challenges these withholdings as unjustified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Both parties have moved for summary judgment. The Court finds that the Government properly withheld information under Exemptions 4, 5, and 9. But the Court also finds that the Government inappropriately invoked Exemption 6. Thus, both the Government's Motion and the Project's Cross-Motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nestl\u00e9 sells bottled drinking water, among other things.

Thus, \"[i]t simply could not be the case,\" the Project insists, \"that the withheld information is more detailed as to bore hole locations, and it is certainly not the case that the Forest Service has met its burden of proof of showing that it is.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   But this argument misapplies the burden of proof. True, the Government generally bears the burden of showing that a FOIA exemption applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mead Data Cent., Inc. v.

In fact, if the Government sought to show a likelihood of competitive harm with no evidence from a Nestl\u00e9 or industry subject matter expert, its arguments would probably fail. The Government's use of the Lawrence declaration was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Project also attacks the sufficiency of the Lawrence declaration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. It criticizes as \"unsupported\" the assertion that release of the information \"could aid some hypothetical competitor in 'reverse-engineering' internal business processes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.

Mr. Lawrence's declaration does not suggest that Nestl\u00e9's physical infrastructure alone constitutes an internal business process. Rather, he states that the withheld information includes descriptions of a \"system\" the company uses to evaluate, develop, and operationalize the physical infrastructure. Lawrence Decl. at 6. Rival firms could use these illustrations of planned infrastructure projects, inventory information, and related data to improve their own evaluation and development procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Next, the Project contends that \"[n]o competitor has or could obtain water rights in Strawberry Creek, so any information gained by reviewing [Nestl\u00e9's] infrastructure specifications would be useless, as the systems and methodologies only apply to Strawberry Creek.\" Pl.'s Reply at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 17.

As the Government suggests, \"although no other entity may have, at this time, applied for a special use permit [for Strawberry Creek], they have the right to do so.\" Defs.' Reply at 7, ECF No. 25. More broadly, the Project offers no support for its contention that Nestl\u00e9's infrastructure, systems, and methodologies apply only to Strawberry Creek.

True, the Government has not established that Nestl\u00e9\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   be harmed if it releases the information the Project seeks. But no such showing is required.

The Project argues that the word \"wells\" must be construed strictly, and that it seeks \"information related to 'bore holes' and not 'wells.' \" Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 24. The Government contends that the Project \"incorrectly assumes that boreholes and wells are two separate entities.\" Defs.' Reply at 16. The Government is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Though perhaps a bit dry, some definitions are in order. A \"well\" is a \"hole or shaft sunk into the earth to obtain a fluid, such as water, oil, or natural gas.\"\n   <em>\n    Well\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). A \"borehole\" is \"a hole bored or drilled in the earth, such as an exploratory well\" or a \"small-diameter well drilled especially to obtain water.\"\n   <em>\n    Borehole\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 1996). \"Borehole\" has also been defined as a \"deep, narrow hole made in the ground, especially to locate water or oil.\"\n   <em>\n    Borehole\n   </em>\n   , Oxford English Dictionary Online, https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/borehole. These definitions make it clear that a borehole is a type of well. Both terms refer to a hole created in the earth to obtain a fluid. And because Exemption 9 unambiguously covers \"wells,\" the Government appropriately withheld the borehole maps and related information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Project's arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. First, it cites U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (\"FDA\") regulations defining \"spring water.\" These regulations note that \"[s]pring water shall be collected only at the spring or through a bore hole tapping the underground formation feeding the spring. There shall be a natural force causing the water to flow to the surface through a natural orifice.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20165.110\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 165.110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(vi). Contrasting \"spring water\" with \"artesian water,\" the FDA explained that the former comes from \"an underground source where water flows naturally to the earth's surface,\" while the latter \"comes from a well tapping a confined aquifer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Fed.%20Reg.%2057%2C076\">\n    60 Fed. Reg. 57,076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57,092 (Nov. 15, 1995). The Project suggests that because the regulations \"refer to wells and bore holes as two separate things,\" and because Nestl\u00e9 \"refer[s] to [its] water sources as bore holes and never as wells,\" boreholes and wells must be distinct. Pl.'s Reply at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   But the FDA's regulations do not apply to the Freedom of Information Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And even if they did, they do not establish that a borehole is not a well for the purposes of Exemption 9. Instead, they differentiate between two types of water based on how each is collected. And they fit with the definitions cited above-a borehole is a \"drilled\" or \"made\" well, rather than a naturally occurring well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Second, the Project cites\n   <em>\n    AquAlliance v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276645\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/101/\">\n    856 F.3d 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2017) in support of its position. But\n   <em>\n    AquAlliance\n   </em>\n   did not hold that Exemption 9 should be construed so narrowly as to exclude boreholes. There, the plaintiff argued that the exemption applies only to oil and gas wells and not water wells. The D.C. Circuit rejected this argument, finding that the text of the exemption says \"geological and geophysical information 'concerning wells,' without any such adjectival limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    AquAlliance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276645\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/101/\">\n    856 F.3d at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
