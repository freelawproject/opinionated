Hastrich (\"Plaintiff\") brings this action pursuant to Title II of the Social Security Act (the \"Act\"), seeking review of the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security (the \"Commissioner,\" or \"Defendant\") denying his application for disability insurance benefits (\"DIB\"). (Dkt. 1). This Court has jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Presently before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Dkt. 10; Dkt. 15), and Plaintiff's reply (Dkt. 16). For the reasons discussed below, the Commissioner's motion (Dkt. 15) is granted and Plaintiff's motion (Dkt. 10) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff protectively filed his application for DIB on June 23, 2014.

Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff last met the insured status requirements of the Act on December 31, 2018. (Dkt. 8 at 17). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since June 6, 2013, the alleged onset date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of: \"degenerative disc disease of the lumbar and cervical spine (status-post multiple surgeries); L5 radiculopathy : history of nondisplaced fracture of the right knee and mild right knee chondromalacia patella.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairment of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome was non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). With respect to Plaintiff's representation that he suffered from allergies and a left ring finger injury, the ALJ concluded that these were not medically determinable impairments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 1.02 and 1.04 in reaching her conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform sedentary work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), with the additional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   can occasionally kneel, stoop, crouch, climb ramps or stairs (but never climb ladders, ropes or scaffolds), occasionally reach overhead or repetitively bend or twist at the waist. He requires a sit/stand option in that he can sit for 45 minutes but then must be afforded the opportunity to stand or walk for 15 minutes while remaining on task.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18). At step four, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was unable to perform any past relevant work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of surveillance system monitor, charge account clerk, and call out operator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     The Commissioner's Determination is Supported by Substantial Evidence and Free from Legal Error\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to reverse the decision of the Commissioner, arguing: (1) the ALJ improperly weighed the opinion of Plaintiff's treating neurosurgeon, Franco Vigna, M.D.; (2) the ALJ erred at step two of the sequential analysis by finding that Plaintiff's bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome was non-severe, and did not include any manipulative limitations in the RFC; (3) the ALJ improperly relied on evidence of Plaintiff's daily activities as evidence of his ability to perform substantial gainful activity; and (4) the ALJ failed to consider Plaintiff's learning disability. (Dkt. 10-1 at 13). The Court has considered each of these arguments and, for the reasons discussed below, finds them to be without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Assessment of Dr. Vigna's Opinion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff's first argument is that the ALJ improperly assigned minimal weight to the medical source statement of Dr. Vigna, Plaintiff's treating neurosurgeon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Because Plaintiff's claim was filed before March 27, 2017, the ALJ was\n   required to apply the treating physician rule, under which a treating physician's opinion is entitled to \"controlling weight\" when it is \"well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the] case record[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 867). Plaintiff required a job that permits shifting positions at will, and needed to walk for ten minutes, every thirty minutes.

The ALJ recognized that although Dr. Vigna was a treating physician:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   his findings overestimate [Plaintiff's] sitting limitations, need for breaks, anticipated time off-task/absences and manipulative limitations; these findings are inconsistent with the minimal evidence of difficulty with prolonged standing (if afforded positional changes as set forth in the residual functional capacity adopted above), intact manipulative functioning (as demonstrated upon physical examinations) and his relatively broad range of daily activities.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 900-71).

Rather, Dr. Vigna's objective examinations of Plaintiff (including examinations of Plaintiff's musculoskeletal system) were mostly normal. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 902, 905, 909, 945, 950, 954-55, 959, 968). Imaging studies taken after Plaintiff's surgeries showed well-maintained disc heights and normal alignment, with good positioning of hardware. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 902, 905, 948).

The lack of explanation is particularly problematic in this case, where Dr. Vigna's treatment notes contain little objective evidence supporting severe functional limitations. Accordingly, the ALJ's conclusion that the evidence in support of Dr. Vigna's severe limitations was lacking, as well as that such severe limitations were inconsistent with the record as a whole, is supported by substantial evidence. It was therefore proper for the\n   ALJ to assign little weight to Dr. Vigna's opinion.\n   <em>\n    Halloran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263224\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/28/#p32\">\n    362 F.3d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the opinion of the treating physician is not afforded controlling weight where ... the treating physician issued opinions that are not consistent with other substantial evidence in the record....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court notes that, in addressing Dr. Vigna's opinion, the ALJ also considered other factors required by the treating physician rule. For example, the ALJ considered Dr. Vigna's treatment relationship with Plaintiff, as well as his specialty. The ALJ recognized that Dr. Vigna was a treating physician, performed surgeries on Plaintiff's spine, and discussed Dr. Vigna's treatment of Plaintiff dating back to 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8 at 22-24). Further, prior to discussing opinion evidence from Dr. Vigna, the ALJ discussed the August 2014 opinion offered by the consultative examiner, Hongbiao Liu, M.D., who found that Plaintiff had \"mild to moderate limitation for prolonged walking, bending, and kneeling.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 846). Accordingly, the ALJ's consideration of Dr. Vigna's medical source statement was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff contends that, contrary to the ALJ's findings, there is objective evidence in the record supporting Dr. Vigna's opinion. (Dkt. 10-1 at 13-14). Specifically, Plaintiff points to various imaging studies in the record, including EMGs, MRIs, and a myelogram, which were performed between 2005 and 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). The Court has reviewed the reports associated with those imaging studies and agrees that they showed at least some evidence of abnormality. However, the record also shows that Plaintiff underwent successful procedures to address these issues. Plaintiff himself reported that many of these procedures were successful in relieving his pain. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 8 at 743 (November 2013 treating note from Dr. Vigna stating, \"I follow with [Plaintiff] secondary to a work-related injury to his lumbar spine. He states that he was so happy with the results of the low back surgery that he wanted to come and see me for his cervical spine.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 892 (in August 2014, following Plaintiff's cervical spine surgery, Dr. Vigna \"had the pleasure of seeing [Plaintiff] back in the office today. He states that he has 'none of the pain that I had before surgery.' \");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 908-09 (in May 2015, following Plaintiff's lumbar spine surgery, Plaintiff noticed improvement in the spasms he was having in his back prior to surgery, but still experienced some ongoing low back pain; objective physical examination of Plaintiff's musculoskeletal system was normal, with \"[f]ull range of motion in his bilateral lower extremities.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 931-32 (in February 2016, following implantation of a spinal stimulator, Plaintiff reported that the stimulator \"took away 'almost all' of his left foot pain\"; Plaintiff continued to report lower back pain, but a physical examination was normal, other than that Plaintiff walked with a \"slightly left antalgic gait.\") ). Where Plaintiff's pain was not fully addressed by these procedures, as noted above, there is a lack of objective evidence in the record - such as abnormal objective physical examinations, or further imaging studies showing Plaintiff's deteriorating condition - to support the severe functional limitations assessed by Dr. Vigna.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff also contends that there is evidence in the record supporting his sitting and standing limitations. (Dkt. 10-1 at 15). Plaintiff cites to several instances in the record between May 2013 and June 2015 where the record notes his difficulty standing and sitting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16). The evidence cited by Plaintiff, however, is entirely predicated on his own subjective complaints. As explained by the ALJ, Dr. Vigna's opinion is not supported by objective evidence supporting such severe standing and sitting restrictions, nor does it provide\n   an explanation as to why Dr. Vigna assessed severe limitations in the absence of objective evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marozzi v.

The ALJ accounted for these limitations by limiting Plaintiff to sedentary work and affording Plaintiff a sit/stand option (allowing Plaintiff to sit for forty-five minutes and then stand/walk for fifteen minutes) to account for any sitting/standing limitations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8 at 18). The ALJ's assessment that the record does not support the harsh limitations assessed by Dr. Vigna is proper and well-supported by the record.

The ALJ explained that \"the record reveals minimal residual symptoms or work-related limitations stemming from this condition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In 2010, Plaintiff sought treatment from Kevin W.

Indeed, the Commissioner's regulations expressly identify \"daily activities\" as a factor the ALJ should consider in evaluating the intensity and persistence of a claimant's symptoms.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.929\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(i). Accordingly, the ALJ's consideration of Plaintiff's activities of daily living was proper in this instance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rusin v. Berryhill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=726%20F.%20App%27x%20837\">\n    726 F. App'x 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 840 (2d Cir. 2018) (severe limitations claimed by the plaintiff were inconsistent with the plaintiff's report that he \"cooked simple meals daily, left the house daily, can drive, and shopped for groceries every two weeks\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the ALJ misconstrued his testimony regarding his activities of daily living because the ALJ \"omitted critical qualifying statements from Plaintiff's Function Report and testimony.\" (Dkt. 10-1 at 18). Specifically, Plaintiff contends that although he was able to complete tasks such as mowing the lawn, preparing meals, and other household chores, he required breaks when mowing the lawn and help from others to complete chores, and the ALJ failed to consider these facts when making her findings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, a review of the written determination reveals that the ALJ did consider Plaintiff's need to take breaks when performing certain tasks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8 at 19 (discussing Plaintiff's testimony that he \"could only sit for 15 minutes before needing to change positions\" and could perform \"minimal daily activities,\" but \"required breaks with chores\" and \"took longer to mow the lawn[.]\") ). As to Plaintiff's claim that the ALJ misconstrued evidence relating to Plaintiff's ability to prepare meals, the Court has reviewed the written determination and finds that the ALJ did not misconstrue this particular detail. Rather, the ALJ accurately cited to the report of Dr. Liu, where Plaintiff reported that, as a part of his activities of daily living, \"[h]e could do cooking four times a week and cleaning house twice a week.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20, 844).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \"[T]he ALJ is not required to discuss every piece of evidence before her.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

It is clear from the written determination that the ALJ considered evidence that weighed against Plaintiff and evidence weighing in his favor, including that Plaintiff found it difficult to complete certain tasks or needed breaks while performing chores. In other words, \"[b]ecause this Court is able to glean the ALJ's rationale and the basis for her findings from the decision, the ALJ did not commit reversible error in failing to explicitly discuss the evidence Plaintiff points to in his brief.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202312914\">\n    2017 WL 2312914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2080847\">\n    2017 U.S. Dist.

Accordingly, neither reversal, nor remand, is required on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Consideration of Plaintiff's Learning Disability\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiff's final argument is that the ALJ erred by failing to consider and/or develop the record regarding his reading ability. (Dkt. 10-1 at 20). Although Plaintiff did not identify a learning disability on his disability application, Plaintiff's attorney questioned Plaintiff about his difficulty reading and writing at the administrative hearing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8 at 57-58). Plaintiff testified to the following: he was in special education classes starting in fourth grade\n   for reading, writing, and math; he still had difficulty with reading and math; and his wife helped him if he was unable to read something on his own. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58). The record further reveals that in October 2015, Plaintiff underwent testing by Buffalo Behavioral Psychology, P.C., in preparation for the installation of a spinal cord stimulator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 970-71). This testing showed that Plaintiff read at a fourth-grade level and had difficulty with reading and writing, which would interfere with his ability to maintain non-labor-based employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 971). Plaintiff does not specifically explain how the record should have been further developed; likewise, at the administrative hearing, Plaintiff's counsel represented that the record was complete and did not request any further development as to Plaintiff's alleged learning disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   To the extent the ALJ should have included limitations relating to Plaintiff's learning disorder in the RFC, or further developed the record on this issue, any such error is harmless. At the administrative hearing, Plaintiff's counsel specifically asked the vocational expert what jobs would be available if the RFC formulated by the ALJ also incorporated limitations for reading, writing, and math at a fourth-grade reading level. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75). In response, the vocational expert testified that, even with those additional limitations, Plaintiff would be able to perform the jobs of surveillance system monitor and call out operator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In other words, even viewing the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff as to any alleged learning disability, Plaintiff would not qualify as disabled under the Act. Neither reversal, nor remand, is required on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Commissioner's motion for judgment on the pleadings (Dkt. 15) is granted and Plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings (Dkt. 10) is denied. The Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment and close this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    When referencing the page number(s) of docket citations in this Decision and Order, the Court will cite to the CM/ECF-generated page numbers that appear in the upper righthand corner of each document.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Plaintiff does not specifically ask the Court to remand the case to the ALJ for further proceedings; rather, he seeks reversal of the Commissioner's decision, and remand for calculation and payment of benefits. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 10-1 at 1, 13, 22). However, in reviewing the decision of the Commissioner, the Court has also considered whether remand for further proceedings would be appropriate in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Dr. Lanighan also found that Plaintiff had a zero percent temporary impairment. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 889).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    While Dr. Vigna found that Plaintiff had no \"significant limitations with reaching, handling or fingering,\" he also assessed that Plaintiff could use the bilateral upper extremities to grasp, turn, and twist objects, or use them for fine manipulations, only fifty percent of the time. (Dkt. 8 at 869). These two findings appear to be at odds with each other. In any event, as noted above, the severe limitations assessed by Dr. Vigna are not supported by the record, and conflict with his own treatment notes, which contain very little objective evidence supporting severe limitations for reaching, handling, or fingering.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
