Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The relevant facts are undisputed and can be stated briefly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Joanne Williams is the owner of a beach house at 109 Via de Luna, Pensacola Beach. The property fronts the Santa Rosa Sound-which is a protected body of saltwater running parallel to the Gulf of Mexico between Pensacola Bay and Ft. Walton Beach, a distance of about 35 miles-and it has a private wooden pier that extends out from the shore 188 feet. The pier is about 2\u00bd feet above the water. There are steps near the foot of the pier that lead directly into the water from the shore, and there is a \"swimming ladder\" near the end of the pier, where the water is around 3\u00bd feet deep. The pier doesn't have any guardrails or lights. Santa Rosa Sound is about 2 miles wide at the site of the property, and it has a sand bottom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ms. Williams lived in Tallahassee at the time relevant to this case, and the defendant, Paradise Beach Homes, marketed and managed the property for her as a short term vacation rental pursuant to a\n   property management agreement. Under the terms of that agreement, the defendant would,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , set and collect the rent; conduct semi-annual inspections to assess and rate the \"furnishings, equipment, decor and appeal;\" and, when necessary, hire contractors to perform \"routine\" repairs that cost no more than $ 200 (unless there was an emergency or Ms. Williams gave prior approval). The defendant listed the beach house for rent on its website, and under a photo of the pier there was a caption that read: \"Private pier is great for boats, fishing and swimming.\" This photo will be attached as Appendix A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In May 2016, the plaintiff, Terasa Lynn Knoll, and some friends were staying at the beach house for a week.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deposition of Terasa Lynn Knoll, dated November 14, 2017 (doc. 15-3) (Pl. Dep.), at 39-43, 54-55.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff, who was twenty seven years old at the time and living in San Francisco, had never been to the State of Florida.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10, 16-18. Although she had never visited Pensacola Beach before, she \"love[d] water\" and had significant swimming and diving experience.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-23. Specifically, she was on her high school swim team for four years-which included platform diving-and she had dived \"hundreds of times\" into natural bodies of water all around the world, including the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, \"beaches all through Ecuador,\" and off the coasts and/or in the lakes of North Carolina, South Carolina, New York, Mexico, and the Galapagos Islands.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 67 (agreeing that \"[I am] an experienced swimmer and diver\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiff flew into Pensacola from San Francisco at approximately midnight on May 26, 2016, after about twelve hours of traveling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Dep. at 45-48. She took a car service to the house, and she got there about 12:45 a.m.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-52. After visiting with her friends for a little while (and after she \"swigged\" a drink of vodka), she and one of her friends, Maria Fierro, got \"excited\" and decided to go swimming.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-52, 54-57, 60. They left the house; took off their clothes; went \"running or walking really fast\" down to the end of the pier; and entered the water at the same time, side-by-side.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 60, 62-65, 70-71. Fierro jumped in feet first (and was not injured), but the plaintiff chose to dive in head first (and hit her head on the bottom and suffered a severe spinal injury).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 64, 66-69, 78. Tragically, she is now a quadriplegic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiff testified that it was \"completely dark\" the night of the incident and that she could not see how deep the water was; in fact, it appears that she couldn't even see the water much at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Dep. at 62-68 (it was \"like black glass almost\"). Thus, when she dived off the pier, she was \"just basically diving into blackness.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 65. The plaintiff testified that she thought the water was \"the ocean\" (and not Santa Rosa Sound), so she just presumed that it was going to be \"deep water.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-62.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Several years prior to the incident, the homeowner-not the defendant-had painted the words NO DIVING in stencil on the wooden boards at the end of the pier. The plaintiff has described this warning as \"weather-worn\" [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. at 5], but she does not dispute that it was still visible.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   However, the plaintiff testified at deposition that she did not see the warning because she did not look down before she dived off the pier and that, even if she had looked down, she would not have been able to see the words \"because it was so dark\" that particular night.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Dep. at 88-90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiff reached a significant financial settlement with the homeowner early on, after which she filed this suit against the defendant, alleging negligence, premises liability, and gross negligence. The gravamen of these claims appears to be that the defendant (as the property manager) should have \"properly\" warned her that the pier was not safe for diving.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 6, 16, 19, 24, 33-34, 37.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant answered the complaint; filed a third party complaint against the homeowner; and now moves for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under the law of Florida (which applies to this diversity action), a plaintiff alleging negligence must prove the following four elements: (1) the defendant owed her a duty; (2) the defendant breached that duty; (3) the breach caused her to suffer an injury; and (4) she sustained damages.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clay Elec. Co-op. Inc. v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9248938\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/873/1182/#p1185\">\n    873 So.2d 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1185 (Fla. 2004). The only element challenged on summary judgment is whether the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty-specifically, \"whether Paradise owed Ms. Knoll the duty to warn her against diving from the pier.\" Def Mot. at 5. As noted just a moment ago, however, there was a painted warning on the pier that specifically said \"NO DIVING,\" but the plaintiff did not look down before she dived into the water and, in any event, it was too dark for her to have read the words even if she had looked down. Thus, the plaintiff appears to be arguing that there should have been a\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   warning (presumably an elevated and lighted sign), the absence of which renders the defendant liable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiff has not cited any case law holding that\n   <em>\n    property managers\n   </em>\n   have a duty to warn in a situation like the one presented here. All the cases that plaintiff has relied upon (which will be discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , and can be distinguished on their facts) involved\n   <em>\n    property owners.\n   </em>\n   Although the property management agreement at issue provided that the defendant would,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , set and collect the rent, conduct semi-annual inspections to evaluate the \"decor,\" and hire contractors to perform repairs up to $ 200, it does not in any way suggest that defendant assumed an obligation to take it upon itself to install-or have installed-an elevated and illuminated NO DIVING sign on a pier that it neither owned nor built. In fact, although it presents a closer issue, it appears that Florida law would not have even required the property owner to provide such a warning on the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Florida law is well established that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   a property owner generally cannot be held liable for dangerous conditions which exist in natural or artificial bodies of water unless they are so constructed as to constitute a trap or unless there is some unusual danger not generally existent in similar bodies of water.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Tremblay v.

Consequently, the critical issue in this litigation is whether the pier and shallow water below presented a \"trap\" or an \"unusual danger\" for which a warning should have been given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As to this issue,\n   <em>\n    Switzer v.

The plaintiff in that case (a minor) dived off the defendant's pier and into a shallow lake, where she struck the bottom and was seriously injured. Although the plaintiff was a trespasser, the case is otherwise similar to the facts of this case; specifically, the pier extended about 100 feet into the lake and stood about 5 feet above the water (here, about 188 feet and 2\u00bd feet, respectively); the depth of the water at the end of the pier was between 3-5 feet deep (here, about 3\u00bd feet deep); and there was a ladder on the pier (same as here). The plaintiff brought suit alleging that defendant was negligent in maintaining\n   the pier \"without signs warning against diving, or signs indicating the depth of the water ....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9871551\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/177/539/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9871551\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/177/539/\">\n    at 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court entered judgment in favor of defendant, and the First DCA affirmed.

Opp. at 10-13. But this lawsuit is nothing like\n   <em>\n    Lienhart.\n   </em>\n   As noted, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Lienhart\n   </em>\n   owned the resort and installed the lounge chairs under tiki huts on the beach close to the ocean. One of its employees directed plaintiff to sit in one of those chairs where she fell asleep, but he did not tell her that a truck-which one would not usually or reasonably expect to be in such an area-would be driving right by her and might strike her while she slept. The underlying point of law from\n   <em>\n    Lienhart\n   </em>\n   (as the plaintiff herself notes,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   ) is that property owners owe \"clear-cut duties\" to invitees in Florida, including \"the duty to give the invitee warning of\n   <em>\n    concealed perils\n   </em>\n   which are or should be known to the landowner and which are unknown\n   <em>\n    and undiscoverable by the invitee through the exercise of due care.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8921003\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/426/1337/\">\n    426 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1339-40 (citing\n   <em>\n    City of Milton v.

The concealed peril at issue in\n   <em>\n    Lienhart\n   </em>\n   could not have been discovered by plaintiff through the exercise of due care, nor could it have been reasonably anticipated by her. In our case, by contrast, to the extent the shallow water beneath the pier could be considered a concealed peril (and\n   <em>\n    Switzer\n   </em>\n   and its progeny indicate it was not), the danger was discoverable through exercise of due care. The plaintiff possessed the necessary intelligence, experience, and knowledge to see and appreciate the risk of diving head first into unfamiliar water on a \"completely dark\" night, and she could have ascertained the water depth before she undertook the extremely dangerous activity of \"basically diving into blackness.\" She could have entered the water directly from the shore, climbed down the shore steps, used the swim ladder, or jumped in feet first like her friend did. By not doing so, she failed to \"exercise [the] due care\" that is required under\n   <em>\n    Lienhart\n   </em>\n   and Florida law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In sum, in each of the cases that the plaintiff has cited and relied on, the defendants (all of whom were property owners) either affirmatively did something that led to the injury at issue or they failed to act based on prior knowledge. They were a public bathhouse that provided patrons with a diving board (\n   <em>\n    Turlington\n   </em>\n   ); they were a hotel that provided a pier over shallow water and knew that guests were diving off the pier and did nothing to stop it-despite knowing that another person had previously broken their neck diving from the same pier (\n   <em>\n    First Arlington\n   </em>\n   ); they were a bathing beach (part of an amusement park) and not only knew that patrons were diving head first off the pier and into shallow water but they actually watched the fifteen-year-old plaintiff prepare her dive and made no attempt to stop her (\n   <em>\n    Brightwell\n   </em>\n   ); and they were a beachfront resort that directed plaintiff to sit in a specific beach chair near the ocean without warning her that trucks would be driving by (\n   <em>\n    Lienhart\n   </em>\n   ). None of these cases are comparable to the facts here, where there was no history of anyone ever diving head first off the pier, and the defendant (an off-site property manager) neither owned nor built the pier and was contractually limited in what it was required and allowed to do\n   with respect to the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As there is no genuine disputed issue of material fact on this record, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

It is often difficult to resist the influence which a palpable hardship is calculated to exert; but a rigid adherence to fundamental principles at all times and a stern insensibility to the results which an unvarying enforcement of those principles may occasionally entail, are the surest, if not the only, means by which stability and certainty in the administration of the law may be secured.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Saga Bay Prop.

The plaintiff in\n    <em>\n     Bucki\n    </em>\n    was a twenty-four-year-old man, and he was a guest at a lake house for the weekend. He arrived at the house around midnight, and shortly after arriving he decided to go swimming in the lake. He \"jogged down\" a floating dock behind the house and dived head first into the lake, even though it was \"pretty dark\" outside and he was unable to determine its depth.

However, even if the plaintiff reasonably assumed that the pier was good for swimming (either from how the property was advertised or after seeing the swimming ladder for the brief time they were on the pier), swimming and diving are not the same thing. The plaintiff tries to equate the two, but they are clearly different (albeit related) activities. To illustrate, above-ground swimming pools are obviously designed for swimming, but they are not meant for diving.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sheehan v.

Dep. at 19-23. Yet she dived in head first this time, even though her unfamiliarity with the water and the near total lack of visibility made it particularly risky. That begs the question: why would she do that? The plaintiff testified that she thought she was diving into the \"ocean,\" which she just assumed was \"deep water.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 60-62.

The plaintiff obviously knew that as she had experience diving in both the Pacific and Atlantic, and she had never dived into\n    <em>\n     those\n    </em>\n    ocean waters until she could ascertain the depth of where she was diving. While one can only speculate as to why she chose to do something this time that she had never done before and that she had to know was dangerous, it is reasonable to assume (although it is not necessary to my decision) that the late hour, the long day of coast-to-coast travel, and/or her \"swigging\" vodka shortly before might have played a role in her decision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The parties have spent a considerable amount of time in their briefs arguing about whether the defendant has violated Section 64E-9.013, Florida Administrative Code, but I can dispose of that issue quickly.
