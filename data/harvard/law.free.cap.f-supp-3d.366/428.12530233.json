(Dkt. 1).

Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff last met the insured status requirements of the Act on September 30, 2013. (Dkt. 8 at 18). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since February 27, 2013, the alleged onset date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of hypertension, prostatism/hematuria, and frequent urination were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). With respect to Plaintiff's representations that he suffered from eczema, dermatitis, and mild sleep apnea, the ALJ concluded that these were not medically determinable impairments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 12.04 and 12.06 in reaching her conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a full range of work at all exertional levels, with the additional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   can perform simple, routine and repetitive tasks in a work environment free of fast paced production requirements, involving only simple, work-related decisions and few, if any, workplace changes. Can tolerate a low level of work pressure defined as work not requiring multitasking, detailed job tasks, significant independent judgment, a production rate pace, sharing of job tasks or contact with the public. Can tolerate occasional interaction with supervisors and coworkers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22). At step four, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was unable to perform any past relevant work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of laundry worker II and kitchen helper. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     The Commissioner's Determination is Supported by Substantial Evidence and Free from Legal Error\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to remand this matter to the Commissioner, arguing: (1) the ALJ erred in weighing the medical opinion evidence from Plaintiff's treating sources; (2) the RFC is not supported by substantial evidence; and (3) the ALJ erred by improperly assessing Plaintiff's credibility. (Dkt. 12-1 at 6).

Because Plaintiff's claim was filed before March 27, 2017, the ALJ was required to apply the treating physician rule, under which a treating physician's opinion is entitled to \"controlling weight\" when it is\n   \"well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the] case record[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

However, the ALJ found that Dr. Spurling's opinions that Plaintiff was capable of only part-time work and would be absent more than four days per month were of limited evidentiary value because they lacked objective support and were supported only by Plaintiff's subjective complaints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court has reviewed Dr. Spurling's opinions and his treatment notes and finds that the ALJ's assessment of the opinions was proper. The ALJ considered the factors required by the treating physician rule, including Dr. Spurling's area of specialization, his treatment relationship with Plaintiff, and the consistency of his opinions with other information in the record. The ALJ properly rejected Dr. Spurling's opinions relating to Plaintiff's ability to perform full-time work and absences as unsupported by the record. Neither of the opinions offered by Dr. Spurling include any explanation as to why he believed that Plaintiff could work less than fulltime or would be absent more than four days per month.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The lack of explanation is problematic, as Dr. Spurling's opinions regarding Plaintiff's ability to work fulltime and absences are belied by Dr. Spurling's own assessment that Plaintiff had only mild or moderate limitations for mental functioning. Further, there no is no objective evidence in Dr. Spurling's treatment notes supporting the conclusion that Plaintiff would not be able to sustain fulltime employment due to his functional limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, other than documenting Plaintiff's subjective complaints and some anxiousness, Dr. Spurling's treatment notes reveal mostly normal mental status\n   examinations, and a good response to medications. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 8 at 415-16, 421-23, 425, 427-28, 430-31, 433-34, 436-37, 463-64, 479-81, 493-94). Further, in July 2015, Dr. Spurling noted that while Plaintiff faced several \"stressors,\" he was doing \"fairly well from a psychiatric perspective,\" had a good response to medications, his bipolar disorder was \"fairly stabilized,\" and his \"mild to moderate\" depression symptoms were \"driven by his multiple psychosocial and financial stressors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 481). Dr. Spurling also noted that Plaintiff's anxiety symptoms were well-controlled by his medication regimen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the ALJ failed to consider Dr. Spurling's opinion that Plaintiff would be \"unable to function\" or \"off task\" for up to twenty-five percent of the workday. (Dkt. 12-1 at 20-21). Plaintiff's argument is based on a mischaracterization of the record. Nowhere in either of Dr. Spurling's opinions does he opine that Plaintiff is unable to function, or would be off task, twenty-five percent of the workday. Rather, based on Dr. Spurling's assessment that Plaintiff has moderate limitations (meaning unable to function eleven to twenty-five percent of the time) in some areas of mental functioning, Plaintiff's counsel extrapolates that Plaintiff is \"unable to function\" or will be \"off task\" twenty-five percent of the workday. (Dkt. 12-1 at 20-21; Dkt. 19 at 2). However, Plaintiff's counsel is not a medical doctor and may not simply presume that, because Dr. Spurling found that Plaintiff had moderate limitations in some areas of mental functioning, that Plaintiff would be off task or completely unable to function in all areas for twenty-five percent of the workday. Remand is not required on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff began treating with Dr. Roemer in July 2016. (Dkt. 8 at 621, 638). On April 10, 2017, Dr. Roemer completed the same evaluation completed by Dr. Spurling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 619-22). Plaintiff was mildly limited in his ability to communicate clearly and effectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 620). Dr. Roemer opined that Plaintiff was moderately limited in the following categories: ability to comprehend and carry out simple instructions; ability to remember work procedures; ability to appropriately work in coordination with or proximity to co-workers; ability to interact appropriately with the general public; ability to maintain regular attendance and be punctual within customary limitations; ability to concentrate and attend to simple work tasks; and ability to perform at a consistent pace. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 619-20). Plaintiff had marked limitations in his ability to make simple, work-related decisions and in his ability to tolerate customary work pressures in a work setting, including ordinary job goals, production requirements, and demands. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 620-21). Dr. Roemer further opined that Plaintiff was likely to deteriorate if placed under stress and would be absent more than four days per month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 621-22). Dr. Roemer found that Plaintiff could work four hours per day, but also noted that he was \"not sure [Plaintiff] can work at all!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 622).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The ALJ gave \"partial weight\" to Dr. Roemer's opinion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25). The ALJ explained that although Dr. Roemer began treating Plaintiff in July 2016, there were no objective findings supporting his opinion that Plaintiff would be unable to work on a regular and continuing basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As summarized by the ALJ in the written determination, Dr. Roemer's treatment notes lack support for his opinion that Plaintiff is unable to sustain fulltime employment and would be absent more than four days per month. While Dr. Roemer's treatment notes document Plaintiff's subjective complaints, mental status examinations were mostly normal. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 644-45, 648-49, 651-52, 675-76, 679-80, 682-83,\n   686-87, 689-90, 694). Plaintiff also experienced improvements in his depression, mood, and temper. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 644, 648, 651, 675, 679, 685-86, 689, 693). Further, the ALJ noted that Dr. Roemer assessed Plaintiff with only moderate limitations in most areas of mental functioning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25). The ALJ also explained that Dr. Roemer's opinion that Plaintiff had marked limitations in his ability to make simple, work-related decisions, was belied by Plaintiff's activities of daily living and in his ability to live independently. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court has reviewed Dr. Roemer's opinion and treatment notes and agrees with the ALJ's assessment of the opinion. Dr. Roemer's opinion that Plaintiff is unable to sustain full-time employment is contradicted by his own assessment that Plaintiff had only moderate limitations in most areas of mental functioning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Illenberg v.

Here, it is clear from the record and the written determination that portions of the treating source opinion evidence conflicted with each physician's own treatment notes and assessment of Plaintiff's categories of mental functioning, which were limited to mostly mild or moderate\n   limitations.

It is clear from the record that the ALJ largely adopted Dr. Spurling's opinions relating to Plaintiff's functional limitations. In other words, the RFC, which provides that Plaintiff can perform simple, routine and repetitive tasks, and can make simple, work-related decisions, is informed by Dr. Spurling's opinion that Plaintiff has mild limitations (meaning unable to function one to ten percent of the time) in his ability to comprehend and carry out simple instructions, remember work procedures, concentrate and attend to simple work tasks, and make simple, work-related decisions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8 at 451-52, 586-87). Further, the RFC accounts for Dr. Spurling's and Dr. Roemer's opinions that Plaintiff would deteriorate under stress by limiting him to a work environment free of fast-paced production requirements, involving only simple, work-related decisions and few workplace changes, and a low level of work pressure (work not requiring multitasking, detailed job tasks, significant independent judgment, production rate pace). Finally, the RFC provides for no contact with the public and only occasional interaction with supervisors and coworkers, which is consistent with Dr. Spurling's and Dr. Roemer's opinions that Plaintiff had moderate limitations (meaning unable to function eleven to twenty-five percent of the time) in his ability to communicate clearly and effectively, appropriately work in coordination with or proximity to co-workers, and interact appropriately with the general public. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 452, 487, 620).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff argues that, in assessing the RFC, it was improper for the ALJ to reject Dr. Spurling's and Dr. Roemer's\n   opinions regarding Plaintiff's ability to sustain fulltime employment and absences because there was no other opinion evidence in the record contradicting those opinions. (Dkt. 12-1 at 25). However, an ALJ is not required to secure an additional medical opinion specifically contradicting Dr. Spurling's and Dr. Roemer's opinions regarding Plaintiff's ability to sustain fulltime employment. Rather, as noted above, the ALJ is required to evaluate the opinion of a treating physician in accordance with the treating physician rule and give good reasons if she gives less than controlling weight to the opinion.\n   <em>\n    Halloran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263224\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/28/#p32\">\n    362 F.3d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
