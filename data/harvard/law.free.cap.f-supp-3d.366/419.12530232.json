Initially, the ALJ determined that C.M.K. was born on July 5, 2005, and therefore was a school-age child on April 23, 2014, the date the application was filed and on the date of the written determination. (Dkt. 5 at 21). At step one, the ALJ determined that C.M.K. had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since April 23, 2014, the application date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that C.M.K. suffered from the severe impairment of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that C.M.K. did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listing 112.11, for ADHD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Similarly, the ALJ found that C.M.K. did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that functionally equaled the severity of the Listings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In making this determination, the ALJ considered C.M.K.'s functioning in each of the above-mentioned six domains and concluded that C.M.K. had no limitation in moving about and manipulating objects, caring for himself, and health and physical well-being, and less than a marked limitation in acquiring and using information, attending and completing tasks, and interacting and relating with others. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-35). Accordingly, the ALJ found that C.M.K. was not disabled as defined in the Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Remand of this Matter for Further Proceedings is Necessary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to reverse or, in the alternative, remand this matter to the Commissioner, arguing that (1) the ALJ failed to obtain missing records, and made his determination based on an incomplete record, and (2) the ALJ misstated evidence in the record, and substituted his own judgment for that of the consultative examiner and CM.K.'s nurse practitioner, Danielle Ross (\"NP Ross\"). (Dkt. 6-1 at 13-28). For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the ALJ failed to develop the record, and this error necessitates remand\n   for further administrative proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Failure to Develop the Record\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Because a hearing on disability benefits is a non-adversarial proceeding, the ALJ generally has an affirmative obligation to develop the administrative record.\"\n   <em>\n    Perez v.

(Dkt. 5 at 21). The written determination also discusses C.M.K.'s treatment for ADHD, which included counseling at the Chautauqua Center from 2015 through 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25). A review of the treatment notes from Chautauqua Center reveal that prior to receiving treatment there, C.M.K. went to counseling at \"CCMH,\" or Chautauqua County Mental Hygiene. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 278, 280). The ALJ acknowledged in the written determination that C.M.K. had seen \"providers at [CCMH] for counseling and Dr. Galecki for psychotropic medication management.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The issue of C.M.K.'s treatment at CCMH was also raised at the administrative hearing. Plaintiff's attorney, Kelly E. Laga, informed the ALJ that C.M.K. was currently in counseling at the Chautauqua Center and had been transferred to that facility from CCMH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42). While Ms. Laga was able to obtain C.M.K.'s counseling notes from the Chautauqua Center, those records did not contain C.M.K.'s prior counseling notes from CCMH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Ms. Laga requested additional time to locate C.M.K.'s counseling notes from CCMH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42, 57). At the end of the hearing, the ALJ stated that he would \"wait until ... [he received] those documents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On December 15, 2016, Ms. Laga submitted a letter to the ALJ. (Dkt. 6-3 at 1). This letter is attached to Plaintiff's motion papers. The letter informed the ALJ that Ms. Laga unsuccessfully attempted to collect the missing records on September 27, 2016 and October 19, 2016, and followed up on her requests on October\n   28, 2016, November 15, 2016, and November 29, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Chautauqua Center did not return Ms. Laga's voicemails and she had not received the records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Ms. Laga requested that the ALJ issue a subpoena to secure the records, and attached information pertaining to the providers and dates of records sought by the subpoena, which included medical records dating back to January 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-3). Although Ms. Laga's December 15, 2016 letter is not a part of the administrative transcript, the letter is accompanied by a sworn affidavit stating that the letter was submitted to both the ALJ and Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 6-2). There is no evidence that the ALJ either considered or responded to Ms. Laga's request for a subpoena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant does not contest the validity of the December 15, 2016 letter, the information contained within it, or the fact that Ms. Laga submitted this request to the ALJ. Rather, Defendant argues that an ALJ is not required to subpoena records if it is not necessary. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 9-1 at 12). Defendant argues that because the record upon which the ALJ based his determination was sufficient and showed that C.M.K. needed only minor accommodations, the ALJ was not required to subpoena the missing records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-16). Defendant also contends that the agency sent C.M.K. to consultative examinations to resolve any deficiencies in the record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15). Defendant further notes that Plaintiff's request that the ALJ issue a subpoena was untimely, as she did not submit her request five days before the hearing date.

The Court disagrees that the missing records were not necessary, and finds that Plaintiff's failure to request a subpoena before the hearing date, or the fact that the agency sent C.M.K. for consultative examinations, does not relieve the ALJ of his duty to develop the record in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As explained above, \"[t]he ALJ must 'make every reasonable effort' to help the claimant get medical reports from his or her medical sources as long as the claimant has permitted the ALJ to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Sotososa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206517788\">\n    2016 WL 6517788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20152800\">\n    2016 U.S. Dist.

Here, the ALJ did not make every reasonable effort to assist Plaintiff in obtaining records from CCMH. The record is clear that C.M.K. received ongoing counseling services to treat symptoms of his ADHD. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 5 at 24-25, 55-57, 271-81). It is also clear that over one years' worth of counseling notes were missing from the record, as Ms. Laga explicitly raised the issue of the missing treatment notes with the ALJ on more than one occasion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-43;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 6-3). Part of these counseling services included prescriptions for medication to treat C.M.K.'s ADHD, an impairment the ALJ found qualified as serious under the Act. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 23 (\"The claimant had a previous diagnosis of ADHD at 5-years old. He was seeing providers at [CCMH] for counseling and Dr. Galecki for psychotropic medication management.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25 (\"NP Ross noted the claimant's history of ADHD, for which he was prescribed Adderall by Dr. Galeki.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 278, 280 (\"He was seeing Dr. Galeki at CCMH.\") ). In other words, the record is missing treatment notes documenting over one years' worth of mental health evaluations, including the decision to prescribe C.M.K. medications for his serious impairment. These records likely contained information relevant to the ALJ's evaluation of C.M.K.'s alleged disability. Indeed, the ALJ himself acknowledged the importance of the records by stating at the hearing that he would hold the record open until he received them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56, 278-81). On September 26, 2015, NP Ross completed a medical statement regarding ADHD for a child's social security disability claim.

NP Ross found that C.M.K. exhibited the following behaviors: often fails to pay close attention to details; has difficulty sustaining attention in work and play; does not seem to listen when spoken to directly; often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish tasks; often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities; often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort; often loses things; is easily distracted by extraneous stimuli; and is often forgetful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 271). C.M.K. suffered from moderate inattention, and mild impulsiveness and hyperactivity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Further, C.M.K. had marked limitations in the following categories: age-appropriate cognitive/communicative function; age-appropriate social functioning; age-appropriate personal functioning; and difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 271-72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Regarding C.M.K.'s general limitations caused by his ADHD, NP Ross opined that C.M.K. had marked limitations in the following categories: social functioning (a child's capacity to form and maintain relationships with parents, other adults, and peers; includes the ability to get along with others); personal functioning self-care, which includes personal needs, health, and safety; deficiencies in concentration, persistence, or pace resulting in frequent failure to complete tasks in a timely manner; attending and completing tasks (ability to focus and maintain attention and to begin, carry through, and finish activities); interacting and relating with others (ability to initiate and sustain emotional connection with others, develop and use language, cooperate with others, comply with rules, respond to criticism, and respect and take care of the possessions of others); and caring for self (ability to maintain a healthy emotional state, including ability to get emotional wants and needs met in appropriate ways, how patient copes with stress and changes in environment, and whether patient can take care of own health, possessions, and living area). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 272-73). NP Ross found that C.M.K. had mild limitations for acquiring and using information (ability to learn and use information learned). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 273). Had the ALJ adopted NP Ross's opinion - which indicated that C.M.K. had marked limitations in more than two domains - he would have found C.M.K. to be disabled under the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Encarnacion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654421\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/72/#p75\">\n    568 F.3d at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"For a child's impairment to functionally equal a listed impairment, the impairment must 'result in \"marked\" limitations in two domains of functioning or an \"extreme\" limitation in one domain.' \") (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .926a(a) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the written determination, the ALJ gave \"some weight\" to NP Ross's opinion that C.M.K. had many ADHD symptoms with moderate inattention, mild impulsiveness and hyperactivity, marked cognitive/communication and social functioning skills, and difficulty maintaining concentration, persistence and pace.

(\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 238).
