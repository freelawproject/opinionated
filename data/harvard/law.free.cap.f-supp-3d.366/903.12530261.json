(ECF No. 3.) On December 2, 2016, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the undisputed facts show that the charged offense cannot be proven as a matter of law. (ECF Nos. 15, 16.) The Government filed a response in opposition (ECF No. 20 ), as well as a notice of intent to use an expert witness (ECF No. 19 ). Defendant has filed a reply. (ECF No. 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The relevant facts are undisputed. On August 25, 2016, Defendant arrived at Avflight in Traverse City, Michigan, to co-pilot a Talon Air flight to Massachusetts. Avflight is a fixed-based operator that services charter planes in Traverse City, and Talon Air is an air common carrier under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After arrival, Defendant began his pre-flight preparation of the airplane, including communicating with the airport tower to obtain the flight plan and clearances for the trip. Defendant also turned on the auxiliary power, inspected the outside of the aircraft, and brought coffee and luggage to the aircraft. Although Defendant had only completed 30% of the pre-flight preparations necessary for take off, the plane could have departed within 45 minutes. In addition, the three aircraft passengers had arrived and were awaiting departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During this time, the pilot, Manny Ramirez, smelled alcohol and noticed Defendant's eyes were bloodshot. Ramirez asked Defendant if he had been drinking, but Defendant denied it. Later, Ramirez called Talon Air to report that Defendant had been drinking. Talon Air contacted the Traverse City Police Department, and Sergeant Drzewiecki responded. Defendant\n   failed a routine test for alcohol impairment, and denied recently consuming alcohol. Sergeant Drzewiecki also administered two preliminary breath tests, both of which showed an unusually high blood alcohol content of over .30 percent. Later tests confirmed that Defendant's blood alcohol content was .343 percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Later that day, Defendant was charged in state court with \"attempt to act as a crew member of an aircraft\" while having a blood alcohol content of .02 percent or greater, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20259.185\">\n    Mich.

On September 6, 2016, the Government filed a federal complaint, and the state charge was dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The criminal complaint continuation sets forth the facts to support a finding of probable cause for Defendant's violation of \u00a7 342, including that Sergeant Drzewiecki found Defendant sitting in the cockpit, wearing plane earphones and conducting pre-flight checks of gauges. (ECF No. 1-1, PageID.3.) Further, the indictment provides that Defendant \"operated an air common carrier while under the influence of alcohol, specifically operating as copilot a Talon Air managed Bombardier Challenger 604 aircraft with tail number N604RR on the tarmac staging area of Cherry Capital Airport while possessing a blood alcohol content of approximately 0.343 percent.\" (ECF No. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(1) provides that \"[t]he indictment or information must be a plain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged[.]\" The indictment \"need not contain a formal introduction or conclusion.\" Fed.

Defendant argues that the Government cannot prove that he operated the aircraft in violation of \u00a7 342. Defendant notes that \u00a7 342 does not define the term \"operate\" and that there are few cases interpreting this statute. Further, the limited case law interpreting \u00a7 342 is comprised of cases where the aircraft actually departed, unlike the facts here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Therefore, Defendant must have actually operated or directed the operation of the aircraft. A substantial step towards operation may be sufficient for attempt; but here, it is not enough for a conviction under \u00a7 342.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The indictment provides that Defendant\n   \"specifically operat[ed] as copilot a Talon Air managed Bombardier Challenger 604 aircraft ... on the tarmac staging area of Cherry Capital Airport while possessing a blood alcohol content of approximately 0.343 percent.\" (ECF No. 3.) The indictment contains the elements of the charged offense, fairly informs Defendant of the charges against him, and enables Defendant to plead an acquittal or conviction. The Court may also rely on other pleadings, including the criminal complaint continuation, to determine whether there are legally-sufficient facts to support a finding of guilt. The criminal complaint continuation details several of the steps taken by Defendant in preparation for departure, including \"utilizing the avionics of the airplane,\" \"communicat[ing] with the airport on a recorded transmission to obtain the flight plan for the trip,\" and \"conducting pre-flight checks of gauges\" from the cockpit.
