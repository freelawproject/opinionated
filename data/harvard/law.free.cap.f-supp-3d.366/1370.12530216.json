This litigation consists of three actions pending in two districts, as listed on Schedule A. Generic manufacturer defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in two D. Delaware actions do not oppose centralization in the District of Delaware. Mylan Inc., and Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (collectively, Mylan), which are defendants in the Northern District of West Virginia action, oppose centralization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Anacor filed these actions after 22 generic drug manufacturers submitted a total of fourteen Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) seeking approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make and sell generic versions of Kerydin (tavaborole) topical solution 5%, a topical antifungal that is used to treat toenail fungus. The actions on the motion are a series of Hatch-Waxman\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   patent infringement lawsuits, in which Anacor alleges that each of the 22 total defendants has infringed four U.S. Patents\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   by filing ANDAs seeking FDA approval to market generic tavaborole in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On the basis of the papers filed and hearing held, we find that these actions involve common questions of fact, and that centralization in the District of Delaware will serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote the just and efficient conduct of this litigation. All actions involve substantially identical claims that defendants infringed the four Kerydin patents. Centralization is warranted to prevent inconsistent rulings (particularly with respect to claim construction and issues of patent validity) and overlapping pretrial obligations, reduce costs, and create efficiencies for the parties, courts, and witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mylan opposes centralization, arguing that there are too few actions to justify centralization and that informal coordination among the parties and involved judges is an adequate alternative to formal centralization. We are not persuaded by these arguments. Even though only three actions are pending in this litigation, we have long acknowledged that \"actions involving the validity of complex pharmaceutical patents and the entry of generic versions of the patent holder's drugs are particularly well-suited for transfer under Section 1407.\"\n   <em>\n    In re: Alfuzosin Hydrochloride Patent Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4024792\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/560/1372/#p1372\">\n    560 F.Supp.2d 1372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1372 (J.P.M.L. 2008). For that reason, we have centralized litigation consisting of only two Hatch-Waxman Act cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the complexity of the allegations and regulatory framework governing Hatch-Waxman cases, as well as the need for swift progress in litigation involving the potential entry of generic drugs into the market, placing all actions before a single judge should foster the efficient resolution of all of the actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We select the District of Delaware as the appropriate transferee district for these actions. The claims of thirteen of the fourteen ANDA filers are pending in this district. We are confident that Judge Richard G. Andrews, who is well-versed in complex patent litigation, will steer this matter on a prudent course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the actions listed on Schedule A and pending outside the District of Delaware are transferred to the District of Delaware and, with the consent of that court, assigned to the Honorable Richard G. Andrews for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    SCHEDULE A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   MDL No. 2884 -\n   <strong>\n    IN RE: KERYDIN (TAVABOROLE) TOPICAL SOLUTION 5% PATENT LITIGATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    District of Delaware\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ANACOR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. v.

Submitting an ANDA with a \"paragraph IV certification\"-stating that the patents listed in the FDA's Orange Book as covering the previously approved drug are invalid or will not be infringed by the generic drug-constitutes a statutory act of infringement that creates subject-matter jurisdiction for a district court to resolve any disputes regarding patent infringement or validity before the generic drug is sold.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n     35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(2)(A) ;\n    <em>\n     Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v.
