WOOD, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Petitioner in this action, David Rankins (\"Rankins\"), moves for reconsideration of this Court's denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, filed pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (ECF No. 19.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his motion for reconsideration, Rankins contends that the Court erroneously determined\n   that the arguments raised in his \u00a7 2255 petition were procedurally barred and, in evaluating his arguments on the merits, applied the wrong standard. Otherwise, Rankins raises essentially the same issues and arguments the Court considered in denying his \u00a7 2255 petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, the Court DENIES Rankins' motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court assumes the parties' familiarity with the facts of this case, which are described in the Court's Opinion and Order denying Rankins' \u00a7 2255 petition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 18, at 1-4.) Briefly, Rankins was charged, along with other defendants, with engaging in a racketeering enterprise involving fraudulent real estate transactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Rankins' role in the fraudulent scheme was that of a straw purchaser for two real estate properties. In connection with these straw purchases, Rankins falsified loan applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After a seven-week trial, the jury convicted Rankins, finding that he acted as a straw purchaser of the two properties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Rankins was ultimately sentenced to fifteen months' imprisonment and one year of supervised release. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) After serving his sentence, Rankins was released from prison on or about May 2, 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) His one-year term of supervised release expired on or about May 2, 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 9, 2009, during the period of his supervised release, Rankins filed his initial \u00a7 2255 petition, asking the Court to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Rankins argued that the Government (1) committed prosecutorial misconduct by presenting false evidence at trial, and (2) failed to provide exculpatory and impeachment information as required under\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963),\n   <em>\n    Giglio v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In an Opinion and Order issued on March 12, 2013, the Court rejected Rankins' arguments and denied his \u00a7 2255 petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) The Court did not issue a certificate of appealability because Rankins failed to make substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 26, 2013, Rankins filed the present motion for reconsideration. (ECF No. 19.) Throughout his motion, Rankins raises numerous issues and arguments that the Court already considered and rejected in its denial of his \u00a7 2255 petition. Apart from his recycled claims, Rankins contends that the Court \"omitted controlling decisions that would permit a court to review previous adjudicated claims upon being presented with new evidence that was not considered in the original review of the claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-6.) Rankins also suggests that the Court did not apply the standard announced in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mahaffy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3518883\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/113/\">\n    693 F.3d 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2012).

Rankins' reconsideration arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Rankins' motion for reconsideration identifies no clear error and cites no change in controlling law or new evidence overlooked by the Court that might reasonably be expected to alter the denial of his \u00a7 2255 petition. Although most of the arguments Rankins raises in the present motion simply rehash arguments raised in his original \u00a7 2255 petition-and the Court declines to address them again-two arguments warrant discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural bar\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Rankins dedicates a large portion of his motion to contesting the Court's determination that his claims are procedurally barred. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 19, at 2-6.) But even assuming this determination were incorrect, Rankins would not be entitled to relief. This is so because, notwithstanding the procedural bar, the Court went on to reject Rankins' arguments on the merits. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 18, at 8 (\"Even considering Petitioner's arguments on the merits, however, the Court finds that no prosecutorial misconduct occurred.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10 (considering and rejecting the merits of Rankins' prosecutorial misconduct claims);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (\"Although much of Petitioner's claim [that the Government failed to produce certain exculpatory and impeachment information] is procedurally barred, even considering these contentions on their merits, the Court finds that the evidence does not support Petitioner's claim.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-15 (considering and rejecting the merits of Rankins' failure-to-disclose claims).) Therefore, even if Rankins were correct that his claims were not procedurally barred, this does not entitle him to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     United States v. Mahaffy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In an attempt to point to controlling law the Court overlooked, Rankins cites to\n   <em>\n    Mahaffy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3518883\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/113/\">\n    693 F.3d 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Mahaffy\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that \"[w]here suppressed evidence is inculpatory as well as exculpatory, and 'its exculpatory character harmonize[s] with the theory of the defense case,' a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation has occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3518883\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/113/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3518883\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/113/\">\n    at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Seizing on this instruction, Rankins repeatedly insists that the \"newly discovered evidence\" he presented to the Court in his \u00a7 2255 petition \"harmonizes\" with the theory of his defense. Because the Court apparently overlooked this harmony, Rankins argues that the Court improperly applied\n   <em>\n    Mahaffy\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Rankins is incorrect. Although\n   <em>\n    Mahaffy\n   </em>\n   does direct courts to consider whether suppressed evidence harmonizes with the theory of the defense, the evidence in question must still be in some way\n   <em>\n    exculpatory. See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841300\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/149/#p164\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[w]here suppressed evidence is inculpatory\n   <em>\n    as well as exculpatory\n   </em>\n   , and 'its\n   <em>\n    exculpatory\n   </em>\n   character harmonize[s] with the theory of the defense case,' a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation has occurred.\"(emphasis added) ). In his \u00a7 2255 petition, Rankins failed to explain how the\n   non-disclosed evidence he identified-almost all of which was unrelated to the fraudulent scheme in his own case-was exculpatory. Indeed, the Court rejected Rankins' argument on this basis.
