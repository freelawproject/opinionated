Thus, the Court only provides a summary of facts and procedural history necessary to decide the instant motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   By way of Complaint dated June 5, 2007, Plaintiffs commenced this action seeking to recover unpaid fringe benefit contributions pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement in effect from 2001 through 2006 (the \"CBA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE [1]. The crux of the dispute focused on whether Conway manifested its intent to be bound by the CBA despite not being a signatory to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE [24] at 6. Following the close of discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on March 12, 2009.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE [20]. On February 19, 2010, Judge Hurley denied both motions after determining that although Conway was bound by the CBA as a matter of law based on its conduct, more briefing was required as to whether Defendant unilaterally terminated its obligations thereunder in 2003.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE [24] at 7, 15-16. The parties subsequently renewed their cross-motions for summary judgment on August 15, 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE [34]. On March 15, 2012, Judge Hurley granted summary judgment in Plaintiffs' favor while denying Conway's motion, holding that Defendant was bound by the CBA for its entire term.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE [38] at 17. Accordingly, Judge Hurley directed the parties to set a briefing schedule with respect to damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant appealed that decision,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DE [39], but the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because a final order had not yet been entered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE [51]. Plaintiffs then filed their motion for damages,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DE [55], and Judge Hurley referred that motion to this Court for Report and Recommendation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 21, 2015 Order. Following an evidentiary hearing on July 31, 2015 and subsequent supplemental briefing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DEs [65] - [67], this Court recommended awarding Plaintiffs $ 202,958.75 in damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE [69]. On September 14, 2015, Judge Hurley adopted this Court's Report and Recommendation and entered judgment against Defendant for $ 202,958.75.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DEs [73], [74] (the \"Judgment\"). Conway again appealed the summary judgment decision and resulting Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE [75]. On September 28, 2016, the Second Circuit found that genuine disputes of material fact existed as to whether Defendant's conduct manifested an intent to be bound to the terms of the unsigned CBA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE [82] at 4. Accordingly, the Judgment was vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following a bench trial on the issue of whether Conway implicitly assented to be bound by the CBA, Judge Hurley concluded that Plaintiffs \"failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence their claim against Conway Construction for unpaid fringe benefit contributions,\" and directed the Clerk of the Court to enter judgment for Defendant and close the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE [114] at 3, 12. In reaching his decision that Conway did not intend to be bound by the CBA, Judge Hurley noted that \"[t]he evidence of implicit assent advanced by Plaintiffs is formidable and would certainly have carried the day but for the compelling and, [in Judge Hurley's opinion], highly credible testimony of Conway.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 24, 2018, Defendant filed the instant motion for attorneys' fees and costs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DE [116], which Judge Hurley referred to this Court for Report and Recommendation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   April 25, 2018 Order Referring Motion.

The disfavor of awards to defendants stems,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , from: (i) plaintiffs often bringing suits in good faith despite ultimately failing to prove their case; (ii) the goal of avoiding a chilling effect against bringing colorable suits; and (iii) supporting ERISA's essential remedial purpose of protecting beneficiaries of pension plans.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11239420\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/222/19/#p28\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Toussaint v.

As an initial matter, Conway's victory at trial certainly constitutes success on the merits such that the Court retains its discretion to award fees and costs under\n    <em>\n     Chambless\n    </em>\n    . Weighing the relevant factors, however, establishes that an award is inappropriate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    The Court notes that Conway made little to no effort at justifying its request for attorneys' fees and costs. Indeed, in its moving papers Defendant cites to no authority, save the statute itself, substantiating its claim for relief.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Declaration of Joseph Steflik, Jr., DE [117]. On reply, after Plaintiffs outlined the relevant precedent for determining whether an award under Section 1132(g)(1) is appropriate, Conway for the first time referenced the\n    <em>\n     Chambless\n    </em>\n    factors.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    [Reply] Memorandum of Law (\"Def.'s Reply\"), DE [120]. Still, however, Defendant did little more than list the factors and claim in conclusory fashion that it was entitled to recovery.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 3.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Notwithstanding, the Court considers the\n    <em>\n     Chambless\n    </em>\n    factors.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    <strong>\n     A.\n     <em>\n      Culpability or Bad Faith\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The Court first concludes that Plaintiffs brought this action in good faith. The Court notes that \"[t]his first factor regarding 'bad faith' is generally the most significant to the overall determination whether a defendant should be awarded attorney's fees in an ERISA setting.\"\n    <em>\n     Critelli v.

With respect to culpability, the bad faith \"of a losing plaintiff significantly differs from that of a losing defendant\" in that the latter \"must have violated ERISA, thereby depriving plaintiffs of rights under a [benefit] plan\" whereas the former \"may be only in error or unable to prove his case.\"\n    <em>\n     Salovaara\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11239420\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/222/19/#p28\">\n     222 F.3d at 28\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotations and citations omitted);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pyrros\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202334027\">\n     2017 WL 2334027\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4 (\"a party that has raised potentially meritorious claims in good faith will generally not be deemed culpable\") (internal citations omitted). Here, Plaintiffs clearly commenced suit under the good faith belief that Conway neglected to contribute to the Funds in accordance with the CBA. Indeed, Judge Hurley initially granted summary judgment in Plaintiffs' favor,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    DE [38], and despite ultimately ruling for Defendant after a bench trial following the Second Circuit's remand, he concluded that Plaintiffs advanced \"formidable\" evidence that \"would certainly have carried the day but for [Conway's compelling testimony].\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DE [114] at 11. Thus, it is evident that Plaintiffs were dutifully carrying out their fiduciary obligation of protecting the Funds' beneficiaries.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Accordingly, this first essential factor weighs in Plaintiffs' favor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    <strong>\n     B.\n     <em>\n      Ability to Pay\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    As for the ability of the offending party to satisfy an award, \"it is only a party's\n    <em>\n     inability\n    </em>\n    to pay an award that weighs in its favor while its\n    <em>\n     ability\n    </em>\n    to pay is generally neutral in effect.\"\n    <em>\n     Tedesco\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20140649\">\n     2019 WL 140649\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *7 (internal quotations and citations omitted) (\n    <em>\n     emphasis in original\n    </em>\n    ). Here, Conway makes no argument with respect to Plaintiffs' ability to pay but instead mentions its own position as a small business.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Reply at 3. This argument misses the mark as the question concerns\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs\n    </em>\n    ', not Defendant's, ability to satisfy an award. To that end, Plaintiffs note that although they technically could pay Conway's legal fees, any such award would come at the detriment of the Funds' beneficiaries.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant's Application for Attorney's Fees and Costs (\"Pls.'

Here, as detailed above, Plaintiffs brought this action with the good faith belief that they had a meritorious claim, but ultimately lost at trial despite proffering substantial supporting evidence.

As Judge Hurley found in his first summary judgment decision,\n    <em>\n     Brown v. C.

Following this precedent, Judge Hurley concluded that Conway implicitly assented to the terms of the CBA. In vacating the Judgment and remanding this case, the Second Circuit agreed with the legal conclusions of\n    <em>\n     Brown\n    </em>\n    but held that genuine factual disputes as to whether Conway manifested its intent to be bound precluded summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DE [82] at 3-4.
