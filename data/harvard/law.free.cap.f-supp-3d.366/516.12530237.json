LIBOR is an interest rate benchmark used in financial markets around the world and intended to reflect the competitive conditions of the London interbank money market. (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.) LIBOR is calculated by averaging a number of submitting banks' estimates of their own respective costs of borrowing money in the London interbank market in several currencies and for a number of maturities (or \"tenors\") per currency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 116-17.) It is administered by the BBA, \"the leading trade association for the United Kingdom banking and financial services sector.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91, 92.) It is published daily and used to price, benchmark, and/or settle interest rate derivatives traded over-the-counter and on public exchanges, including interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, foreign exchange forwards, and futures contracts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 121.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the relevant time period, the BBA published LIBOR rates for ten different currencies,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   including the British Pound Sterling, based upon interest rate quotas that panel banks submit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 103-07.) Defendants in this case were BBA panel banks that controlled the British Pound Sterling LIBOR (\"Sterling LIBOR\") during the class period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101, 109, 116.) Other actions filed in this District involve the U.S. Dollar,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Japanese Yen,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Swiss Franc\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   LIBOR. The financial instruments used by Plaintiffs in this action were foreign exchange (\"FX\") forward contracts, interest rate swaps, and FX futures contracts traded on the Chicago\n   Mercantile Exchange (\"CME\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 37-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To set Sterling LIBOR, the BBA asks the panel banks to answer independently the following question on every banking day in London: \"At what rate could you borrow [Sterling], were you to do so by asking for and then accepting inter-bank offers in a reasonable market size, just prior to 11:00 a.m.?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.) The panel members each submit answers reflecting the rate of interest offered on loans for 15 different maturities, or tenors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116.) Pursuant to BBA guidelines, each panel bank's answer at each tenor is supposed to reflect actual competitive market rates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109.) Each panel bank submits its rates electronically to Thomson Reuters, \"as administrator of the LIBOR fixing,\" including the Sterling LIBOR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117.) After all the submissions are received, the quotes in each tenor are ranked.\n   <em>\n    (See id.)\n   </em>\n   The Sterling LIBOR is then calculated for each tenor by averaging the middle 50% of submissions.\n   <em>\n    (Id.)\n   </em>\n   Because there were sixteen members of the Sterling LIBOR contributing panel, this meant that Thomson Reuters used the middle eight submissions, after discarding the top and bottom quartiles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.) \"This average rate becomes the daily official Sterling LIBOR for that particular tenor and is distributed electronically to the market, including within the United States, through Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg among other financial services platforms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117.) Thomson Reuters also publishes each member bank's submissions, including those that were in the top and bottom quartiles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Nearly $ 100 trillion in Sterling LIBOR-based derivatives were traded within the United States from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2010 (the \"Class Period\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 95.) During this time, Defendants also maintained operations within the United States from which they \"transacted in a full range of interest rate derivatives products, including those based upon Sterling LIBOR.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.) They \"competed against one another and others in the United States in the sales of financial services and products, including sales of interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, foreign exchange forwards, and other financial products in which the price or payments were based upon the Sterling LIBOR.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98.) They also competed in the futures markets, including the Sterling futures contracts traded on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (\"LIFFE\"), and British pound futures contracts traded on the CME. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Alleged Conduct\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Lloyds, Rabobank, RBS, and UBS were among the members of the sixteen-bank Contributor Panel for Sterling LIBOR during the putative Class Period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 118.) Plaintiffs allege that each member bank over that period \"coordinated their Sterling LIBOR submissions and manipulative trading practices to fix the prices of Sterling LIBOR-based derivatives for their financial benefit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125.) According to the CAC, \"Defendants' derivatives traders frequently\n   used electronic communications, including instant messages and chat rooms, to share information regarding their Sterling LIBOR-based derivatives positions and to request Sterling LIBOR submissions that would manipulate and fix the prices of those derivatives at artificial levels for their financial benefit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126.) Those communications allegedly took place internally as well as \"externally (among Sterling LIBOR-based derivatives traders and submitters located at different, supposedly competing, Sterling LIBOR contributor banks).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 127.) \"During the Class Period, Defendants entered into a series of agreements designed to create profit or limit liabilities amongst themselves by coordinating the manipulation of Sterling LIBOR and the prices of Sterling LIBOR-based derivatives, by conspiring to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , make false submissions to the BBA designed to artificially suppress, inflate, maintain, or otherwise alter Sterling LIBOR.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 238.) Defendants have entered into various settlements and non-prosecution agreements with government regulators, such as the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\"), and United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), in connection with LIBOR manipulation related to various currencies.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) An FX forward is \"[a] transaction that solely involves the exchange of two different currencies on a specific future date at a fixed rate agreed upon on the inception of the contract covering the exchange.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121(e).) Sonterra characterizes its forwards as \"Sterling LIBOR-based derivatives,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37), because the \"cost of buying or selling Sterling under a foreign exchange forward is determined using a formula that incorporates Sterling LIBOR,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 206). \"The calculation involves taking the 'spot price' of Sterling for immediate delivery, and adjusting it to account for the 'cost of carry,'\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the amount of interest paid or received on Sterling deposits, for the duration of the agreement. Sterling LIBOR, the benchmark rate for Sterling deposits, is used in this formula to calculate the cost of carrying Sterling over the duration of the foreign exchange forward.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff Dennis is an individual trader who participated in transactions in Sterling foreign exchange futures contracts (\"Sterling FX Futures\") on the CME on one occasion-May 11, 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 214.) A \"CME British pound futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell \u00a362,500, in terms of U.S. Dollars, on some future date.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 212.) Prices of CME Sterling FX Futures are determined using \"the same calculation used to determine the price of\" Sterling FX Forwards, but CME Sterling FX Futures are traded on the exchange according to standardized terms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 212.) On May 11, 2010, Dennis entered into a \"long position\" in CME Sterling FX Futures and, two days later, \"liquidated that position,\" at a loss of approximately $ 38,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 214.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff FrontPoint is a Delaware limited partnership with its principal place of business in Greenwich, Connecticut. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) FrontPoint claims to have entered into \"Sterling LIBOR-based swaps\" with UBS on three occasions in 2007-October\n   17, 2007, November 22, 2007, and November 29, 2007-with payments ceasing on those swaps in 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 209, 211.) These swaps were entered into in accordance with an International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (\"ISDA\") Master Agreement dated May 1, 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) \"A swap is an over-the-counter Sterling LIBOR-based derivative in which two parties exchange the obligation to make [a] series of payments based on some underlying principal amount for a set period of time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 208.)

Defendants requested a pre-motion conference to discuss their proposed motion to dismiss. (Doc. 48.) The pre-motion conference was held on October 19, 2015, during which I granted the parties' request to submit separate briefing on the question of whether this Court lacks personal jurisdiction, as distinct from their briefing on whether to dismiss on other grounds, and set a motion schedule.

Plaintiffs filed the CAC on February 25, 2016. (Doc. 95.) The CAC asserted federal claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act (First and Second Claims for Relief), the CEA (Third, Fourth, and Fifth Claims for Relief), RICO (Sixth and Seventh Claims for Relief), as well as state law claims for unjust enrichment and violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Eighth and Ninth Claims for Relief).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On April 11, 2016, Defendants moved to dismiss the CAC, (Doc. 99), and filed two briefs in support-one brief addressing the question of personal jurisdiction and the other brief addressing Defendants' remaining arguments, (Docs. 100, 103).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs filed their oppositions, (Docs. 114, 116); and Defendants filed their reply briefs, (Docs. 120, 121).

(Defs.' SMJ Br. 11.) An FX forward is \"an agreement to buy or sell a certain amount of one currency,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Sterling, in terms of another,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   U.S. Dollars, on some future date.\" (CAC \u00b6 206.) Sterling FX Futures are the same as Sterling FX Forwards \"except that [Sterling FX Forwards] are not traded on an exchange and thus [are] not subject to the standardized terms specified by the CME.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 212.) Plaintiffs allege that \"[t]he cost of buying or selling Sterling under a foreign exchange forward is determined using a formula that incorporates Sterling LIBOR.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 206.) The CAC describes this \"formula\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-44\">\n   The calculation involves taking the \"spot price\" [what it costs today] of Sterling for immediate delivery, and adjusting it to account for the \"cost of carry,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the amount of interest paid or received on Sterling deposits, for the duration of the agreement. Sterling LIBOR, the benchmark rate for Sterling deposits, is used in this formula to calculate the cost of carrying Sterling over the duration of the foreign exchange forward. As a result a manipulation of Sterling LIBOR renders the cost of buying or selling Sterling under a foreign exchange forward artificial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) I find that these non-conclusory allegations about the relationship between Sterling LIBOR and the Sterling FX Futures and FX Forwards are sufficient to establish-for the purpose of determining whether there is constitutional standing-that\n   any LIBOR manipulation had an effect on the price of Plaintiffs' transactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v.

The conduct at issue is alleged to have occurred during the Class Period-January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2010. (CAC \u00b6 217.) Although Plaintiffs may have been aware of the identities of the panel members, they claim not to have known which of the panel members participated in the conspiracy, and thus lacked notice of their claims, until the Government settlements became public: Barclays on June 27, 2012, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 46), UBS on December 18, 2012, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 17 n.8), RBS on February 6, 2013, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 73), Rabobank on October 29, 2013, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 20 n.15), Lloyds on July 28, 2014, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 22 n.20), and Deutsche Bank on April 23, 2015, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 13 n.2).

As comprehensively summarized by Judge Furman, the 2008 press reports conveyed the following information:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    On April 10, 2008, strategists at Citigroup published a report comparing LIBOR to other interest rate measures and concluding that \"LIBOR may understate actual interbank lending costs\" by twenty to thirty basis points (or twenty to thirty hundreths of a percentage point). The strategists explained:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    \"The most obvious explanation for LIBOR being set so low is the prevailing fear of being perceived as a weak hand in this fragile market environment. If a bank is not held to transact at its posted LIBOR level, there is little incentive for it to post a rate that is more reflective of real lending levels, let alone one that is higher than its competitors. Because all LIBOR postings are publicly disclosed, any bank posting a high LIBOR level runs the risk of being perceived as needing funding. With markets in such a\n    fragile state, this kind of perception could have dangerous consequences.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n    Six days later, the\n    <em>\n     Wall Street Journal\n    </em>\n    published an article citing the Citigroup report and warning that \"one of the most important barometers of the world's financial health could be sending false signals.\" The article reported that the BBA, which oversees LIBOR, was conducting an investigation into potential problems with the rate.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n    Two more articles in the\n    <em>\n     Wall Street Journal\n    </em>\n    followed in quick succession. The following day, April 17, 2008, the\n    <em>\n     Journal\n    </em>\n    reported that the BBA had \"fast-tracked its inquiry into the accuracy of the rate.\" The\n    <em>\n     Journal\n    </em>\n    noted that the BBA's announcement \"came as more traders and bankers expressed concerns about\" the validity of LIBOR. And on April 18, 2008, the\n    <em>\n     Journal\n    </em>\n    reported a \"sudden jump in the dollar-denominated London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR,\" in the wake of the announcement that the BBA was accelerating its inquiry into the rate's accuracy. The article reiterated \"concerns among bankers that the LIBOR panel banks were not reporting the high rates they were paying for short-term loans for fear of appearing desperate for cash.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n    Nor was the\n    <em>\n     Wall Street Journal\n    </em>\n    the only news outlet reporting on concerns surrounding LIBOR. On April 21, 2008, the\n    <em>\n     Financial Times\n    </em>\n    reported that \"the credibility of Libor as a measure is declining.\" In particular, the\n    <em>\n     Times\n    </em>\n    explained that, as the paper had \"first revealed\" in 2007, \"bankers have been questioning the way Libor is compiled ever since the credit turmoil first erupted.\" On May 16, 2008,\n    <em>\n     Reuters\n    </em>\n    published an article discussing \"problems with Libor,\" and noting that \"recent concern had focused particularly on the dollar Libor index and worries that some banks were understating how much they had to pay to borrow money in order to avoid being labeled desperate for cash and, as a result, vulnerable to solvency rumors.\" And on May 29, 2008,\n    <em>\n     Bloomberg\n    </em>\n    published an article, the first line of which stated: \"Banks routinely misstated borrowing costs to the British Bankers' Association to avoid the perception they faced difficulty raising funds as credit markets seized up, said Tim Bond, a strategist at Barclay Capital.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n    Amidst growing concern about LIBOR's reliability, the\n    <em>\n     Wall Street Journal\n    </em>\n    conducted its own study. Its results-published in a May 29, 2008 article-revealed that \"in the first four months of 2008, the three-month and six-month dollar Libor rates were about a quarter percentage point lower than\" the\n    <em>\n     Journal\n    </em>\n    's analysis suggested they should have been. The data showed, further, that \"after banks adjusted their Libor rates following news of the BBA review in mid-April, the difference between the reported rates and what rates should have been shrunk to about 0.15 percentage point.\" Three experts, the\n    <em>\n     Journal\n    </em>\n    reported, approved of its methodology. By May 29, 2008, then, there were at least seven articles in major publications reporting that there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion that LIBOR was artificially low and had been so for some time.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    <em>\n     BPP Ill., LLC v.

In a footnote, the Court reconciled its decisions as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n    In the previous appeal in this case, we stated that the district court had acted too hastily in concluding, based in part on these newspaper reports, that BPP should have been aware of its potential LIBOR-fraud claims. In that appeal, however, we considered a different question under a different body of law. The issue was whether BPP had sufficient inquiry notice under the relevant Pennsylvania statute of limitations. That question turned on when the plaintiff reasonably should have known that he had been injured and that his injury had been caused by another party's conduct. In this appeal, controlled by Fifth Circuit bankruptcy precedents, the question is whether the debtor has enough information prior to confirmation to suggest that it may have a possible cause of action. The tests are different, and a bankruptcy debtor in the Fifth Circuit could be required to list a cause of action in its schedule of assets even though the same debtor would not be deemed to have inquiry notice of his injury for purposes of the Pennsylvania statute of limitations.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516091\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/68/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 193 n.3 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The Second Circuit's recent decision in\n    <em>\n     Charles Schwab Corp. v.

As an initial matter, the 2008 press reports did not explicitly suggest that panel banks were manipulating Sterling LIBOR, which distinguishes this case from the U.S.-dollar LIBOR decisions that tolled the statute of limitations notwithstanding those same reports. Further, it is unclear that the 2008 press reports should have alerted Plaintiffs to their various claims, as those reports may not have provided Plaintiffs with a basis to allege a cognizable theory of liability against each specific Defendant.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sullivan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20685570\">\n     2017 WL 685570\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *28 (rejecting defendants' argument that \"October 2011 press reports about possible Euribor manipulation should have alerted plaintiffs to their claims\" because \"those early reports did not provide plaintiffs with information sufficient to identify each defendant or a good-faith basis to allege a cognizable theory of liability\").

(Defs.' SMJ Br. 39.) This is essentially the same argument as discussed above in the context of antitrust standing-that there is no plausible relationship between Dennis's FX Futures and the alleged Sterling LIBOR manipulation to adequately allege an injury. Thus, for the reasons stated above,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    Part V.B.1.b, I find that Dennis has adequately pled that the Sterling LIBOR manipulation had an effect on futures contracts for the purposes of CEA standing. A CME futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell \u00a362,500, in U.S. Dollars, on some future date. (CAC \u00b6 212.) The cost of buying or selling Sterling on that future date is determined by a formula that incorporates Sterling LIBOR to adjust the spot price of Sterling to account for the amount of interest paid or received over the duration of the agreement. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) A change in the Sterling LIBOR thus affects the price of the contract, at least for the purpose of CEA standing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    Defendants also argue that Dennis lacks standing under the CEA because he has not pled actual damages, a requirement for CEA standing.

UBS was a reporting bank for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's (\"FRBNY\") surveys on the over-the-counter interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange market. The FRBNY surveys indicated that the Sterling foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives market was the fourth largest interest rate derivatives market in the United States. (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 94-95;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Lefkowitz Decl. Exs. 32-33.) FrontPoint traded directly with UBS in the alleged manipulated products pursuant to the ISDA Master Agreements. UBS operated an interest rate derivatives trading desk in Connecticut. (CAC \u00b6 81.) Traders at that desk acted as submitters or made requests to submit false Sterling LIBOR rates to harm Plaintiffs and the Class and benefit UBS's trading positions. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 81-84.)

However, the\n    <em>\n     Sullivan\n    </em>\n    court described, in a hypothetical, allegations that would be necessary to satisfy the minimum-contacts prong of the specific jurisdiction test. Specifically, Judge Castel stated that if the complaint had alleged \"that a United State[s] branch employed traders\n    who requested artificial Euribor rates\" or \"pointed to directives from United States management that facilitated or encouraged the scheme, such allegations would likely reflect suit-related conduct with a substantial connection to the forum.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"382\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20685570\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at *45 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Libor-Based Financial Instruments Antitrust Litigation (\"LIBOR IV\")\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"383\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204634541\">\n     2015 WL 4634541\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *26 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2015) (\"[I]n principle, we would uphold jurisdiction in the forum containing the office from which a defendant determined, or transmitted, a false LIBOR submission.\") These allegations are similar to some of the allegations in the CAC related to UBS and Frontpoint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    Foreign Defendants argue that \"Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege that Foreign Defendants engaged in manipulative conduct relating to Sterling LIBOR in the forum.\" (3/14/17 Ltr. 2.) With regard to Defendant UBS, this argument ignores Paragraph 85 of the CAC, which alleges that \"[a]t least one senior UBS manager in its Stamford, Connecticut headquarters directly manipulated UBS's LIBOR submissions,\" and that the manager \"directed UBS LIBOR submitters to manipulate LIBOR submissions across all currencies, including Sterling LIBOR.\" (CAC \u00b6 85 (citing UBS CFTC Agmt. 48\n    <footnotemark>\n     30\n    </footnotemark>\n    ).) This is the type of allegation that Judge Castel found lacking in the\n    <em>\n     Sullivan\n    </em>\n    complaint. Plaintiffs allege, by reference to documentary evidence, the involvement of a United States-based UBS employee in LIBOR manipulation. This conduct, which allegedly occurred in the forum, is alleged to have caused, in part, the harm suffered by Plaintiff FrontPoint as a result of Defendant UBS's Sherman Act violations, which is \"suit-related conduct\" that creates a \"substantial connection\" with the forum.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Walden\n    </em>\n    , 571 U.S. at 284,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578282,12701990\" index=\"384\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1115/\">\n     134 S.Ct. 1115\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Applying the five factors the Supreme Court has identified, I find that it is appropriate to exercise jurisdiction over Defendant UBS.

Requiring Defendant UBS to answer to allegations in the United States, and specifically in New York, will not impose an unreasonable burden.
