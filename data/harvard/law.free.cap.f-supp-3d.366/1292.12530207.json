This royalty interest is accounted for by monthly reports and royalty payments lessees submit to ONRR. Prior to 1982, meaningful civil penalties were rarely imposed to help assure accurate lessee reporting and payment, and the government had limited legal authority to impose sanctions for late payment or nonpayment. This failure was highlighted in reports by the General Accounting Office (GAO) discussing the government's failure to collect royalties, along with the outright theft of oil and gas from federal and tribal leases. The Linowes Commission, appointed by the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), investigated GAO's claims, and the Commission's findings were summarized by a Senate report issued in conjunction with the passage of FOGRMA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The Commission's findings basically confirmed the reports of the [GAO]. The federal royalty accounting system lacks effective accounting procedures and is understaffed. The system does not provide for the verification of data reported by oil and gas lessees, and lease account records are so unreliable that federal royalty managers often do not know which lessees have paid royalties and which lessees have not. Penalties for late payments or underpayment are rarely imposed. Because of these shortcomings, the Linowes Commission concluded that \"the industry is essentially on an honor system.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   S. Rep.

In short, Congress established three levels of civil penalty liability for persons who violate provisions of FOGRMA. This penalty system includes the lowest penalty level, Section 1719(a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which generally requires notice of a violation and an opportunity to comply before a penalty would be assessed. S. Rep. No. 97-512, at 17 (1982); Appellate Record (AR) 59. Section 1719(b) imposes liability for a higher daily civil penalty based on continued \"failure to take corrective action\" within a certain period after notice or report of the\n   violation under Section 1719(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 1719(c) covers certain enumerated violations and imposes liability for higher daily penalties without an opportunity to cure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The highest level, Section 1719(d), prescribes \"substantially higher penalties for certain more serious violations which are committed knowingly or willfully.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   CM/ECF Document (Doc.) 30-2, p. 6.

First, API argues the definitions of the terms \"maintains\" and \"submits\", and the phrase \"knowingly or willfully\" sweep violations and conduct into the most severe penalty tier of FOGRMA Section 1719(d), beyond what Congress enacted. API contends Congress limited Section 1719(d) to criminally punishable theft and fraud, and through these definitional changes, ONRR has eviscerated Congress' carefully crafted statutory penalty hierarchy. Second, API claims the new penalty scheme illegally and arbitrarily imposes blanket, strict, vicarious liability on lessees for all employee actions. Third, API argues ONRR has broadened the scope of conduct that may be penalized under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201719\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), by allowing any alleged recordkeeping issue, such as a delay in providing requested records, into an impediment of an \"audit,\" thereby triggering higher penalties without prior notice to the lessee. Fourth, API challenges the rule precluding consideration of the royalty consequence of the underlying violation in assessing certain specified civil penalties, arguing it ignores the principles of proportionality. Fifth, API argues the rule allowing the ALJ to forfeit the benefit of a stay in certain circumstances denies procedural due process. Finally, API claims the rule fails to consider its economic impacts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Threshold Questions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As an initial matter, ONRR argues that API lacks Article III standing to pursue its claims for relief because it has failed to demonstrate any \"injury-in-fact\" as a result of the rule.

Rep. No. 97-512, at 17 (1982). API's chief complaint is that the rule improperly and illegally captures less serious errors and conduct into FOGRMA's most severe penalty provisions of Sections 1719(c) and (d), as opposed to Sections 1719(a) and (b), thus subjecting its members to exponentially higher civil penalties without notice and an opportunity for correction. The causal link between the allegedly unlawful rule and the alleged injury (i.e., much higher penalty liability without a NONC) is not speculative. No one has suggested that there would be anything other than swift and sure penalty imposition for Section 1719(c) and (d) violations. Thus, the threatened injury of severe penalties without a prior NONC is sufficiently imminent to establish standing for API's members. Further, the other requirements for associational standing are met and apparently undisputed. The interests API seeks to protect are germane to their organizational goals of ensuring a favorable regulatory environment and economic health for oil and gas companies. Finally, there is no apparent reason why this suit requires the participation of individual companies. Therefore, API has standing to sue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Ripeness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ONRR argues API's claims are neither constitutionally nor prudentially ripe.

In making this argument, API points to the exposure for criminal penalties tied to violations addressed by Section 1719(d), as well as the types of violations discussed in Section 1719(d)(2) and (3) which essentially include taking, transporting, purchasing or using stolen or unlawfully removed oil or gas. As the Court understands the argument, because two of the three subsections focus on theft, and criminal liability may be imposed, Congress intended the first subsection discussing false information to be limited to acts amounting to fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In terms of legislative history, the Committee reports have the following discussion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [T]he Committee feels strongly that administrative discretion should not be the principal mechanism through which the severity of punishment is matched to the seriousness of the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Therefore, the Committee amendment attempts to distinguish between those violations which ought to lead to a very large civil penalty and those for which liability should be reduced. In making this distinction a balance must be struck between the need to deter violations of the Act and the need to avoid a situation in which exposure to very severe penalty liability for relatively minor or inadvertent violations of necessarily complex regulations becomes a major disincentive to produce oil or gas from lease sites on federal or Indian lands. The Committee attempted to achieve this balance by providing a requirement of notice of violation and a lower civil penalty limit for certain violations of the Act and a steeply rising civil penalty liability for serious violations knowingly or willfully committed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Doc. 30-2, p. 5.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The approach the Committee used for civil penalties was to provide lesser penalties for failure to comply with a term of an oil and gas lease, license, or permit, or any provision of this bill ..., regulations or orders. For the more serious acts such as knowingly or willfully submitting false records, accepting stolen oil or gas, or diverting oil or gas\n   from a lease site without authority to do so, the Committee provided stiffer penalties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Doc. 30-3, p. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   API's argument is not supported by the statute or its legislative history. First, Congress specifically used the phrase \"false, inaccurate, or misleading\" information in Section 1719(d)(i), not fraudulent information. The term \"fraud\" is typically understood to describe words or silence meant to mislead or deceive in regard to material facts.\n   <em>\n    Stewart v. Wyoming Cattle-Ranche Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3533507\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/128/383/#p389\">\n    128 U.S. 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 389-390,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3533507\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/128/383/#p389\">\n    9 S.Ct. 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3533507\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/128/383/#p389\">\n    32 L.Ed. 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). Turning to a more recent source, \"intent to defraud\" means \"to act willfully with intent to deceive or cheat, ordinarily for the purpose of causing financial loss to another or bringing about financial gain to one's self.\" 10th Cir. Criminal Pattern Jury Inst. 2.50.1 (updated Feb. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Other than the statutory phrase \"knowingly or willfully\" which is addressed below, there is no support in the statute, its history, or the case law to suggest Congress intended to require the Secretary to show proof of an intent to deceive or materiality. Indeed, one of the greatest concerns in the drafting of FOGRMA was a suggested amendment limiting the prohibition on the preparation, maintenance, or submission of inaccurate or misleading information to \"significantly\" inaccurate or \"materially\" misleading information. The government's response was that these two adverbs \"would give us serious problems\" and \"sanction the submission ... of misleading information and make us then prove it was \"materially\" misleading before taking any action. Doc. 30-2, p. 11. The amendment was not adopted. This legislative history, along with the language of the statute supports the conclusion that Section 1719(d)(1) is not limited to fraud, but includes the broader conduct of preparing, maintaining, or submitting false, inaccurate, or misleading information done knowingly and willfully. API's arguments concerning the phrase \"knowingly and willfully,\" and whether Section 1719(d) is limited to criminally specific intent, are addressed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    \"Maintains\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   API challenges the definition of \"maintains,\" arguing it should refer only to a lessee's internal keeping of company records and thus harshly penalize conduct amounting to \"cooking the books.\" API contends the new definition includes any \"failure to correct\" any reporting violation on \"any ONRR data system\" after the lessee receives even the most informal or indirect form of notice from ONRR. API argues this definition improperly captures simple reporting errors innocently made and later brought to a lessee's attention, thereby bringing such conduct into FOGRMA's most severe penalty provisions of Section 1719(d) as opposed to Sections 1719(a) and (b). API contends this eviscerates Congress' carefully crafted statutory penalty hierarchy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   ONRR argues it reasonably defined \"maintains,\" which is undefined in FOGRMA, and API's argument that the term cannot cover reports on file with ONRR after submission is unfounded. ONRR points to several ordinary definitions of \"maintains\" and argues it includes keeping or carrying on a thing or information as valid or true. Thus the term properly encompasses a continuing affirmation that the information provided to ONRR is true and correct. ONRR argues Congress was concerned with ensuring accuracy in the entire royalty accounting system, thus it is illogical to believe Congress was only concerned with the accuracy of internally-kept records but not the accuracy of the records kept on file with the agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   API replies by arguing the issue isn't whether records kept on file with the agency are accurate, but whether the failure to correct inaccurate records once brought to the lessee's attention was intended by Congress to come within the ambit of the most severe penalty tier of Section 1719(d), rather than the penalties provided by Sections 1719(a) and (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   After considering the arguments of the parties, the Court agrees with ONRR. Congress intended to impose substantially higher penalty liability under Section 1719(d)\"for certain more serious violations which are committed knowingly or willfully.\" Doc. 30-2, p. 6. ONRR must carry its burden of proof in showing the violation was committed knowingly or willfully. The only issue here is whether it is reasonable to conclude Congress intended the lessee's \"knowing or willful\" failure to correct false or misleading records contained in the ONRR data system to be one of the \"more serious violations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the history underlying FOGRMA's enactment, it is reasonable to conclude such a knowing and willful failure is a more serious violation covered by Section 1719(d). The shortcomings of the old royalty management system were well documented. Fundamental to these shortcomings was the fact that the oil and gas lease accounts kept by the government were in disarray with mostly erroneous balances. Doc. 36-2, p. 16. The government failed to collect essential data.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3533507\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/128/383/#p389\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Furthermore, the data [the government] did manage to collect and properly file was supplied by industry without verification; thus allowing industry to operate on an honor system.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3533507\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/128/383/#p389\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In the context of this history and the corrective purpose underlying FOGRMA, it is simply unreasonable to severely penalize knowing maintenance of false or misleading information internal to the lessee's records, without placing at the same level for liability, the knowing maintenance of false or misleading information within the official records of ONRR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    \"Submits\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   API challenges the definition of \"submits,\" claiming it fails to include the proposed rule's definition of \"submission,\" i.e., that \"you know, or should have known, the information that you provided was false, inaccurate or misleading at the time you provided the information.\" AR1211. API contends it is not enough that a lessee sends reports to ONRR that later are shown to contain errors; under Section 1719(d) a lessee must know of false information in its reports at the time it submits them. Based on a variety of examples and questions presented by API in its brief, API contends the definition creates \"limitless ONRR discretion and liability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   ONRR argues that regardless of the amended rule's definition of \"submits,\" to impose a penalty under Section 1719(d)(1), ONRR must meet the requirements of that section. Section 1719(d)(1) imposes a \"knowing or willful\" requirement. Thus the amended rule's definition of \"submit\" could\n   not-and does not purport to-modify the statutory\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The regulation at issue reads as follows: \"Submits false, inaccurate, or misleading information means that you provide false, inaccurate, or misleading information to an ONRR data system, or otherwise to us for our official records.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201241.3\">\n    30 CFR \u00a7 1241.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This definition equates the word \"submits\" with the word \"provides\" and replaces the statutory phrase \"reports, notices, affidavits, records, data, or other written information\" with the word \"information.\" It also limits liability as the information must be provided \"to us for our official records.\" The definition does not purport to modify the statutory requirement that such provision of information must be done knowingly or willfully, nor does it relieve the ONRR of its burden of proof as to the requisite\n   <em>\n    mens rea.\n   </em>\n   API's argument that this definition creates limitless discretion and liability is unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    \"Knowingly or Willfully\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   API challenges the definition of \"knowingly or willfully,\" arguing Section 1719(d) requires specific intent and the rule impermissibly lowers the requisite\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   from a criminal standard to a mere \"reckless disregard\" civil standard. In support of this argument, API asserts Section 1719(d) comprises exclusively criminal-level violations as indicated by the fact Congress made the civil violations in Section 1719(d) a predicate to criminal liability. Thus the provisions should be interpreted consistently, adhering to the criminal standard, meaning actual knowledge of wrongfulness or deliberately wrongful action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   ONRR responds by arguing there is no dispute, based on FOGRMA's text and legislative history, that Sections 1719(d) and 1720 are two distinct provisions, with different goals. Section 1719(d) is a civil penalty provision imposing liability for serious violations knowingly or willfully committed, and Section 1720 imposes criminal liability for those serious acts identified and committed under Section 1719(d). API's argument improperly attempts to conflate the two provisions into one single criminal penalty provision. ONRR argues the rule is reasonable as \"reckless disregard\" is often applied as the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   for a willful violation in a civil context and is appropriately applied to violations under Section 1719(d), a civil penalty provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The issue presented is whether ONRR erred by including \"reckless disregard\" as a component of the permissible\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   showing under Section 1719(d). The Court concludes ONRR's definition of \"knowingly or willfully\" is reasonable. API's argument that \"knowingly or willfully\" must be given a consistent definition in both sections is unsupported. First, API fails to provide any counterpart criminal statute which uses the phrase \"knowingly or willfully.\" Indeed, the use of the word \"willfully\" (without \"knowingly\") in the federal criminal code is limited, including but perhaps not entirely limited to criminal tax cases, odometer fraud cases, health care anti-trust kickback statute cases, anti-structuring cases, certain securities cases, certain firearms cases, and failure to pay child support cases.

The Court rejects this argument. First, liability under Section 1719(d) is just one element of the offense described in Section 1720. In other words, a violation of Section 1719(d) is necessary for conviction under Section 1720, but it is not sufficient. Other elements, including a much higher burden of proof (proof beyond a reasonable doubt versus a preponderance standard) applies for a criminal conviction. Further, the Court is reaching no conclusion on the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   required for Section 1720. After all, this is a different legal provision with criminal sanctions, and context matters. It would logically be expected that \"knowingly or willfully\" may be given a different interpretation in a criminal statute, warranting jury instructions not controlled by the ONRR definition of \"knowingly or willfully\" for civil penalty assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Further, if \"willfully\" is construed the same as in the criminal law context, there would be no reason for its inclusion, as ONRR would satisfy Section 1719(d) for penalty assessment simply by meeting its burden of proving a knowing violation. In other words, there would be never be a need to show a culpable state of mind.

The subpart of the regulation at issue discusses a list of information ONRR may use as evidence of a knowing or willful violation. The list includes \"[t]he act and failure to act of your employee or agent.\" 30 CFR 11241.60(c)(1). API argues this inclusion disregards the employee's position within the company or the employee's relation to federal or Indian lease royalty reporting and payment obligations. Moreover, API argues under \u00a7 1241.60(c)(4), agency communications as informal as a telephone call or email from any ONRR employee to any company employee can create such severe vicarious liability. API argues this rule is contrary to the law that only authorized agents can bind a corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 1.01 (2006). API argues vicarious liability for punitive damages like FOGRMA's civil or criminal penalties requires a showing that an \"employee serving in a 'managerial capacity' committed the wrong while acting in the scope of employment,\" that the principal was reckless in hiring an unfit agent, or that the principal authorized or approved the act.\n   <em>\n    Kolstad v.

ONRR also complains that API's argument about when or whether liability will be imposed is speculative and hypothesized. Further, ONRR agrees that this rule does not allow informal notification, as formal correspondence is sent to a lessee's designated representative. Finally, ONRR points out that civil penalties are not \"punitive damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As to the reasonableness of the regulation in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201241.60\">\n    30 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), the Court agrees with ONRR. This rule does not presume to impose vicarious liability, strict liability, or strict vicarious liability. It is merely notice of what information ONRR may seek to use as evidence. The rule does not purport to address what evidence might actually be used or admitted, or the weight to be given to any admissible evidence. Issues concerning the scope of employment, the duties or authority of the employee or agent, whether the employee or agent was a designated representative, or the form, manner of delivery, or appealability of communications, are not before the Court by virtue of a facial attack to the regulation at issue. Rather, these will, if ever, be issues for ONRR and the adjudicating ALJs when the rule is ultimately applied. On its face, the regulation providing notice of the type of information which may be used as evidence is not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Further, API, by its fact-based hypotheticals and speculations, fails to show that there is \"no set of circumstances\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   in which the challenged regulation might be applied consistent with the agency's statutory authority.\n   <em>\n    Scherer v.

The offensive language at issue is the appendage to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201241.60\">\n    30 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(ii) which adds, \"including refusal to keep, maintain, or produce documents.\" API argues the plain purpose of the statute was to impose liability on a lessee that literally or figuratively \"barred the door\" when ONRR needs to audit the lessee's records. API contends the rule now allows ONRR to convert any alleged lessee recordkeeping issue, such as a delay in providing requested records, even if no audit exists, into a violation of Section 1719(c), which carries a significantly higher maximum daily penalty than Sections 1719(a) or (b), and without notice and an opportunity to correct. API also complains that the rule automatically imputes an alleged impediment of an audit by any \"employee or agent\" to create Section 1719(c) liability for an entire company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   ONRR responds by arguing that API misconstrues the so-called \"appendage\" in 30 C.F.R.\u00a7 1241.60(b)(1)(ii). According to ONRR, this language merely provides a clarifying list of examples of what could constitute a refusal to permit an audit under Section 1719(c), and is not a \"significant departure\" from FOGRMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Again, the Court agrees with ONRR. The offending language which adds \"including refusal to keep, maintain, or produce documents\" follows the word \"audit.\" This is a reasonable example of a Section 1719(c) violation for impeding an audit. If records are not kept, maintained or produced, an audit is impeded just as much as if the lessee \"bars the door.\" ONRR does not claim this example is an independent basis for assessing the higher civil penalty apart from an audit. Again, on its face, the regulation providing this example is not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. As noted above, fact-based hypotheticals and speculations are insufficient to show that there is \"no set of circumstances\" in which the challenged regulation might be applied consistent with the agency's statutory authority.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scherer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822854\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/653/1241/#p1243\">\n    653 F.3d at 1243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

API claims this rule chills the option to pursue a stay by threatening to retroactively reverse the benefits, thereby cutting off due process and appeal rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   ONRR again argues API fails to meet the test in\n   <em>\n    Scherer\n   </em>\n   as its argument concedes any stay may be forfeit only in certain cases (i.e., only if the ALJ determines the defense to a Notice is frivolous). ONRR also argues the rule is reasonable in that it warns and deters against bringing baseless defenses, and it does not violate due process as there is no constitutional right to bring a frivolous suit. In short, it is no different than warnings and sanctions imposed for pursuing frivolous claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The rule at issue provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Notwithstanding [the ALJ's determination that a stay of the accrual of penalties is warranted along with the posting of a bond or surety (or demonstration of financial solvency) ], if the ALJ determines that your defense to a Notice is frivolous, and a civil penalty is owed, you will forfeit the benefit of the stay, and penalties will be calculated as if no stay had been granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201241.11\">\n    30 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5). This provision must be understood in the context of the general provisions for Department Hearings and Appeals Procedures:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    Standards and procedures for obtaining a stay.\n   </strong>\n   Except as otherwise provided by law or other pertinent regulation:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (1) A petition for a stay of a decision pending appeal shall show sufficient justification based on the following standards:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (i) The relative harm to the parties if the stay is granted or denied,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (ii) The likelihood of the appellant's success on the merits,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (iii) The likelihood of immediate and irreparable harm if the stay is not granted, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (iv) Whether the public interest favors granting the stay;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (2) The appellant requesting the stay bears the burden of proof to demonstrate\n   that a stay should be granted ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%204.21\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). By its rule, ONRR thereby interjects a subsequent determination by the ALJ for royalty cases wherein a stay was previously granted but the civil penalty is affirmed - namely, a determination as to whether the appellant's defense was frivolous. If that \"frivolous\" determination is made, penalties will be calculated as if no stay had been granted.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201241.11\">\n    30 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5). On this point, it is important to note that civil penalties for violations not only accrue daily, but interest accrues on the principle. A stay stops this accrual and thus the loss of this benefit has the potential for enormous, retroactive effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As to API's due process claim, the Court finds that argument unpersuasive as API fails to identify any case supporting the proposition that an appellant is entitled to a stay to pursue a frivolous defense. Nonetheless, the Court concludes the rule at issue is an abuse of discretion and not in accordance with law. The rules and regulations governing requests for a hearing provide for a stay if the ALJ determines on the filings that a stay is warranted. There is no basis in the record for a second bite following adjudication of the case, particularly when ONRR is not required to file a response to any petition for stay, and the potential loss of benefit is so significant. If ONRR believes a stay is not warranted, including the argument that the defense is frivolous, ONRR has the right to, and should file a response to the stay petition rather than wait on an outcome at some undetermined later date and then assert frivolity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds the provision at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201241.11\">\n    30 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5) is an abuse of discretion and not in accordance with law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   VIII.\n   <em>\n    Economic Impacts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   API argues the rule presents \"Summary Cost and Royalty Impact Data\" that is grossly understated and shows the rule is unjustified.

EPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3892544,5875112\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/1032/\">\n    682 F.3d 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1040 (D.C. Cir. 2012). ONRR argues API cannot meet its high burden simply by engaging in speculation about the number, type and amount of penalties that may be imposed in the future. In short, ONRR argues it performed a reasonable economic analysis relying on recent data (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR3653) and acknowledging the industry could experience some impacts with respect to increases in civil penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The rule does not contain, nor does it apparently require, an economic impact analysis. The \"Summary Cost and Royalty Impact Data\" referenced by API is in a portion of the rule entitled \"Procedural Matters.\" 81 F.R. 50315. API has not identified any substantive law violated with respect to this procedural matter. API appears to challenge the summary cost data, and not the royalty impact data. However, the rule provides the cost and benefit information in this \"Procedural Matter\" is used only as the basis for Departmental certifications (\"items 2 through 10\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3892544,5875112\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/1032/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   API has not brought claims under any of these \"items,\" whether they are laws or executive orders. Further, there is no argument made that any of these \"items\" mandate anything more than the summary cost data presented, and the record is completely silent as to API's standing to complain concerning a procedural matter apparently used for agency certifications. As a result the Court declines to consider this issue further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Based on the forgoing, it is ORDERED:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   1.
