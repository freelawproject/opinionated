Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On April 2, 2018 at approximately 11:48 p.m., defendant Mark Gibson was walking home from the bus stop. As he was walking east on Galen Street at the intersection of 16th Street and Galen Street Southeast in the District of Columbia, four Metropolitan Police Department Gun Recovery Unit Officers (\"MPD officers\" or \"officers\") were patrolling in the same area, seeking to recover firearms. After a brief encounter between the officers and Mr. Gibson-the details of which are disputed-Mr. Gibson fled. He was caught, arrested, searched, and found to be in possession of cocaine base and a firearm. Thereafter, Mr. Gibson was indicted on three counts: (1) unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) ; (2) unlawful possession with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (3) possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment, ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court is Mr. Gibson's motion to suppress all tangible evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 6. Mr. Gibson argues that he was unlawfully seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution when the MPD Officers approached him and ordered him to show his waistband and lift his jacket. The Court held evidentiary hearings on September 17, 2018 and September 20, 2018, at which both MPD Officer Matthew Hiller (\"Officer Hiller\") and Mr. Gibson testified. As explained fully below, the Court credits Mr. Gibson's testimony and finds that the government has not met its burden to establish that the seizure was lawful. Accordingly, after careful consideration of Mr. Gibson's motion, the responses and supplemental responses, the replies and supplemental replies thereto, the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearings, and the oral arguments made at the September 25, 2018 and October 10, 2018 motion hearings, Mr. Gibson's motion to suppress all tangible evidence is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 24, 2018, Mr. Gibson was indicted for: (1) unlawfully and knowingly possessing a Taurus .40 caliber semiautomatic pistol as a felon; (2) knowingly and intentionally possessing cocaine base; and (3) knowingly possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. Indictment, ECF No. 1. During the September 17, 2018 and September 20, 2018 evidentiary hearings, the Court viewed the relevant body-worn camera footage. Officer Hiller and Mr. Gibson also testified about the circumstances leading to Mr. Gibson's arrest. Their respective testimony conflicts on the critical question upon which resolution of this motion depends-namely, whether one of the MPD officers ordered Mr. Gibson to show his waistband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Unfortunately, this determination cannot be made from the best evidence available: the body-worn camera footage. There is no audio available of the encounter because none of the four MPD officers activated their cameras when they came into contact with Mr. Gibson. The officers only activated their body-worn cameras when they began to pursue Mr. Gibson on foot. Sept. 17 Tr., ECF No. 16 at 141; Gov't's Exs. 1-A, 1-B. The Court is able to see the encounter, even though the MPD officers did not activate their body-worn cameras, because the cameras store visual footage for the two minutes preceding the moment that the cameras are activated. The camera does not store the audio for those two minutes. Sept. 17 Tr., ECF No. 16 at 7-8, 14. Therefore, the Court is able to view the short encounter between the MPD officers and Mr. Gibson but is unable to hear the dialogue.

Because Officer Wright allegedly ordered Mr. Gibson to comply, Mr. Gibson argues that a reasonable person under the circumstances would not feel free to disregard the command and leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Def.'s Suppl. Mem., ECF No. 19 at 15-16. The government argues that Mr. Gibson was not seized because Officer Wright merely asked him to see his waistband, an acceptable practice pursuant to Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit precedent.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Opp'n, ECF No. 7 ; Gov't's Suppl. Mem., ECF No. 14-1. Thus, Mr. Gibson's motion to suppress turns entirely on a factual determination: whether Officer Wright\n   <em>\n    ordered\n   </em>\n   Mr. Gibson to see his waistband or merely\n   <em>\n    asked\n   </em>\n   Mr. Gibson to see his waistband.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Factual Findings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As described above, Officer Hiller and Mr. Gibson provided directly conflicting accounts. The Court has considered the evidence admitted,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses, and the testimony of Mr. Gibson and Officer Hiller.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In the final analysis, the Court concludes that the government has not met its burden because its evidence is insufficient to prove the seizure was lawful by a preponderance of that evidence. The government's only witness-Officer Hiller-either could not remember or misremembered many of the critical facts from the April 2, 2018 encounter. Specifically, Officer Hiller could not remember the words Officer Wright used when speaking to Mr. Gibson, the issue central to resolving the motion. First, Officer Hiller testified that Officer Wright asked Mr. Gibson \"if he minded showing us his waistband.\" Sept. 17 Tr., ECF No. 16 at 18. Then, after the Court asked Officer Hiller what Officer Wright said to Mr. Gibson, Officer Hiller hedged his answer, testifying that Officer Wright said \"something almost exactly to that effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56. On cross-examination, however, Officer Hiller could not confirm the \"exact words used,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 89, and agreed that it was \"hard to remember,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 72; Mot. Hr'g Tr. (\"Oct. 10 Tr.\"), ECF No. 28 at 23-25 (Oct. 10, 2018) (conceding that Officer Hiller could not testify to the specific words uttered by Officer Wright);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26 (COURT: \"Wasn't [Officer Hiller] still unclear about the precise language [Officer Wright] used in his question to Mr. Gibson?\" GOVERNMENT: \"I think the answer to that is yes, he did not say he recalled these words specifically\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Accordingly, the government asks the Court to accept Officer Hiller's testimony that Officer Wright would never demand to see a waistband.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   Oct. 10 Tr., ECF No 28 at 32 (GOVERNMENT: \"[W]e can prevail because the Officer said it was in question form, whatever it was, was in question form.\"). True, Officer Hiller testified that Officer Wright never demands to see a waistband because MPD officers are \"instructed\" to not make demands: \"every\n   time we say that [referring to seeing waistbands], it's directed in question form.\" Sept. 17 Tr., ECF No. 16 at 117-18. However, the Court cannot agree with the government that the actual words used are \"not critical\" in light of Officer Hiller's avowal that Officer Wright would never demand to see a waistband. Oct. 10 Tr., ECF No. 28 at 36-37, 40. Moreover, it would be error on the part of the Court to credit without hesitation Officer Hiller's testimony and accept the government's conclusory argument that \"whatever it was\" that Officer Wright said, he \"said [it] in question form.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Of utmost importance in this case is Mr. Gibson's Fourth Amendment right: \"[n]o right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded ... than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Terry,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    392 U.S. at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations and citations omitted). The Court cannot find that the government met its burden of proof merely by offering Officer Hiller's blanket assurance that Officer Wright always asks questions and never demands. That declaration is insufficient because Officer Hiller could not recall what Officer Wright actually said and because-due to the officers' failure to activate their body-worn cameras during the initial encounter-the audio was not captured in the footage. Oct. 10 Tr., ECF No. 28 at 38;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sept. 17 Tr., ECF No. 16 at 75. A mere assertion that Officer Wright asks questions rather than makes demands is unsatisfactory considering Mr. Gibson's significant liberty interests and the Court's solemn duty to enforce the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Likewise, the Court is troubled by other significant gaps in Officer Hiller's memory. For example, Officer Hiller did not remember Mr. Gibson raising his two arms in the air-the most salient part of the short encounter. Sept. 17 Tr., ECF No. 16 at 70-71 (Q: \"You remember him having two hands in the air?\" A: \"I don't - I don't remember\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 154 (COURT: \"Do you recall seeing [Mr. Gibson's] hands in the air ...?\" A: \"I don't remember\"). Indeed, Officer Hiller did not mention Mr. Gibson raising his arms during his initial narrative testimony, despite having viewed the body-worn camera footage in advance to prepare for his testimony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-20, 67-68. Testimony about Mr. Gibson's lifted hands was only elicited on cross-examination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62. Moreover, Officer Hiller\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   omitted the key fact that Mr. Gibson had raised his arms in response to Officer Wright when he prepared and filed under oath a Gerstein Report the day after arresting Mr. Gibson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13-1 at 1-2 ; Sept. 17 Tr., ECF No. 16 at 59-60. In that detailed document, Officer Hiller attested that Mr. Gibson responded to Officer Wright's request to see his waistband while \"keeping his hands in his jacket pockets.\" ECF No. 13-1 at 1. At no point did Officer Hiller mention the fact that Mr. Gibson raised his arms in the air in response to Officer Wright.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Although, a Gerstein Report need not contain \"every\" detail about a particular encounter, Oct. 10 Tr., ECF No. 28 at 74, the omission is problematic, given the overall brevity of the encounter and the significance of the surrendering act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, Officer Hiller could not remember other details about the encounter. For example, because Officer Hiller did not remember Mr. Gibson raising his hands in the air, he also could not remember whether the MPD officers could see Mr. Gibson's waistband, a fact significant to the Court's analysis. Sept. 17 Tr., ECF No. 16 at 154 (COURT: \"At the time when [Mr. Gibson's] hands were in the air, could you see his waistband?\" A: \"I don't - I don't remember,\n   Your Honor\"). Additionally, the MPD officers encountered another individual and spoke to that individual shortly before coming across Mr. Gibson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Ex. 1-B at about 0:24-0:55. When asked about that encounter, Officer Hiller could not remember who Officer Wright had been speaking to or what Officer Wright said to that unknown individual, even though the officers spoke to the individual less than a minute before encountering Mr. Gibson. Sept. 20 Tr., ECF No. 17 at 20-21, 29 (Q: \"So you have no memory of that?\" A: \"No, I don't have a memory of that. Like I said, I - it appeared from the video\"). Finally, Officer Hiller testified that he did not \"even remember\" if he saw Mr. Gibson turn around to run away: \"I just remember Officer Mancini got out [of the vehicle], and that's why I got out with him. And then once I got out, I saw [Mr. Gibson] running.\" Sept. 17 Tr., ECF No. 16 at 155.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Clearly, the best evidence of what was said to Mr. Gibson would have been the body-worn camera footage, had the audio been captured. As discussed, the audio would have been captured had\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the four MPD officers activated their cameras upon \"contact\" with Mr. Gibson, as\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     required\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   by an MPD General Order. Sept. 17 Tr., ECF No. 16 at 77-78 (Q: \"But you knew by not having activated [the body-worn camera] the conversation would not be recorded, correct?\" A: \"Yes\"); Def.'s Ex. 5, ECF No. 13-4 (MPD General Order 302.13). Officer Hiller and government counsel agreed that the General Order required the officers to activate their body-worn cameras once Officer Wright began speaking to Mr. Gibson. Sept. 17 Tr., ECF No. 16 at 84-85; Oct. 20 Tr., ECF No. 28 at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   However, even without the audio, the video footage is the best evidence of what happened when the MPD officers stopped Mr. Gibson. The video shows the MPD officers driving down the street in the dark for about two minutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Ex. 1-B. Suddenly, the vehicle's speed decreases and Officer Wright immediately takes out his flashlight and shines it at Mr. Gibson from the front seat.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Ex. 1-B at about 1:45-1:55. Moments later, Mr. Gibson raises both hands in the air with his palms facing the MPD officers at about head height. He holds his hands in the air for a few seconds, taking about four or five steps, and then quickly turns and runs away.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   This footage is consistent with Mr. Gibson's testimony and inconsistent with Officer Hiller's. And it suggests that the MPD officers may have directed Mr. Gibson to comply with an order, as raising one's hands is a gesture that symbolizes surrender and compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In light of the significant memory gaps in Officer Hiller's testimony, the lack of evidence in the record regarding the words Officer Wright said to Mr. Gibson, and the video footage corroborating Mr. Gibson's testimony, the Court concludes that the government has not met its burden to prove there was no show of authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Credibility Findings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In view of the Court's finding that the government has not met its burden, the Court need not make any further credibility determinations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 10 Tr., ECF No. 28 at 42-43 (government counsel conceding that the government cannot prevail if the evidence is in equipoise). However, after presiding over two days of testimony, the Court had the opportunity to observe the demeanors of both witnesses and make determinations about whether each \"testified truthfully and also whether the witness accurately observed, recalled, and described the matters about which the witness testified.\" Criminal Jury Instruction for the District of Columbia 2.200 (\"Credibility of Witnesses\")(\"[a juror] may\n   consider the demeanor and the behavior of the witness on the witness stand; the witness's manner of testifying; whether the witness impresses you as a truthful person; whether the witness impresses you as having an accurate memory and recollection; whether the witness has any motive for not telling the truth....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court credits Mr. Gibson's testimony and finds that it was more consistent with the body-worn camera footage, the best evidence available in the case. As previously noted, Mr. Gibson testified on September 20, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 20 Tr., ECF No. 17 at 43-91. His demeanor was calm-even under aggressive cross-examination-and his answers were forthcoming, consistent, and straightforward. Moreover, Mr. Gibson exhibited a high degree of recall.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 61-62 (Q: \"Would it be possible ... you don't remember every word that Officer Wright said to you that night. That'd be fair to say, right?\" A: \"No, I do\" ... Q: \"And if he had said, 'Can I see your waistband,' that's possible, isn't it?\" A: \"No, he didn't\"). Unlike Officer Hiller, Mr. Gibson did not have any significant memory lapses or revised or inconsistent answers during his testimony. Finally, it is probable and reasonable that Mr. Gibson's memory is \"really good,\" as he testified, because the arrest was a significant event in his life.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Most importantly and as discussed above, Mr. Gibson's testimony is corroborated by the body-worn camera footage. He testified that he lifted his arms in response to a direct command-\"let me see your waistband\"-so his jacket would \"raise enough that [the MPD officers] could see the waist of [his] ... jeans.\" Sept. 20 Tr., ECF No. 17 at 50-51. His gesture is a probable and reasonable reaction to an MPD officer shining a flashlight on him while ordering him to show his waistband.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Ex. 1-B at about 1:45-1:55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The government argues that the Court should not credit Mr. Gibson's testimony because he has a stake in the outcome, has a criminal history, and was on court supervision at the time of the arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 10 Tr., ECF No. 28 at 31-32. But the Court may find Mr. Gibson credible notwithstanding his interest in the outcome and his prior convictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reagan v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3584376\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/157/301/#p305\">\n    157 U.S. 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 305,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3584376\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/157/301/#p305\">\n    15 S.Ct. 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3584376\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/157/301/#p305\">\n    39 L.Ed. 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1895) (\"It is within the province of the court to call the attention of the jury to any matters which legitimately affect his testimony and his credibility. This does not imply that the court may arbitrarily single out his testimony, and denounce it as false. The fact that he is a defendant does not condemn him as unworthy of belief, but at the same time it creates an interest greater than that of any other witness, and to that extent affects the question of credibility.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Criminal Jury Instruction for the District of Columbia 2.209 (\"Defendant As Witness\")(\"[A defendant's] testimony should not be disbelieved merely because s/he is the defendant.\"). The Court has considered Mr. Gibson's stake in the outcome, his criminal history, and the fact that he readily admitted his criminal past. Sept. 20 Tr., ECF No. 17 at 44-45, 55. Indeed, Mr. Gibson was forthcoming; he\n   <em>\n    admitted\n   </em>\n   that he ran because he was scared: he knew he possessed contraband, knew he was under court supervision, and knew he would get in trouble.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. Nothing about his testimony undermines his credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Conversely, the Court does not credit Officer Hiller's testimony. As thoroughly discussed, Officer Hiller admitted that he could not remember the words Officer Wright used when speaking to Mr. Gibson. He also admitted that he could neither remember Mr. Gibson raising his arms in\n   the air, nor whether Mr. Gibson's waistband was visible. Finally, Officer Hiller could not remember if he saw Mr. Gibson flee.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Sec. IV.A.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court also observed Officer Hiller's demeanor on the stand and found his answers to be evasive and inconsistent. For example, Officer Hiller originally testified that Officer Wright asked Mr. Gibson \"if he minded showing us his waistband.\" Sept. 17 Tr., ECF No. 16 at 18. He did not originally testify that he was unsure of the exact words used. As discussed, Officer Hiller gradually changed his answer until he ultimately admitted that he could not remember the words used.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 72. Officer Hiller also originally testified that the MPD officers had not complied with the MPD General Order because they did not activate their body-worn cameras upon face-to-face contact with Mr. Gibson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77-78, 83-85. However, Officer Hiller later changed his testimony on redirect, testifying that the MPD Order may not have been invoked as the officers may not have had \"contact\" with Mr. Gibson because they were in a vehicle while Mr. Gibson was on the sidewalk, despite facing Mr. Gibson and being in close proximity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 142-45. Upon further questioning by the Court, Officer Hiller again changed his answer, admitting that he would characterize the particular encounter as a face-to-face contact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 145 (COURT: \"[I]f's it's not face to face, what is it? How would you characterize this particular moment? ....\" A: \"I guess the best way to characterize it is face to face.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Officer Hiller was also less forthcoming than Mr. Gibson, omitting important details from his narrative testimony. Most significantly, Officer Hiller failed to mention that Mr. Gibson had raised his arms in response to something Officer Wright said. This is a critical fact. Officer Hiller's omission is notable because he testified that he had watched the body-worn camera footage to prepare for his testimony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67-68. Officer Hiller's testimony was therefore also less consistent with the body-worn camera footage. Moreover, as previously discussed, Officer Hiller also failed to note that Mr. Gibson had raised his arms in his sworn Gerstein report.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Sec. IV.A.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, the Court concludes that portions of Officer Hiller's testimony were not plausible. For example, Officer Hiller testified that he and the other three MPD officers in the vehicle failed to activate their body-worn cameras while Officer Wright was speaking to Mr. Gibson because it was not possible at the time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 141. He testified that he activated his camera \"as soon as I felt it reasonably possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, Officer Hiller and Officer Mancini both activated their cameras while pursuing Mr. Gibson on foot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Exs. 1-A, 1-B. Plainly, it is not plausible that all four officers felt it was not possible to activate their cameras by pushing a button while seated in a car listening to a conversation, but\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   find it possible to do so while sprinting after a fleeing defendant. The Court need not infer that the MPD officers were\n   <em>\n    intentionally\n   </em>\n   not activating their body-worn cameras. That said, the Court is troubled that all four officers failed to adhere to MPD policy, especially because the officers knew that not activating their cameras would prevent the conversation from being recorded. Sept. 17 Tr., ECF No. 16 at 78. Indeed, the very purpose of the \"Body-Worn Camera Program,\" as set forth in General Order 302.13 is to \"promote public trust, and enhance service to the community by accurately documenting events, actions, conditions, and statements during citizen encounters ... and to help ensure officer and public safety.\" Def.'s Ex. 5, ECF No. 13-4 at 1. By failing to adhere to MPD policy and activate their body-worn\n   cameras, the MPD officers deprived the Court from reviewing the best evidence available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The government argues that the Court should credit Officer Hiller's testimony because, unlike Mr. Gibson, he does not have a stake in the outcome of the case. Oct. 10 Tr., ECF No. 28 at 27-28. As discussed, the Court has considered the fact that Mr. Gibson has a significant stake in the outcome of this motion. However, the Court cannot agree that Officer Hiller has\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   stake in the outcome.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   As government counsel stated, there is significant \"import\" to this Court not crediting Officer Hiller's testimony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76-77. For one, \"he'll be on the Louis [sic] list\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the next several years or so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77. Of course, Officer Hiller's stake is small compared to Mr. Gibson's, but the Court cannot agree that he is a completely unbiased witness and that his impartiality warrants crediting his otherwise flawed testimony. Moreover, Officer Hiller's testimony is not afforded greater weight because he is a law enforcement officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Criminal Jury Instruction for the District of Columbia 2.207 (\"Police Officer's testimony\")(\"A police officer's testimony should be evaluated by you just as any other evidence in the case. In evaluating the officer's credibility, you should use the same guidelines that you apply to the testimony of any witness. In no event should you give either greater or lesser weight to the testimony of any witness merely because s/he is a police officer.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Legal Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Having found that the government did not meet its burden, the Court must now evaluate whether ordering Mr. Gibson to \"let me see your waistband\" and \"lift your jacket\" constitutes a show of authority under the circumstances. In directing district courts to consider certain factors, the D.C. Circuit confirmed that \"the officer's use of language or tone of voice\" may indicate that \"compliance with the officer's request might be compelled\" in certain circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325148,12310423\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/625/\">\n    825 F.3d at 632-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mendenhall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185389\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/544/#p551\">\n    446 U.S. at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185389\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/544/#p551\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   )(quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finding there was a show of authority here is consistent with D.C.

The\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   court \"agree[d] with the District Court that [the defendant] was seized when Officer Oslzak touched Appellant and instructed him to 'hold on' and Appellant complied.\"\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325148,12310423\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/625/\">\n    825 F.3d at 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, the MPD officers were following Mr. Gibson in an unmarked vehicle late at night while wearing tactical vests. When the vehicle pulled up next to Mr. Gibson, Officer Wright immediately shined a bright flashlight at him, and issued two, successive directives: \"let me see your waistband\" and \"lift your jacket.\" Officer Wright's \"use of language\" indicated that \"compliance with the officer's request might be compelled.\"\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325148,12310423\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/625/\">\n    825 F.3d at 632-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, the MPD's rolling roadblock practice is so prevalent in the District of Columbia that individuals living in high-crime neighborhoods sometimes show MPD officers their waistbands \"without [MPD officers] even saying anything.\" Sept. 20 Tr., ECF No. 17 at 31 (Officer Hiller testimony);\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Patrick Madden,\n    <em>\n     D.C.'s Aggressive Confiscation of Illegal Guns Leaves Residents Feeling Targeted\n    </em>\n    , NPR, Oct. 24, 2018, available at https://www.npr.org/2018/10/24/659980871/d-c-s-aggressive-confiscation-of-illegal-guns-leaves-residents-feeling-targeted (\"Young black men say they feel targeted and harassed by these stops.

Mr. Gibson testified that he had at least two other encounters with police officers wanting to see his waistband. Sept. 20 Tr., ECF No. 17 at 52. In each of those experiences, Mr. Gibson did not feel that he had a choice as to whether to show his waistband.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 53.

The Court rejects this argument. It is clear that Mr. Gibson argued in his initial motion that he was seized \"at the point that the police officer stopped him.\" Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 6 at 2. Moreover, the Court allowed the parties to submit supplemental briefing to remedy any lack of clarity in the original motion.
