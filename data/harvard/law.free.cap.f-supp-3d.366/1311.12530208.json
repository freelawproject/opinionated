Walker, Chief United States District Judge\n   This is a case about the precariousness of public trust. Defendant Rick Scott is Florida's current governor and a candidate for the United States Senate. ECF No. 1, at \u00b6 10. On November 6, 2018, Florida voters delivered a narrow margin in which Scott led his opponent, Senator Bill Nelson, by less than one-quarter of one percent. At the time of this Order, Scott's lead was less than 13,000 out of more than 8.1 million votes cast, or approximately 0.15 percent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Florida law, a manual recount is required for election results with margins less than one-quarter of one percent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20102.166\">\n    Fla.

ECF No. 4. This Court previously denied Plaintiffs' motion inasmuch as it was for a temporary restraining order. Now, after giving Scott an opportunity to be heard, this Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Florida's Governor has a variety of powers that directly and indirectly relate to the electoral process. Scott possesses the authority to suspend public officers, including county-level canvassing board members and supervisors of elections. Fla. Const. art. IV \u00a7 7 (a). He sits as a member of the state's Elections Canvassing Commission and he has appointed the two other members of the commission, which certifies the result of Florida's elections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20102.111\">\n    Fla.

Against the symbolic backdrop of the executive residence, Scott apparently appeared in his capacity as a candidate for U.S. Senate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Ex. 1-4 (stating \"I am proud to be the next senator\").

Later, Scott appeared on national television where he declared that he was \"gonna fight this and we're gonna win.\" Pl.'s Ex. 1-5. He also vowed that he was \"gonna do everything we can\" to \"win this\" including \"looking at every legal remedy we can exercise.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20943.03\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 10, Scott \"urg[ed] every Sheriff in the State of Florida to watch for any violations during the recount process as outlined in Florida law\" from his campaign Twitter account.

First, Plaintiffs have standing. Representatives of the two organizational plaintiffs, Common Cause Florida and the League of Women Voters of Florida, persuasively testified at the evidentiary hearing that the resources of their respective organizations have been diverted. They also asserted as much in affidavits. ECF No. 1-1, at \u00b6 8 ; ECF No. 1-2, at \u00b6 7. Drain on resources has long been grounds for organizational standing.\n   <em>\n    Havens Realty Corp. v.

Though sometimes careening perilously close to a due process violation, Scott's most questionable conduct has occurred in his capacity as a candidate rather than as governor. For example, it was through his campaign that Scott \"urg[ed]\" local law enforcement to be on the lookout for potential fraud. Pl.'s Ex. 1-1 &amp; 1-2. As votes were still being counted, Scott\n   <em>\n    asked\n   </em>\n   -but did not\n   <em>\n    order\n   </em>\n   -state law enforcement to investigate two counties, citing no evidence for the investigation. Although the Department of State already had monitors in Broward County, and they had made nary a whisper about any criminal activity, ECF No. 1, at \u00b6 28, Scott merely requested law enforcement investigate possible untoward conduct. If Scott\n   <em>\n    ordered\n   </em>\n   the FDLE to investigate, then a stronger case could be made for unconstitutional intimidation-a witch hunt, to use the parlance of the era. Arguably, Scott was acting as governor when asking state law enforcement to launch an investigation. But there is a crucial and important distinction between asking and ordering.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <em>\n     Available at\n    </em>\n    https://floridaelectionwatch.gov/FederalOffices/USSenator.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    At a scheduling conference hearing, Scott's general counsel articulated Scott's intent to recuse himself from the Elections Canvassing Commission.

That so few constitutional violations are alleged against other types of public officials could be attributed to the prudence and foresight that many public officials show in recusing themselves from technically overseeing the mechanics of their own vote tabulations. Regardless of the novelty of this issue, the simple fact that constitutionally required recusals have largely been judicial does not limit\n    <em>\n     Caperton\n    </em>\n    from applying to non-judicial constitutionally required recusals. Scott's counsel agreed that recusals extend to non-judicial officials during the evidentiary hearing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Even so, Scott's request to state law enforcement must be viewed in the context of Scott's other contemporaneous public statements. \"I will not sit idly by,\" Scott said outside the Governor's mansion, \"while unethical liberals try to steal this election.\" Pl.'s Ex. 1-4. Later on television, after noting his order to state law enforcement, Scott declared \"we're gonna fight this and we're gonna win.\" Pl.'s Ex. 1-5. He also explained \"we're gonna do everything we can,\" \"we're gonna fight this and we're gonna win this.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    These are Scott's most troubling utterances. But this Court finds that they are campaign-trail bombast rather than official gubernatorial statements. They are a candidate's desire-rather than a governor's proclamations under the auspices of his public office-to \"fight\" and \"win.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    What is more, Scott has not yet moved to indicate an objective risk of bias. He has not suspended any election official. He has not ordered any investigation. He has not interfered with the recount so far. He has even recused himself from the Elections Canvassing Commission.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    All Plaintiffs have are statements of a candidate exceedingly close to a United States Senate seat.
