The media organizations assert a right of access to these warrant materials under the common law and the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

On April 9, 2018, the FBI executed searches of Cohen's residence, hotel room, office, safe deposit box, cell phones, and electronic communications pursuant to warrants authorized under Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These searches, according to the Government, represented the first public step in what was by then a months-long investigation into Cohen's business dealings and potential campaign finance violations. Following the searches, Cohen pled guilty on August 21, 2018 to five counts of tax evasion based on his failure to report over $ 4 million in taxable income to the Internal Revenue Service, one count of making false statements to financial institutions to obtain a $ 500,000 home equity line of credit, and two counts of campaign finance violations based on his involvement with hush payments to women who threatened to disclose details of their extra-marital affairs with a candidate for federal office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Subsequently, The New York Times Company, the American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., the Associated Press, Cable News Network, Inc., Daily News, L.P., Dow Jones &amp; Co., Inc., Newsday LLC, NYP Holdings, Inc., and CBS Broadcasting, Inc. (the \"Media Organizations\") filed letter applications to unseal documents relating to the April 9, 2018 searches. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 9 (\"Times Letter\") ; ECF No. 11 (\"News Organizations Letter\") ; ECF No. 19 (\"CBS Letter\").) In particular, the applications seek to unseal copies of the warrants, warrant applications, and supporting affidavits and riders in connection with these searches (the \"Materials\"). The Government opposed the applications on the basis that disclosure would jeopardize an ongoing investigation and prejudice the privacy rights of uncharged third parties. In addition to a publicly filed brief (ECF No. 14 ), the Government submitted a supplemental\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   submission articulating the factual bases for its opposition and also provided the Materials for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.

It also follows that the value of such judicial determinations would be substantially the same to those monitoring the work of federal courts.

According to the Government's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   submissions, these individuals include those cooperating with the Government, those who have provided information to the Government, and other subjects of the investigation.

These arrangements-some of which were made by publicly traded companies-involved payments for consulting on various political issues that affect the general public.

The majority of circuits have circumscribed in some fashion the applicability of the First Amendment right of access to search warrant materials in deference to ongoing investigations. For instance, the Ninth Circuit has adopted a bright-line rule that no\n   public right of access attaches to search warrants and supporting affidavits \"when an investigation is ongoing but before indictments have been returned,\" whether under the First Amendment or otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Times Mirror Co. v.

Finally, the Sixth Circuit has concluded that no First Amendment right of access applies to documents filed in search warrant proceedings \"based in part on the lack of any evidence that there is a historical tradition of such access and in part because that access would be detrimental to the search warrant application and criminal investigatory processes.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Search of Fair Finance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3515440\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/424/#p433\">\n    692 F.3d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 433 (6th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   By contrast, the Eighth Circuit is the lone federal court of appeals that has affirmatively recognized a First Amendment right of access to documents filed in support of search warrant applications after execution of the warrant, even if the investigation is ongoing. Specifically, it reasoned that those materials are \"routinely filed with the clerk of court without seal\" and that access to such documents \"is important to the public's understanding of the function and operation of the judicial process and the criminal justice system and may operate as a curb on prosecutorial or judicial misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Search Warrant for Secretarial Area Outside Office of Gunn (\"Gunn\")\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530306\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/855/569/#p573\">\n    855 F.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 573 (8th Cir. 1988).
