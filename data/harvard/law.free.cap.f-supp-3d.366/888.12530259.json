JONKER, CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendants The Law Offices of Mitchell D. Bluhm &amp; Associates, LLC, Capio Partners, LLC, and CP Medical LLC's (collectively, \"Defendants\") joint motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (ECF No. 21 ). The Court has thoroughly reviewed all matters of record and carefully considered the applicable law. For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff filed a putative FDCPA class action on January 11, 2017. About a month later, on February 14, 2017, he signed an acceptance of Defendant's Rule 68 Offer of Judgment providing him all the relief he could receive for his personal FDCPA claim. About a week after that, on February 22, 2017, he filed a copy of the Rule 68 offer and acceptance, along with a motion to certify an FDCPA class with himself as named Plaintiff class representative. By signing an acceptance of Defendant's Rule 68 offer of complete relief before certification-or even a motion for certification of a class-Plaintiff mooted this case. Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff could have rejected-or simply not responded to the offer of judgment-and potentially preserved his ability to proceed as a putative class representative. By accepting the offer of complete relief for himself at this early, pre-certification stage, Plaintiff mooted the case in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff originally owed a debt for medical services to Florida Hospital. Plaintiff received a letter from Defendant The Law Offices of Mitchell D. Bluhm &amp; Associates, LLC (\"Bluhm\") dated January 13, 2016, stating that Bluhm had been authorized to offer Plaintiff settlement to the debt for $ 60.00 (ECF No. 1-1 ). Plaintiff claims Defendants violated the FDCPA because the letter failed to inform Plaintiff that the debt was time-barred and failed to provide the disclosure of rights in an \"initial communication.\" (ECF No. 1, PageID.4-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 8, 2017, Defendants sent Plaintiff a joint offer of judgment that all parties agree provided Plaintiff with all the relief he could possibly receive for his individual claims. Plaintiff signed an acceptance of this offer on February 14, 2017,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.41, and filed a copy with the Court on February 22, 2017. That same day, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Class Certification, asking to be the class representative even though he had mooted his own claim by accepting the Rule 68 offer (ECF No. 15 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss the case as moot. The Court agrees that Plaintiff mooted the case by choosing to accept an offer of Rule 68 relief of his individual claim before certification of any class. Plaintiff did not have to accept the offer of judgment. He could have rejected it, or simply let it lapse, and potentially preserved his ability to seek class certification. But by choosing to accept full relief for himself, Plaintiff mooted this case in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In\n   <em>\n    Brunet v. City of Columbus\n   </em>\n   , the named plaintiffs filed a class action complaint raising a Section 1983 challenge to the defendant city's firefighter hiring practices.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511491\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/390/#p399\">\n    1 F.3d 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 395 (6th Cir. 1993). Prior to filing a motion to certify the class, the named plaintiffs were accepted into and entered the city's firefighting class, thus mooting their individual claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511491\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/390/#p399\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511491\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/390/#p399\">\n    at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On appeal, the Sixth Circuit dismissed the plaintiffs' claims as moot, reasoning that when the named plaintiffs entered the firefighting class, they no longer had standing to contest the city's hiring procedures at the time of certification of the Rule 23(b)(2) class.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511491\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/390/#p399\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511491\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/390/#p399\">\n    at 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, in response to the plaintiff's claim that a \"picking-off\" exception to mootness applied, the court held that, assuming such an exception existed, it would not apply because \"there was no motion for certification pending when the City made its settlement offer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511491\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/390/#p399\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Gawry v.

Mooting a putative class action simply because a Defendant offers to settle by providing the named class representatives full relief really would place the class action opportunity \"at the mercy of a defendant, even in cases where a class action would be most clearly appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Susman v. Lincoln Am. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"836762\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/587/866/#p870\">\n    587 F.2d 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 870 (7th Cir. 1978). In this Court's view, a class representative's rejection of the offer-even one providing full individual relief-is enough to sustain the case to decision on a class certification motion. In\n   <em>\n    Genesis Healthcare Corporation v. Symczyk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697066\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/66/\">\n    569 U.S. 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697066\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/66/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697066\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/66/\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), the Supreme Court hinted at this very distinction. The Court determined that a Rule 68 offer of judgment that provided a lead plaintiff's requested relief prior to the certification of an FLSA collective action class moots the entire case even if the lead plaintiff does not accept it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1529. In reaching its decision, however, the Supreme Court limited its holding to collective actions under\n   the FLSA and distinguished Rule 23 class actions as \"fundamentally different from class actions under the FLSA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). This suggests a lapsed Rule 68 offer to a class representative in a putative class action would not moot the action and preclude a ruling on the merits of class certification. But nothing in the case suggests a Plaintiff that actually accepts such a Rule 68 offer would have any standing to continue the litigation solely for the purpose of seeing if class certification was nevertheless appropriate. It's not too much to ask that the representative of a putative class have his or her own fortunes rise or fall with the putative class. Where, as here, the Plaintiff has voluntarily agreed to settle any and all of his claims before moving for class certification, this Court \"is not at liberty to create a controversy where one no longer exists.\"\n   <em>\n    Pettrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5892749\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/584/701/#p703\">\n    584 F.3d at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

The Sixth Circuit has previously addressed those exceptions, and held that it may be proper for a named plaintiff who has resolved his claims to continue representing the class when (1) the plaintiff's claims were \"involuntarily terminated\"; or (2) the named \"plaintiff[ ] retained a personal stake in the case because they would be able to shift part of the costs of litigation to the class members if they prevailed in their attempt at class certification.\"\n   <em>\n    Pettrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5892749\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/584/701/#p703\">\n    584 F.3d at 704-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither exception applies in this case. Here, prior to moving for class certification, Plaintiff voluntarily settled all of his claims against Defendants by accepting Defendants' offer of judgment; that settlement included \"an amount for reasonable attorney's fees, in satisfaction of any and all claims for same provided for by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(a)(3).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In short, Plaintiff no longer has a live case or controversy and this case is moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brunet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511491\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/390/#p399\">\n    1 F.3d at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Settlement of a plaintiff's claims moots an action.\") (citations and quotation marks omitted).
