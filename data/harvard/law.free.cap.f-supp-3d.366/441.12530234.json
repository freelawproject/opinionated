(Dkt. 1). This Court has jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Presently before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Dkt. 10; Dkt. 14), and Plaintiff's reply (Dkt. 15). For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiff's motion (Dkt. 10) is granted in part, the Commissioner's motion (Dkt. 14) is denied, and the matter is remanded to the Commissioner for further administrative proceedings consistent with this Decision and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff protectively filed his application for SSI on December 20, 2010. (Dkt. 7 at 20, 80).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his application, Plaintiff alleged disability beginning August 6, 2003, due to severe depression, anxiety, personality disorder, and \"not otherwise specified\" mental disorders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20, 130, 148, 532). Plaintiff's application was initially denied on April 26, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20, 81-84). At Plaintiff's request, a hearing was held before administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") Bruce R. Mazzarella in Buffalo, New York, on September 5, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20, 33-79). On October 15, 2012, the ALJ issued an unfavorable\n   decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-28). Plaintiff requested Appeals Council review; his request was denied on January 15, 2014, making the ALJ's determination the Commissioner's final decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, Plaintiff appealed his case to the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, and on May 12, 2015, the Court issued a Decision and Order remanding the case to the Commissioner for further administrative proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 599-617). A second administrative hearing was held before ALJ Timothy M. McGuan in Buffalo, New York, on September 22, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 532, 559-78). On January 19, 2018, the ALJ issued an unfavorable decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 529-50).

If so, the claimant is not disabled. If not, the ALJ proceeds to step two and determines whether the claimant has an impairment, or combination of impairments, that is \"severe\" within the meaning of the Act, in that it imposes significant restrictions on the claimant's ability to perform basic work activities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.920(c). If the claimant does not have a severe impairment or combination of impairments, the analysis concludes with a finding of \"not disabled.\" If the claimant does have at least one severe impairment, the ALJ continues to step three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At step three, the ALJ examines whether a claimant's impairment meets or medically equals the criteria of a listed impairment in Appendix 1 of Subpart P of Regulation No. 4 (the \"Listings\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.920(d). If the impairment meets or medically equals the criteria of a Listing and meets the durational requirement (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.909), the claimant is disabled. If not, the ALJ determines the claimant's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"), which is the ability to perform physical or\n   mental work activities on a sustained basis, notwithstanding limitations for the collective impairments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.920(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The ALJ then proceeds to step four and determines whether the claimant's RFC permits the claimant to perform the requirements of his or her past relevant work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.920(f).

At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since December 20, 2010, the application date. (Dkt. 7 at 534).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of: major depressive disorder ; anxiety disorder; personality disorder; attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); and schizoid personality disorder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of acne, hypertension, sleep apnea, fullness of supraclavicular fossa, fatty liver infiltration, migraines, and history of substance abuse were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 12.04, 12.05, 12.06, 12.08, and 12.11 in reaching his conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 535-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a full range of work at all exertional levels, with the additional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   can only occasionally interact with the public; can frequently interact with coworkers and supervisors; and can occasionally understand, remember, and carry out complex and detailed tasks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 537). At step four, the ALJ found that Plaintiff had no past relevant work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 548).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of cleaner and mail room clerk. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 549). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 549-50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Remand of this Matter for Further Proceedings is Necessary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to reverse or, in the alternative, remand this matter to the Commissioner, arguing: (1) the ALJ erred by failing to address the opinion of Sandra Jensen, Ph.D., that Plaintiff had mild-to-moderate limitations for making decisions and dealing with stress, and failed to incorporate these limitations into the RFC; (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   the ALJ erred in evaluating Plaintiff's subjective complaints; and (3) the ALJ improperly evaluated the psychometric testing conducted by Gary DiNezza, Ph.D. and Gwendoline Lander, M.A. (Dkt. 10-1 at 12-20). For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the ALJ erred by failing to explain how Plaintiff's limitations for making appropriate decisions and appropriately dealing with stress are incorporated into the RFC. This error necessitates remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Assessment of Dr. Jensen's Opinion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff underwent an examination by Dr. Jensen, a consultative examiner, on March 22, 2011. (Dkt. 7 at 314-18). At the examination, Plaintiff reported that \"[h]e feels worthlessness, concentration difficulties, social withdrawal, isolation, and self-mutilation,\" and that he \"stares a lot and obsesses about things.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 315). Dr. Jensen noted that Plaintiff's anxiety-related symptoms \"include excessive apprehension and worry.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After a mostly normal mental status examination, Dr. Jensen opined that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   is able to follow and understand simple directions and instructions, perform simple tasks independently, maintain attention and concentration, maintain a regular schedule, learn new tasks, and perform complex tasks independently within normal limits. His ability to make appropriate decisions, relate adequately with others, and appropriately deal with stress would be mildly to moderately impaired because of psychiatric issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The results of the present examination appear to be consistent with psychiatric issues that do appear to interfere with his ability to function on a daily basis to some degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 317). Dr. Jensen also found that Plaintiff \"needs a relatively high level of psychiatric intervention at this point and to be on medications that help him better. He would benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy to manage his mood and then have vocational training and rehabilitation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 318).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The ALJ gave \"great weight\" to Dr. Jensen's opinion, based on Dr. Jensen's personal examination of Plaintiff, for which objective testing was largely unremarkable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 547-48). The ALJ further found that Dr. Jensen's opinion was consistent with other evidence in the record, including Plaintiff's GAF scores of 65-69, which are consistent with only mild symptoms, as well as the recommendations of Drs. Reyes and Gokhale that Plaintiff had mild symptoms and should seek vocational counseling and be more active. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ explained that he gave Plaintiff \"some benefit of the doubt\" in limiting him to low public contact work and the occasional performance of complex tasks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff contends that, despite giving Dr. Jensen's opinion \"great weight,\" the ALJ failed to address, or incorporate into the RFC, Dr. Jensen's opinion that Plaintiff had mild-to-moderate limitations for making appropriate decisions and appropriately dealing with stress. In response, Defendant argues that the RFC accounts for Plaintiff's mild-to-moderate difficulties with decision making and dealing with stress, as the RFC includes \"several social limitations,\" and limits Plaintiff \"to only occasionally understanding, remembering, and carrying out complex and detailed tasks.\" (Dkt. 14-1 at 24). Accordingly, the issue is whether the RFC, which limits Plaintiff to occasional interaction with the public, frequent interaction with coworkers and supervisors, and occasional understanding, remembering, and carrying out of complex and detailed tasks, accounts\n   for his mild-to-moderate limitations in decision-making and dealing with stress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"Because stress is highly individualized, mentally impaired individuals may have difficulty meeting the requirements of even so-called low-stress jobs, and the Commissioner must therefore make specific findings about the nature of a claimant's stress, the circumstances that trigger it, and how those factors affect his [or her] ability to work.\"\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

LEXIS 103352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *39-40 (W.D.N.Y. Aug. 5, 2016) (the RFC, which \"explicitly required positions involving unskilled work that did not require any contact with coworkers or the public and only limited contact with supervisors\" adequately accounted for any limitations dealing with stress). The RFC formulated by the ALJ in this case is not so generous. The RFC does not limit Plaintiff to simple work or routine tasks; rather, the RFC requires Plaintiff to occasionally understand, remember, and carry out complex and detailed tasks. Further, while the RFC limits Plaintiff to occasional interaction with the public, it requires him to \"frequently\" interact with co-workers and supervisors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   While the RFC, which contains some social limitations, appears to account for Dr. Jensen's opinion that Plaintiff has mild-to-moderate difficulty relating adequately with others, the Court concludes\n   that the RFC does not account for Plaintiff's decision-making or stress-related limitations as they are defined by Dr. Jensen. \"It is plainly improper for an ALJ to cherry-pick evidence that supports a finding of not-disabled while ignoring other evidence favorable to the disability claimant.\"\n   <em>\n    Starzynski v.

LEXIS 164444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *8 (W.D.N.Y. Nov. 29, 2016). Despite giving \"great weight\" to Dr. Jensen's opinion, and thereby finding her assessment regarding Plaintiff's limitations for handling stress and making decisions credible, the ALJ failed to explain how these limitations are incorporated into the RFC. For example, although Dr. Jensen's report noted that Plaintiff has anxiety-related symptoms and \"obsesses about things,\" the RFC requires Plaintiff to occasionally understand, remember, and carry out complex and detailed tasks. It is unclear to the Court how limiting Plaintiff to the occasional performance of complex tasks addresses Plaintiff's stress-related issues, and the written determination does not contain any explanation on this point. Further, the RFC includes no limitations addressing Plaintiff's difficulty making appropriate decisions. In other words, \"[w]hile it may be reasonable for an ALJ to account for a stress-based limitation by including, in the claimant's RFC, restrictions to simple work, with little interaction with others ... [i]t is not the function of this Court to ... supply its own rationale where the ALJ's decision is lacking or unclear.\"\n   <em>\n    Stellmaszyk v.

The ALJ found that Plaintiff could perform the jobs of cleaner and mail room clerk. (Dkt. 7 at 549). However, as explained above, \"[b]ecause stress is highly individualized, mentally impaired individuals may have difficulty meeting the requirements of even so-called low-stress jobs, and the Commissioner must therefore make specific findings about the nature of a claimant's stress, the circumstances that trigger it, and how those factors affect his [or her] ability to work.\"\n   <em>\n    Collins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205529424\">\n    2016 WL 5529424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20135900\">\n    2016 U.S. Dist.
