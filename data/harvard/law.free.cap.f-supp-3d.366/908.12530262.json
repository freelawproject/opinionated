JONKER, CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case involves sexual misconduct by a teacher at a public high school in Grand Rapids, Michigan. There is no question that the teacher's behavior was reprehensible-in fact, criminal-and that the students were victims in this experience. The teacher was fired and is now serving time in prison. The question in this case is whether the school district and its senior\n   administrators are civilly accountable for the teacher's criminal conduct and their response to it. Based on the record developed in this case, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not created a genuine issue of material fact, and that Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, Defendants' motions for summary judgment are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Jamila Williams was a math teacher at University Preparatory (\"U-Prep\"), a public high school in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Jamila had been a highly regarded teacher at U-Prep for five years going into the 2012-2013 school year. Plaintiffs J.S., T.B., and U.J. were in ninth grade at that time. Plaintiffs Deprece Irvin and Kyree Robertson were in eleventh grade. All of these students had a class or home room with Jamila. At the time, Daniel Williams was the principal and Kenyatta Hill the vice-principal at U-Prep. Larry Johnson was the assistant superintendent and director for public safety and security for Grand Rapids Public Schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Sexual Abuse and Harassment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jamila began text messaging with several of the Plaintiffs on sexually suggestive topics in January 2013. Things intensified over spring break, when Jamila had a sexual encounter with U.J. at his house. In the spring of 2013, Jamila also had a sexual encounter with J.S. in the alley behind his house and once while driving him to a school internship. During that same time, Jamila had a sexual encounter with Deprece at his house. There is no record basis suggesting that any Defendants knew of these activities as they were occurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As spring progressed, sexual activity moved from off-site locations to school itself. Later that spring, Jamila reportedly had sex with U.J. in her classroom at school several times over a period of weeks. Jamila had suggestive communications with the Plaintiffs at school during class hours and after-school tutoring during the spring. The parties agree that Jamila and her victims were all trying to keep the illicit relationships secret, with the only real discussion occurring among the Plaintiffs. There is no record basis suggesting any Defendant knew about these things as they occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Rumors Regarding the Misconduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The first record evidence of information reaching any Defendant is an incident report dated May 30, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the report, a teacher told Hill on May 27, 2013, that a parent had approached the teacher at school saying that children were \"discussing inappropriate texts being sent between [Jamila] and several students.\" (ECF No. 191, PageID.4058). The incident report identifies J.S. as the victim and T.B., U.J., Kyree, and Deprece as \"Others involved.\" Hill reported this to Sgt. James Turner of the Grand Rapids Public School Department of Public Safety on the date of the report (ECF No. 33 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On Friday, May 31, most of the students at U-Prep went on a trip to the zoo. While on this trip, some students heard rumors about Jamila engaging in inappropriate behavior with students. Reuben Riley, a Youth Advocate employed at U-Prep, heard from two students that J.S. and U.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   were having sex with Jamila (ECF No. 18, PageID.3268-3269). Riley possibly broached the topic with another Youth Advocate, but neither of them reported it to anyone else at the time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On Sunday, June 2, 2013, J.S. told his sister that he was \"messing around\" with Jamila after his sister found text messages between J.S. and Jamila on J.S.'s phone. J.S.'s sister told Kyree's sister, who, in turn, told her mother, Denise Cross.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Termination of Jamila's Employment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On Monday, June 3, Denise Cross confronted Jamila after her first hour class at school. According to Jamila, after Cross left, she went to Hill's office and told Hill that a parent had confronted her about \"inappropriate texting\" with students and \"messing around\" with them (ECF No. 163-11, PageID.3208). Hill followed up with Sergeant Turner from the Grand Rapids Police Department and also advised Williams of unfolding events (ECF No. 152, PageID.2291; ECF No. 191, PageID.4060; ECF No. 152-1, PageID.2321). Turner called Johnson and relayed the information that Hill had given him (ECF No. 163-14, PageID.3240-3241).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At about the same time, another teacher, Jason Stachura, heard rumors of inappropriate conduct between Jamila and students. (ECF No. 152-1. PageID.2317). After relaying these rumors to Hill, Stachura prepared a \"Report of Actual Suspected Child Abuse or Neglect\" and faxed it to the Department of Human Services at 1:14 P.M. (ECF No. 163-15, PageID. 3252; ECF No. 34 ). Child Protective Services referred the report to the GRPD after receiving it (ECF No. 163-21, PageID.3284). The GRPD assigned the case to Detective Mark Miller, who called Johnson for more details.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3285. In quick succession, the GRPD opened a criminal investigation that led to Jamila's suspension that same day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   That afternoon, one of the Plaintiffs' mothers, Shaunika Williams, informed Williams that her son was involved with Jamila.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Upon hearing the allegations, Williams called Johnson. Johnson immediately arranged for a meeting between the Plaintiffs and Detective Mark Miller at the GRPD building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.2332, 2336. At around 4 P.M., Williams called Jamila and directed her to leave the school premises and not return or communicate with any of the students.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.2334. It is undisputed by the parties that Jamila did not communicate in any manner with the Plaintiffs or any other students after June 3, 2013. Superintendent Neal prepared and sent a letter to the parents of students at U-Prep encouraging anyone with information concerning the incidents to contact the GRPD or the Grand Rapids Public Safety Department (ECF No. 152-2, PageID.2393).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Following the police investigation, criminal charges were filed against Jamila and the school district suspended her. Jamila is now serving an eight to fifteen-year sentence with the Michigan Department of Corrections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Follow-Up\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Williams and Hill provided accommodations to U.J., J.S., and Kyree to complete their final examinations, and some of the victims were also given extra credit to\n   bring their grades up (ECF No. 152-2, PageID.2342-2347; ECF No. 191, PageID.4061). Williams scheduled a meeting with Deprece, who already had a poor academic record covering several years, to discuss a plan for Deprece to graduate and continue at U-Prep (ECF No.152-7, PageID.2511). Kyree attended summer school at U-Prep that summer, but enrolled at a different school in the fall. Deprece, U.J., and J.S. all ended up enrolling in different schools as well. Deprece did not qualify to return to U-Prep because of his grades. The other victims chose to go to other schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    V. The Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On November 11, 2014, Plaintiffs filed a complaint with this Court, alleging five counts against Defendants (ECF No. 1 ). Count I alleged violation of Title IX (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ) as to Defendant Grand Rapids Public Schools District (GRPS). Count II alleged violation of Title IX - Retaliation as to Defendant GRPS. Count III claimed Defendants GRPS, Weatherall-Neal, Williams, Johnson, and Hill violated Section 1983 (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Count IV alleged\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability under Section 1983 against GRPS. Count V claimed violation of the Michigan Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act ( MCLA \u00a7 37.2102(1) ) by GRPS. Count V was later dismissed because the Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over that claim (ECF No. 36 ). Additionally, the Court dismissed Plaintiffs' individual capacity claim against Weatherall-Neal (ECF No. 45 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On January 29, 2016, Defendants moved for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' individual capacity claims under Section 1983 (ECF No. 128 ; 129). On February 27, 2016, Defendants moved for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' Title IX and\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability claims (ECF No. 151 ; 152). Plaintiffs opposed Defendants' motions. This Court heard oral argument on Defendants' motions on July 14, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where the record evidence presents no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Plaintiffs claim that Defendants were deliberately indifferent for three reasons. First, Plaintiffs claim that Hill's delayed response to reports of Jamila's sexual abuse establishes deliberate indifference (ECF No. 191, PageID.4060). Second, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants' alleged failure to support, accommodate, or otherwise remedy the harm done by Jamila's sexual abuse constitutes deliberate indifference.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p645\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID.4061. Third, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' failure to comply with Title IX regulations, specifically their lack of conducting an independent investigation, establishes deliberate indifference.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p645\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID.4062-4064.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    1. Timing of Response\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants' response to the unfolding situation cannot be characterized as delayed in any meaningful way, much less deliberately indifferent. Defendants arguably received initial reports of inappropriate conduct in the morning of May 30. This was the earliest possible date of any actual knowledge of inappropriate conduct. It was not until the parental confrontation of June 3 that any Defendant heard of the more serious sexual misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants promptly reacted. On the morning of June 3, Defendants immediately began investigating the matter, contacted the GRPD by noon, and removed Jamila by 4 P.M. that same day. Therefore, Defendants' response occurred on the very day Defendants learned of the most serious allegations, and only two school days after the earliest possible actual notice of any inappropriate activity if the jury credits the May 30 date on the report. As such, Defendants acted promptly and responsibly to prevent further abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pahssen v. Merrill Comm. Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049023\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/356/#p364\">\n    668 F.3d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 364 (6th Cir. 2012) (finding no deliberate indifference where district's response to the incident was \"prompt [and] reasonable\"). The cases cited by Plaintiffs are not to the contrary, as those cases discuss delays of months and weeks, not days or hours.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Rutherford Cnty. Bd. of Educ.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:13-cv-00328,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204080163\">\n    2014 WL 4080163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13-*14 (M.D. Tenn. 2014) (holding deliberate indifference established where \"school officials dragged their feet for months in response to potentially serious allegations of sexual harassment\");\n   <em>\n    Dawn v.

Pa. 2008) (finding deliberate indifference established where school district failed to investigate until four weeks after a complaint was filed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Indeed, on the present record, it is hard to envision how the department could have acted more quickly. Any school administrator faced with allegations of abuse needs to gather information quickly and consider the level of risk to the students, the teacher's rights as an employee, and the need to permit criminal and CPS investigation along with internal school investigation. In this case, the record establishes as a matter of law that the Defendants acted promptly and without deliberate indifference to what they learned. Moreover, the undisputed record further demonstrates that on the rare other occasions in which the GRPS encountered similar allegations, it and its responsible administrators acted with similar dispatch to remove any potential ongoing threat to students (ECF No. 192, PageID.4457-4461). No reasonable fact-finder could conclude on this record\n   that the Defendants were deliberately indifferent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pahssen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049023\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/356/#p364\">\n    668 F.3d at 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"prompt [and] reasonable\" response by district precluded a finding of deliberate indifference).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    2. Remedial Actions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants' remedial actions likewise fail to establish deliberate indifference. It is undisputed that subsequent to the removal of Jamila from school grounds, Superintendent Neal prepared and sent a letter to the parents of students at U-Prep encouraging anyone with information concerning the incidents to contact the GRPD or the Grand Rapids Public Safety Department (ECF No. 152-2, PageID.2393). Williams testified that he was never contacted by any parents concerning the incident after that, and there is no evidence to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Additionally, it is undisputed that Defendants provided accommodations to several of the Plaintiffs, including U.J., J.S., and Kyree to complete their final examinations, and some Plaintiffs were given extra credit to bring their grades up (ECF No. 152-2, PageID.2342-2347; ECF No. 191, PageID.4061). Kyree Robertson attended summer school at U-Prep (ECF No. 152-7, PageID.2510). Williams scheduled a meeting with Deprece, who already had a poor academic record covering several years, to discuss a plan for Deprece to graduate and continue at U-Prep (ECF No.152-7, PageID.2511).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiffs' allegations that Defendants should have interviewed the Plaintiffs and accommodated their needs in other ways (ECF No. 191, PageID.4061) are insufficient to establish deliberate indifference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rost v. ex. rel.

Plaintiffs point to three prior incidents to establish that GRPS tacitly approved and acquiesced to a pattern of sexual abuse by school employees (ECF No. 192, PageID.4471). During the 2006-2007 school year, Ronald Taylor, a teacher at GRPS, was convicted of sexual misconduct involving several minor male students.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757966\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/469/479/#p490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID.4457. In 2009, Kenneth Hoskins, a Youth Advocate at GRPS, was criminally charged with having sexual relations with a minor at school.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757966\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/469/479/#p490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID.4458. Finally, during the 2012-2013 school year, Kevin Dengel, a parapro at GRPS Elementary School, was accused and later criminally prosecuted for sexual abuse and harassment of a minor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757966\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/469/479/#p490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID.4460-4461.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The evidence Plaintiffs identify, however, actually shows that GRPS did not provide tacit approval or acquiescence in any way to sexual abuse and harassment. As Plaintiffs themselves acknowledge,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757966\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/469/479/#p490\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID.4457-4461, GRPS immediately involved the police department and terminated\n   the perpetrators' employment in each of the separate incidents. As such, the evidence does not establish that there was a clear and persistent failure by the district to respond to complaints about sexual abuse or harassment. To the contrary, the evidence establishes that GRPS dealt effectively and efficiently with problems of sexual abuse and harassment every time they occurred by confirming the reports, immediately notifying law enforcement, and promptly removing the offending staff member. These measures establish that GRPS was not deliberately indifferent to or tacitly approving of the misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Claiborne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1002\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/103/495/#p505\">\n    103 F.3d at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Plaintiffs fail to establish a \"custom of inaction\" for purposes of their \u00a7 1983 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    2. Failure to Train\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that GRPS's failure to train its employees to protect students from the criminal sexual assaults of co-employees, and its administrators on how to conduct an after-the-fact investigation amounts to an official policy of inaction (ECF No. 192, PageID.4464-4477). \"[A] systematic failure to train employees amounts to a custom or policy for which the employer may be subject to \u00a7 1983 liability only if such failure amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the employees come into contact.\"\n   <em>\n    Savoie v.

Nor can they, as Plaintiffs' own evidence establishes that GRPS provided training on exactly the type of misconduct at issue here (ECF No. 192, PageID.4456). Teachers and administrators at U-Prep are required to complete twelve training modules at the time they are hired and additional modules periodically thereafter. (ECF No. 192, PageID.4456-4457). One of these training modules addresses \"Ethics &amp; Boundaries for School Employees.\" (ECF No. 192-10 ). It provides several examples of \"boundary violations\" that could constitute sexual grooming and states that \"staff members should monitor one another and, when a colleague has crossed a professional boundary, be willing to speak out.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4117635\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/726/868/#p886\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID.4549-4553. \"[S]taff members should also question what they are observing or hearing and report behavior or comments that make a student uncomfortable and/or could lead to an inappropriate boundary violation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4117635\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/726/868/#p886\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID.4554. The training module emphasizes that \"[s]taff members should not work consistently with an individual student before and after school except with the knowledge of the administration and with the classroom door open.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4117635\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/726/868/#p886\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID.4560. A second module, entitled \"Sexual Harassment,\" lays out the complaint procedure, providing that \"[u]pon the filing of a complaint, the grievance office shall conduct a prompt and complete investigation.\" (ECF No. 192-11 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Instead, Plaintiffs' claim is based on the alleged ineffectiveness of GRPS's training (ECF No. 192, PageID.4464). Plaintiffs, however, are unable to establish that GRPS ignored a history of abuse and that it was on actual or constructive notice that its training was deficient. To the contrary, every time an allegation of sexual abuse or harassment occurred, GRPS's administrators and personnel promptly responded to the allegations, notified law enforcement officials, and terminated the offending employees. It is undisputed that no unconstitutional conduct continued by the offenders subsequent to GRPS's response in each of the prior instances of misconduct. Thus, Plaintiffs fail to establish that GRPS's training was deficient and that the alleged deficiency of GRPS's training led to the misconduct at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Moreover, it is unlikely that any additional training would have prevented Jamila's misconduct. Additional training for other teachers and staff would not have prevented the misconduct because it is undisputed that GRPS teachers and staff received training on exactly the type of conduct at issue here, that Jamila taught at U-Prep for several years without a single complaint or reported incident, and that once reports surfaced, they were addressed immediately. Nor would more training for Jamila herself have prevented the misconduct. Jamila testified multiple times that she knew that her conduct was risky and wrong and that it had to be reported (ECF No. 154-4, PageID.2604, 2606, 2608). Yet, Jamila deliberately engaged in criminal conduct and actively attempted to conceal the conduct. Thus, Plaintiffs have failed to establish that additional training would have prevented Jamila's misconduct and that a lack of training caused Plaintiffs' injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thorpe v. Breathitt Cnty. Bd. of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4209840\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/8/932/#p942\">\n    8 F.Supp.3d 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 942 (E.D.

In the Court's view, the three or four day difference is not material on this record, but the Court will assume the May 30 date is correct to ensure a view of the facts most favorable to Plaintiffs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Plaintiffs complain that Jamila was allowed to talk with several of the students while the investigation was ongoing (ECF No. 163, PageID.3050). Plaintiffs do not dispute, however, that any contact that Jamila had with the Plaintiffs after the Defendants received reports of misconduct occurred that same day, out in the open, and did not involve any sexual misconduct.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4209840\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/8/932/#p942\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Defendants dispute the date of the incident report, claiming that \"May 30, 2013\" is a typo and that the parental complaint instead occurred on June 3, 2013 (ECF No. 191, PageID.4058).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Plaintiff's general allegation that the risk of sexual abuse should have been \"obvious\" to Williams, Johnson, and Hill and that \"it was their job to know\" of the risk, or that teachers and staff other than defendants knew of other incidents that could give rise to Title IX liability fails as a matter of law to show that Defendants had actual notice.
