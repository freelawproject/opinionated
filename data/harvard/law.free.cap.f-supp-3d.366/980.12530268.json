Additionally, Plaintiff Sarah Lee has sought leave to amend her complaint. Doc. 48. The motion is GRANTED, and the Court will consider the motions to dismiss in light of the amended complaint. Plaintiff Sarah Lee has not opposed the dismissal of Zimpher, Schmidt, Lumpe, and the Avon Lake City School District. Those motions (Docs. 35, 36), therefore, are GRANTED. Accordingly, the Court now addresses the sole remaining motion, NEA's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Through this opinion, the Court joins an ever-growing number of courts that have found that causes of action seeking to enjoin collection of fair-share fees and recoup damages based on prior collection of those fees must be dismissed in light of\n   <em>\n    Janus v.

As detailed above, cases survived post-\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   because courts concluded that specific, state statutes had not been the subject of the decision by the Court in\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   . The same cannot be said here.\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   , as detailed above, used broad language that immediately made it unconstitutional for unions to extract agency fees from nonconsenting employees. There is no dispute that NEA immediately ceased collecting such fees. Accordingly, any request for injunctive relief is MOOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In a similar fashion, Lee amended her complaint in the hope of creating a factual issue surrounding NEA's good faith defense. Lee contends that this Court cannot dismiss the matter because NEA must demonstrate factually that it complied with prior Supreme Court precedent and that its decisionmakers\n   <em>\n    subjectively\n   </em>\n   believed that the precedent was correct. The Court finds no merit in such a contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   First, Lee's assertion regarding the subjective belief of members of NEA cannot withstand scrutiny. The entity acts solely through its actions. Those actions included collecting fees under\n   <em>\n    Abood v. Detroit Board of Education,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n    431 U.S. 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n    52 L.Ed.2d 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977), a Supreme Court decision that expressly permitted such actions. Even if an employee strongly believed that\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided, it would not make reliance on that decision any less good-faith\n   reliance. Rather, regardless of personal opinions, individuals are entitled to rely upon binding United States Supreme Court precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, it is unclear what facts Lee believes need to be proven to establish compliance with\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   and its progeny. It appears that Lee is suggesting that if NEA was routinely violating\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, such a finding would undermine any good faith defense. However, even in the now-amended complaint, Lee has not even hinted at any such violation. Moreover, given the current litigation, it is difficult to conceive of a circumstance where the NEA would have disregarded\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   in such a blatant manner as to destroy a good faith defense and yet still avoided litigation. As such, the Court declines to open discovery into the matter. The facts are undisputed that NEA collected fees under the binding precedent of\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   and the subsequent state statutes it spawned. As a matter of law, therefore, those collections efforts were done in good faith that they did not violate the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Based upon the above, the complaint is hereby DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
