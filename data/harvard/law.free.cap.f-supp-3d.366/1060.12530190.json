She was removed from a permanent post at a G4S client's business in early 2018 after the client requested her removal for a disciplinary reason. She then brought this action without the help of a lawyer, asserting several claims against G4S employees and G4S itself. After the Court dismissed some of those claims, remaining are Terry's claims for sex discrimination, retaliation, and defamation, all running against G4S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Documents # 18 and # 28.

In early 2017, she began a permanent G4S security post at Manheim, a car auction company in Little Rock. G4S clients such as Manheim can request the removal of a security guard from the post at the client's site. In December 2017, Manheim's Security Manager received information that Terry had been rude and unhelpful to a transport driver at Manheim and then left her guard post uncovered. The Security Manager called the transport driver. He confirmed what had occurred. He then requested that Terry be removed, and G4S removed her from the Manheim post.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   G4S placed Terry on two days of administrative leave pending an investigation. Based on this investigation G4S concluded that Terry had not left her post, but it determined that she had been rude and unhelpful to the driver during the interaction. She was informed she would not be returning to the Manheim post. G4S next offered Terry a special events position. She accepted. Unlike her post at Manheim, however, the special events position does not provide a stable income because special events occur unpredictably. To this date G4S has not offered Terry another permanent position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Terry contends that G4S removed her from the Manheim post because of her sex in violation of Title VII. She also alleges that G4S removed her in retaliation for\n   complaining about sex discrimination, and furthermore that G4S has refused to consider her for a permanent full-time position in retaliation for filing an EEOC charge and this lawsuit. Finally, Terry asserts a defamation claim under Arkansas law based on a G4S employee allegedly publicly accusing her of stealing, which was false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Title VII prohibits discrimination because of sex. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1).

Document # 36-1 at 4-5. Parker commented to Terry in November 2017 that the \"male guards\" were \"doing such a good job.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. He told her that she was not scanning correctly when she made her security rounds, and before G4S lost its contract with Manheim, he would \"get rid of the problem guard.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   All these instances are why Terry felt Parker \"has a problem with [her] because of [her] gender.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The record reveals that in late December 2017 Terry had an incident with a Manheim driver. As site supervisor Parker handled minor disciplinary issues. Document # 36-3 at 2. Parker emailed Manheim's\n   Security Manager, Cory Knapp, several days after the incident. Document # 36-1 at 54.

It is true that months before Terry's removal Parker had made some negative comments about females in general and some positive comments about males. But Parker was not a decisionmaker in Terry's removal from her post, and stray remarks by a nondecisionmaker are not direct evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648351\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/643/1031/#p1042\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Even if Parker's email to Knapp was intended to cause Terry's removal, there is no evidence that sending the email was \"motivated by a discriminatory bias.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648351\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/643/1031/#p1042\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"if a non-decisionmaker performs an act motivated by a discriminatory bias that is intended to cause, and that does proximately cause, an adverse employment action, then the employer has cat's paw liability\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Staub v.

This is because Terry has not connected Parker's email to Knapp with any discriminatory bias. The parties agree that a conversation occurred between Terry and the transport driver at issue on the date at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Parker's email reflects communication to Manheim regarding this incident, including the driver's own account of it. Knapp called the driver and independently confirmed what had occurred before he made the decision to request Terry's removal. If Parker did harbor some discriminatory bias toward Terry, the record contains no evidence that that bias motivated his email relating a driver's complaint to Knapp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To the extent that Parker allegedly previously said in November he would \"get rid of the problem guard,\" nothing in the record shows the comment was related to Terry's sex. Document # 36-1 at 5. Terry testified that Parker made the comment in the context of his belief that she was not scanning in correctly when she made her security rounds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5990446,12457262\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/1186/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Turning next to the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   framework: Terry meets the first and third elements of a prima facie case because she is female and because she was transferred from a permanent post to an as-needed post involving a reduction in pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

This argument is belied by the undisputed fact that G4S requested Terry stay on as a G4S security guard for special events. Drawing reasonable inferences from these facts in\n   Terry's favor, a jury could find that she remained qualified for a security guard position with G4S even after the incident with the Manheim driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The inquiry thus centers on whether the record contains sufficient evidence to lead to an inference of discrimination based on Terry's sex. As explained above, nothing shows that Parker's alleged discriminatory bias motivated Terry's removal from her post. Rather, G4S followed Knapp's directive to remove Terry after Knapp independently confirmed the account in Parker's email. And Willis, G4S's branch manager, believed the claims that Terry was rude and unhelpful based on his conversation with Terry after the incident, his previous interactions with her, and his awareness that multiple previous clients had requested her removal from job sites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCullough v.

Moreover, one of the two male guards was treated the same as Terry, as he was removed from his post at Manheim while Terry still worked there. Document # 36-1 at 25. This evidence would not allow a reasonable jury to find an inference of sex discrimination. Terry thus has not put forth sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Even if Terry had made a prima facie case, she has not shown that G4S's proffered legitimate nondiscriminatory reason was pretextual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bearden v.

G4S rightly points out that the record contains no evidence that Terry's removal from the Manheim post was caused by any protected activity. She filed an EEOC charge and this lawsuit\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   she was removed, and so those protected activities could not have caused her previous removal. Taking as true that Terry spoke to the human resources manager in September about sexist comments by Parker, there is no evidence that the human resources manager reported Terry's allegations to any decisionmakers. Even if she had, a jury could not find Terry's removal more than three months later would not have occurred absent that conversation.\n   <em>\n    Cheshewalla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8947771\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/415/847/#p851\">\n    415 F.3d at 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (timing alone rarely enough).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Assuming, without deciding, that a December letter from Terry's lawyer to G4S was a protected activity under Title VII,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the intervening incident between Terry and the Manheim driver erodes any causal connection between the letter and her removal.\n   <em>\n    Lenzen v.

She alleges that G4S has had unarmed posts available and that the company purposely has not considered her for a permanent post in retaliation. Further, Terry says she has reached out to the company about online job postings, all to no avail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Document # 19 at 3. She has produced evidence confirming all this - screen shots from job websites showing G4S had openings for an unarmed guard, and screen shots of text messages with a G4S supervisor in which she told him she had seen unarmed G4S posts online, asked why she had not gotten calls about them, and asked for work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Document # 19 at 6-11; Document # 43 at 21-22.

Document # 36-1 at 35. In that email, Parker wrote that the week before, when he arrived to work one morning, Terry told him someone had spilled fuel in the bay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56. He confirmed fuel was on the floor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, he stated in the email,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   if the fuel had been spilled during the time that Manheim employees were still at work or even on the shift that was before hers it would have evaporated before I got to work at 0600. The fuel was still wet and had not yet evaporated so the smell was still fresh. This is the same person that on almost every shift the fuel consumption in the security vehicle seems to go up dramatically. Sherry says that there has been someone bothering the things at her desk. So I'm going to be aware of the times and days that Sherry's is in disarray from this point on....

However, there is no evidence the email was published or that it caused actual harm to Terry's reputation. Terry opined in her deposition that \"Tracy [Parker] left this email up ... because if he printed these emails off and left them in the security desk, he left them there with the intent of somebody seeing them to defame my character.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She believes Parker left the emails up, but admitted, however, that she does not have any proof to support her belief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34. There is thus no evidence that Parker communicated the contents of this email to anyone other than the recipient of the email, a G4S supervisor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roeben v.
