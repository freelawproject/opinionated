And unfortunately, it is not the first time this dysfunction has frustrated the administrative review process in this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 18, 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") published the final version of its regulations with the stated intent \"to reduce waste of natural gas from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore Federal and Indian (other than Osage Tribe) leases.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation: Final Rule.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2083%2C008\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. 83,008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Waste Prevention Rule\"). Petitioners promptly raised various challenges to the Waste Prevention Rule in these consolidated cases. On January 16, 2017, the day before the Rule became effective, this Court denied Petitioners' request for preliminary injunctive relief, in part because significant portions of the Rule would not become effective until January 17, 2018 (\"phase-in provisions\"). Thereafter, the Court set an expedited briefing schedule so that the merits of Petitioners' challenges could be addressed prior to the phase-in provisions of the Rule becoming effective. Regrettably, this approach has been derailed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Uncertainty in the Waste Prevention Rule's fate was first created by Congress. On February 3, 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a Congressional Review Act resolution to disapprove the Waste Prevention Rule, which would have voided the Rule and barred any other \"substantially similar\" rule in the future. H.R.J. Res. 36, 115th Cong. (2017-2018). The U.S. Senate defeated this Congressional Review Act resolution on May 10, 2017. Then on June 15, 2017, in compliance with a directive from the President to review the Rule for consistency with the policies of the new administration,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the BLM announced it was postponing the January 17, 2018 compliance dates for the phase-in provisions of the Rule,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   pending judicial review in this Court, pursuant to its authority under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20705\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C430\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 27,430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (June 15, 2017) (\"Postponement Notice\"). In doing so, the BLM considered \"the substantial cost that complying with these requirements poses to operators ..., and the uncertain future these requirements face in light of the pending litigation and administrative review of the Rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C430\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C430\">\n    at 27,431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The BLM further stated its intention to conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking to suspend or extend the compliance dates of those sections affected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C430\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Rule's provisions with compliance dates that had already passed were unaffected by the Postponement Notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Five days later, and in light of BLM's plan to propose revision or rescission of the Rule, the Federal Respondents filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion to Extend the Briefing Deadlines\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 129 ) which this Court granted, making the opening merits briefs due October 2, 2017 and response briefs due November 6, 2017 (ECF No. 133 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In granting the extension, this Court determined: \"To move forward on the present schedule would be inefficient and a waste of both the judiciary's and the parties' resources in light of the shifting sands surrounding the Rule and certain of its provisions, making it impossible to set a foundation upon which the Court can base its review under the Administrative Procedures Act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C430\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C430\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Then on July 5th and 10th, 2017, several of the Intervenor-Respondents in this case, along with the elected Attorney Generals from the States of California and New Mexico, challenged the BLM's Postponement Notice in a Federal District Court in the Northern District of California.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    California and New Mexico, et al. v. BLM\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:17-CV-03804-EDL (N.D. Cal.);\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club, et al. v. Zinke\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:17-CV-03885-EDL (N.D. Cal.). On October 4, 2017, the Northern District of California Court held unlawful and vacated the Postponement Notice, thereby reinstating the (by then) three-and-one-half-month away compliance dates for the phase-in provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Meanwhile, back in this Court, Petitioners and Intervenor-Petitioners timely filed their opening briefs. On October 20, 2017, the Federal Respondents filed a second\n   <em>\n    Motion for an Extension of the Merits Briefing Deadlines\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 155 ), requesting the Court again extend the briefing deadlines then in place by thirty-seven (37) days, allowing time for the BLM to complete a rule (\"Suspension Rule\") which will suspend or delay the majority of the provisions of the Waste Prevention Rule, including the portions of the Rule that would otherwise become effective on January 17, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, BLM had also begun working on a rule to revise or rescind the Waste Prevention Rule (\"Revision Rule\"). The Court granted the second extension, again stressing the inefficient use and likely waste of resources by proceeding to address the merits of challenges to a rule when the agency has begun the process for suspending and revising that same rule. (ECF No. 158.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 8, 2017, the BLM published the final \"Suspension Rule,\" temporarily suspending or delaying certain requirements of the Waste Prevention Rule that are at the heart of this litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2058%2C050\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 58,050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The 2017 final delay rule does not substantively change the 2016 final rule, but simply postpones implementation of the compliance requirements for certain provisions of the 2016 final rule for 1 year.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2058%2C050\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"The BLM has concerns regarding the statutory authority, cost, complexity, feasibility, and other implications of the 2016 final rule, and therefore intends to avoid imposing likely considerable and immediate compliance costs on operators for requirements that may be rescinded or significantly revised in the near future.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2058%2C050\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Suspension Rule's stated effective date was January 8, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Federal Respondents, together with the Industry Petitioners and Petitioner States of Wyoming and Montana, then moved the Court to stay these cases on the basis that it would not be a wise use of the parties' or the Court's resources to adjudicate the merits in light of the Suspension Rule and the fact that the BLM is in the process of issuing a proposed Revision Rule. Intervenor-Petitioner States of North Dakota and Texas opposed a stay, arguing that the limited number of provisions that will remain in effect during the suspension period continue to harm those states by infringing upon the States' sovereignty, unlawfully expanding BLM's jurisdiction to state and private interests, and intruding upon the States' congressionally-granted authority to regulate air quality within their borders. Intervenor-Respondents chose to challenge the Suspension Rule by again filing separate actions in the Northern District of California.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State of California et al. v. BLM et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:17-CV-07186-WHO (N.D. Cal. Dec. 19, 2017);\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club et al. v. Zinke et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:17-CV-07187-MMC (N.D. Cal. Dec. 19, 2017). Requests to transfer the venue of those cases to this Court were denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 29, 2017, given the on-going rulemaking process that would materially impact the merits of the present challenges to the Waste Prevention Rule and the prudential ripeness concerns relating to the issues before this Court, the\n   requested stay was granted pending finalization of revisions to the Rule, or at least while the Suspension Rule was in effect. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 189.) For a third time, this Court emphasized that moving forward to address the merits of the present challenges would be a waste of resources, as such an analysis is dependent upon which \"rules\" are in effect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2058%2C050\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wyoming v.

Reg. 7924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Feb. 22, 2018). Also on February 22, 2018, the District Court for the Northern District of California preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the Suspension Rule, arguably making the phase-in provisions immediately effective.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, this Court lifted the stay in these cases and set a briefing schedule to resolve the following pending motions now before this Court: (1)\n   <em>\n    Joint Motion by the States of North Dakota and Texas to Lift the Stay entered December 29, 2017 and to Establish Expedited Schedule for Further Proceedings\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 194 ); (2)\n   <em>\n    Motion to Lift Stay and Suspend Implementation Deadlines\n   </em>\n   filed by Petitioner States of Wyoming and Montana (ECF No. 195 ); and Industry Petitioners'\n   <em>\n    Motion to Lift Litigation Stay and for Preliminary Injunction or Vacatur of Certain Provisions of the Rule Pending Administrative Review\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 196 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Federal Respondents urge the Court to stay this litigation and the Waste Prevention Rule's implementation deadlines to preserve the status and rights of the regulated parties and avoid entanglement with the administrative process. The Federal Respondents argue the BLM should not be forced to litigate - and implement - the Waste Prevention Rule while the agency is actively reconsidering the Rule and has engaged in rulemaking to suspend and revise the Rule. The Intervenor-Petitioners, North Dakota and Texas, urge the Court to move forward with the merits of these cases on an expedited basis. The Intervenor-Respondents, the States of California and New Mexico and the Environmental Groups, oppose the Industry Petitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction or vacatur, and further oppose any stay of these cases or the existing implementation deadlines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This Court cannot escape the reality of the difficult, and somewhat\n   unique, procedural circumstances facing it - that going forward on the merits at this point remains a waste of judicial resources and disregards prudential ripeness concerns. The Court's consideration of the various requests for relief must begin by recognizing that the BLM has the inherent authority to reconsider its own rule, in the same manner and pursuant to the same constraints as when initially promulgating the rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trujillo v. Gen. Elec. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"482381\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/621/1084/#p1086\">\n    621 F.2d 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1086 (10th Cir. 1980) (\"Administrative agencies have an inherent authority to reconsider their own decisions, since the power to decide in the first instance carries with it the power to reconsider.\");\n   <em>\n    ConocoPhillips Co. v.

Wish as they might, neither the States, industry members, nor environmental groups are granted authority to dictate oil and gas policy on federal public lands. In light of the BLM's clearly expressed concerns about certain provisions of the Waste Prevention Rule, and the agency's publication of the proposed Revision Rule, the Court should allow the administrative process to run its course and restrain from prematurely conducting a merits analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wyoming v.

The proposed revisions substantially change those provisions of the 2016 Waste Prevention Rule that were to be phased in over time and are at the heart of this litigation. If the proposed Revision Rule becomes final, many of the changes and modifications required under the 2016 Rule, including the phase-in provisions, will be eliminated. Yet, the costs and difficulties of immediate compliance with those provisions - particularly considering that the intended period for \"ramping up\" never came to be because of the BLM's ongoing efforts to suspend and revise\n   those provisions - are undoubtedly substantial and unrecoverable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   To force temporary compliance with those provisions makes little sense and provides minimal public benefit, while significant resources may be unnecessarily expended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"[T]o the extent necessary to prevent irreparable injury,\" the Administrative Procedures Act gives a reviewing court discretion to \"issue\n   <em>\n    all necessary and appropriate process\n   </em>\n   ... to preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20705\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioners, particularly Industry Petitioners, will be irreparably harmed by full and immediate implementation of the 2016 Waste Prevention Rule, magnified by temporary implementation of significant provisions meant to be phased-in over time that will be eliminated in as few as four months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Revision Rule is presently subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking on the very issues before the Court.

Moreover, proceeding to address the merits of these cases will put the BLM in the difficult situation of litigating and defending a rule that it is in the midst of reconsidering and of taking positions on issues that are currently subject to public comment.

Unfortunately, none of the proposed solutions is comprehensively satisfying, and the circumstances presented here do not fall nicely into any particular legal doctrine. Still, the circumstances that justified this Court's stay of this litigation in the first place have not changed. Accordingly, in order to preserve the status quo, and in consideration of judicial economy and prudential\n   ripeness and mootness concerns, the Court finds the most appropriate and sensible approach is to exercise its equitable discretion to stay implementation of the Waste Prevention Rule's phase-in provisions and further stay these cases until the BLM finalizes the Revision Rule, so that this Court can meaningfully and finally engage in a merits analysis of the issues raised by the parties. A stay will provide certainty and stability for the regulated community and the general public while BLM completes its rulemaking process, will allow the BLM to focus its limited resources on completing the revision rulemaking, and would prevent the unrecoverable expenditure of millions of dollars in compliance costs. The waste, inefficiency, and futility associated with a ping-ponging regulatory regime is self-evident and in no party's interest.

Such an assertion suggests the invalidation of the Postponement Notice and Suspension Rule were, and the ultimate upending of the Revision Rule is, a foregone conclusion. However, \"a presumption of validity attaches to the agency action and the burden of proof rests with the appellants who challenge such action.\"\n    <em>\n     WildEarth Guardians v.

Thus, the States, industry, and public may appropriately rely on agency action unless and until it is held unlawful.
