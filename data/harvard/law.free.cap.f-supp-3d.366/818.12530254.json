(Doc. 15 at 34). The Warranty Deed was filed for record in Midland County on January 4, 2005.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 29, 2017, Ouzts died. (Docs. 51, 54). Thereafter, Plaintiff requested that Defendant relinquish possession, custody, and control of the Property. (Doc. 54 at 4). Defendant refused, claiming title to the Property under the Warranty Deed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On February 9, 2018, Plaintiff filed suit in the 441st District Court of Midland, Texas, raising claims for declaratory judgment, trespass to try title, and assumpsit (money had and received). (Doc. 1-3 at 11-12). Defendant removed the case to this Court on diversity grounds on April 3, 2018. (Doc. 1 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 25, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, almost five months before the discovery deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Doc. 15). Plaintiff argues that: (1) the alleged Deed, once executed and delivered to Plaintiff, gave Plaintiff a remainder interest in the fee simple title to the property described therein; (2) Ouzts, via the final provision in the alleged Deed, reserved for himself no more than a life estate; and (3) when Ouzts passed away on July 29, 2018, Plaintiff became the owner of a fee simple title to the Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Defendant counters that partial summary judgment is not warranted because there are genuine and material factual disputes regarding whether the alleged Deed is actually a deed or testamentary in character. (Doc. 19). Further, Defendant argues that even if the alleged Deed is, in fact, a deed, there is a genuine and material factual dispute as to whether the alleged Deed was delivered to Plaintiff and adequately acknowledged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the discovery deadline, the parties filed a series of Motions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1.\n   <strong>\n    Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgement.\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion raises three points: (1) that because the alleged deed is testamentary in nature, not a deed, Ouzts effectively revoked or canceled conveyance; thus, Plaintiff has no interest in the Property; (2) alternatively, that the alleged Deed is a terminable, non-testamentary instrument, and Plaintiff's rights terminated when Defendant took title; and (3) that Defendant is a bona fide purchaser who cuts off Plaintiff's interest under the alleged Deed. Moreover, that Plaintiff cannot bring a declaratory judgment claim. (Doc. 51).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   2.\n   <strong>\n    Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgement on Defendant's Defenses of Estoppel and Unjust Enrichment.\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion argues that: (1) there is no evidence supporting Defendant's defenses for estoppel and unjust enrichment; (2) alternatively, that the summary judgment evidence negates the elements of Defendant's estoppel and unjust enrichment defenses; and (3) Plaintiff reasserts her Motion for Partial Summary Judgment filed on May 25, 2018. (Doc. 52).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   3.\n   <strong>\n    Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on Delivery, Constructive Notice, and Bona Fide Purchaser.\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff argues that the evidence contradicts Defendant's assertions that Ouzts did not deliver the alleged Deed, that Defendant lacked notice of the alleged Deed, and that Defendant was a bona fide purchaser. (Doc. 53).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   4.\n   <strong>\n    Plaintiff's Motion for Hearing.\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff requests a hearing on all pending motions. (Doc. 58).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Both parties have timely responded and replied to all Motions--the final reply was filed on December 28, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 54, 55, 56, 57). Based on the parties' Motions, the issues before the Court are the following: (1) whether the alleged Deed is testamentary in character, a terminable, non-testamentary instrument, or a valid deed of conveyance; (2) whether Defendant was a bona fide purchaser; (3) whether Defendant's defenses are viable; and (4) whether Plaintiff's declaratory judgment cause of action is viable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court finds that it is able to rule on the motions absent a hearing; thus, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Unopposed Motion for Hearing.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff's claims for trespass to try title, declaratory judgment, and money had and received are premised on a dispute of land between Plaintiff and Defendant. A trespass to try title claim \"is a method of determining title to ... real property.\" Tex. Prop. Code \u00a7 22.001. To prevail a party may \"establish superior title out of a common source.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Amerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9256922\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/133/262/#p265\">\n    133 S.W.3d 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 265 (Tex. 2004). Plaintiff argues she has superior title to Defendant via the alleged Deed from Ouzts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant counters that Plaintiff is unable to show a chain from a common source first because the alleged Deed was testamentary in character and rescinded when Ouzts recorded the Rescission Deed. Alternatively, Defendant argues the alleged Deed was a terminable, non-testamentary instrument, and that Plaintiff's rights terminated when Ouzts sold the Property to Defendant in 2004. Finally, Defendant argues that regardless of how this Court interprets the alleged Deed, Defendant cut off Plaintiff's interest as a bona fide purchaser. Thus, Defendant argues the Court should grant summary judgment in her favor as to all claims. Plaintiff also moves for partial summary judgment, but requests the Court to declare that the alleged Deed is a valid deed that passed title to Plaintiff and which entitles Plaintiff to recover possession of the Property, which has been withheld by Defendant. Plaintiff further asks the Court to grant summary judgment in her favor as to Defendant's estoppel, unjust enrichment, and bona fide purchaser defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As detailed below, the Court finds that the alleged Deed is a deed and not testamentary in character nor a terminable, non-testamentary instrument. Nonetheless, because there are genuine issues of\n   material fact regarding the issues of delivery and whether Defendant is a bona fide purchaser, the Court cannot find at this stage of the case that Plaintiff has established superior title out of a common source. Thus, the Court cannot grant summary judgment to either party on the trespass to try title claim. However, the Court dismisses with prejudice Plaintiff's claim for declaratory judgment, as the trespass to try title statute governs the parties' substantive claims. Finally, because the Defendant withdrew her estoppel defense, the Court grants Plaintiff's request for summary judgment on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(Doc. 51 at 6). In the alternative, Defendant argues that the Court should apply the Transfer on Death Deed statute to the alleged Deed and hold it is a terminable, non-testamentary instrument that was terminated when Defendant took title in 2004 under the Warranty Deed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Deed or Testamentary Instrument\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Under the Texas Property Code, \"[a] person may make an inter vivos conveyance of an estate of freehold or inheritance that commences in the future, in the same manner as by a will.\" Tex.

The language the court was referring to is the following: \"Grantor further reserves the full power and authority, without the joinder of any other person, to sell, convey, mortgage, lease, and otherwise dispose of the property in fee simple with or without consideration and without joinder by Beneficiary, to any person or persons whatsoever, and to keep absolutely any and all proceeds derived therefrom.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203398447\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the language in the case at bar only specifies when the Property will vest-upon the demise of Ouzts--it does not expressly reserve the right to sell or convey the property to third parties during Ouzts' lifetime.

(Doc. 15 at 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Carlton\n   </em>\n   , the instrument was in the form of a deed, recorded, was witnessed by a third party, and contained the following language: \"The said Abner Lee holding and reserving all the within named estates, both real and personal, during the natural life of the said Abner Lee.\"\n   <em>\n    Carlton v.

The court found that because the lower court had considered the \"terms of the instrument, the nature of the reservation, and of the estate to be created\" and formed the opinion that based on the totality of the instrument it was the intent of the maker that the \"instrument take effect only on his death,\" the instrument was testamentary in character.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2182782\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tex/54/72/#p73\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, this Court notes that in\n   <em>\n    Carlton\n   </em>\n   , the grantor was not only disposing of real property and naming his daughter and wife beneficiaries, he was also disposing of all personal property he owned at the time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2182782\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tex/54/72/#p73\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the execution of the document was witnessed by \"assisting witnesses\" and \"instrumental witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2182782\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tex/54/72/#p73\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These are characteristics representative of testamentary instruments. Clearly, the execution of the document in\n   <em>\n    Carlton\n   </em>\n   differs significantly from the execution of the alleged Deed in this case, which was executed without any witnesses and only references the Property rather than all property owned by Ouzts. (Doc. 15 at 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court finds this case is more like\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   , where the issue before the court was whether the instruments were testamentary in nature or deeds.\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20S.W.%20484\">\n    88 S.W. at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In concluding the documents were deeds and not testamentary in nature, the court considered that the instruments were written not by the grantor but by the notary public, they were attested by only one witness--thus they could not be probated as wills--and that without the words, \"The deed is to take effect at my death and not before\" the instrument would contain all the elements of a deed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20S.W.%20484\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court found that the intent of the grantor was \"to reserve an interest in the property during the lifetime of the grantor\" and \"that the deeds should only become effective to disturb this right at his death.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20S.W.%20484\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Also on point is\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   , where the Court found that because the document was in the general form of a deed and had \"none of the indicia of a will,\" the phrase \"to take effect at the death of the survivor of us\" was \"not inconsistent with the construction of the instrument as a deed\" and did not \"refer to the instrument, but rather to the commencement of the estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10308687\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw/293/815/\">\n    293 S.W. at 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the court held that the instrument was a deed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10308687\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw/293/815/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, in\n   <em>\n    Bruce\n   </em>\n   , the court--relying on the facts that the document was not written by the grantor but by a notary, that two witnesses did not witness it, and that it contained \"usual and customary words of conveyance\"--found that the grantor's \"plain and apparent intention\" was not contradicted or made ambiguous by the statement in the conveyance that \"This deed, however, under no condition or circumstances is to be made a matter of record or become absolute until after my death.\"\n   <em>\n    Bruce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8265867,8265909\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw/233/535/\">\n    233 S.W. at 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, the court also found the document to be a deed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8265867,8265909\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw/233/535/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Similarly, the alleged Deed, without the final sentence, contains all the elements of a deed, was written by a notary public, was\n   acknowledged\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and recorded, and was not witnessed. (Doc. 15 at 23). There is nothing in the alleged deed that expressly reserves in Ouzts the right or power to \"revoke, defeat or impair his act.\"\n   <em>\n    Bruce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8265867,8265909\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw/233/535/\">\n    233 S.W. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   538 (citing\n   <em>\n    Crocker v.

Further, the language in the alleged Deed shows that Ouzts was referring to the commencement of the estate not the alleged Deed when it stated that it--the Property--shall not vest until Ouzts' death. Consequently, the Court finds that the alleged Deed is similar to the instruments in\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Bruce.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, Defendant's argument that the definition of \"vest\" under Merriam-Webster.com \"negates an intent to convey an immediate right in the Property to Plaintiff\" is unpersuasive. (Doc. 51 at 9). Texas courts have found instruments containing similar language are deeds. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Irvin\n   </em>\n   , the court opined that the instrument was a deed and not testamentary in character despite the following language in the deed: \"that the control and management of the property herein conveyed shall remain in the hands of the grantors or either of them so long as either shall live... after the death of both herein the title to, management of, and occupancy of, shall be\n   <em>\n    vested\n   </em>\n   in and to the following...\"\n   <em>\n    Irvin v.

App.-Beaumont 1973, no writ) (emphasis added). Using similar language, in\n   <em>\n    Abney\n   </em>\n   , an Alabama case cited by Texas courts, the instrument stated that at the grantor's death \"the title to the foregoing lands is to\n   <em>\n    vest\n   </em>\n   immediately in my said children.\"\n   <em>\n    Abney v.

Specifically, Defendant points to a letter dated July 8, 2003,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   from Alan Meyers, Ouzts' attorney demanding Plaintiff return Ouzts' trust documents and deed. (Doc. 51-1 at 38). Defendant also points to the contradictory testimony of Plaintiff. In an interrogatory, Plaintiff stated that she \"received no instruction from [Ouzts]\" at or around \"the time he executed the [alleged Deed].\" (Doc. 55-1 at 5-6). Plaintiff now argues that Ouzts requested she record the document. (Doc. 53 at 5-6). Finally, Defendant argues that the Rescission Deed also shows that Ouzts did not intend to deliver the alleged Deed because Ouzts did not believe he had executed and acknowledged the alleged Deed before a notary public as required by law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 51-1 at 44). Based on that evidence, the Defendant concludes that Ouzts did not intend for the alleged Deed to take effect as a conveyance when he gave it to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiff counters that because the alleged Deed was notarized and recorded, there is conclusive evidence that the Deed was signed, delivered and accepted. (Doc. 57 at 4). Further, Plaintiff claims that she witnessed her father deliver to her the alleged Deed and that he requested that she record the document.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. Thus, there has been a delivery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It seems\n   Plaintiff attempts to establish delivery first by relying on the recordation of the alleged Deed and second based on her statement that she witnessed her father deliver the alleged Deed to her. Because there is a dispute as to the facts surrounding the issue of delivery, the Court cannot grant Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the issue of delivery. Nor can it decide whether Plaintiff has a superior title under the alleged Deed whose delivery and thus validity is in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Effect of Rescission Deed\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to declare that the Rescission Deed did not affect Plaintiff's interest in the Property under the alleged Deed. However, because the Court cannot at this stage determine whether the alleged Deed was delivered to Plaintiff and consequently whether there was a valid conveyance of property, Plaintiff's interest in the Property remains in question. Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiff's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Bona Fide Purchaser Argument\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant argues that she is a bona fide purchaser that cut off any rights Plaintiff had to the Property when Ouzts sold Defendant the Property in 2004.
