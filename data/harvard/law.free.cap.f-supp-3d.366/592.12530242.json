INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court is the second wave of cross-motions for summary judgment in this Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") dispute between journalist and professor of journalism Charles Seife, appearing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , and the United States Department of State (the \"State Department\"). The dispute began with two July 22, 2014 requests for various records related to press briefings given \"on background\" by anonymous senior agency officials. The Court assumes the parties' familiarity with the facts, legal principles, and conclusions of law set forth in the Court's prior opinion,\n   <em>\n    Seife v. United States Dep't of State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524164\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/592/#p630\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 630 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (the \" Prior Opinion\") (ECF No. 40 ). To the extent that any particular fact or legal principle articulated in the Prior Opinion bears upon the analysis here, it is embedded in this opinion, below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, Plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment is DENIED, and the State Department's cross-motion for summary judgment is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the wake of the Prior Opinion, the State Department released additional information\n   to Plaintiff, and the parties engaged in very limited conferral regarding the outstanding issues. Unable to reach an accord, the parties filed a second wave of cross-motions for summary judgment, which are now ripe for adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before the Court are three discrete issues: 1) whether the State Department's search for responsive transcripts was adequate; 2) whether the State Department properly withheld information pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B)(5) (\"Exemption 5\"); and 3) whether the State Department properly withheld, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6) (\"Exemption 6\"), the identities of the \"on background\" briefers who are still employed by the federal government. The Court addresses each of those questions in turn, below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the course of briefing, the State Department submitted a revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index, to which the Court refers\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   (the \"Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index\"). (ECF No. 58-1 ). Additionally, the State Department voluntarily released additional information which has limited the scope of the dispute before the Court. The voluntarily released information included the identities of the \"on background\" briefers previously withheld under Exemption 6, save for those briefers who are still currently employed by the federal government. To facilitate the Court's\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the privacy issues related to the disclosure of the remaining briefers, the State Department also submitted the June 6, 2018\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   declaration of Eric F. Stein (the \"\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   Declaration\") which identifies the \"on background\" briefers at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III. REQUEST F-2014-12997\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For the reasons articulated below, the Court holds that the State Department's search conducted in response to the remaining aspects of Plaintiff's FOIA request numbered F-2014-12997 (\"Request 12997\") was adequate in part, and inadequate in part. Accordingly, summary judgment is granted to the State Department in part, and the parties are directed to confer regarding a solution to the narrow remaining areas of dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Recent Developments as to Request 12997\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the Prior Opinion, the Court held that \"the State Department should have interpreted the 12997 request as one for unredacted transcripts of each 'on background' conference, briefing, and call that took\n   place between January 20, 2009 and July 21, 2014, regardless of whether the transcript identified by name the government official providing the briefing.\" Prior Opinion,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524164\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/592/#p630\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Subsequently, \"the State Department conducted a search for any transcripts created by the State Department-both for transcripts for 'on background' briefings and for internal-use transcripts of Government officials' engagements with select groups of reporters in which they spoke for 'attribution to a government official, not for individual attribution'-and produced 452 such transcripts to Plaintiff as a result of this search.\" Def.'s Reply (ECF No. 57 ) at 2 (citing Third Decl. of Eric F. Stein (ECF No. 50) (\"3d Stein Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, 10-11). Those 452 transcripts are the fruit of the State Department's search of \"the shared drive where the stenographers who prepared the transcripts stored their files.\" Def.'s Br. (ECF No. 49 ) at 6. \"[A]pproximately 50 [of those] transcripts ... are not currently on the Department's website.\" Fourth Decl. of Eric F. Stein (ECF No. 58) (\"4th Stein Decl.\") \u00b6 10. While the State Department was not obligated to produce transcripts which were publicly available, all 452 transcripts were produced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prior Opinion,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524164\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/592/#p630\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   610 (citing\n   <em>\n    Triestman v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, Drug Enforcement Admin.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7845653\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/878/667/#p671\">\n    878 F.Supp. 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 671 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) ). There is no dispute that the search of the stenographers' shared drive was adequate to produce responsive transcripts produced by the State Department.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. (ECF No. 54 ) at 23-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Rather, the current dispute is as to the adequacy of the State Department's search of its employees' email accounts for material responsive to Request 12977. The genesis of the dispute is in the State Department's concern that Request 12997, as drafted, encompasses all transcripts, regardless of whether they were prepared by the State Department or not. Unlike the stenographers' shared drive, which has a high likelihood of containing all relevant transcripts prepared by the State Department, there is no centralized repository for non-State-Department-produced transcripts in the possession, custody or control of the State Department. Nor is there a centralized method by which transcripts prepared by other departments or agencies are disseminated throughout the State Department. 3d Stein Decl. \u00b6 8. Instead, State Department employees acquire such transcripts through individual subscriptions to mailing lists, and otherwise on an\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   basis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7845653\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/878/667/#p671\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, locating all transcripts responsive to Request 12997 in the possession, custody or control of the State Department that were not prepared by the State Department, would require individual review of each of the State Department's 20,000 plus employees' data.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7845653\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/878/667/#p671\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Uncontroversially, the State Department considers conducting such a search to be unduly burdensome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On this point, Plaintiff agrees. Third Decl. of Charles Seife (ECF No. 53) (\"3d Seife Decl.\") \u00b6 77. (\"I obviously wouldn't want State to search every employees' account, so I would be happy to work with [Defendant] to limit the scope in that regard.\"). However, the State Department's proposed solution was to limit the scope of Request 12997 to State-Department-produced transcripts-which in practice would limit the search to only the search of the stenographer's shared drive described above.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81. Plaintiff rejected that proposed limitation of Request 12997, citing his concern that that limiting the searches to transcripts prepared by the State Department would exclude transcripts of joint conferences prepared by another agency-for example \"a joint State/DoD briefing whose transcript was compiled by DoD and transmitted to State\" would be\n   excluded by the State Department's proposed solution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Despite Plaintiff's willingness to confer with the State Department as to document custodians and search terms, the State Department instead unilaterally implemented the following protocol.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86-87. First, it adopted Plaintiff's suggestion that employees of the State Department's Bureau of Public Affairs Office of Press Relations (\"PA/PRS\") were the most likely to have responsive documents. 3d Stein Decl. \u00b6 13. Second, the State Department identified which of its current employees were employed by PA/PRS from January 20, 2009 to July 21, 2014 (the \"12997 period\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Deputy Director of PA/PRS has been employed at PA/PRS since November 6, 2011. Accordingly, she searched her email account using the search term \"background briefing\"-limited to the date range of November 6, 2011 to July 21, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. She only searched the \"White House\" folder of her email account, \"because she only subscribes to White House and DoD releases and only saves transmission from the White House.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That search led to the production of two transcripts which were not available on the White House's archive website.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The third step in the State Department's search was to locate current PA/PRS employees who were employed by PA/PRS during the portion of the 12997 period not covered by the Deputy Director's search-January 20, 2009 to November 5, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. A search of their email, using unspecified terms and limitations, did not produce any additional transcripts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff objects to the email search procedure described above. He has also \"made it clear [that] he would accept a search spanning no more than handful of employees\" and \"apologizes for bringing this matter before the Court, as it is something that should have been properly resolved through dialogue.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The State Department's search protocol was adequate as to the search for State Department produced transcripts, but inadequate as to the search for non-State Department produced transcripts. It is uncontested that the search of the stenographers' shared drive was reasonably calculated to produce responsive transcripts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 23-26. The Court agrees and holds that the State Department's search and production of State-Department created transcripts was adequate. However, for the reasons that follow, the State Department's search of its employee's email accounts for transcripts created by other governmental departments or agencies was inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The State Department's email-search protocol was primarily limited, without sufficient justification, to the contents of the Deputy Director's email account. As Mr. Stein's declaration makes clear, the Deputy Director \"only subscribes to White House and DoD releases and only saves transmissions from the White House.\" 3d Stein Decl. at \u00b6 13. The State Department has further indicated that not all employees subscribe to the same mailing lists, and some State-Department employees may receive transcripts on an\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   basis. Def.'s Br. at 7 (citing 3d Stein Decl. \u00b6 8). Accordingly, there is no reason to presume that the Deputy Director's email account was even indicative, let alone panoptic, of the other PA/\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   PSR employees' accounts-nor has any evidence been presented suggesting that to be the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Nonetheless, the State Department limited the date range of their searches of the accounts of the other current PA/PSR employees to the portion of the 12997 period not covered by the search of the Deputy Director's account. As a result, if there was any responsive material within those two employees' accounts which was within the date range of the Deputy Director's term of employment, it was not produced. Nor is there any basis for the Court to find that any such discovery would have been duplicative, given the State Department's admission that each employee could have received responsive documents via their idiosyncratic decisions to subscribe to various mailing lists, or otherwise on an ad hoc basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def.'s Br. at 7 (citing 3d Stein Decl. \u00b6 8). Accordingly, on its face, the search of PA/PSR employee accounts, while evidencing a reasoned approach, was not \"reasonably calculated produce documents responsive\" to Request 12977-and is therefore inadequate.\n   <em>\n    Garcia v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, Office of Info. and Privacy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9400548\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/181/356/#p366\">\n    181 F.Supp.2d at 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Weisberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"593091,3804036\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/745/1476/\">\n    745 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1485 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In his third declaration, Plaintiff articulates his current position regarding \"the rough parameters of a search that Plaintiff would consider adequate.\" 3d Seife Decl. \u00b6 87. The Court takes no position as to Plaintiff's proposal, but expects that it may serve as a starting point for conferral between the parties. A \"reasonably calculated\" search might, for example, include a search of all the current PA/PSR employees who were employed during the 12977 period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For all the reasons articulated above, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment as it relates to the search for State-Department produced transcripts, and denies both motions for summary judgment as to the search for non-State-Department-produced transcripts. To the limited extent that disputes as to Request 12977 persist, the Court expects the parties will be able to resolve any such disputes through prompt conferral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index also adequately describes how the emails at issue were \"generated as part of a continuous process of agency decision making, viz., how to respond to on-going inquiries,\" which adequately demonstrates that those materials are predecisional.\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

In the Court's Prior Opinion, the Court was unable to conclude that the withheld portions of the emails were deliberative because \"[a]bsent information describing the authors and recipients,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   whether the communications involved recommendations for consideration in the deliberative process, such as suggestions made by junior officials to senior officials or decision-makers within the agency, the Court cannot determine that the emails are deliberative in nature and subject to the privilege.\" Prior Opinion\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524164\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/592/#p630\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In the Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, the State Department has remedied that deficiency by including specific descriptions of the withheld portions of the emails, such that the Court can now conclude that the withheld portions relate to evolving policy determinations being made by the State Department, which were ongoing at the time the emails were sent. For example, in Category One, the Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index now includes a description of the withheld portions of the emails in question, described as deliberations and consultations, both within the State Department and with other agencies, \"that reflect foreign policy considerations bearing on the timing of the announcement\" at issue \"as well as participation in the background briefing, ... detailed information about other aspects of the designations announcement (such as notification of stakeholders)\" and \"a proposed 'rollout plan' about how the announcement ... will be made publicly and a proposal regarding informing various governmental and foreign stakeholders.\" Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 2.

Accordingly, the Court can now conclude that the withheld material in Category One is both predecisional and deliberative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Another indicative example is Category 12 of the Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, which specifies that the withheld material consists of questions by a senior official as to points to be made \"during the background briefing on the Department's November 13, 2013 announcement designating Boko Haram and Ansaru as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists, as well as proposed response and feedback regarding the same.

That type of back and forth exchange, in which proposed policy options are discussed and refined, is both predecisional and deliberative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Upon review of the complete record, including the indicative examples discussed above, the Court finds that the withheld portions of the emails described in the Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index are both predecisional and deliberative, subject to any applicable limitation in \u00a7 IV(B)(3), below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Here, the Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index shows two key improvements over its deficient predecessor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, the State Department has now produced the final versions of talking points which had previously been withheld,\n   and is now only withholding draft documents.

For example, in Category 6, the State Department describes the withheld portions of draft Q&amp;As and talking points as \"newer versions of documents drafted previously, which were updated following remarks by the President and were intended for continuing use by government officials\" and that those draft materials \"would reveal the author's thoughts and ideas relating to press guidance on a sensitive matter.\" Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 6-7. The State Department also indicates that the final version of these documents were released to Plaintiff on May 21, 2018, and that the \"information that continues to be withheld includes the justification for a decision about what to include in the Q&amp;A, which reflects the government's deliberative process, as well as the anticipated questions and proposed answers\" which were \"hypotheticals.\" The Court finds that description sufficient to demonstrate that the withheld information is both predecisional and deliberative-the withheld information is contained in working drafts, which reflect the author's positions, not State Department policy, and were intended for continuing internal use and refinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index also provides additional insight into the nature of the one document withheld in full and listed as Category 15 in the Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index. In the Prior Opinion, the Court noted with concern that the description of Category 15 in the Original\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index provided no specific information upon which the Court could conclude that withholding the document was appropriate. Prior Opinion,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524164\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/592/#p630\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, on the other hand, specifies that the Category 15 document contains only \"proposed answers to hypothetical questions, which may or may not have been delivered\" and is lacking any of the hallmarks of a completed State Department document, such as a title, header, or end page with the signatures of any employees who reviewed it. Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 13. Accordingly, the Court can now conclude that it was predecisional and deliberative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Upon review of the record, including the indicative examples discussed above, the Court finds that, the withheld portions of the documents described in the Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index were both predecisional and deliberative, subject to any applicable limitation in \u00a7 IV(B)(3), below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

In its Prior Opinion, the Court had expressed its concern that the Original\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index did not contain sufficiently detailed descriptions for the Court to verify that the draft rollout schedules did not constitute \"routine operating decision[s] which could not be withheld under the deliberative process privilege.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Prior Opinion\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524164\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/592/#p630\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

The Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index remedies that concern, and contains information sufficient for the Court to conclude that the withheld material regarding draft rollout schedules was predecisional and deliberative, subject to any applicable limitation in \u00a7 IV(B)(3), below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As it did in its Prior Opinion, the Court considers Categories 11 and 17 together. Category 11 describes a draft of a rollout schedule as to \"the announcement designating Boko Haram and Ansaru as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global terrorists\" which is not in final form, and contains edits and markups, as well as editing comments. The document is predecisional as to the final rollout plan, and is deliberative in that it reflects the State Department's evolving views as to the sequence and timing of activities surrounding that announcement, including Congressional testimony. Further, the additional information in the Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index allows the Court to conclude that the activities described, such as coordinating briefings with Congressional testimony, are not \"routine operating decisions which [cannot] be withheld under the deliberative process privilege.\" Prior Opinion\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524164\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/592/#p630\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

The Category 17 documents are incomplete drafts which discuss the State Department's \"evolving\" position as to the \"schedule for proposed official remarks, media engagement, and outreach calls on the topic of Iraq.\" Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 14. The activities described go beyond routine operating procedures, and include coordinating with a wide array of government officials and other stakeholders, and the materials described represent the author's views, rather than official policy of the State Department. Accordingly, the Court finds them to be predecisional and deliberative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Upon consideration of the full record, including the indicative examples discussed above, the Court concludes that withheld portions of the rollout documents described in the Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index are both predicational and deliberative, subject to any applicable limitation in \u00a7 IV(B)(3), below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Inapplicable Exceptions to Exemption 5\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   While the Court has concluded that much of the withheld material described in the Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index is predecisional and deliberative, the Court may not determine that they are protected by the deliberate process privilege without first determining whether an exception to that privilege applies. For the reasons stated below, the Court finds that no such exception applies, with the corollary that the State department's use of the deliberate process privilege in the Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index was appropriate, save for the exceptions noted in \u00a7 IV(B)(3), below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \"[E]ven if the documents at issue are 'predecisional' and 'deliberative,' and thereby fall under the scope of Exemption 5, there are circumstances under which they will be found outside the scope of that protection....

Critically, the Court need not determine whether Plaintiff's argument applies to final versions of such documents, as the final documents at issue here have been produced. Rather, the question before the Court is whether draft versions of those documents are vulnerable to Plaintiff's argument. The Court holds they are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   No evidence has been presented which demonstrates that the draft documents are in fact final State Department positions, which were at some point publicly adopted or otherwise constitute working law of the State Department.

Pl.'s Br. at 21. In response to Plaintiff's arguments, the State Department released additional portions of the document, which make it clear that what Plaintiff had initially interpreted as a request for the general position of the State Department regarding press embargoes, was in reality a discrete question, and not the transmission of any State Department policy or working law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of that evidence, the Court has no basis on which to conclude that document C05973837 was adopted or constituted the working law of the State Department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As the Court has found that no exception to the deliberative process privilege applies, the withheld material which the Court has found to be predecisional and deliberative was properly withheld pursuant to Exemption 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Categories Which the Court Cannot Determine Are Protected by the Deliberative Process Privilege\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Despite the improvements in the Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, and the State Department's beneficial production of previously withheld material, there remain certain categories of documents withheld in whole or in part pursuant to Exemption 5 which the Court cannot conclude, on the basis of the record before it, were properly withheld. Accordingly, for the reasons, and to the extent, articulated below, the Court denies the State Department's motion for summary judgment as to Categories 5, 13 and 18 of the Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In Category 5, certain material was withheld because it relates to \"the stated 'Goal' of the talking points.\" Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 5. Additionally, \"the opening portions of each bulleted taking points ... [which] reflect internal information about the Department's broader strategy regarding Syria\" was also withheld.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Simply put, the State Department's broader positions regarding Syria may be sensitive, but as described, the \"Goal\" of the talking points appears to be settled State Department policy-as opposed to deliberations as to evolving policy. Accordingly, on the basis of the record before it, the Court declines to endorse the State Department's invocation of the deliberate process privilege as to the documents in Category 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Similarly, in Category 13, the State Department indicated that it was unclear whether the \"comments and recommended edits\" in the draft documents at issue \"were addressed and accepted or rejected.\" Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 12.

It is insufficient for the State Department to claim it is \"unclear\" whether the edits were accepted or rejected. The result of that lack of clarity is that the Court has been presented with no basis upon which it can determine that the proposed edits do not constitute final articulations of State Department Policy, rather than deliberations. To be clear, the State Department has indicated that these documents are \"not in final form,\" however, that, alone, is insufficient to demonstrate that these documents reflect continuing deliberations as to evolving policy. Without additional clarity regarding the deliberative nature of these documents, the Court cannot approve of the State Department's decision to withhold large portions of them pursuant to the deliberative process privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, the State Department's Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   entry for Category 18 only indicates that the documents are draft talking points, and that they preview the administrations prospective policy actions. Indeed, aside from noting that the documents are labeled \"DRAFT//INTENRAL USE ONLY\" the Category 18 Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   entry is largely identical to the corresponding entry in the Original\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index.

However, also for the reasons articulated below, the Court cannot determine, on the record before it, the identity of the briefer referenced in footnote four of the Fourth Declaration of Eric F.

Accordingly, the only remaining dispute as to the Defendant's use of Exemption 6 is as to the identity of the three \"on background\" briefers currently employed by the United States Government, which Defendant declines to produce.

Plaintiff has identified two potential public interests to balance against the asserted privacy interests. The first-that disclosure would allow the public insight into \"the government's increasing reliance \"on background\" briefings as well as other mechanisms for controlling press coverage\"-was rejected by the Court in its previous opinion as being \"too attenuated\" from \"the potential illumination of the government activity at issue.\" Prior Opinion,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524164\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/592/#p630\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The second proposed public interest is that disclosure would allow the public to test the veracity of the Government's assertions regarding the nature of the \"on background\" briefers who remain anonymous despite the fact that they personally disseminated information to the press on behalf of the Government. That is a colorable interest, which the Court must balance against the privacy interest asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   On balance, the Court finds that the privacy interests asserted outweigh the public interest in disclosure. Simply put, the concerns associated with disclosure of the briefers' identities, as disclosed in the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   Declaration, are serious. On the other hand, the State Department's decision to voluntarily release the identities of briefers who are no longer are employed by the Government will allow Mr. Seife, and the public, to test the State Department's assertions as to the nature of the \"on background\" briefers. Accordingly, the public's interest in the disclosure of the remaining withheld identities is diminished, while the serious privacy concerns at issue remain palpable. Accordingly, on balance, the Court finds that the substantial privacy interests of the briefers at issue in the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   Declaration outweigh the public's interest in disclosure, and those identities may be properly withheld pursuant to Exemption 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The above analysis, however, cannot be extended to the individual discussed in footnote four of Mr. Stein's fourth declaration. On the record provided, the Court cannot determine who is referred to in footnote 4, whether that identity was withheld, or if any such withholding was permissible pursuant to Exemption 6. Accordingly, the Court defers judgment as to the identity of that individual, and requests that the State Department provide that information to the Court,\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   if need be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. PLAINTIFF'S ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPER CONDUCT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Plaintiff has accused the State Department of engaging in \"a pattern and practice\n   of inaccuracy and incompleteness that raises questions about its candor and/or good faith,\" Pl.'s Br. at 26, and has compiled an exhibit in which he provides his analysis on each alleged instance of such conduct. Pl.'s Br., Ex. N (ECF No. 60-1 ). The Court, however, accepts the State Department's proffer that it has \"endeavored to provide complete and accurate information to the Court,\" Def.'s Reply at 19, and finds that presumption of good faith owed to the State Department's sworn testimony remains undisturbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment is DENIED, and the State Department's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. For the avoidance of doubt, the Court provides the following summary of the outcome of Defendant's motion for summary judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    REQUEST F-2014-12997:\n   </strong>\n   Summary judgment is granted in favor of the State Department as to the search for State-Department produced transcripts, and denied as to the search for non-State-Department-Produced-Transcripts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Exemption 5:\n   </strong>\n   Summary judgment is granted in favor of the State Department as to all applications of Exemption 5 in the Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, except for Categories 5 (subject to footnote nine, above), 13, and 18 for which summary judgment is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Exemption 6:\n   </strong>\n   Summary judgment is granted in favor of the State Department, except as to the individual discussed in footnote four of the Fourth Declaration of Eric F. Stein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The remaining issues are discrete, and the Court expects that they may be resolved by conferral amongst the parties. The Court directs the parties to so confer, and to submit a joint status letter to the Court describing what, if any, issues remain in this case no later than three weeks following the date of this opinion and order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the motions pending at docket numbers 48 and 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The Court incorporates the articulation of the applicable standards governing motions for summary judgment, FOIA requests,\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    litigants, and\n    <em>\n     Vaughn\n    </em>\n    indices, in its Prior Opinion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Prior Opinion,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524164\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/592/#p630\">\n     298 F.Supp.3d at 604-08\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    In the Prior Opinion, the Court discussed whether certain materials could be properly withheld pursuant to the Presidential communications privilege.
