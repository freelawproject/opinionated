SCHLESINGER, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS CAUSE\n   </strong>\n   is before the Court on Defendants' Dispositive Motion for Summary Judgment and Memorandum of Law in Support (Doc. 115) and Plaintiff's Response and Memorandum of Law in Opposition thereto (Doc. 120). After careful consideration of the issues presented, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 115) is granted. The Court's analysis in support of that conclusion is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Benjamin Michael DuBay (\"Plaintiff\") is a nephew of William Bryan DuBay, one of the creators of \"Restin Dane\" also known as \"The Rook.\" The Rook is a comic book character whose first story was published in 1977 in a Warren Publications horror/fantasy comic magazine entitled\n   <em>\n    Eerie\n   </em>\n   volume 82 (hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    Eerie 82\n   </em>\n   \"). According to Plaintiff, The Rook character was distributed in \"greater than five million comic magazine copies, throughout the United States from January 1977 thru March 1983\" (Doc. 6, \u00b6 18). The Rook comic remains available to the public today in comic books, graphic novels and electronic forms (Doc. 6, \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Stephen King is the author of the widely successful series of novels entitled\n   <em>\n    The Dark Tower\n   </em>\n   . First published in 1982,\n   <em>\n    The Dark Tower\n   </em>\n   has evolved into an eight-volume series, reimagined and interpreted through various mediums, including film and graphic novels. Roland Deschain also known as \"The Gunslinger,\" is the protagonist of the series.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Approximately 35 years after the world first officially\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   met Roland Deschain, Plaintiff brought this action alleging that Roland Deschain is so shockingly and extraordinarily similar to The Rook that Defendant King must have unlawfully copied and appropriated The Rook character. (Doc. 6, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 24).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff has identified the infringing works as: the eight novels of\n   <em>\n    The Dark Tower\n   </em>\n   series written by Defendant King and published by Defendant Simon &amp; Schuster; 16 of\n   <em>\n    The Dark Tower\n   </em>\n   graphic novels licensed by Defendant Marvel; and the 2017 feature film\n   <em>\n    The Dark Tower\n   </em>\n   produced and/or distributed by Defendants MRC,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Imagine Entertainment and Sony Pictures Entertainment. Plaintiff argues that because Roland is the central character in this large volume of works, all works infringe on Plaintiff's validly held copyright of The Rook character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 28, 2017, Plaintiff filed a two-count complaint against Defendant King\n   alleging claims for Copyright Infringement and Vicarious Copyright Infringement (Doc. 1, pgs. 28-31). Shortly thereafter, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint naming the remaining Defendants and adding an additional count for Contributory Copyright Infringement against Defendants MRC and Imagine Entertainment (Doc. 6, pgs. 44-46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n   <strong>\n    The Relevant Copyright\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff claims he is the owner of the copyright for the work entitled \"The Rook,\" registered with the United States Copyright Office under Registration Number B188968. The registration date is February 4, 1977. The initial publication date is January 19, 1977. The deposit copy for No. B188968 is\n   <em>\n    Eerie 82\n   </em>\n   . (Doc. 6, \u00b6 21). It is by and through this copyright for\n   <em>\n    Eerie 82\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiff claims ownership of the copyright the Defendants are accused of infringing. For the purposes of this analysis, the Court will treat Plaintiff as the owner of the relevant copyright for The Rook character.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   III.\n   <strong>\n    Summary Judgment Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Summary Judgment is proper if \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).

Dubay, Budd Lewis and James \"Jim\" Stenstrum, created The Rook during the fall of 1976. Mr. William Dubay died in 2010. Mr. Stenstrum is the only surviving member of the trio. Plaintiff describes The Rook as a \"time-traveling, parallel/alternate\n   world traveling, monster-fighting, romantic adventure hero; who has a penchant for dressing as a cowboy from the Old West and is symbolized by a rook bird\" (Doc. 6, \u00b6 16). A few years after his initial debut in\n   <em>\n    Eerie\n   </em>\n   , The Rook was given his own magazine, entitled\n   <em>\n    The Rook\n   </em>\n   After his title magazine was cancelled, The Rook again appeared in\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   magazine. Warren Publishing eventually went bankrupt and ceased all further publication of The Rook character. The Rook series again appeared in a mini-series was revived by Dark Horse Comics in 2015 and is available and by GooglePlay in a mobile video game (Doc. 6, \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   b.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Man Who Time Forgot!\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"He was born ... Restin Dane but he calls himself ... THE ROOK!\" An exciting and light-hearted comic, The Rook character is first introduced to readers in\n   <em>\n    Eerie 82\n   </em>\n   in classically exciting, catchy and heroic terms: \"The Most Exciting New Hero in Comics!\" and \"The Master of the Past, Present and Future!\" The Rook is a hero in the traditional mold. He is self-made, likeable, charming and a successful adventure hero. Restin Dane calls himself The Rook because of the \"shrewd killer chess piece\" in the shape of \"an impregnable castle,\" that he travels through time in and because he moves through time as quickly and mysteriously as \"the black bird of prey ... known also as ... The Rook!\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Like Batman's Bruce Wayne, The Rook is a wealthy inventor/techno physicist, who experiments with the science of physics, computers and advanced robotronics. The Rook designed the time traveling devices he uses. He most commonly uses a time machine in the shape of a large rook chess piece, although a time machine shaped as a knight chess piece is also featured in the series. He calls traveling through time \"castling.\" The Rook has also built robots to serve as his team of assistants. The most prominently featured robot is a computer robot butler named \"Manners.\" Two more rudimentary robots, aptly named \"Nuts\" and \"Bolts\" are also mentioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Eventually, The Rook's crime fighting team is comprised of himself, his great, great grandfather Bishop Dane, an outlaw gunfighter whom he rescued from 1874 and Manners. (\n   <em>\n    See Eerie 85\n   </em>\n   , 120-1C). The action primarily takes place in the Old American West, but The Rook lives in modern day Arizona in a house called \"Rook Manor\" or \"Rook Castle\" which is also shaped like a giant rook chess piece. The Rook has built an underground headquarters there, where he stores his time machines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Rook is a bachelor. He is young, ruggedly handsome, square jawed with dark hair and thick sideburns and a muscular physique. The Rook does not age and remains in his prime, despite passing years. Although The Rook's attire changes slightly as his adventures progress, he basically subscribes to the same old American West look throughout.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   He mostly wears dark jean or black, bell bottomed pants, a torn white or light, long sleeve collared shirt, a dark vest, leg holster, and a belt with a large buckle containing the image of a rook bird, an animal similar in appearance to the common crow. The Rook often, but not always, wears a black cowboy hat with a somewhat reflective silver, hatband. He is frequently armed on his adventures with a revolver, a Bowie knife, and a machine gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Rook's desire \"to escape the time in which he is imprisoned\" and interest in his ancestral history initially motivates his time travel. Resourceful and brave, The Rook strives to do the right thing, even if it means sacrificing himself or placing himself in harm's way. The Rook's main adversary in\n   <em>\n    Eerie\n   </em>\n   is Gat Hawkins. Hawkins wants to be the \"Master of All Time\" and torments The Rook in his quests (\n   <em>\n    Eerie 84\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 120-3). In\n   <em>\n    Eerie 87\n   </em>\n   , Granny Gadget is also introduced as a villain (Doc. 120-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   c.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     As Featured in Erie 82\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Reader learns The Rook spent a lifetime preparing to time travel, and when he was finally able, his goal was to travel to save Parrish Dane, a relative, who died in the Battle of the Alamo. The Rook character's main storyline in this comic surrounds the Battle of the Alamo and his attempts to save Parish Dane. The Rook goes castling in his rook time machine, to the famous 1836 battle. The Rook introduces himself to Davy Crockett, Colonel William Travis, Colonel James Bowie, and Parrish Dane, who he fights alongside defending The Alamo. The Rook desperately wants to save all the fighters at the Alamo, but even he and his modern weaponry could not survive the onslaught of the Mexican army. Although he cannot save Parrish Dane, The Rook saves a boy, who was fighting alongside Colonel Bowie. The Rook sweeps the boy, who is later revealed to be Bishop Dane, into his time machine and transports him to the day after the climatic Battle of the Alamo, ensuring the boy's survival. The boy appears to be the sole survivor of the Battle, except for The Rook. The Rook returns to Rook Manor, awash in failure, and in deep despair he could not fulfill his life's mission of saving his ancestor Parrish Dane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   VI.\n   <strong>\n    Roland Deschain\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   a.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Creation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   According to Defendant King, the character of Roland Deschain, also known as the Gunslinger, was developed over three decades, beginning in 1970.

Tolkien's\n   <em>\n    The Lord of the Rings\n   </em>\n   ; Robert Browning's poem, \"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came,\" which is about a young man, \"on a quest for a mysterious dark tower\" (Doc. 115-19, \u00b6 5);\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clint Eastwood's character, \"The Man With No Name\" featured in spaghetti westerns beginning in the 1960s, including the film\n   <em>\n    The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\n   </em>\n   ; and author Clifford Simak's science fiction novel\n   <em>\n    Ring Around the Sun\n   </em>\n   . (Doc. 115-19, \u00b6\u00b6 5-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant King purports to have had little to do with the illustrations of Roland. (Doc. 115-19, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16). He points out that the illustrations of The Gunslinger vary greatly from book to book and The Gunslinger played by actor Idris Elba in the film,\n   <em>\n    The Dark Tower\n   </em>\n   did not \"strictly conform\" to the image of Roland he wrote.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   b.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Gunslinger\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In the first installment of\n   <em>\n    The Dark Tower\n   </em>\n   series,\n   <em>\n    The Gunslinger\n   </em>\n   , Roland lives in a post-apocalyptic Mid-world. Mid-world is a parallel, alternate version of our world that is a compilation of familiar settings:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   the Old American West, a feudal society, a magical universe, wasteland and a distant fixture. Within Mid-world, there are remnants of familiar technologies and appliances such as defunct oil derricks, tanker trucks, robotics and machinery, and mostly empty but seemingly technologically advanced cities. In the Court's view, Mid-world may be considered as the hub, while all other parallel worlds are spokes off the central hub.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Roland is descended from Mid-world royalty, Arthur Eld, an architype of King Arthur. He has no living relatives. He can enter the consciousness of people and has the power to hypnotize. He is a deft and accurate shooter of his western-style revolvers and can reload them in an instant. Roland was born in a feudal city-state called Gilead. At the top of the feudal society were the Gunslingers, reminiscent of knights, who dressed like cowboys, and were lethal shots. Gilead falls, and only Roland was left alive, the last Gunslinger. His quest is to find the Dark Tower, the nexus of all worlds and the linchpin of space and time, and protect it from destruction by The Man in Black; who goes by different names and appears in different iterations, including Walter O'Dim, Randall Flagg, and Marten Broadcloak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   At the very least, Roland is a complex protagonist, who as the novels progress, is revealed to be an anti-hero, a profoundly tortured and flawed individual. He does not always do the \"right thing.\" His actions are, at best, ethically ambiguous. He smokes, drinks, lies, manipulates and commits crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For Instance, in\n   <em>\n    The Gunslinger\n   </em>\n   , Roland acts with depravity. Believing that a mad preacher, Sylvia Pittson, had engaged in sexual relations with the villainous Man in Black and is pregnant with a demon, Roland rapes her with a gun. Angry, Pittson sends her congregation after Roland. They are armed with stones, wood and other primitive weaponry. Roland starts shooting her congregation in self-defense, however it quickly turns to murder. By the end of the encounter, Roland has shot and killed 39 men, 14 women, including his lover, and five children. After the massacre, he goes to a honky-tonk, has burgers and beer and then falls asleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   One character who plays a major part in the series is Jake Chambers, who is introduced in\n   <em>\n    The Gunslinger\n   </em>\n   . Jake was from New York City and died when he was hit by a car. In an unexplained way, Jake is transported to Mid-world after his death. Roland hypnotizes Jake and grows to love him, but believes he is a trap set by the Man in Black. Roland promises to take care of Jake, all the while knowing he will eventually kill him. Eventually, Roland leaves a teetering Jake to fall to his death, choosing instead to pursue the Man in Black. Roland realizes he has damned himself. This act begins Roland's evolution from a heartless killer to a character capable of love and compassion.\n   <em>\n    The Dark Tower\n   </em>\n   series is not Roland's literal journey to the Dark Tower, but a morality play for Roland's inner quest for redemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Roland does travel between parallel worlds in the works. In\n   <em>\n    The Drawing of Three\n   </em>\n   , Roland sees three, magical stand-alone doors, with each leading to the mind of a person from New York City. The first door is to the mind of Eddie Dean; the second is to the mind of Odetta Susannah Holmes/Detta Walker, and the third is to the man who originally killed Jake. Eddie is a heroin addict, and Odetta is amputee with multiple personality disorder. Odetta's two personalities eventually merge, and she then calls herself Susannah. Eddie and Susannah become part of Roland's group. Roland, who at first cared little for others, begins to show compassion and reforms his ways. Roland eventually draws a\n   magic doorway and draws Jake back into Mid-world. Roland promises to protect Jake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Throughout his quest, Roland interacts with many science-fiction and supernatural elements, such as a monster that bites off two of his fingers, and a gang of cannibalistic mutants. Roland grows old throughout the series and is afflicted with rheumatism. His epic quest ends on a metaphysical tone. When he finally reaches the Dark Tower, he is faced with all of his sins. Roland learns his true adversary is himself. He is doomed to repeat his journey again and again, until he learns to change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   c.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Graphic Novels\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The graphic novels focus on the adventures of Roland in his quest for the Dark Tower. Most of the graphic novels center on the many trials and tribulations that transformed Roland from a young, learning gunslinger, to a hardened killer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   d.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Dark Tower Feature Film\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The actors Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey play Roland and The Man in Black in the 2017\n   <em>\n    The Dark Tower\n   </em>\n   movie. The movie deviates from the books. The main characters are Roland, Jake Chambers, and the Man in Black. The plot involves The Man in Black abducting psychic children to use their mental abilities, called \"the shine,\" to bring down the Tower, allowing darkness to reign. The first act features Jake being transported to Mid-world where he encounters Roland. The pair have a series of action-packed encounters. The Man in Black and Roland eventually fight in New York City, with Roland emerging victorious. Roland saves the Tower, Jake and the abducted children. The movie ends with Jake and Roland returning to Mid-world.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Movie Roland looks quite different than the Roland featured in the artwork in the novels and graphic novels. He is clad in tight, black leather. He is African American and does not age. A significant portion of the novels is spent examining Roland's past, this is less prevalent in the movie. Movie Roland is more one dimensional and goes through far less character development. The movie's theme is centered on external rather than internal redemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   VII.\n   <strong>\n    Analysis of Substantial Similarity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In an effort to illustrate the similarities between the two protagonists, Plaintiff describes that Roland Deschain, like The Rook,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   is a quasi-immortal time-traveling, monster-fighting, romantic adventure hero who descends from an immortal, is symbolized by a rook bird, dresses in cowboy garb despite not being from the Old West and who descends from Gilead, a homage to Goliad \"The Other Alamo\", who traverses time through dimensional doors connected to a tower who is in the aesthetical likeness of Restin Dane as well as having been similarly named consistent with an admitted signature symbolization device of Defendant King's....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   (Doc 115-41)( grammar errors in original).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"In determining whether a character in a second work infringes a cartoon character, courts have generally considered not only the visual resemblance but also the totality\n   of the characters' attributes and traits.\"\n   <em>\n    Warner Bros.

Analyzing most adventure heroes with such a high level of abstraction would lead to a finding of infringement. Plaintiff ignores the true details and context that makes each character unique in his own right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Witness Gale illuminated how a high level of abstraction and generalization can lead to an erroneous conclusion. To illustrate, he compared two movies:\n   <em>\n    The Wizard of Oz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Star Wars\n   </em>\n   . (Doc. 115-6, pg. 67). Both films feature main characters who lives with an Aunt and Uncle in a rural environment, leave home to go on a quest, are accompanied by a character made of metal important to the success of the quest (the Tin Man/C3PO Robot) and a hairy character (The Cowardly Lion/Wookie), and seeks a wise old man for help (The Wizard/Obi Wan Kenobi). The villains in both films dress completely in black (The Witch/Darth Vader) and wear distinctive headgear (Witch's hat/Darth Vader's helmet). Yet, no reasonable person would call the movies\n   <em>\n    Star Wars\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    The Wizard of Oz\n   </em>\n   substantially similar works. (Doc. 115-6, pg. 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   An illustration of this adage was made by the Eleventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    BUC International Corp. v.

As Plaintiff points out, they are the stories to be told. The Rook seeks to do the \"right thing.\" He is upbeat and motivated by a desire to correct history, and make things better. In other words, The Rook is a classic hero.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Roland, however, is not a classic hero. He is at times, dark and brooding. He kills in cold blood, leaves Jake to die, sacrifices those around him to reach the Dark Tower and is on a quest for redemption. While Roland and The Rook are both adventurers, the comparison stops there; the Court does not find the type of adventures, motivations for the adventures, or the characters' actions during the adventures to be substantially similar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   b.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Time Travel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Time travel is an element in both works. Defendants point out that Roland does not time travel; rather he \"visits parallel worlds that are not his own.\" (Doc. 120, Furth Deposition, pg. 50) That distinction in label notwithstanding, the act of entering different time periods plays a different role in each work. The Rook's desire to time travel and the adventures he has while time traveling are central storylines. Time travel is the hook; it is the thing that provides him adventure and a platform to succeed in adversarial situations. The Rook uses time travel in attempt to correct perceived wrongs in history, or to save\n   those he loves. This is best illustrated by some of the catchy headlines associated with The Rook's comics: \"His time ... was any time! Every time!\" and \"The Master of the Past, Present and Future!\" The Rook can choose what time period he would like to travel to. For example, he travels to 1836 and the Battle of the Alamo. The Rook is technologically savvy. The machine most used in the\n   <em>\n    Eerie\n   </em>\n   series look like a rook chess piece or a castle. It is time travel in the classic sense; he gets into a machine and arrives in a different time. Usually, The Rook can travel through time whenever and wherever he chooses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In Roland's quest for the Dark Tower, time travel is not the adventure itself and is less central to the plot. Time travel is a means to an end. When he does travel, Roland does not use a time machine. Rather he travels through literal doorways to parallel worlds connected to a particular character. The worlds are not always synchronized in time, and the portals are sometimes thin, so that the parallel worlds mingle. Roland has no control over where and when he will travel to. Likewise, Roland cannot choose where the portals lead, only whether to enter them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The element of time travel in each work is not substantially similar. Even if this Court found that the element of time travel was a similarity between the two works, time travel in the general sense, is hardly a unique, original expression.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the films\n   <em>\n    The Time Traveler's Wife, Kate and Leopold, Back to the Future, The Time Machine\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Midnight in Paris\n   </em>\n   . At least one court has found that involuntary time travel is so pervasive, that it is not subject to copyright protection.\n   <em>\n    Feldman v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4096984\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/723/357/#p366\">\n    723 F.Supp.2d 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 366 (D. Mass 2010) (noting that warning signs of upcoming time travel, after effects showing time traveling is complete, a tragic romance related to time traveling, and significant consequences as a result of time travel are\n   <em>\n    sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire\n   </em>\n   or stock scenes in the portrayal of time travel).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   c.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gunslingers\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiff claims that both Roland and Restin \"descend from a familial line of gunslingers.\" Gunslingers as imagined by popular culture are personified by The Rook and Bishop Dane, someone in the American West who carried a gun and was an excellent, quick shot. However, what it means to be a gunslinger on Mid-world is independently defined by Defendant King within\n   <em>\n    The Dark Tower\n   </em>\n   novels and contains only some pop-culture elements. As imagined by Defendant King, Gunslingers are a caste of elite, aristocratic gunfighters who train from childhood to be heroes. They have a code of honor. Roland is a descendent of royalty, and his father was a leader of the gunslinger caste.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Readers do not learn about The Rook's immediate ancestral history in\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   . However, readers do learn that his great, great grandfather Bishop Dane was performing as a classic, western, gun fighter before he met The Rook. While both The Rook and Roland have a familial history of gun fighting, those histories manifest in different ways and are not substantially similar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   d.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Towers\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Rook and Roland are similar to the extent that medieval towers play a large role in their adventures. However, the looks and function of each tower are different. Rook Manor is The Rook's lair. It is\n   his tower-shaped home base where he stores his time machines, keeps his robots, watches recordings of his travels called \"time tapes,\" and rests between adventures. The tower time machine serves as a vehicle by which The Rook goes on his time traveling adventures. Both towers look like cartoonish versions of their namesake, the rook chess piece.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Roland's Dark Tower serves as the linchpin of a time and space continuum; not a home, not a time machine. Its look is gothic, ornate and menacing. It is often featured rising out of a swath of hazy fog. In the illustrations, the Tower is often set far in the background, reminding readers that Roland is nomadic; his quest is long; and his redemption distant. The towers are not alike, and do not serve like roles in each work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   e.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Romantic\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Plaintiff claims that a point of similarity between the characters is that both The Rook and Roland romantically interact with women. Even if having a protagonist who has romantic interactions with women is an original expression, The Rook and Roland's interactions with women could not be more different While Roland softens as his adventures continue, his interactions with women are often shocking and violent. He impregnates his first and only love Susan Delgado and then leaves her. She is then burned alive as he escapes, illustrating the sacrifices he is willing to make in his quest for the Dark Tower. His rape of Pittson with his firearm is shocking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Rook is classically dashing and romantic. For example, In\n   <em>\n    Eerie 83\n   </em>\n   , The Rook is romantically interested in January Boone and Kate McCall. When trouble ensues, Ms. Boone pleads with The Rook to keep himself safe and return to her. The pair then share a kiss. Later, while landing a punch against Hawkins and his allies, The Rook cheekily says, \"This one is for Kate,\" \"This one is for Jan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   f.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Bad Guy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiff points out that the nemesis of both characters is \"the man in black.\" (Doc. 6, pg. 26, # 14). What Plaintiff means is that both characters' nemesis wears black. However, both versions of Plaintiff's assertion are misstatements. The Rook, as he is featured in\n   <em>\n    Eerie\n   </em>\n   , has varied enemies. While it is true Hawkin makes an appearance in multiple episodes, the villain The Rook is tasked with defeating depends on the time traveling adventure he finds himself in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Roland's nemesis throughout the books, though known by multiple names and incarnations is one being, The Man in Black. The Man in Black seeks to destroy the Dark Tower and bring chaos to Mid-world. Roland has one constant and animating enemy throughout his quest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Even if both characters had one significant adversary in their quests that only wore black, this is hardly original expression; Venom (\n   <em>\n    Spiderman\n   </em>\n   ), Darth Vader (\n   <em>\n    Star Wars\n   </em>\n   ), Black Manta (\n   <em>\n    Acquaman\n   </em>\n   ) and The Wicked Witch of the West (\n   <em>\n    The Wizard of Oz\n   </em>\n   ) are all villains who wear black.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   g.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Overall Look\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Rook and Roland's looks are similar. They both wear western gear and recall imagery of the Old American West. However, neither look is original or distinguished. The overall look of each protagonist is a mishmash of stock elements or\n   <em>\n    sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire\n   </em>\n   of western heroes. Surviving Rook co-creator, Stenstrum's testimony is illustrative of this point (Doc. 115-60). Stenstrum testified that Mr. William Bill DuBay asked Stenstrum to make a costume\n   for The Rook that he could quickly show Warren Publishing. Within minutes, knowing the comic was a Western, he \"grabbed things [he] remembered from the past.\" (Doc. 115-60, pg. 53). Stenstrum best explains his inspiration for the look of The Rook:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   There was the vest and the shirt from Rod Taylor\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it was-the hat I remembered from a TV show. I'm not sure if it's the proper one, but it had a very interesting look. It was a -it had these kind of disks that were put together to form a kind of a band and it was a .... Anyway, I had taken that and I threw that hat together and - the black I took from-I always like Paladin from -the big old hat from \"Have Gun - Will Travel.[\"]\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   So I made him pretty much all black except for the white shirt ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   (Doc. 115-60, pgs. 53-54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   According to Defendant King, he did not create or supervise the illustrations or cover art for any of\n   <em>\n    The Dark Tower\n   </em>\n   novels, the film or the graphic novels. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 115-19).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even assuming he had, the Court notes that Roland appears differently in each novel, each graphic novel, each version of the same novel. However, the look is similar at its core, a western, or cowboy looking loner in often desolate or eerie surroundings (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 115-32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Rook's look, that of a cowboy, is the customary, stock-treatment given to those characters set in the old west or worlds similar to the old west, it is the definition of\n   <em>\n    sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire. See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zalewski v. Cicero Builder Dev., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 754 F.3d at 102 (\"[E]lements of a work that are 'indispensable, or at least standard, the treatment of a given topic'- like cowboys, bank robbers, and shootouts in the American West-get no protection.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hoehling v.

The characters do not have unique looks. One would expect a character who lives in Mid-world, akin to the Old West, to wear western gear.
