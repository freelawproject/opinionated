(ECF No. 72.) The Board filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, admitting liability on Plaintiff's as-applied challenge but opposing Plaintiff's facial challenge. (ECF No. 79 ). The Court has jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and all parties consent to the jurisdiction of a U.S. Magistrate Judge under FED. R. CIV. P. 73(b). For the following reasons, the Court grants the Board's motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff's facial challenge to the Practice laws, and grants Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment with respect to all other issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The material facts are not in dispute. Plaintiff is a resident of Washington County, Oregon, a lawful permanent resident of the United States, and a citizen of the Kingdom of Sweden. (Compl. \u00b6 8; Answer \u00b6 7.) Plaintiff earned the equivalent of a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in Sweden and has spent his career working in the field of electronics. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-15; Answer \u00b6 9.) He does not have a professional engineering license to practice in any state. (Compl. \u00b6 28; Answer \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In May 2013, Plaintiff became interested in traffic light timing after his wife received a \"red-light-camera\" ticket. (Compl. \u00b6 11; Answer \u00b6 9.) Plaintiff spent three years analyzing the standard method for calculating the duration of a yellow light and found that the formula failed to account\n   for drivers who must slow down to make a legal turn. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-17; Answer \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In September 2014, Plaintiff emailed the Board and asked for \"support and help\" in an attempt to further his research and broadcast his findings. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-25; Answer \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.) The Board responded two days later, informing Plaintiff that he violated engineering laws by referring to himself as an \"electronics engineer\" and stating \"I'm an engineer.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-27; Answer \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.) The Board advised Plaintiff to stop using those titles until he registered with the Board. (Compl. \u00b6 29; Answer \u00b6 23.) Undeterred, Plaintiff continued to discuss his ideas with the public, including the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying, the\n   <em>\n    60 Minutes\n   </em>\n   news program, a local news station, and the physicist who created the original traffic light timing formula. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-32; Answer \u00b6 23.) In at least one of those communications, Plaintiff described himself as an \"engineer,\" including in further emails to the Board. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-38; Answer \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 12, 2015, the Board's Law Enforcement Committee conducted a preliminary evaluation and voted to open a \"law enforcement case\" against Plaintiff. (Compl. \u00b6 43; Answer \u00b6 32.) In November 2016, the Board imposed a $ 500 civil penalty for Plaintiff's violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20672.020\">\n    Or.

Specifically, the Board concluded that Plaintiff violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20672.020\">\n    Or. Rev.

(Mats J\u00e4rlstr\u00f6m Decl., Ex. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 13-17.) Plaintiff paid the $ 500 penalty. (J\u00e4rlstr\u00f6m Decl. \u00b6 26.) On January 10, 2017, the Board issued its Final Order finding Plaintiff in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20672.020\">\n    Or.

(J\u00e4rlstr\u00f6m Decl., Ex. 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In April 2017, Plaintiff filed this case alleging that Oregon's engineering practice and title laws violate the First Amendment's Speech and Petition Clauses both facially and as applied to Plaintiff. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 103-146; Answer \u00b6\u00b6 76-116.) On August 18, 2017, the Board refunded the $ 500 fine to Plaintiff. (J\u00e4rlstr\u00f6m Decl., Ex. 17.) Plaintiff moved for summary judgment in May 2018. (Mot. for Summ. J.) The Board filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, asking the Court to provide only as-applied relief. (Mot. for Summ. J.; Resp. to Mot. for Summ. J.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Here, Plaintiff has not demonstrated a realistic danger that the Practice\n   laws will significantly compromise the First Amendment rights of parties not before the Court. Aside from Plaintiff's successful as-applied challenge here, Plaintiff points only to the Board's enforcement actions against Dale La Forest and Suji Somasundaram as evidence of the Practice laws' potentially unconstitutional reach. (Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 22.) In Plaintiff's view, the Board punished La Forest and Somasundaram simply for their speech critical of public projects. (Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 21.) However, the record reflects that, unlike Plaintiff here, La Forest and Somasundaram did not engage in engineering on their own behalf.
