Ala. Aug. 23, 2018) (\"An entity attempting to collect a debt will not generate phone numbers randomly or sequentially without regard to whether the person being called owes the company money. In that regard, an entity like Nationstar will always make its collection calls with reference to a relatively narrow, predetermined list of telephone numbers. But this fact does not prevent the TCPA from applying to Nationstar's predictive collection calls. Again, Nationstar's proposed interpretation of the TCPA is too restrictive.\").\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramos v. Hopele of Fort Lauderdale, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527371\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/334/1262/#p1265\">\n    334 F.Supp.3d 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1265-66 (S.D. Fla. 2018) (reasoning that whether or not a device is an ATDS depends on how much human-directed actions are required by the system, ruling at summary judgment that \"the undisputed facts establish that the EZ-Texting system could not send the text messages at issue without a significant amount of human involvement\" and therefore was not an automatic dialer under the TCPA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To sufficiently plead the ATDS element of a TCPA claim, a plaintiff may not merely recite the statutory elements of\n   the use of an ATDS or prerecorded voice without alleging additional facts to support those facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johansen v. Vivant, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206590551\">\n    2012 WL 6590551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *3 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 18, 2012) (\"Use of an ATDS and the pre-recorded nature of the messages are not legal conclusions, they are facts. Still, when a fact is itself an element of the claim, as is the case here, it is not sufficient to recite that fact verbatim without other supporting details.\"). Here, upon consideration, the Court concludes that Plaintiff's Complaint includes sufficient allegations that support his claim that the calls were autodialed and/or prerecorded. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant made upwards of 310 calls to Plaintiff's cellular telephone. \u00b6 30. Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant ignored Plaintiff's numerous demands that Defendant cease calling, which also suggests that Defendant was autodialing Plaintiff. \u00b6 26. Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss the TCPA claim for failure to allege the use of an ATDS shall be denied. Defendant may raise the issue of whether an ATDS was used at summary judgment, after the opportunity to conduct discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff's TCPA claim fails because debt collection calls are not covered by the TCPA. The Court rejects this argument. As explained by a recent district court opinion where Defendant Ocwen argued this precise issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   While the Court agrees with Ocwen that the 2003 and 2008 Orders were vacated to the extent that the Court cannot apply the definitions of capacity or ATDS contained in those Orders, the Court disagrees with Ocwen's argument that other portions of those orders are also invalid. That is the premise of Ocwen's first argument why Gonzalez's TCPA claim should be dismissed: the TCPA does not apply to it because the 2003 Order which first applied the TCPA to debt collection calls is now invalid. But just because one aspect of an FCC order is vacated does not mean that the entire order has been vacated. As proof, this Court need look no further than\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l,\n   </em>\n   in which the D.C. Circuit vacated two portions of the FCC's 2015 Order but upheld two other portions.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/#p691\">\n    885 F.3d at 691-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ocwen has provided no authority for this Court to throw out the entirety of the 2003 Order-including the portion determining that the TCPA applies to debt collectors-as opposed to excising only the offending portion of the 2003 Order that the D.C. Circuit held is invalid. Instead, the Court concludes it is bound under the Hobbs Act to apply the FCC's rule that the TCPA does apply to calls made by debt collectors.\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.
