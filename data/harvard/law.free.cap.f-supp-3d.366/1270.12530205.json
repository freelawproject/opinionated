Kelly, Inc., d/b/a Kelly's Brew Pub and Restaurant and DB Brewery LLC's (collectively, \"the Kelly's Defendants\") Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 53), and Plaintiffs West American Insurance Company and Peerless Indemnity Insurance Company's (collectively, \"the Insurers\") Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 74). Together, the motions seek summary judgment for all claims contained in the Insurers' Complaint for Declaratory Judgment (Doc. 1) and the Kelly's Defendants' Counterclaim (Doc. 50).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties dispute whether several insurance policies require the Insurers to defend and indemnify the Kelly's Defendants in state court actions where it is alleged that they improperly withheld tips, underpaid servers at Kelly's Brew Pub, and violated the City of Albuquerque Minimum Wage Ordinance (MWO). The Insurers seek a declaratory judgment that they are not obligated to defend nor indemnify\n   the Kelly's Defendants in the underlying lawsuits. The Kelly's Defendants argue that the Insurers have a duty to defend the underlying actions and thus have breached their contract, acted in bad faith, and violated the New Mexico Unfair Insurance Practices Act (UIPA) by refusing to defend the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Underlying State Lawsuits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In April 2016, former employees of Kelly's Brew Pub brought suit in state court, alleging that the Kelly's Defendants had been violating the MWO by withholding or requiring servers to pay back their earned tips, not paying servers the correct minimum wage, and failing to keep required payroll records. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39-45.) That case-\n   <em>\n    Atyani v. Bonfantine\n   </em>\n   -is currently pending in the Second Judicial District Court, Bernalillo County, New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D-202-CV-2016-02775. In February 2017, a different former employee filed suit against the Kelly's Defendants alleging similar violations of the MWO.\n   <em>\n    See Frank v. Bonfantine\n   </em>\n   , D-202-CV-2017-00852. In November 2017, the\n   <em>\n    Frank\n   </em>\n   case was resolved through settlement and the state court dismissed\n   <em>\n    Frank\n   </em>\n   with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Stipulated Order Gr. Dismissal with Prejudice (2nd Jud. Dist., Bernalillo Cty., N.M. Nov. 13, 2017). (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Docs. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 47-49; 53 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Insurers issued various insurance policies to DB Brewery LLC d/b/a Kelly's Brew Pub, and the policies were in effect during the period when the alleged MWO violations occurred. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 32-34.) The relevant portions of both the Peerless and West policies include identical language covering property damage if the damage \"is caused by an 'occurrence' that takes place in the 'coverage territory.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) The policies specifically exclude property damage that is \"expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The policies define an \"occurrence\" as an \"accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Property damage\" is defined to include \"[l]oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 53 at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Kelly's Defendants informed the Insurers of the suits and sought defense on the theory that the claims in\n   <em>\n    Frank\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Atyani\n   </em>\n   allege \"property damage\" covered by the policies. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 51; Docs. 50 \u00b6 51; 50-1, Ex. A.) The Insurers twice declined to defend the underlying actions on the basis that allegations of wage withholding and other MWO violations do not involve property damage resulting from an occurrence and, even if they did, would be further excluded from policy coverage as intended or expected harms. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 1 \u00b6 52; 53 at 8-10.) In July 2017, the Kelly's Defendants again demanded that the Insurers defend them in the\n   <em>\n    Atyani\n   </em>\n   suit. (Doc. 50-1 at 1-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Insurers' Complaint for Declaratory Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 18, 2017, the Insurers filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment Relief seeking a ruling from this Court declaring the parties' rights and obligations under the policies. (Doc. 1.) The Complaint specifically urges the Court to find that the Insurers have no duty to defend nor indemnify the Kelly's Defendants in the underlying suits because the relevant insurance policies do not cover the claims asserted in\n   <em>\n    Frank\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Atyani.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-\n   14.) The Kelly's Defendants moved to dismiss the declaratory action, arguing that the Court should decline to issue a declaratory judgment on coverage until the ongoing state case has more fully developed the facts in dispute-e.g., whether the alleged tip withholding occurred at all or occurred intentionally. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 15 at 4-5.) The Court disagreed, holding that \"federal declaratory relief is the most efficient and logical way to settle the present coverage dispute and will not conflict with any subsequent fact development in the underlying\n   <em>\n    Atyani\n   </em>\n   case.\" (Doc. 73 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Kelly's Defendants' Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In answering the Insurers' complaint for declaratory judgment, the Kelly's Defendants also filed a counterclaim alleging that the Insurers: (1) breached their contract by declining to defend and indemnify the Kelly's Defendants in the underlying suits; (2) acted in bad faith by failing to adequately investigate the underlying suits and ultimately declining to defend them; and (3) violated the UIPA by, among other things, failing to promptly respond to communications and provide a reasonable explanation for refusing to defend the claims. (Doc. 50 at 17-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Both parties have moved for summary judgment on the question of whether the Insurers have a duty to defend the Kelly's Defendants in the underlying suits. (Docs. 53; 74.) The Kelly's Defendants also moved for partial summary judgment on Count I of their Counterclaim, urging the Court to find as a matter of law that the Insurers breached their contract by refusing to defend the underlying suits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 53 at 2, 20.) However, the Kelly's Defendants assert that the issue of indemnity should not be decided until the underlying actions have resolved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-22.) The Insurers seek summary judgment in their favor as to all counts of the Counterclaim, on the theory that they have no duty to defend and thus could not have breached their contractual duty, acted in bad faith, or violated the UIPA in declining to do so. (Doc. 74 at 21-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when the Court, viewing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, determines \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The Duty to Defend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The question at the heart of these motions is whether the Insurers had a duty to defend the Kelly's Defendants in the underlying lawsuits.

Having reviewed both parties' motions for summary judgment on the issue of the Insurers' duty to defend, the Court finds that there are no material facts in dispute\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and this issue is\n   properly resolved through summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court finds that while the underlying complaints allege at least some facts that arguably show \"property damage\" resulting from an \"occurrence\" sufficient to obligate the Insurers to defend the lawsuits, the alleged harm was the type of result intended or expected by the Kelly's Defendants in crafting their tip policy, and is thus clearly outside the scope of coverage per the provision excluding \"expected or intended injury.\" Thus, the Insurers properly declined to defend the underlying actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The underlying actions potentially allege \"property damage\" as defined in the policies.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The policies define \"property damage\" as \"[l]oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\" (Docs. 1 \u00b6 36; 53 at 4-5.) Though the Insurers believe that addressing the issue of whether there was potential \"property damage\" in the underlying suits \"puts the proverbial cart before the horse\" (Doc. 58 at 13), the Court finds that it makes more sense to determine at the outset whether the underlying complaints allege a type of injury that could be covered by the insurance policies at all. The Kelly's Defendants argue that the underlying suits allege \"the loss of tangible property, i.e., tips in the form of cash, as a result of the Kelly's Defendants' alleged conduct.\" (Doc. 53 at 13.) They point out that \"numerous courts\" in various jurisdictions have held that cash may be considered tangible property subject to \"property damage\" under commercial insurance policies, and that New Mexico courts have considered cash to be \"tangible property\" in other, non-insurance contexts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Insurers, on the other hand, argue that courts that have addressed \"the question directly-i.e., are employees' tips considered tangible property-have answered it in the negative.\" (Doc. 58 at 13.) They emphasize that New Mexico courts have not considered cash tips to be tangible property \"except in the very limited, inapplicable, context of the statutory construction of New Mexico's garnishment statute.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) The Insurers cite alternative definitions of tangible property as \"corporeal\" and \"[t]hat which may be felt or touched\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and point to examples of courts in other jurisdictions holding that salaries and economic interests do not constitute tangible property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-17 (gathering cases).) The Insurers also argue that the MWO itself defines tips as a \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     sum\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   presented by a customer as a gift or gratuity,\" and that the underlying lawsuits seek the return of those\n   <em>\n    sums\n   </em>\n   that were allegedly withheld, not the return of the actual cash and coins given to them by customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The parties' plentiful citations to persuasive caselaw on both sides of the issue suggest from the start that the issue is not clearly settled under New Mexico law and that cash tips do not clearly fall outside the definition of \"tangible property\" such that loss of cash tips could never be covered\n   under the policies. Indeed, the Insurers essentially concede the point by stating that \"[c]ases relied upon by Defendants may be viewed for the proposition that cash in the form of actual currency\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      may, in certain circumstances\n     </em>\n     ,\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   constitute tangible property under an insurance policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) Though the Insurers make a strong argument that the tips in the underlying cases are not \"tangible property\" for insurance purposes, their concession that they\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be treated as such in certain circumstances makes clear that, on this issue, the underlying complaints might \"arguably\" or \"possibly\" fall under the scope of policy coverage for \"property damage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Second Amended Complaint in\n   <em>\n    Atyani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   for example, contains various factual and legal allegations that could fall under the scope of coverage if there is any possibility that the state court would consider cash tips tangible property.

The fact that at least some of the alleged injuries include loss of cash, combined with the genuine debate over whether cash tips constitute \"tangible property,\" mean that this prong of the analysis leans toward the Insurers having a duty to defend the underlying suits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The potential \"property damage\" arguably resulted from an \"occurrence\" as defined in the policies.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Insurers argue that, even if cash tips could potentially be considered tangible property, the underlying state lawsuits do not allege an \"occurrence\" that would bring them under the policies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 74 at 4.) The policies cover property damage \"only if ... [the] 'property damage' is caused by an 'occurrence' that takes place in the 'coverage territory[.]' \" (Doc. 1 \u00b6 36). \"Occurrence\" is defined as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 53 at 4-5.) The Insurers argue that, because \"accident\" is not defined under the policies, it should be \"interpreted in its usual, ordinary[,] and popular sense.\" (Doc. 74 at 12 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Battishill v.

According to the Insurers, because the Kelly's Defendants affirmatively designed and implemented the policy by which tips were allegedly misappropriated, the alleged harm was not the result of an accident in any ordinary sense of the word. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 74 at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Kelly's Defendants argue that the definition of \"accident\" is actually much broader, as the New Mexico Court of Appeals recognized in holding that faulty workmanship may be considered an accident constituting an \"occurrence\" in the insurance context. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 53 at 15 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pulte Homes of N.M., Inc. v. Ind. Lumbermens Ins.

Further, they point out that the term \"accident\" is undefined and ambiguous in the policy, and thus should be construed against the Insurers when considering a duty to defend. (Doc. 61 at 4.) The Kelly's Defendants assert that the MWO can certainly be violated by accident. (Doc. 78 at 13.) They argue that \"the ordinary usage of 'accident' does not exclude intentional\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     acts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ; it can include unexpected results, caused by carelessness or ignorance, of intentional acts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) For example, the Kelly's Defendants argue, the\n   <em>\n    Pulte Homes\n   </em>\n   court found that the workmanship in that case \"was not unintended; it was just bad[, which] was enough to allege an accident, and therefore an occurrence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (discussing\n   <em>\n    Pulte Homes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=367%20P.3d%20869\">\n    367 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   878 ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court finds that, like the question of whether cash tips could be considered \"tangible property,\" whether the harms alleged as a result of the Kelly's Defendants' tip policy could arguably derive from an \"accident\" and thus an \"occurrence\" is debatable enough under New Mexico law to create a duty to defend in the underlying actions.

The alleged \"property damage\" was intended or expected from the standpoint of the Kelly's Defendants, and thus falls clearly outside policy coverage.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   However, though the complaints in the underlying suits arguably allege harms that would be covered by the Insurers' policies based on \"property damage\" resulting from an \"occurrence,\" New Mexico law is clear that the \"expected or intended injury\" policy exclusion removes the underlying claims from coverage. The policies include an exclusionary provision that states: \"This insurance does not apply to ... 'property damage' expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\" (Doc. 1 \u00b6 36.) The Insurers argue that this exclusion applies to the claims in the underlying lawsuits because \"the injuries that the underlying plaintiffs allege are of the same general type that may be expected to result from Defendants' tip policy, including the taking of tips of their employees.\" (Doc. 74 at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Kelly's Defendants counter that the exclusion does not relieve the Insurers of their duty to defend because \"[n]one of the state court claims requires proof that the Kelly's Defendants expected or intended the loss.\" (Doc. 53 at 16.) Because the underlying actions do not allege violations of the law that require intent to harm or interfere with the rights of others, the Kelly's Defendants conclude that the exclusion for intended or expected harm does not preclude the Insurers from defending the suits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-18.)

New Mexico Public School Insurance Authority\n   </em>\n   , the court explained that while policy exclusions are indeed narrowly construed, their applicability is based on the\n   <em>\n    acts underlying\n   </em>\n   the theory of recovery, not the legal elements of the claim for recovery itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1552540\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/117/207/\">\n    870 P.2d at 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In assessing whether the plaintiff's underlying civil rights complaint was based on excluded acts of sexual misconduct, the\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   court looked not at the elements of\n   a civil rights violation but at the underlying actions leading to the complaint, and explained that \"[i]n determining the applicability of [an] exclusion, [the] focus must be on the\n   <em>\n    origin\n   </em>\n   of the damages,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    legal theory\n   </em>\n   asserted for recovery.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1552540\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/117/207/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Here,\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   applies to negate the Kelly's Defendants' argument that\n   <em>\n    Knowles\n   </em>\n   does not govern because the underlying legal theories of recovery do not carry an element requiring intent to harm. Instead, looking to the origin of the damages asserted in\n   <em>\n    Atyani\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Frank\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that the implementation of the \"tip-out\" policy requiring servers to pay the Kelly's Defendants some or all of their cash tips was an intentional act, and the Kelly's Defendants intended the same general type of outcome-taking the servers' tips-that allegedly harmed the servers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knowles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"723227\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/113/703/\">\n    832 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   398 ;\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1552540\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/117/207/\">\n    870 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   747 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hartford Fire Ins.

The defendants \"may not have expected to flood [plaintiff's] property, but they intended to divert the water from the Brown Arroyo.\"). The Kelly's Defendants' arguments that there is no evidence they kept or intended to keep the tips for themselves are irrelevant in determining duty to defend-the relevant act is taking the servers' cash tips away from them, not whether they intended to harm the servers or actually benefitted themselves by doing so. (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 78 at 6.) Thus, finding no duty to defend under these facts is squarely in line with controlling New Mexico Supreme Court precedent in\n   <em>\n    Knowles\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Thus, as the Court has found that the Insurers do not have the broader duty to defend in the underlying\n   <em>\n    Atyani\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Frank\n   </em>\n   state suits, they have no duty to indemnify the Kelly's Defendants for those claims either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The breach of contract claim (Count I) is based on the Insurers' refusal to defend and indemnify the Kelly's Defendants in the underlying lawsuits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) As the Court finds as a matter of law that the Insurers have no duty to defend or indemnify, it follows that the Insurers did not breach their contract with the Kelly's Defendants by declining to defend or\n   indemnify them in the suits. Thus, the Court resolves Count I in favor of the Insurers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Insurers have moved for summary judgment as to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   counts in the Kelly's Defendants' Counterclaim, while the Kelly's Defendants moved for summary judgment only on Count I. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 74 at 1; 53 at 2.) Thus, the Court must decide if there is a genuine dispute as to any material fact regarding the Kelly's Defendants' claims of bad faith (Count II) and violations of the UIPA (Count III), viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Kelly's Defendants as the nonmoving party. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"731636\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/114/695/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The Insurers argue that the bad faith claim must fail as a matter of law because \"[t]he concept of bad faith or failure to pay in the insurance context does not arise unless there is a contractual duty to pay under the policy.\" (Doc. 74 at 21 (citing\n   <em>\n    Charter Servs., Inc. v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 78 at 6-9.) The Kelly's Defendants do not, however, point to any caselaw suggesting that an insurance company can act in bad faith in denying a claim\n   <em>\n    even in the absence of a duty to defend or indemnify.\n   </em>\n   Each of the Kelly's Defendants' legal arguments in response to the Insurers' motion for summary judgment on the bad faith claim assert only that a duty to defend exists and the Insurers thus declined to defend in bad faith. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23.) To the extent that the Kelly's Defendants argue that a bad faith claim can exist in regard to the sufficiency of the investigation leading up to the denial of defense, even if the denial was correct, they have not pointed to New Mexico caselaw supporting such an argument. To the contrary, a 2006 decision in this District explicitly held the opposite:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   According to [the insured], even though the Policy did not provide coverage ..., Allstate could still be held liable for a bad faith claim if their investigation was not sufficient to make that determination. This Court rejects this argument.

The Court agrees, and finds that, as the Insurers had no duty to defend in the underlying lawsuits, they could not have acted in bad faith in reaching that decision. The Court will resolve Count II in favor of the Insurers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Kelly's Defendants do, however, allege various facts that appear to support a claim under the UIPA. Their list of \"Additional Facts Precluding Summary Judgment\" allege that: the Insurers waited a year to file the declaratory action after first denying coverage; Peerless Insurance Company never issued a denial letter; the Insurers' claims specialists made no effort to determine whether the\n   underlying complaints might actually fall within policy coverage under New Mexico law; the underlying class action complaints should have been referred to the Insurers' corporate office but were not; claims specialists did not speak with the Kelly's Defendants before denying coverage; claims specialists failed to sufficiently investigate the claims; and claims specialists failed to comply with industry standards. (Doc. 78 at 6-9.) The Kelly's Defendants also produced an expert report on industry practice for insurance claims professionals to support their factual assertions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 78-9), and have supplemented the record with deposition testimony from several of the Insurers' claims specialists describing how they handled the claims (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 77).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Kelly's Defendants then argue that the facts described above provide a basis for their claim that the Insurers violated the UIPA, NMSA 1978, \u00a7 59A-16-20, because the facts demonstrate \"a failure to acknowledge and act promptly with respect to the claims, a failure to adopt and implement reasonable standards for claim handling, a failure to act in good faith, and a failure to promptly provide a reasonable explanation for denials of coverage.\" (Doc. 78 at 23.) The Kelly's Defendants argue that \"Peerless's failure to send any denial letter until filing suit over a year after being notified of the suit is by itself sufficient to deny summary judgment on these counterclaims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Insurers dispute most of the Kelly's Defendants' additional facts, taking particular issue with their characterization of the record and the testimony of claims specialists. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 86 at 3-6.) The Insurers argue that the Kelly's Defendants' \"expert does not identify industry publications or the like setting out the standards that they claim are accepted industry standards[,]\" and offer a report from their own expert opining that the Insurers did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   violate industry standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6; Doc. 86-3.) The Insurers do not, however, point to a lack of genuine dispute as to facts material to the UIPA claim, nor point to any cases showing, as a matter of law, that the Kelly's Defendants cannot pursue a claim for UIPA violations if the Insurers had no duty to defend the underlying lawsuits. Though the Insurers imply that\n   <em>\n    New York Life Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   stands for this proposition (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 74 at 22), a closer reading reveals that the case simply holds that a lack of duty to defend would necessarily moot \"\n   <em>\n    a generalized claim of 'bad faith'\n   </em>\n   for Unfair Claims Practices\" as defined in the UIPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205634117\">\n    2017 WL 5634117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Counterclaim alleges specific violations of the UIPA beyond a generalized claim of bad faith, including that the Insurers failed to acknowledge and act promptly on communications, failed to adopt and implement reasonable standards, and failed to provide a reasonable explanation of the basis relied upon for denying defense. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 50 at 20.) When faced with a motion for summary judgment, the Kelly's Defendants met their burden by laying out additional facts in support of their claims, numerous citations to the record, deposition testimony, and an expert report. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 78 at 6-9; 78-1 through 78-9.) Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, there appears to be a genuine factual dispute, at the very least, as to whether the Insurers sufficiently investigated claims, communicated with policyholders, and implemented reasonable standards for handling claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205634117\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 86 at 2-6.) To the extent that the Insurers argue the UIPA allegations do not meet the\n   <em>\n    Twombly/Iqbal\n   </em>\n   pleading standard (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 86 at 12), the Court is not\n   persuaded of this and is unwilling to entertain such arguments since the Insurers chose not to file a motion to dismiss asserting those claims in full. Finally, the Court declines to determine as a matter of law whether punitive damages are potentially available under the UIPA claim.
