The victim called the police and underwent a medical evaluation. DNA evidence collected during her medical evaluation was found to match Richard Beckham's buccal swab. A jury convicted Beckham of attempted predatory sexual assault. This federal habeas petition follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The 26-year-old victim testified that, on May 20, 2009, she left a friend's birthday celebration in Brooklyn and rode the subway to her stop in Queens. Trial Tr., Victim Test., ECF No. 12-3 (\"Victim Test.\"), at 449-52. As she exited the station at 63\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Drive around 4 a.m., an unknown man began speaking to her and followed her as she walked towards home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 453. The man then sped up, grabbed her from behind, put his hand over her mouth to prevent her from screaming, and dragged her into a stairwell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 453-54, 472. He announced his intention to \"make love to [her]\" and demanded that she lie on the ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 454-55, 458, 460, 480. Shocked, disgusted, and not \"on top of [her] game\" after drinking beer that night, the victim did not resist.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 455, 459-60, 472, 479-80. The man proceeded to pull down her pants and attempt penetration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 454-56. Unable to maintain an erection, the man eventually gave up and walked back in the direction of Queens Boulevard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 456-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The victim, walking in the opposite direction, dialed 911 and reported the attack.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 457, 467, 485. Police and an EMT reported to the crime scene.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 485-87. The victim was then transported to the hospital via ambulance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 458, 486. An emergency room physician examined the victim and collected a buccal swab, vaginal swab, and anal swab as part of a rape kit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 459; Trial Tr., Newstead Test., ECF No. 12-4, at 665-70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 19, 2009, law enforcement received an investigatory lead on the offender's identity, resulting in Beckham becoming a suspect and his subsequent arrest in connection with this sexual assault. Trial Tr., Aquaviva Test., ECF No. 12-3, at 566-67. Sixteen months following Beckham's arraignment, the prosecution was granted permission to obtain a buccal swab from Beckham for the purpose of comparing it to the DNA profiles generated from the victim's underwear and pantyliner stains on the night of the attack. Opp'n Pet. Writ Habeas Corpus, ECF No. 11, at 28-29. Kerry Annitto, a forensic biologist and Level 3 criminalist employed by the Office of Chief Medical Examiner's (\"OCME\"), analyzed the DNA evidence and reported a match. Trial Tr., Annitto Test., ECF No. 12-4 (\"Annitto Test.\"), at 592, 607.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At trial, the prosecution presented the following evidence: a surveillance videotape showing the victim walking next to a man around 4:30 a.m. and then walking off screen before any physical contact occurred, photographs of the stairwell where the victim was led, the victim's 911 call, the OCME criminalist's testimony regarding the DNA match between the samples collected and Beckham's buccal swab, and the victim's testimony regarding the assault. Beckham's defense consisted of two main theories: First, the victim and defendant engaged in consensual sexual acts, and only after their encounter, did she regret her actions and lie to the police about an attack.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Summation, ECF No. 12-4, at 708-709, 716-17, 718. Second, if the defendant did attack the victim, no penetration occurred whatsoever, meaning that a key element of predatory sexual assault could not be established.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 721, 726.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While the OCME forensic biologist, Kerry Annitto, did not perform the DNA testing herself, she personally interpreted the results and reported her findings, which showed that semen discovered from the vaginal swab, as well as the victim's underwear and pantyliner matched only one male DNA profile: Richard Beckham's. Annitto Test. 606-09, 610-615. Annitto testified that that profile could only be found in \"one in greater than a trillion people.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 602.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The jury acquitted Beckham of predatory sexual assault (count 1) and convicted him of\n   <em>\n    attempted\n   </em>\n   predatory sexual assault (count 2).

Second, the prosecutor's mid-testimony conference with the victim, as well as portions of the opening and closing arguments, were improper. Third, Beckham was wrongly denied the circumstantial evidence charge he requested with respect to the DNA evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

But Beckham rejected the State's offer to test the DNA evidence himself in order to gather his own raw electronic data and present DNA evidence as part of his defense. Nor did Beckham attempt to subpoena the data from OCME. Moreover, Beckham extensively cross-examined the OCME criminalist testifying about the DNA evidence at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Annitto Test. 609-644. Beckham disputes none of this.
