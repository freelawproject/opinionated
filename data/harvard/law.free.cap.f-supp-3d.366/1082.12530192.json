The United States, on behalf of the USDA (\"Defendant\") subsequently removed this case to federal court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In November 2009, Plaintiff purchased property located at 3416 Hildebrecht Road, Doe Run, Missouri 63637 (the \"Hildebrecht Property\"). To finance the purchase, Plaintiff sought and obtained a $ 122,000 loan from the USDA. Plaintiff executed a Deed of Trust in favor of the USDA, which the USDA recorded with the St. Francois County Recorder of Deeds at Document No. 2009R-10926, and re-recorded at Document 2010R-00327.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As a condition of the loan, Plaintiff was required to obtain property insurance. Plaintiff applied for and received a homeowner's insurance policy from Farm Bureau Town and Country Company of Missouri (hereinafter, \"Farm Bureau\"). In September 2010, the Hildebrecht Property suffered damage from fire. Plaintiff submitted a claim to Farm Bureau, which denied coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 28, 2010, Farm Bureau filed a lawsuit in Missouri state court naming Plaintiff and the USDA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mo. Case No. 10SF-CC00289 (St. Francois County) (the \"Farm Bureau Lawsuit\"). Farm Bureau alleged that on the application for insurance, Plaintiff concealed the fact that he had prior felony convictions. Farm Bureau alleged that the USDA, as the mortgagee on the Hildebrecht Property, was \"subject to the same terms, exclusions, and conditions that apply to the named insured.\" The United States counter-claimed, alleging Farm Bureau owed the United States for the property loss under the homeowner's policy because the United States was the mortgagee on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Farm Bureau and the USDA settled the claims between them, whereby Farm Bureau agreed to pay the USDA an undisclosed amount of money. On February 21,\n   2014, the USDA and Farm Bureau agreed to a voluntary dismiss the USDA from the Farm Bureau Lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The USDA applied the settlement proceeds to the outstanding balance of Plaintiff's loan, although the settlement was insufficient to satisfy the outstanding principal balance. Farm Bureau is still prosecuting the Farm Bureau Lawsuit against Plaintiff in the state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff stopped making payments to the USDA on the remaining balance of the $ 122,000 loan. On February 21, 2012, the USDA sent via certified mail an acceleration letter pursuant to the promissory note signed by Plaintiff, demanding full payment of the outstanding loan balance and accrued interest. When Plaintiff failed to comply, the USDA contacted the caretaker of Plaintiff's property, notifying him that the USDA intended to foreclose on Plaintiff's property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 30, 2018, the Substitute Trustee under the Deed of Trust conducted a foreclosure sale of the Hildebrecht Property. The foreclosure sale netted a total of eleven thousand dollars ($ 11,000.00) in proceeds. Because the foreclosure sale did not satisfy the outstanding principal balance on the loan, there were no excess proceeds to remit to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 22, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a fourth amended petition. Plaintiff filed his fourth amended petition on August 27, 2018. In the fourth amended petition, Plaintiff names Defendants United States, John Robinson, and Ann L. Mell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff raises five counts in his fourth amended petition. In Counts I and II, Plaintiff requests a declaratory judgment interpreting provisions of the homeowner's contract between Plaintiff and the Farm Bureau, and alleges the USDA breached the terms of that contract. Count III alleges the USDA wrongfully seized $ 1,240.00 of Plaintiff's tax refund, and alleges that Plaintiff sustained injury when the United States removed his state court litigation to this Court. Plaintiff demands the United States pay him damages because the United States removed this case to federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In Count IV, Plaintiff once again alleges that the United States breached the terms of his homeowner's insurance policy. He further alleges that the defendants \"had a meeting of minds in circumventing Plaintiff's rights,\" when it removed this case to federal court prior to him having a hearing before the state-court judge. Plaintiff further alleges that the foreclosure of his property was wrongful and fraudulent. In Count V, Plaintiff alleges that the United States and the individual defendants engaged in a \"conspiracy\" causing Plaintiff damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant USDA moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Defendant Mell moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. Defendant Robinson moves to dismiss or alternatively stay this proceeding pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   Doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Legal Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"In order to properly dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), the complaint must be successfully challenged on its face or on the factual truthfulness of its averments.\"\n   <em>\n    Titus v.

First, courts must ascertain whether a plaintiff's claims arise in a new\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   context. \"If the case is different in a meaningful way from previous\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cases decided by [the Supreme Court], then the context is new.\"\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1855\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court held that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A case might differ in a meaningful way because of the rank of the officers involved; the constitutional right at issue; the generality or specificity of the official action; the extent of judicial guidance as to how an officer should respond to the problem or emergency to be confronted;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   the statutory or other legal mandate under which the officer was operating; the risk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into the functioning of other branches; or the presence of potential factors that previous\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cases did not consider.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1855\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1855\">\n    at 1860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the context is new, then the court must ask whether \"any alternative, existing process for protecting the interest amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilkie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573210\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/537/#p550\">\n    551 U.S. at 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573210\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/537/#p550\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, courts must also analyze \"any special factors counseling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation,\" otherwise known as the \"special factors analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573210\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/537/#p550\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"The Court's precedents now make clear that a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy will not be available if there are special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1855\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court has not defined the phrase \"special factors counseling hesitation,\" but the Court has observed that the \"inquiry must concentrate on whether the Judiciary is well suited, absent congressional action or instruction, to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1855\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1855\">\n    at 1857-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Put more simply, to be a \" 'special factor counseling hesitation,' a factor must cause a court to hesitate before answering that question in the affirmative.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1855\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1855\">\n    at 1858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff has failed to present any reasons why this Court should expand\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   to include this action wherein Plaintiff is seeking a Declaratory Judgment on the propriety of the foreclosure action and the settlement of Farm Bureau and the USDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    Defendant Robinson\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant Robinson moves to dismiss this action against him based on the\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   Doctrine. Based on the factors delineated by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Court agrees. The Circuit Court of St. Francois County, Missouri has established jurisdiction over the issues raised herein in the case filed by Farm Bureau against Plaintiff and the USDA, Plaintiff has answered in that matter and has filed counterclaims, and has brought a claim against Defendant Robinson in that action. Factor one favors abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The property is located in St. Francois County, the foreclosure occurred in St. Francois County, and the insurance policy was applied for and issued in St. Francois County. This federal forum is clearly less convenient that the State Forum. Factor two favors abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Abstention is favored under Factor three. All of the parties are present in the State action, whereas Farm Bureau is not present in this Court, and its presence may be necessary for a full determination of the issues raised. Likewise, having both actions proceed may result in inconsistent judgments. The resulting piecemeal litigation can be avoided by proceeding solely in the State Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The State Court case has priority over this action. It has been pending since 2010, with Plaintiff filing his counterclaims in September, 2015. This action was filed in March, 2018, thus pending a far shorter time than the State action; the State action has advanced significantly further that the case has in this forum. Factor four favors abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   State law controls the issues in this case completely. There are no federal law issues before either court. Factor five favors abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Likewise, Plaintiff's federal rights are not at issue. All of Plaintiff's claims against\n   Defendant Robinson arise under Missouri law. Factor six favors abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   All factors to be considered under the\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   Doctrine favor abstention. The most appropriate forum for Plaintiff's claims is the parallel action currently pending in St. Francois County, Missouri. As such, the Court will abstain from exercising jurisdiction over Plaintiff's declaratory judgment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Based upon the foregoing analysis, the Motions to Dismiss are well taken. This action will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant United States of America, on behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Housing Service (\"USDA\")'s Motion to Dismiss, [Doc.
