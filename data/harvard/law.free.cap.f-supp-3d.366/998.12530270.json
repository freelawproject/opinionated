Google Photos is a free, cloud-based service for organizing and sharing photographs. R. 153, Def. SOF \u00b6 7; R. 167-1, Pls. Resp. Def. SOF \u00b6 10. When a user uploads a photo to Google Photos, Google Photos detects images of faces, then creates a face template, represented by [Redacted\n   ]. Def. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 13-15. Google uses these face templates to compare the visual similarity of faces within Google Photos users' private accounts,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15, and then groups photographs with visually similar faces and displays the groups (called \"face groups\") to the users' private account,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Google Photos' face-recognition feature automatically defaults to \"on\" and is applied to every photo uploaded to the service unless the user opts out. Pls. Resp. Def. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10. The technology also can be applied to photos on the user's phone if \"Private Face Clustering\" is enabled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.

Predictably, the parties dispute how the Court should apply the Supreme Court's most recent pronouncement on the injury-in-fact requirement,\n   <em>\n    Spokeo v.

So\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   's holding stands on two pillars: the risk of identity theft arising from the permanency of biometric information, as described by the Illinois legislature, and the absence of in-advance consent to Facebook's collection of the information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523425\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/290/948/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This is a close question, but even when drawing all inferences in Plaintiffs' favor, neither pillar supports a finding of concrete injury. First, as discussed in detail earlier, there is no evidence of a substantial risk that the face templates will result in identity theft. It is true that if an unintended disclosure happens, then there are few ways to change biometric information, and federal courts should follow the legislature's lead in considering that immutability in deciding what is a \"substantial\" risk. But even taking that permanency into account does not justify an across-the-board conclusion that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   cases involving\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   private entity that collects or retains individuals' biometric data present a sufficient risk of disclosure that concrete injury has been satisfied in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On the second pillar of\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   , there is no legislative finding that explains why the absence of consent gives rise to an injury that is\n   <em>\n    independent\n   </em>\n   of the risk of identity theft.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   740 ILCS 14/5(a) - (g). Indeed, the only specific injury described by the Act's findings is the risk of identity theft, 740 ILCS 14/5(c), (d). The other findings only set forth broad conclusions, like the \"public welfare, security, and safety will be served\" and the \"full ramifications of biometric technology are not fully known.\" 740 ILCS 14/5(f), (g). The generality of the legislature's findings is especially damning when considering whether unconsented face scans are sufficiently concrete for Article III purposes. Most people expose their faces to the general public every day, so one's face is even more widely public than non-biometric information like a social security number. Indeed, we expose our faces to the public such that no additional intrusion into our privacy is required to obtain a likeness of it, unlike the physical placement of a finger on a scanner or other object, or the exposure of a sub-surface part of the body like a retina. There is nothing in the Act's legislative findings that would explain why the injury suffered by Plaintiffs here-the unconsented\n   creation of face templates-is concrete enough for Article III purposes. As important and instructive as legislative judgments are in evaluating intangible harms, the Act does not support a finding that the concrete-injury requirement has been met in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moving on from legislative findings,\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   instructs courts to also examine possible analogues to common law harms that historically have supported a finding of Article III injury-in-fact.\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]t is instructive to consider whether an alleged intangible harm has a close relationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts.\") In this case, Plaintiffs' response brief outlines the historical development of the right to privacy in American law, which was \"fueled by social and technological change.\" Pls.'

These exhibits only demonstrate\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   potential uses of Google's facial recognition technology; they do not suggest that Google currently employs these practices, that Google likely will do so in the future without consent, or that Google used Plaintiffs' data in this way. So the evidence falls well short of a substantial likelihood that Plaintiff's will suffer any of those injuries. The only other tack that Plaintiffs could possibly take is to argue that Google \"mapped Plaintiffs' faces, creating, collecting, storing, and exploiting their unique biometric identifiers for its own competitive advantage in the marketplace for photo-sharing services.\" Pls.'
