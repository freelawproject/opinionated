In the email, Masalin-Cooper stated that she had recently left her job with McGraw-Hill. She claimed to have a \"deep and broad understanding of the business of permission/rights acquisition and the business contract and compliance of 3rd party content and media,\" and asked whether HSBK would be interested in \"consulting on the best practices for content licensing and contract compliance as it pertains to copyright.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Twelve days later, Masalin-Cooper sent a substantively identical, also unsolicited, email to HSBK partner Maurice Harmon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The following month, Harmon and Masalin-Cooper communicated by telephone and email regarding her work experience.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 6, 2016, HSBK and Masalin-Cooper entered into an agreement for Masalin-Cooper to provide consulting and/or expert witness services concerning \"[l]itigation involving McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings LLC and McGraw-Hill School Education Holdings LLC.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The extent of Masalin-Cooper's \"consulting\" for HSBK was a one-hour telephone conversation with HSBK attorney Amanda Bruss on December 8, 2016, in which Bruss and Masalin-Cooper discussed McGraw-Hill's databases, permissions systems, and licensing procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Masalin-Cooper was paid $ 600 for her services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The only subsequent interactions between HSBK and Masalin-Cooper involved scheduling (and taking) her deposition, and an October 22, 2017 email from Bruss to Masalin-Cooper formally terminating Masalin-Cooper's consulting arrangement with HSBK.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

In his decision disqualifying HSBK, Judge Baylson made factual findings based on his review of, among other things, Masalin-Cooper's deposition, declarations submitted by the parties, and testimony received at the Hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Judge Baylson found that while employed by McGraw-Hill, Masalin-Cooper was \"deeply involved in discovery management and other litigation support, including with respect to [\n   <em>\n    Heilman I\n   </em>\n   ].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Judge Baylson found that the team Masalin-Cooper managed at McGraw-Hill was tasked with suppressing the unauthorized images that were at issue in\n   <em>\n    Heilman I\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, she had filed a declaration in that action, stating that she was \"presently overseeing efforts to ensure that none of the photos that were at issue [in\n   <em>\n    Heilman I\n   </em>\n   ] is [sic] used in any future printing of Higher Education textbooks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The issues presented in\n   <em>\n    Heilman II\n   </em>\n   appeared to Judge Baylson to \"arise directly out of\" McGraw-Hill's failure to successfully suppress the content at issue in\n   <em>\n    Heilman I\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He found that Masalin-Cooper \"possessed privileged information (about material facts on substantially related cases) vis-\u00e0-vis both sides of the litigation ... much in the way of a 'double agent,' \"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *13, and that Masalin-Cooper had, in fact, revealed confidential and/or privileged information concerning\n   <em>\n    Heilman I\n   </em>\n   to\n   HSBK,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *12. Judge Baylson held that by retaining Masalin-Cooper, HSBK had incurred a duty to take preventive measures to stop Masalin-Cooper from sharing McGraw-Hill's confidences with HSBK.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10. By failing to do so, HSBK violated the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *13.

(\"A lawyer may have ex parte contact with the opposing party's former employees.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court need not resolve the above disagreement in order to rule on McGraw-Hill's motion. Regardless of how HSBK's conduct is framed, its disqualification is warranted only if McGraw-Hill has shown that HSBK likely obtained privileged or confidential information pertinent to this case, such that there is a risk the trial in this matter will be tainted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prevezon Holdings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175330\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/227/#p241\">\n    839 F.3d at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As an initial matter, McGraw-Hill has not shown that Masalin-Cooper possessed privileged or confidential information specific to this case. Masalin-Cooper did not begin work at McGraw-Hill until late 2012, after the transactions at issue in this litigation were completed, and she was fired approximately two months before the complaint in this case was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Although it is undisputed that Masalin-Cooper provided Bruss with some information relevant to this case, McGraw-Hill has not shown that information to be confidential, let alone privileged. The parties agree that during Bruss's conversation with Masalin-Cooper, Bruss sought and received\n   information concerning whether McGraw-Hill had internal systems and databases designed to track the use of photographs in its publications. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pelaez Opp'n 19; Reply 4.) McGraw-Hill characterizes this information as \"confidential,\" and argues that HSBK has \"exploited\" the information to its advantage in this suit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McGraw-Hill Mem. 3-5; Reply 3-4.) Yet McGraw-Hill fails to counter Bruss's sworn statements that (1) this information was subsequently obtained directly from McGraw-Hill and its employees through formal discovery, in depositions that McGraw-Hill did not designate as confidential; and (2) HSBK was aware of the general nature of the database issue prior to Bruss's interview of Masalin-Cooper. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. Amanda Bruss \u00b6\u00b6 11-13, 26, ECF No. 165.) These statements, which are left unaddressed by McGraw-Hill, refute McGraw-Hill's contention that the information Bruss received concerning photograph usage tracking was confidential. Moreover, McGraw-Hill does not identify any unfair advantage Pelaez will obtain in this litigation as a result of any of this information having initially been acquired from Masalin-Cooper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matthews v.

(holding that a lawyer's knowledge of allegedly confidential information did not give him an unfair advantage where the information could be obtained through discovery). Therefore, even if McGraw-Hill had shown that the information received was confidential (and it has not), the Court would not disqualify HSBK on this basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States Football League\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754010\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/605/1448/#p1452\">\n    605 F.Supp. at 1464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Only information that would give the attorney an unfair advantage that will taint the trial should be a sufficient basis to disqualify that attorney.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Absent evidence that Masalin-Cooper possessed privileged or confidential information concerning the transactions at issue in this litigation, McGraw-Hill must show that there is a \"substantial relationship\" between this litigation and the matter on which Masalin-Cooper worked, namely,\n   <em>\n    Heilman I\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .

Aside from referring to\n   <em>\n    Heilman II\n   </em>\n   as a \"parallel case,\" (McGraw-Hill Mem. 1), McGraw-Hill provides no argument on this point. Moreover, in a submission made in opposition to Pelaez's pending motion for partial summary judgment, McGraw-Hill itself argues that the resolution of\n   <em>\n    Heilman I\n   </em>\n   is \"not relevant\" to this proceeding. (Defs.' Resp. Pls.' Am. Statement Undisputed Material Facts (ECF No. 132), \u00b6\u00b6 43, 44). As McGraw-Hill points out, this case arises out of conduct that occurred in connection with agreements between McGraw-Hill and a third-party, Corbis, that was not involved in\n   <em>\n    Heilman I\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1423495\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/569/737/#p739\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   To the extent McGraw-Hill asserts that Masalin-Cooper had knowledge of McGraw-Hill's general litigation strategies and defenses, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   McGraw-Hill Mem. 3, 9), that type of knowledge is not sufficient to establish a risk of taint in this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Olajide\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201448859\">\n    2016 WL 1448859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (holding that disqualification was not warranted where \"movant [a]t most establish[ed] that [the lawyer whose disqualification was sought] 'recurrently handled' ...

In any event, there is no evidence that that Masalin-Cooper had privileged or confidential information concerning any matter other than\n   <em>\n    Heilman I\n   </em>\n   . Although McGraw-Hill points out that Bruss's conversation with Masalin-Cooper concerned issues applicable to all of the cases HSBK was litigating against McGraw-Hill-including this one-this merely establishes Bruss's motivation for interviewing Masalin-Cooper. It is not probative of the extent of Masalin-Cooper's knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   McGraw-Hill complains that HSBK failed to give notice of its intent to consult with Masalin-Cooper, depriving it of the \"opportunity ... to control the dissemination of [its] privileged and confidential information.\" (Reply 7.) McGraw-Hill need not have depended on HSBK for that opportunity. It is well-established in this Circuit that a party who fears its former employee will reveal privileged or confidential information in the course of an ex parte interview by opposing counsel may apply to the Court for a protective order which includes prophylactic measures designed to avoid such disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arista Records\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4249925\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/784/398/#p416\">\n    784 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   416 ;\n   <em>\n    In re SLM Corp.

Apr. 3, 2008) (Lynch, J.). Given McGraw-Hill's characterization of Masalin-Cooper as \"an instrumental in-house participant in McGraw-Hill's defense of the cases litigated against it by HSBK,\" (Reply 8), the Court would have expected McGraw-Hill to apply-in this case or in the other cases in which it ultimately filed disqualification motions-for a protective order regulating HSBK's contact with Masalin-Cooper. Yet McGraw-Hill never applied for such an order in this case; nor does McGraw-Hill indicate that it applied for such an order in any of the other cases in which it filed motions to disqualify HSBK. In light of McGraw-Hill's seeming lack of concern regarding Masalin-Cooper earlier in this litigation, the present motion carries the whiff of tactical maneuvering. This reinforces the Court's conclusion that McGraw-Hill has failed to demonstrate that HSBK's contact with Masalin-Cooper created a risk that the underlying trial in this matter will be tainted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nyquist\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"822954\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/590/1241/#p1246\">\n    590 F.2d at 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the Second Circuit's \"considerable reluctance to disqualify attorneys despite misgivings about the attorney's conduct ... probably derives\" in part \"from the fact ... that disqualification motions are often interposed for tactical reasons\" (internal citations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the reasons above, disqualification of HSBK is not warranted. Because McGraw-Hill has not requested any relief aside from disqualification, the Court need not reach the question of whether, even in the absence of a risk of taint, HSBK's contact with Masalin-Cooper violated any state disciplinary rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   McGraw-Hill's motion to disqualify Pelaez's counsel, HSBK, is DENIED.
