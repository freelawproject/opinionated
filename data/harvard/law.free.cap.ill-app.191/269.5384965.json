Waters and water courses,\u2014how water company may collect charges.

Waters and water courses,\u2014when injunction preventing collection of water charges should be dissolved. An order overruling a motion to dissolve an injunction preventing a public service corporation from collecting a bill for water served, held erroneous when supported only by the general statement of the consumer that he was charged for more water than he consumed, and more than he was charged for in former years.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-5\" pgmap=\"314\">Cooke, Pope &amp; Pope, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-6\" pgmap=\"314\">Frederick Sass, for appellee.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b314-15\" pgmap=\"314\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
