Appeal and error, \u00a7 1410<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when verdict will not-be disturbed. In an action for personal injuries sustained while alighting from a street car, a verdict in favor of the plaintiff was not manifestly against the weight of the evidence.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b114-5\" pgmap=\"114\">2. Damages, \u00a7 112*\u2014when verdict not excessive. In an action for personal injuries sustained by a woman while alighting from a street car, due to the car starting suddenly, a verdict of fifteen hundred dollars reduced to one thousand dollars was not excessive.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b114-6\" pgmap=\"114\">3. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1535*\u2014when instruction cannot be com^ plained of. In an action for personal injuries sustained while alighting from a street car, the giving of an instruction as to the burden of proof which omitted the element of the number of witnesses testifying pro and con upon the controverted material facts .in the case was error, but a defendant was not warranted in complaining of it where the record did not show that the question \u00f3f the number of witnesses was an important element in the case,, and that it suffered by the giving of the instruction.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b114-7\" pgmap=\"114\">4. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1544*\u2014when erroneous instruction as to contributory negligence harmless. In an action for personal injuries sustained while alighting from a street car, the giving of an instruction as to the burden of proof, stating that the jury \u201cshould\u201d take into consideration the elements named in the instruction, was erroneous as misleading and as tending to invade the province of the jury, and the word \u201cmay\u201d should have been used, but in view of the state of the record, the giving of the instruction was harmless error.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b114-8\" pgmap=\"114\">5. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1565*\u2014when modification of instruction harmless. In an action for personal injuries, the modification of an instruction as to the credibility of witnesses, by striking out the words requiring the jury to consider testimony \u201cthe same as you would receive the testimony of any other witness,\u201d did not constitute reversible error, as the meaning of the instruction was not changed by the modification.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b114-9\" pgmap=\"114\">6. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1565*\u2014when modification of instruction as to contributory negligence harmless. In an action for personal injuries sustained by a passenger while alighting from a street car, where an instruction requiring the plaintiff to use her faculties with ordinary care only \u201cin looking out for danger\u201d was modified by striking out the quoted words, the modification was not harmful to the defendant, as in the instruction as given there was no limitation as to the care that the plaintiff was required to use to avoid injury.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
