The boy was standing on the front platform of the second car and had been standing there for many blocks. The sides of the platform were inclosed by iron gates about six feet high. Along its front edge were four upright iron stanchions supporting the canopy, one standing in each corner and the other two between them. The space between the two in the middle was left open for passage from one car to another. From each corner stanchion to the next stanchion towards the middle was a railing about \u201cwaist high.\u201d The base of each stanchion was about one and one-half inches from the platform. At the time of the accident the boy stood near the left corner stanchion and railing, fronting towards the rear platform of the first car which was like the other in construction.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\" pgmap=\"516\">As the train moved around the curves, the relative position of adjoining platforms was, of course, almost constantly changing. As the first curve was taken, the left comer of said rear platform necessarily swung away from the car behind, and, as the next curve was taken, the other corner swung away, bringing said left comer back by a sudden, jerky and irregular movement, in the course-of which the west corner stanchions came within five inches of each other. During that movement the boy\u2019s head was caught and crushed between these two stanchions.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-6\" pgmap=\"516\">The case was submitted to the jury on two counts of the declaration, the first charging the defendant with negligence in failing to give Airey any notice or warning of the danger of his position under such circumstances, and the second charging negligence in failure to provide a guard or device so as to protect passengers while thus standing on the platform. From a judgment for plaintiff for two thousand dollars, defendant appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-7\" pgmap=\"516\">Addison L. Gardner and Carroll H.
