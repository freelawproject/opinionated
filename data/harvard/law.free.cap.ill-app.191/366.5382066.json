Sampsell, as receiver of Chicago Union Traction Company, to recover for personal injuries. From a judgment for twenty-seven hundred and fifty dollars in favor of plaintiff, defendant appeals. While defendant\u2019s street car had stopped at an appropriate\" and customary place to discharge passenger, plaintiff, of the age of about six and one-half years, was thrown to the pavement, with his mother, who was assisting him to alight, because of the starting of the car at the conductor\u2019s signal.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-10\" pgmap=\"410(152) 411(55)\">The undisputed evidence of the father and mother of plaintiff and a nurse who attended him showed that he was bruised on the hip, groin and knee and for a long time was sore in those parts, and that he was confined to his bed the larger part of the time for a month or more; that the bruise on the knee became infected and did not heal for several weeks; that parts of his body near the bruise on the hip became black and blue and- there was a swelling in the groin; that he from the moment of the injury has walked with a limp; that a year or more after the accident the mother of plaintiff claimed to have noticed a curvature of his spine and an apparent shortening of one of his legs, and that prior to the injury he was a sound, healthy boy. The evidence tended to show that the neck of the right femur between the ball of the hip joint and the great trachanter was shorter than natural by a half inch, and that where the right femur connects with the pelvic bone that bone is higher than its counterpart on the left side of the body.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-7\" pgmap=\"411\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-8\" pgmap=\"411\">1.

Where a child of tender years was thrown from a street car to the pavement because of the starting of the car while he, with the assistance of his mother, was alighting therefrom and the car was started because of the negligent order of the conductor, held that the child was entitled to recover such damages as such starting of the car was the proximate cause.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-9\" pgmap=\"411\">2.

Where there was no doubt as to the act of a street car conductor in causing the car to start while a passenger was attempting to alight therefrom being negligence under any view of the duty of the carrier to its passenger, an instruction that it was the duty of the carrier to exercise for the safety of its passengers the highest degree of care \u201cconsistent with the operation of the road,\u201d is held not to require a reversal, although erroneous, the rule being that such carrier must use the highest degree of care for the safety of its passengers consistent with the practical operation of the road.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-10\" pgmap=\"411\">3.
