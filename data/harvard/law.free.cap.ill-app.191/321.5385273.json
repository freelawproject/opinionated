The district, which was organized under the Farm Drainage Act (J. &amp; A. \u00b6\u00b6 4475-4556) fixed the compensation of its first treasurer at two per cent.; though the compensation of subsequent treasurers up to defendant\u2019s incumbency had not been fixed, they had been paid the same compensation. Defendant was also paid two per cent, for compensation for the first year of his term and retained $218 for his compensation for his second year. To recover this amount, plaintiff brought this suit, and a jury having been waived and the case tried on a stipulation as to the facts, the issues were found for plaintiff and its damages assessed at $218, and it had judgment therefor.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b366-9\" pgmap=\"366\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b366-10\" pgmap=\"366\">1.
