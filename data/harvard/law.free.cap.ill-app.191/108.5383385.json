It appeared that certain premises were leased for three years to the defendant, at a total rental of $936, payable monthly in advance at the rate of $26 per month, and that during the last year the defendant moved away from the premises and failed to pay eight months\u2019 rent. The defendant contended that the lease was can-celled and terminated. The case was tried before the court without a jury resulting in a judgment in favor of the defendant, whereupon the plaintiffs brought this writ of error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b152-9\" pgmap=\"152\">John B.
