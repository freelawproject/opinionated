In an action to have certain Probate Court judgments against an estate declared a lien upon real estate standing in defendant\u2019s name and for collateral relief within the general purpose of a creditor\u2019s bill, evidence held to establish that decedent was not insolvent when he conveyed the property without consideration to his wife, one of the defendants.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b563-12\" pgmap=\"563\">2.

Fraudulent conveyances, \u00a7 49<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014effect of solvency as to conveyance of husband to wife. In an action to subject real estate standing in the name of a wife to the lien of judgment against her deceased husband\u2019s estate and for relief within the general purpose of a creditor\u2019s bill, the question is one of the grantor\u2019s solvency at the time of the voluntary conveyance, in spite of the rule that such a conveyance under former decisions seems to have been held invalid unless the grantor is pecuniarily able to withdraw the amount of his donation from his estate without the least hazard to his creditors.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b564-4\" pgmap=\"564\">5. Fraudulent conveyances, \u00a7 45*\u2014how solvency bears on fraud. In an action for relief as against a conveyance of real estate, while, if a fraudulent intent is shown by, or can be properly inferred from competent evidence presented, the conveyance can be set aside, and insolvency in such a case may be only one of the circumstances from which the intent may he inferred and the absence of insolvency . may not be conclusive against such fraudulent intent to hinder and delay creditors, yet solvency at the time of the conveyance tends strongly to negative said intent.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b564-6\" pgmap=\"564\">6. Fraudulent conveyances, \u00a7 91*\u2014effect of husband\u2019s acting as agent for wife. In an action to subject to a lien of a judgment against a husband\u2019s estate, real estate conveyed without consideration by him to his wife, held the wife\u2019s title was not affected by the fact that the husband afterwards acted for her in the collection of rents or by the fact that such income was mingled with his own money in his bank account.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b564-7\" pgmap=\"564\">7. Executors and administrators, \u00a7 467*\u2014insufficiency of evidence to show purchase on behalf of executrix. Where, in an action to subject real estate to the lien of a judgment, it was contended that a sale under order of the Probate Court was only colorable, fraudulently designed to defraud creditors and void as a sale really to the executrix herself, held that the sale was valid in the absence of a showing of bad faith.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b564-8\" pgmap=\"564\">8. Executors and administrators, \u00a7 454*\u2014mere inadequacy of price insufficient for vacating judicial sale. The fact that real estate sold under an order of the Probate Court to pay debts fails to bring its full value in the absence of bad faith is not sufficient to require that it be set aside, inadequacy of price being not infrequently associated with judicial sales, especially of property subject to mortgage and dower claims.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
