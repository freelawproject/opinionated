From a judgment denying the writ of mandamus the petitioner brings error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-8\" pgmap=\"555(184) 556(14)\">The petitioner held the position of driver in the fire department of the City of Chicago under certification and appointment under the terms of the Civil Service Act, on September 19,1910. On that day, on account of the illness of his wife, he applied to the Fire Marshal for a leave of absence for a year. The Fire Marshal advised the petitioner that he could not grant leave of absence for more than thirty days at a time, but that he would extend his leave from time to time. The petitioner thereupon obtained leave of absence for a period of thirty days from September 19, 1910, and removed with bis family to Indiana, where he had leased a farm. On October 19, 1910, he made application for extension of his leave of absence for another period of thirty days. The extension was allowed but the petitioner received no notice thereof, and made no further application for extension of his leave of absence or claim for reinstatement to his office or position until he returned to Chicago on or about August 15, 1911. He was then informed that his resignation had been accepted on October 25, 1910.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b556-8\" pgmap=\"556\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b556-9\" pgmap=\"556\">1. Mandamus, \u00a7 15<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014where ineffectual. The granting of a writ of mandamus is descretionary with the court in view of all the existing facts and with due regard to the consequences which may-result, and in the exercise of this judicial descretion the court may refuse the writ though the petitioner has a clear legal right for which mandamus is an appropriate remedy, where it can be seen that it cannot accomplish any good purpose or where it will fail to have any beneficial effect.</headnotes><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-4\" pgmap=\"556\">It appeared that Driscoll, battalion chief over Jacob-sen, and Capt. Strook, not being- informed that the Fire Marshal had extended Jacobsen\u2019s leave of absence, investigated the action of Jacobsen, and Capt. Strook went to Jacobsen\u2019s farm near Valparaiso, Indiana, for the purpose of making an examination and report concerning his absence. Strook did not see Jacobsen but left word with his wife that Jacobsen should either return to work or send in the city prop- . erty, such as the badge, cap, insignia, etc., which belonged to the City of Chicago. Within a week thereafter the insignia of office or position were received by Capt. Strook through the mail accompanied by a letter, the contents of which do not appear in the record. Thereupon Capt. Strook made out and signed Jacobsen\u2019s resignation of his position and his name was dropped from the pay roll of the department.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b556-5\" pgmap=\"556\">William E.

Where a petitioner had been advised that a leave of absence could not be granted for a period longer than thirty days at a time from his position as an officer in the fire department of the City of Chicago and a period of over fifteen months elapsed between the time of his removal and the day of his filing a petition for a writ of mandamus for reinstatement, and no excuses or justification for his long absence from duty or for his ignorance that his leave of absence had not been extended were shown, held that the writ was properly denied because of the unreasonable delay of the petitioner in presenting his petition for the writ.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b557-4\" pgmap=\"557\">3.
