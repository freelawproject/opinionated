The lease also provided for a penalty of $10 each day the tenant held over. The case was tried before .the court without a jury and there was a finding and judgment in favor of plaintiff for $235; To reverse the judgment, defendant prosecutes a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-9\" pgmap=\"232\">The testimony tended to show that at the expiration of the lease, the lessee offered to make the restoration but was deterred from so doing by the lessor, that the cost of restoration would have been $150, and that the lessee surrendered the keys five days after the lease expired. The court evidently arrived at its finding by deducting from the amount of the deposit and three per cent, interest thereon to the date of the expiration of the lease the estimated cost of restoring the building and $50 for holding over, thus leaving $200, on which the statutory interest to the date of judgment was $35.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b233-6\" pgmap=\"233\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b233-7\" pgmap=\"233\">' Damages, \u00a7 85<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when deposit under terms of lease treated as penalty.
