Brom Allen for injury alleged to have been sustained to plaintiff\u2019s foot through the carelessness of a dentist engaged in extracting a tooth. From a judgment for $300 in favor of plaintiff, defendant brings error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-10\" pgmap=\"443(192) 444(90)\">Before pulling the tooth, the plaintiff was anlesthetized by the inhalation of nitrous oxide gas administered by a trained nurse in the defendant\u2019s office. The whole time during which the plaintiff was in the dentist\u2019s chair did not exceed five minutes, and the period of complete unconsciousness (during which the tooth was extracted) did not exceed forty seconds. The plaintiff did not claim there was anything wrong with the operation itself or the administration of the anesthetic. Her claim was that her foot was injured at that time. She testified that before the operation her foot was in perfect condition; that immediately after the operation, she felt a sharp pain in her left foot, and cried out: \u201cOh, my foot\u2019\u2019; that defendant said: \u201cTour foot is all right; get up and walk\u201d; that she walked into an adjoining room, where she rested a few minutes on a couch, and then left the doctor\u2019s office, suffering great pain. This happened about noon time. She went about her usual duties during the afternoon, but the pain in her foot continued. On arriving at her home she removed her shoe and discovered a bruise on the instep, abont in line with the buttons of the shoe, and about the size of a silver dollar. A doctor was called, who prescribed hot applications and bandages. She claimed she was unable to perform her usual work, that of a school teacher, for a period of six weeks, and expended $27- for doctor\u2019s bills and medicine. The defendant and his assistant both testified that nothing happened while the plaintiff was in the chair that conld have caused the injury described by her.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b444-9\" pgmap=\"444\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b444-10\" pgmap=\"444\">I.

Where a dentist gives an anaesthetic to his patient for the purpose of extracting a tooth, the dentist is not an insurer against all possible injuries or accidents, and a presumption of .negligence on the part of the dentist does not arise from proof of the mere fact that plaintiff without her fault sustained an injury of unusual character while she was in the care and control of the dentist.</headnotes><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b444-5\" pgmap=\"444\">In the argument to the jury, plaintiff\u2019s counsel said: \u201cWe do not, I contend, have to go further than to show that this accident happened at that place. It happened in her helpless condition. It was something that would not ordinarily happen in a dentist\u2019s chair, and that is all ive have to show; it is all we can show, it is all you or anybody else can show under the same circumstances. \u2019 \u2019</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b444-6\" pgmap=\"444\">H.

In an action for an injury to plaintiff\u2019s foot alleged to have been sustained while under the care of a dentist, an instruction to the jury that if they believe from the evidence that plaintiff was hurt without fault on her part while she was under the control of defendant and her injury was of such a nature as would not happen in the ordinary course of things under such circumstances, then the jury have a right to presume that the injury was caused by defendant\u2019s negligence and that the burden is upon the defendant to overcome that presumption, held erroneous since it is necessary to show that the injury is of such a character that it would not ordinarily occur if due care is used.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b445-4\" pgmap=\"445\">4.

' Dentists, \u00a7 3*\u2014necessity of control of cause of injury. Where it was admitted that there was no evidence from which to deduce any theory of what actually caused an injury to plaintiff\u2019s foot alleged to have been sustained, it was erroneous for the court to assume by its instructions that the injury was caused by something under defendant\u2019s control while plaintiff was under his care for the purpose of extracting a tooth, since it might have been caused by pure accident or by something not at all within the control of the dentist, the cause of the injury being a question of fact and one of the main issues in the case.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b445-6\" pgmap=\"445\">6. Dentists, \u00a7 3*\u2014necessity of control of cause of injury before presumption of negligence may arise. In an action for injury to plaintiff\u2019s foot while she was in a dental chair, remarks of counsel voicing the theory that if she was hurt without fault on her part while under the care of defendant, and her injury was of such a nature as would not happen in the ordinary course of things under such circumstances, the jury had a right to presume that the injury was caused by defendant\u2019s negligence, placing the burden on defendant to overcome the presumption of negligence, held prejudicially erroneous in assuming the cause was within defendant\u2019s control.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
