A. Crancer Company, against C. P. Williams, C. L. Williams and Werner Bros. Express and Storage Company to recover a piano sold by plaintiff to C. L. Williams under a conditional sale contract which contained a provision prohibiting the removal of the piano from the residence of the purchaser in Norfolk, Nebraska, without the vendor\u2019s consent. The piano was removed without such consent and placed with the Storage Company in Chicago. Later defendant C. P. Williams brought attackment proceedings against C. L. Williams, and claimed to have obtained a judgment in rem, and a special execution thereon under which the piano was levied on and sold, he bidding in the property and leaving it in charge of the Storage Company.-</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b496-9\" pgmap=\"496\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b496-10\" pgmap=\"496\">1. Replevin, \u00a7 152<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when joint, judgment, fpr defendants erroneous. In a replevin proceeding by the vendor against the purchaser of personalty, under a conditional sale contract and one claiming title thereto under an execution sale on judgment against such purchaser, a joint judgment for damages in favor of the defendants is erroneous, since if the execution purchaser obtained title under the execution sale he alone was damaged by the detention of the property under the replevin writ.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b496-11\" pgmap=\"496\">2.

A judgment for costs in favor of a defendant who entered no appearance is erroneous.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b496-13\" pgmap=\"496(30) 497(28)\">3. Execution, \u00a7 206*\u2014when purchaser claiming under must prove judgment. Where in an action of replevin by the vendor of personalty the defendant claims title under an execution sale upon a judgment against the vendee, he must prove the existence of the judgment upon which the execution issued, and proof of the execution alone will not suffice.</headnotes><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-5\" pgmap=\"496\">Thereupon the plaintiff commenced a replevin proceeding to recover the piano. The Storage Company was dismissed out of the case. On trial without a jury the court found that the right of possession of the property replevied was not in the plaintiff and entered judgment for one cent damages and costs in favor of C. P. and C. L. Williams and awarded the writ of retorno habendo, from which judgment plaintiff prosecutes error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b496-6\" pgmap=\"496\">J. W.

Judgment, \u00a7 692<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what evidence insufficient to prove existence of. The introduction in evidence of the \u201chalf sheet,\u201d a term used in the Municipal Court to designate the record of its proceedings including the judgment, which consists of a jumble of letters conveying no meaning unless explained, is insufficient to prove the existence of a judgment, especially where no explanation was offered:</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b497-5\" pgmap=\"497\">5. Judgment, \u00a7 242*\u2014when entry invalid. A record consisting of a jumble of figures conveying no meaning unless explained is invalid as an entry of judgment under Stein v.
