In an action for injuries sustained by a brakeman alleged to have been caused by the negligence of defendant in permitting a pile of cinders on the railroad track, where the defense was that plaintiff assumed the risk, a verdict for plaintiff held sustained by the evidence, where it was conceded that the pile of cinders caused the injury, and it appeared that plaintiff had no knowledge of the cinders or that he had worked on the line at the particular place in question for several months prior to the injury.</headnotes><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-4\" pgmap=\"88\">Because of the application of the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, the defense of fellow-servant was eliminated, and the defense of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was urged only in mitigation of the damages.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-5\" pgmap=\"88\">The defense relied on at the time of the trial, as shown by the briefs and argument of counsel, was that the accident was the result of a danger of which the plaintiff had assumed the risk, and the defendant confines its brief and argument on this appeal to that issue, and contends that the pile of cinders was: (1) An incidental risk and hazard ordinarily connected with the plaintiff\u2019s employment; or (2) an extra hazard of which he had had actual notice; or (3) an extra hazard of which he will be presumed to have had notice because they were so patent and obvious; because they were at all times on the Peoria main; because he was by and on this track innumerable times when cinders were on it.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-6\" pgmap=\"88\">Winston, Payne, Strawn &amp; Shaw, for appellant; Silas H.

In an action against a railroad company for injuries sustained by plaintiff alleged to have been caused by a pile of cinders in the track, over which he stumbled when he went between moving cars to disconnect the air hose in order to stop the train for the purpose of avoiding a collision, refusal of court to direct a verdict for defendant on the ground that plaintiff was charged with notice of the pile of cinders and that he assumed the risk, held not error, where there was evidence tending to show that plaintiff had not worked at the particular place in question for many months and that he had no knowledge of the pile of cinders, and it also appearing that a rule of the company had been posted in the form of a bulletin at various places on the line forbidding the dumping of cinders on tracks at the place in question.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
