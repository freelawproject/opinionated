F. Sayrs against John Yangas and E. F. Thompson on a stav-of-execution bond given to plaintiff by Thompson with Yangas as surety, to recover the amount of a judgment, cost and interest, and the value of the use of the premises for the period during which Thompson remained in possession after the judgment was rendered, said judgment having been recovered by plaintiff against defendant in a suit for the possession of certain premises, and affirmed by the Appellate Court. See Sayrs v. Thompson, 172 Ill. App. 207. The defendants filed an affidavit of merits. The court entered an order stating, in substance, that the defendants by their affidavit had admitted the amount of the original judgment, costs and interest to be due and that the affidavit showed a defense to only a portion of plaintiff\u2019s demand. A judgment was thereupon entered against the defendants for the amount of the original judgment, interest and costs, hut reserved \u201cfor future determination and adjudication the matter of the balance of the plaintiff\u2019s demand. \u2019 \u2019 The defendants sued out a writ of error from that judgment, but were again unsuccessful and the judgment was affirmed. See Sayrs v. Yangas, 187 Ill. App. 23. The defense interposed to the reserved claim for the value, use and occupation of the premises was that the premises had no rental value whatever because of the alleged untenantable condition of the same. A trial was had by a jury and plaintiff recovered a verdict and judgment for two hundred dollars. To reverse the judgment, defendants prosecute error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b76-8\" pgmap=\"76\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b76-9\" pgmap=\"76\">1.
