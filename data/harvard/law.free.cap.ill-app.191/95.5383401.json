Tucker &amp; Hagen, a corporation, was served as garnishee. Subsequently the defendants appeared and entered into a recognizance, whereupon the attachment was released. Plaintiff\u2019s claim was based upon the refusal of defendants to deliver him certain sandals, resulting in a loss' of profits because of his inability to resell the sandals. It appeared that the defendants refused to deliver the goods unless the plaintiff paid cash or procured somebody to guarantee his account for him, though they had contracted to allow him a certain time for payment. The case was tried befor\u00e9 the court without a jury, resulting in a judgment against defendants for $156.96, whereupon this writ of error was brought.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b140-7\" pgmap=\"140\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b140-8\" pgmap=\"140\">1.
