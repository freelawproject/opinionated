Barron against Isidor Levinson to recover damages for injuries to plaintiff\u2019s flat alleged to have been caused by defendant as a tenant. It appeared that in April, 1910, the defendant rented a flat from the plaintiff and occupied it from that time until May 30, 1911, under a verbal lease from month to month. On May 1, 1911, plaintiff served on the defendant a thirty days\u2019 notice to quit. Defendant moved out on May 30, 1911, but retained the keys of the flat. The next day the plaintiff called on the defendant and asked him for the keys. Defendant refused to give them up but sent them by mail the next day. Plaintiff thus received the keys on June 2, 1911. According to the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, in which he is corroborated by three other witnesses, he found, when he entered the vacant flat on June 2nd, that some of the glass globes of the chandeliers were broken and scattered around the floor and others were missing; that several of the window shades were torn, and a large piece torn out of one of them had been thrown on the front porch; that one of the inner doors had been cut in several places as by an axe; that part of the grillwork between the first and second rooms was broken and one of the posts had apparently been chopped by an axe; that most of the window cords had been cut and some were hanging loose; that the woodwork was scratched, dented and splintered; and upon the papered walls of the parlor and bedrooms had been written in colored chalk and with indelible pencils the words \u201cBeware of Bats,\u201d and \u201cBeware of Bed-Bugs.\u201d The undisputed evidence was that the flat was in good condition when the tenant moved in, and that the plaintiff was required to expend a considerable sum of money to repair the damage thus found after the tenant had moved. There was also evidence that a bitter feeling existed between the landlord and tenant. As opposed to this evidence, defendant testified that when he left the flat there \u201cwas no damage except such as might be termed \u2018ordinary wear and tear,\u2019 \u201d and he produced two witnesses who testified that they were present when he moved out, and \u2018 \u2018 saw no damage. \u2019 \u2019</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b80-9\" pgmap=\"80\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b80-10\" pgmap=\"80(83) 81(101)\">1. Landloed and tenant, \u00a7 197<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when \u25a0finding as to injury to premises 6y tenant contrary to evidence. In an action by a landlord to recover damages to his flat alleged to have been caused by the defendant as his tenant, a finding in favor of defendant held contrary to the weight of the evidence, where a preponderance of the evidence showed that the damage was done after notice to quit had been served on defendant and before he turned over the keys to the flat, and it also appeared that he refused to turn over the keys on the next day after he moved out, hut returned them by mail so that plaintiff did not receive them until two days thereafter, and it did not appear that defendant denied that he was at the premises in the interim between the time he moved out and the time plaintiff received the keys by mail, from which fact a reasonable inference would arise that the damage was deliberately committed either by the defendant himself or by some one for whose acts he was responsible.</headnotes><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-5\" pgmap=\"80\">A trial was had by the court without a jury and the court found the issues for the defendant, upon the ground, as stated in the statement of facts certified to this court, \u201cthat the evidence failed to show that the defendant did or committed the acts complained of, or that the same were permitted to be done to the knowledge of the defendant.\u201d To reverse the judgment, plaintiff prosecutes a writ of error.'</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-6\" pgmap=\"80\">Rost &amp; Smith, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-7\" pgmap=\"80\">Gorman, Pollock, Sullivan &amp; Livingston, for defendant in error.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b80-11\" pgmap=\"80\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
