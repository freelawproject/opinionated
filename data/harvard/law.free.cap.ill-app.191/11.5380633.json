The undisputed facts were that before the complaint was made on which the warrant for the arrest of plaintiff was issued, defendant went to his regular' attorney, who for years had transacted for him such business as required the services of an attorney, and fairly and fully submitted to him all the facts within his knowledge concerning the charge that was eventually lodged against plaintiff. On the following day the attorney went to the office of defendant and examined the books of defendant pertaining to the matter and talked with the bookkeeper and the cashier and again talked with defendant, going over the facts with each separately. The attorney then advised that a demand be made on plaintiff for the money, which was done, with the result that plaintiff refused to turn it over. The attorney then advised defendant that plaintiff was guilty of the crime of embezzlement and advised him to \u2018 \u2018 swear out a warrant. \u2019 \u2019 Acting on this advice, the complaint on which the warrant in question was issued was made.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b56-8\" pgmap=\"56\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b56-9\" pgmap=\"56\">1.
