Plaintiff shipped three cars loaded with bags of sugar, for storage, to the defendant, at its warehouse in Chicago. These cars were directed to F. C. Van Ness, care of the Railway Terminal &amp; Warehouse Company, the defendant; and when delivered to the Warehouse Company, a warehouse receipt was issued to the said F. C. Van Ness. The contents of these cars were unloaded at the warehouse. The bags were stored in tiers seven or eight bags high, on the main floor of the warehouse, which is slightly above the street level, within twenty or twenty-five feet of doors that remained open practically the entire day. These doors led out directly onto a switch track, and beyond the switch track is a public roadway. There was evidence to prove that dust and dirt had collected on the bags and that the sugar was lumpy and of a dirty or grayish color.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-6\" pgmap=\"85\">Q.
