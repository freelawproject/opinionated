Rejected gear wheels of about the same weight had been taken from the shop to the platform by plaintiff and another man. The difference between the two kinds of wheels was that the gear wheels had teeth or cogs in the surface of the rim, while fly wheels were smooth. In both kinds of wheels a hub projected from the wheel two or three inches. There was an abundance of wall space in the yards, but five or six wheels were placed one in front of another just outside the door of the shop. The first wheel was so placed as to lean against the wall and the second so as to lean against the first, and so on to the sixth. Because of the projecting hubs it was necessary to place the rim of a wheel some little distance from the wheel against which it was to lean, and necessarily the angle of inclination increased with each wheel so placed. It was not alleged in the declaration that the wheels were negligently or improperly placed, but only that owing to the great weight of the wheel which plaintiff and the other man were attempting to put in place they were unable to hold the wheel and it fell on plaintiff\u2019s foot and injured him. Plaintiff contended that defendant was guilty of negligence in not furnishing one or more additional men to assist in placing the wheel.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b616-8\" pgmap=\"616\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b616-9\" pgmap=\"616\">1.
