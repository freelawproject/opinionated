Plaintiff also introduced testimony that the car was defective and had not been repaired or altered as defendant had agreed; that he had made many complaints to defendant\u2019s manager and had taken the car to defendant\u2019s shops many times and finally, in May, 1911, left it in defendant\u2019s garage. He further testified that in November, 1911, the manager, acting for defendant, agreed to sell the car for plaintiff for not less than one thousand two hundred dollars, and out of the proceeds to cancel the notes and pay plaintiff the balance of seven hundred dollars, or any balance that the car might bring in excess of one thousand two hundred dollars.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-4\" pgmap=\"643\">Defendant contended that no such agreement had been made, and correspondence of plaintiff, subsequent to the date of the alleged agreement purporting to tell the \u201centire story,\u201d was introduced in which no mention was made of the agreement.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-5\" pgmap=\"643\">Defendant\u2019s manager, who testified, made no definite denial of plaintiff\u2019s version of the conversation in which the agreement was alleged to have been made.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-6\" pgmap=\"643\">A former employee of defendant testified, as did plaintiff, that the car had not been given the agreed overhauling.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-7\" pgmap=\"643\">To reverse a judgment for plaintiff for seven hundred dollars, defendant prosecutes this writ of error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-8\" pgmap=\"643\">Parker &amp; King, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-9\" pgmap=\"643\">H.

Contracts, \u00a7 372<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014When evidence sufficient to establish agreement for sale of automobile. In an action to recover on an agreement alleged to have been made for the sale of plaintiff\u2019s automobile, where the plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to the agreement is not only substantially uncontradicted, except in so far as it is weakened by the fact that in his letters to defendant, subsequent to the date of the alleged agreement, in which he undertook to state the circumstances of the transactions between them, plaintiff made no mention of such an agreement, but there are other facts tending to support his contention, and defendant\u2019s evidence contains no definite denial of plaintiff\u2019s evidence of the circumstances of the making of the agreement, a verdict for the plaintiff will not he disturbed.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b644-6\" pgmap=\"644\">2. Sales, \u00a7 17*\u2014when consideration sufficient. Where plaintiff purchased from defendant an automobile which was manufactured the year before, paying part of the price in cash and giving his notes due in one year for the balance, and defendant gave him the same guaranty for the car as was given for its cars for the current year, either the payment of the notes before due or release by plaintiff of defendant\u2019s guaranty would be sufficient consideration to support an agreement by defendant to sell the car for plaintiff for a minimum price and apply the proceeds to the cancellation of plaintiff\u2019s notes and pay him the balance.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b644-7\" pgmap=\"644\">3. - Appeal and error, \u00a7 1466*\u2014when admission of evidence in corroboration not error. Even though certain evidence tending to prove the consideration for a contract may not be competent, its admission is not error where plaintiff has testified fully to the same fact without objection.</headnotes> <p id=\"b644-8\" pgmap=\"644\">Brown, P.
