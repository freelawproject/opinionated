Jurgensen and John F. Jurgensen, trading as Jurgensen Tea Company. The action proceeded against Henry T. Jurgensen alone, the other party not being served, and it appearing that such other party had terminated business relations with the defendant. The premises involved were leased to the defendant under a lease providing for forfeiture if the rent remained unpaid after the first of the month. It appeared, however, that the check in payment of the rent was usually mailed by the defendant to the plaintiff a few days after the first, and on the occasion in question such monthly check was not received until thirteen days after the first of the month, when it was returned and these proceedings instituted. At the close of the trial a verdict was directed for the plaintiff, whereupon the defendant, Henry T. Jurgensen, brought error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b112-8\" pgmap=\"112\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b112-9\" pgmap=\"112\">1.
