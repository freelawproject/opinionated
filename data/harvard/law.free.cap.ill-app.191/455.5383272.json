J. Harrington &amp; Company were authorized to procure a tenant, and both presented one Reuter\u2019s name to the defendant as a prospective tenant, the former by letter of January 7, 1913, and the latter by a letter dated January 2, 1913, each asking in his letter to be protected as to commissions in case a lease was effected. In a letter, of January 8th acknowledging receipt of Thorpe\u2019s letter, W. A. Cameron, the president of defendant, said: \u201cWe will protect you in this - matter. \u2019 \u2019 About the middle of February, shortly after the deal was closed with Eeuter through the firm of Harrington &amp; Company, Cameron received a bill for commissions from Thorpe. Thereupon he wrote his agents, Harrington &amp; Company, that in looking over his files he had found correspondence with Thorpe above referred to and that he had overlooked it in negotiating with Harrington &amp; Company. No special reference was made to the fact he had also overlooked the said letter previously received from Harrington &amp; Company.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b500-9\" pgmap=\"500\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b500-10\" pgmap=\"500\">1.
