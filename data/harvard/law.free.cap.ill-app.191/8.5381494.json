Greenburg and Henry Duckgeischel to recover for money paid out by plaintiff for the defendants.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-9\" pgmap=\"52\">The facts showed. that defendants were about to form a corporation to be known as the \u201cGreen-Duck Company\u201d for the manufacture of some metal specialties. Being desirous of securing the room described in the lease hereinafter mentioned, to be occupied by the Green-Duck Company when it should become incorporated, they induced M. H. Cazier, who was president of the plaintiff Company, to secure a lease thereof, for them. The lease was to be taken in the name of the Chicago Form Company and M. H. Cazier, as lessees.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-10\" pgmap=\"52\">Cazier secured from one Warren Springer the lease desired for a term beginning December 1, 1906, and ending April 30,1912, at a monthly rental of $175, and paid the first month\u2019s rent therefor. On December 18, 1906, the following agreement in writing was executed;</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-11\" pgmap=\"52\">\u201cThis Agreement between the Chicago Form Company, and M.

This in consideration of their use and occupancy of the premises.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-6\" pgmap=\"53\">Chicago Form Company,</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-7\" pgmap=\"53\">M.

The costs in that case were $13, making the total amount of the judgment and costs $2,038. Of this judgment appellant had notice, but there is nothing in the record to show that he ever took any steps either to have it vacated or to pay it or to prevent plaintiffs from being forced to pay it. This judgment was satisfied December 19, 1911, and appellees\u2019 claim it was paid in full by them. Thereafter this suit was instituted. Plaintiffs in their affidavit of claim relied on the contract of December 18, 1906, heretofore set out and also on a claimed contract of January 8, 1907. The execution of the contract of January 8, 1907, was denied by appellant both in his affidavit of defense and on the witness stand. He also, introduced in evidence a special finding by a jury in another \"case as tending to prove that it had not been executed. The court thereupon excluded from the consideration of the jury all evidence as to its execution. The jury found the issues against the defendants and assessed the plaintiffs\u2019 damages at $2,038. Prom a judgment on this verdict, defendant George G. Greenburg alone appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b54-8\" pgmap=\"54\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b54-9\" pgmap=\"54\">1.
