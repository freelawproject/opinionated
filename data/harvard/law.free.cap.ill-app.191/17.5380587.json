In an action to recover the price of pad calendars sold and delivered, an affidavit of merits alleging that the calendars were in defective condition and not the same as ordered, and in effect admitted that defendant received and used the calendars and did not return or offer to return them at any time, held not to state a valid defense, where it did not allege that there was any express warranty of the quality or condition, that plaintiff was a manufacturer of the calendars or that they were made to order.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b63-9\" pgmap=\"63\">2.
