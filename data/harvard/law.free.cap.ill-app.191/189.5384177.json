Disorderly conduct, \u00a7 1<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when finding of not guilty sustained by evidence. On a prosecution for disorderly conduct in violation of a city ordinance, a finding of not guilty held not contrary to the evidence where the weight thereof depended mainly upon the credibility of witnesses.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-10\" pgmap=\"234\">2. Appeal and error, \u00a7 472*\u2014when limiting number of witnesses not preserved for review. Action of court in limiting the number of witnesses, held not preserved for review, where no objection was taken to the court\u2019s suggestion to that effect, but on the contrary it appeared that counsel appeared to have acquiesced in it.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-11\" pgmap=\"234\">3. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1512*\u2014when action of court in taking judicial notice of character of place witness worked not reversible. In a prosecution for disorderly conduct, the fact that the court improperly took judicial notice of the bad character of a place in which one of the witnesses at one time worked, held not reversible error, where the material fact in controversy was as to who were the aggressors in the fight.</headnotes><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-4\" pgmap=\"234\">. The same charge was also preferred and prosecuted at the same time against one Charles E. Selleck, growing out of the same occurrence and with the same result.
