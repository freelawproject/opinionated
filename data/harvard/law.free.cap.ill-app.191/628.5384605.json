In an action against an initial carrier to recover for damages alleged to have been caused an automobile in transporting it, where the defendant denies negligence, the damage is not shown by the introduction of an alleged hill of lading of defendant, the execution of which is not proven and the admission of which is objected to, reciting the receipt of the automobile \u201cin apparent good order,\u201d where it appears that it had been in use for some time and there is nothing to show that it was not in the same condition when shipped as when delivered at its destination.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AMg\" pgmap=\"673\">3.
