H. Andrews Company, a corporation, against C. P. Lautenschlager to recover damages for breach of a written contract of purchase of seating for a theater. From a judgment in favor of plaintiff for $349.62, defendant brings error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-9\" pgmap=\"587(124) 588(159)\">By written agreement defendant purchased and ordered from plaintiff seating for a theater to the number of 650 (more or less, according to plan) at $1.70 \u201cper setting\u201d according to the specifications attached to the contract and made a part thereof. By the original contract defendant also agreed to buy back approximately sixteen chairs at $1 per chair. 'Two days after the instrument was signed Lautenschlager went to plaintiff\u2019s office for the purpose, as he testified, of canceling the contract. With him was the representative of a rival seating concern, but that fact was not disclosed to plaintiff. Lautenschlager complained to Merle, secretary and general manager of the corporation, that the prices named in the instrument were too high. Merle consented, to a reduction of the price of the chairs from $1.70 to $1.6iy2 \u201cper setting\u201d and to an increase of the price of the sixteen chairs which plaintiff was to take back from defendant from $1 to $1.35 per chair, and Merle drew his pen through the original figures and wrote in the figures above named. Lautenschlager then, on the suggestion of the man who came with him that the contract had been changed and was void, refused to \u201cO. K.\u201d the changes so made in the instrument, and left plaintiff\u2019s office, saying that he would have to see his father before indicating by his initials his consent to the changes, and now contends that by such alteration in the instrument that the same was altered and either made void or as modified became the contract of the parties, and that the recovery must be made on the contract as so altered and modified.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b588-9\" pgmap=\"588\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b588-10\" pgmap=\"588\">1.

In an action for breach of contract where defendant was to furnish a seating plan for chairs purchased for a theater, on his failure to do so within the time given he cannot complain that the contract is void for uncertainty because it provided for the furnishing of an approximate number of chairs, the exact number of which could not be ascertained until the seating plan was furnished, especially where recovery was based on a less number than the approximation.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b589-5\" pgmap=\"589\">4.

Where recovery was sought for breach of a contract of purchase \u00f3f seating for a theater, evidence held insufficient to show mutilation of the instrument since the proposed alterations were innocent, failing to become effective because of the defendant\u2019s refusal to ratify the contract as altered, so that plaintiff could recover on the original obligation.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b589-6\" pgmap=\"589\">5. Sales, \u00a7 331*\u2014where amount of recovery not excessive. Where defendant in an action for breach of contract of purchase of seating for a theater contended that the damages were excessive, because if a plan of circular seating were adopted a less number of seats could have been placed in the theater than the number on which the recovery was based, held that the damages were properly estimated on the number furnished under the plan provided by the plaintiff, as the jury might take that number as the basis for estimating plaintiff\u2019s damages, the contract not providing for a circular plan of seating.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
