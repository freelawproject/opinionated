J. Begnell Company against Bichar\u00e1 A. Meiswinkel upon a contract in writing to do carpenter work on a building for $21,900. Payments were to be made on architect\u2019s certificates, the final certificate being conclusive evidence of performance of the contract. Plaintiff alleged that it secured a final architect\u2019s certificate for $2,838, that it furnished extras amounting to $526.56, that defendant paid $1,500 and refused to return the final architect\u2019s certificate. Plaintiff\u2019s claim was for $1,338, balance due under the certificate, and $526.56 for extras, with interest. At the trial defendant elected to stand by its affidavit of merits and the court entered judgment for the plaintiff for $1,540.89, and ordered that the cause proceed to trial as to the balance of the claim and interest. To reverse such judgment, defendant appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-9\" pgmap=\"282\">Campe, Koebel &amp; Mechling, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-10\" pgmap=\"282\">Joseph G.
