The case was submitted to the jury on plaintiff\u2019s evidence alone, defendant offering none but relying on the insufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s evidence to show either negligence on its part or the exercise of due care by deceased. To reverse a judgment in favor of plaintiff for four thousand dollars, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-8\" pgmap=\"243\">Deceased was walking with his head down as testified to by his widow. She last saw him at the first rail of the east tracks while so walking, and said that when he left the sidewalk the car was about two hundred feet north. She did not see the collision and the testimony of the only witness who did throws little light on the main questions. A passenger on the car testified that he felt the brakes put on suddenly and a jolt immediately afterwards. Another testified that the car was going slower and slower before the collision. The several witnesses testified that they heard no bell, and that the car was going at the rate of about six or eight miles an hour. There was no obstruction to a view of the car.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b244-6\" pgmap=\"244\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b244-7\" pgmap=\"244\">. 1.

In an action against a street railway company to recover for the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate caused by being struck by a car when he was crossing the street car tracks, a requested instruction on behalf of defendant to the effect that the mere happening of the accident together with the proof of the exercise of ordinary care on the part of the deceased does not raise a pre^ sumption of negligence on the part of defendant, held improperly refused, where the defendant offered no evidence in the case and there was danger that the jury might supplement the meagerness of the evidence with such presumption.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b244-8\" pgmap=\"244\">2. Street railroads, \u00a7 152*\u2014when argument of plaintiff\u2019s counsel prejudicial error. In an action against a street railway company to recover damages for the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate, where the. defendant relied wholly on the insufficiency, of plaintiff\u2019s case and introduced no evidence, action of court in permitting plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his argument, over objection, to allude to the fact that the defendant, though pleading not guilty, had not produced as witnesses persons whom its counsel in his opening statement said were on the car and knew how the accident happened, and thereafter permitting him to continue to dwell on the fact, comparing the attitude of the two sides in respect to producing witnesses to the occurrence, and also to say that defendant was afraid to put its motorman on the witness stand for cross-examination, held prejudicial error as encouraging plaintiff\u2019s counsel to argue, in effect, that defendant was guilty because it did not call witnesses in its power to produce.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b244-3\" pgmap=\"244\">Weymouth Kirkland and Frank L.
