Silber as lessee, which lease was guarantied by the defendant. The lease provided that the lessor should construct a bakeshop in the rear portion of the first floor of the building, and was made when the premises were occupied by one Goldstein. Bent was collected from said Goldstein after the making of the lease, and Goldstein claimed that the landlord had elected to treat him as a tenant from year to year. A forcible entry and detainer suit was brought against Goldstein and resulted in a verdict for the defendant, whereupon an appeal was prayed. Silber occupied the portion of the premises not occupied by Goldstein and some other property also belonging to the plaintiff. At the trial the issues were found in favor of the plaintiff, and this writ of error followed.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-9\" pgmap=\"110\">Jacob C.
