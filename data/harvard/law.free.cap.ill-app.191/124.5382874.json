In an action to recover a balance of commissions claimed to be due plaintiff from defendant on scales sold on commission for defendant, where praecipe and statement of claim state the nature of the claim and that it is for five hundred dollars, and the affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s claim states the demand to be for money due for services and commissions as set forth in the statement of claim, there is a sufficient statement of the amount of plaintiff\u2019s claim to comply with Rules 40 and 16 of the Municipal Court, even though the statement of claim admits that the exact number of scales sold- by plaintiff and the exact number that had been fully paid for could only appear by defendant\u2019s records when produced, and though the affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s claim states there is due to plaintiff from defendant a sum of money, the exact amount of which is unknown to plaintiff.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b169-6\" pgmap=\"169(263) 170(106)\">2. Principal and agent, \u00a7 8*\u2014when evidence sufficient to establish existence of agency in action for commissions. In an action for a balance of commissions claimed to be due plaintiff from defendant on sales by plaintiff of defendant\u2019s scales, plaintiff\u2019s, evidence showed that he was authorized by a third person to sell the scales in Chicago for defendant on a specified commission, part to be paid when each sale was made, the balance when the payment of the purchase price instalments were completed by the purchaser; that said third person represented to plaintiff that he represented defendant in Chicago; that said third person occupied a business place in which were kept defendant\u2019s scales; that said third person gave him blank forms of contract orders, prepared and printed in triplicate, \u2022 to be signed by the purchaser also \u201cfor\u201d defendants, \u201cby\u201d plaintiff, \u201csalesman,\u201d one of such triplicates to be kept by the purchaser, one by plaintiff and one to be sent to defendant; that on receipt of the first of these orders, defendant sent plaintiff a check for the specified part of the commission; that on transmitting subsequent orders he received the specified part of the commission. For defendant, its secretary and vice-president swore separately that plaintiff was never employed by defendant and that at the time of sales made they were doing business as partners and con- \u2022 trolled defendant\u2019s entire output; that the third person with whom plaintiff dealt worked for them and that plaintiff must, therefore, either have worked for them or for said third person. Defendant\u2019s bookkeeper also testified that plaintiff was never in defendant\u2019s \u201cdirect employment, that is, * * * never had a contract.\u201d It was also agreed that the third person would have testified that he was sales agent for the partnership. To contradict evidence of defendant\u2019s secretary that his partnership had no authority to employ and had never employed a sales agent for defendant, such a contract was introduced in evidence. To contradict the evidence of defendant\u2019s vice-president and secretary as to when they became such officers, letterheads of defendant were introduced. It was held that .the evidence was sufficient to establish plaintiff\u2019s agency for defendant.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b169-8\" pgmap=\"169\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
