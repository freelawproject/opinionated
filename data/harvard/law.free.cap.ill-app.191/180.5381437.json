Plaintiff had verdict and judgment for nine hundred dollars. To reverse the judgment, defendant prosecutes a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-9\" pgmap=\"224\">The place of the accident was at the intersection of a north and south street and an east and west street, and a street running northeasterly and southwesterly. Plaintiff was driving a loaded wagon north on the first mentioned street and when he reached the intersection he attempted to cross the street car tracks of defendant for the purpose of turning west on the second named street on which a car was approaching from the west. There was evidence tending to show that when plaintiff started to cross the tracks the street car was about two hundred or three hundred feet away coming at full speed and that it did not slacken until it struck the wagon. There was also testimony that no bell or gong was sounded and that the car ran by the point at the intersection where passengers were waiting to board the car.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b224-10\" pgmap=\"224\">A.
