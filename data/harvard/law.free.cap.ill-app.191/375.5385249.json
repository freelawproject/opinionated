Appeal and ebrob, \u00a7 1303*\u2014presumption of sufficiency of evidence to sustain finding.

Appeal and error, \u00a7 1303*\u2014effect of statutory requirement as against finding. The fact that the statute requires a defendant demanding a jury to pay a fee of six dollars, does not overcome a finding of the court to the contrary, that no costs had accrued to either side upon the entry of an order of dismissal, since a presumption of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the finding prevails as against a presumption that the statutory fee was paid in a given case.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b420-8\" pgmap=\"420\">5.
