Hildebrandt, Jr., on behalf of the H. Hildebrandt Fuel Company, and dated March 1st, 1913, and approved by the creditors of the said H. Hildebrandt Fuel Company; to all the property of the said Company, to one H. N. Lund. It is, however, understood that I do not in any way represent or warrant that I have perfect title to said property, or that I can deliver perfect title or possession of same, except as is shown in the above named instruments, and the purchaser, H. 1ST. Lund, hereby assumes all risks of loss and damage of any kind, nature or description. And it is further agreed that the only effect of this assignment is to transfer whatever title I now have or may have without question of legality or without any warranty on my part whatsoever.
