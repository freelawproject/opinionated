The defendant contended that the applicant made false statements in the application for insurance both as to a disease of the liver and the excessive use of liquors, and it appeared that Sharmach\u2019s death was caused by chronic organic heart disease, cirrhosis of the liver being a contributing cause, and such disease of the liver was frequently caused by excessive use of intoxicating liquors. It also appeared that deceased suffered from delirium tremens. At the trial the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $1,361.29.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b299-7\" pgmap=\"299\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b299-8\" pgmap=\"299\">1.
