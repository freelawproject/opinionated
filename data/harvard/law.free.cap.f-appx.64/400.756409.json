The district court denied Ayers\u2019 motion to dismiss the indictment, finding that \u00a7 922(g)(9) is constitutional under the Commerce Clause and Fifth and Tenth Amendments. Ayers then entered a conditional plea of guilty pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2), reserving the right to appeal the adverse determination of his motion to dismiss. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-20\">Ayers asserts that Congress exceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause in enacting \u00a7 922(g) because it is merely a criminal statute that has nothing to do with interstate commerce. As support for his argument, Ayers relies upon <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), and <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000). Ayers\u2019 argument is foreclosed by our decisions in <em>United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 138 (4th Cir.2001) (holding that <em>Morrison </em>and <em>Jones </em>do not affect our decisions regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)), and <em>United States v. Wells, </em>98 F.3d 808, 810-11 (4th Cir.1996) (holding that jurisdictional requirement of \u00a7 922(g) satisfies Commerce Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-21\">Ayers also asserts that \u00a7 922(g) violates the Tenth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. We have rejected similar claims in <em>United States v. Bostic, </em>168 F.3d 718, 724 (4th Cir.1999) (Tenth Amendment), and <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>209 F.3d 319, 323 (4th Cir.2000) (Fifth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-22\">Because Ayers\u2019 claims are foreclosed by circuit precedent,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the district court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>not err in denying the motion to dismiss the indictment. <em>See United States v. Good, </em>326 F.3d 589, 591 (4th Cir.2003) (stating standard of review). Accordingly, we affirm Ayers\u2019 conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-18\"> To the extent that Ayers urges us to reconsider our cases finding that \u00a7 922(g) is constitutional, \" \u2018a panel of this court cannot overrule, explicitly or implicitly, the precedent set by a prior panel of this court. Only the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc </em>can do that.' \u201d <em>Scotts Co. v. United Indus. Corp., </em>315 F.3d 264, 271 n. 2 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Mentavlos v. Anderson, </em>249 F.3d 301, 312 n. 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>(4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 952, 122 S.Ct. 349, 151 L.Ed.2d 264 (2001)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
