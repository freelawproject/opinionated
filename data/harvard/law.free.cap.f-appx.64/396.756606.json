The applicable guideline range was calculated to be 360 months to life imprisonment. However, in view of Wiggs\u2019s prior drug convictions and the quantity of drugs attributable to him, the district court concluded that the drug count carried a statutorily-required life sentence. The court imposed concurrent 240-month sentences for the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">On appeal, this court determined that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), it was plain error for the court to sentence Wiggs to a life sentence under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2003). We remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">On remand, the district court sentenced Wiggs to 360 months on the drug conspiracy charge and 240 months on each money laundering count. The 240-month sentences run concurrent with each other and consecutive to the 360-month sentence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Wiggs appeals, alleging that the sentence is disproportionate to the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">This court does not review a sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) (2000); <em>United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990). Wiggs does not challenge calculation of the guideline range; the district court sentence is well within that range. Therefore, \u201cwe cannot address appellant\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s exercise of sentencing discretion.\u201d <em>Porter, </em>909 F.2d at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">We affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-10\"> The term of imprisonment is to be followed by concurrent supervised release terms of six, three, and three years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
