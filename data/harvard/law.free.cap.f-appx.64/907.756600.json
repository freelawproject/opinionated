Cleveland appeals his convictions and 154-month sentence imposed by the district court following his guilty pleas to bank robbery (three counts), obstructing interstate commerce (one count), and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence (one count), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c), 1951, 2113(a) (2000). In his appeal, filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel for Cleveland claims to have found no non-frivolous grounds for appeal, but challenges the district court\u2019s acceptance of Cleveland\u2019s guilty plea and calculation of his sentence. Cleveland has been advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-20\">Neither of the claims presented by counsel were preserved before the district court. Accordingly, they are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 123 S.Ct. 200, 154 L.Ed.2d 169 (2002); <em>United States v. Ford, </em>88 F.3d 1350, 1355 (4th Cir.1996). Cleveland first assigns error to the district court\u2019s acceptance of his guilty pleas. We have reviewed the transcript of the hearing conducted before the district court and are satisfied that Cleveland was afforded the protections of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, as well as the Due Process Clause. Accordingly, this claim merits no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-23\">Cleveland next claims that the district court erred in calculating his sentence. We have likewise reviewed the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines and find no plain error. Cleveland\u2019s sentence was the minimum in the applicable guidelines range, and there was no error in the determination of that range. Moreover, the sentence did not exceed the maximum applicable under the relevant statutes. Accordingly, we deny relief on this claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-24\">Finding no meritorious issues upon our review of the record pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
