Pichardo\u2019s petition sought a declaratory judgment permanently enjoining the United States from seeking his deportation, or, at the least, his deportation to the Dominican Republic. Because Pichardo does not challenge the validity of his conviction or sentence, the district court improperly construed Pichardo\u2019s petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See In re Vial, </em>115 F.3d 1192, 1194 (4th Cir.1997). Thus, no certificate of appealability is required to appeal the district court\u2019s order and the standards therefor are inapplicable to this case. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1040, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Furthermore, Pichardo sought relief under \u00a7 2241 because the sentencing order for his conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000) did not memorialize any agreement by the Government not to deport him. Indeed, the district court would have had no jurisdiction in Pichardo\u2019s criminal proceeding to enjoin his deportation in the future. Because neither the Attorney General nor the INS has ordered Pichardo\u2019s departure, his petition must be and is denied without prejudice as premature. We express no opinion as to whether the Government has failed to fulfill any agreement not to have Pichardo deported. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denying relief on that alternate ground. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
