Woods appeals the district court\u2019s orders dismissing his motion to reduce his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Woods that failure to file specific objections to the recommendation within ten days plus three days for mailing could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Woods placed objections in the prison mail system on February 5, 2003,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and they were postmarked on February 6, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">Despite this timely filing, the district court did not enter Woods\u2019s filing on the docket until February 10, 2003.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On that day the district court, noting that no objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation had been filed, adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendations and dismissed Woods\u2019s motion. Upon receipt of Woods\u2019s objections, the district court found the filing untimely and moot. The district court found that Woods\u2019s objections failed to indicate specific error in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and, without a de novo review, reaffirmed its February 10 order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-17\">We find that any error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Woods\u2019s objections were not timely filed is harmless. Nor does the district court\u2019s failure to perform a de novo review necessitate reversal because Woods failed to raise specific objections after receiving proper notice and thereby waives his right to appellate review. <em>See Orpiano v. Johnson, </em>687 F.2d 44, 47 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-18\">Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We grant in forma pauperis status in both appeals. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-13\">. <em>See Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988) (prisoner's notice of appeal filed on the day it is delivered to prison officials).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Als\">. Woods\u2019s objections were due on February 10, 2003, ten days after the magistrate judge issued her report plus the three days specified in the magistrate judge\u2019s report for mailing. <em>See </em>Fed.RXiv.P. 6(a) (providing that \"intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays\u201d are excluded when the time period is less than eleven days).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A6l\">. Woods also raises two claims for the first time on appeal. This Court generally does not address issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
