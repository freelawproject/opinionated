However, he concedes in his brief that he waived his right to appeal these convictions in his plea agreement. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-26\">In No. 02-4930, Davis appeals his conviction and sentence for criminal contempt of court in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 (2000), claiming there is insufficient evidence to support the conviction. Criminal contempt of court is defined, in part, as the \u201c[mjisbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice.\u201d \u00a7 401. Davis\u2019 behavior interrupted the district court\u2019s effort at concluding the sentencing hearing and his subsequent inflammatory remarks were clearly directed at disrupting the respect and decorum of the court. <em>See United States v. </em>Murphy, 326 F.3d 501 (4th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we conclude sufficient evidence supports the conviction, and we affirm the order of the district court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-27\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-28\">No. <em>02-4929\u2014DISMISSED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-29\">No. <em>02-4930\u2014AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
