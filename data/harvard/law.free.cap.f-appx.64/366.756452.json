Liles appeals the enhancement of his sentence for the use of a dangerous weapon. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E), cmt. (n. 1) (2001) (providing for enhancement for use of non-lethal object in a manner that created the impression that the object was a weapon). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-23\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989). The victim of the robbery, the postmistress, testified at the sentencing proceeding that Liles jumped over the counter and demanded postal orders. When she hesitated, Liles stated he did not want to hurt her and reached into his pocket and partially withdrew a black metallic object. She testified she was afraid the object might have been a gun. The district court found this testimony more credible than Liles\u2019s version that he was merely reaching toward a pocket for a glove and never withdrew anything from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>his pocket. Despite the postmistress\u2019s earlier statement that the object may have been a cell phone, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in its factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Liles\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
