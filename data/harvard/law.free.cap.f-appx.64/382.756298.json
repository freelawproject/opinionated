A 500-pound transformer attached to the pole fell through the cab of Green\u2019s truck, pinning him to the steering wheel, and ultimately killing him. The representatives of Green\u2019s estate and the court-appointed guardian of his children (collectively \u201cthe Estate\u201d) brought this action against several parties, including the original designer and manufacturer of the pole, Reilly Industries, Inc., alleging that the knot in the pole rendered it defective, and that this defect caused Green\u2019s death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court granted summary judgment to Reilly on the ground that Maryland\u2019s statute of repose, Md.Code Ann., Courts and Jud. Proceedings \u00a7 5-108(a) (2002), barred the Estate\u2019s action against Reilly. The Estate appeals, contending that the pole did not constitute an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d within the meaning of the statute of repose. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-17\">In 1967, Potomac Electric Power Company (\u201cPEPCO\u201d) ordered the pole from Reilly (then Republic Creosoting Company). PEPCO installed the pole in an industrial park in Gaithersburg, Maryland in 1968. Three transformers were suspended from the top of the pole, as were electrical wires which ran from an existing pole across the street, down the pole, into an underground trench, and ultimately to a warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-18\">When initially installed, the pole did not facilitate the supply of electricity to the parcel of land on which it was located. The pole was located on Parcel E owned by a Mr. Adams, but was used to provide electricity to a warehouse located on the adjoining Parcel D, owned by Mr. and Mrs. Salkeld. Though there was some dispute on this point at oral argument, the only reasonable reading of the record indicates that at the time PEPCO installed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>pole on Parcel E, that parcel was undeveloped. After the pole was installed, apparently two buildings were built on Parcel E and Adams had sold the parcel to a Mr. Kimmel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Sometime between 1980 and 1989, Kimmel sold a 25-foot right of way to the Salkelds; this right of way included the land on which the pole was located. As the district court put it, \u201c[a]t that point, the utility pole was used to supply power to the parcel of land in which it was attached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, here the Estate. <em>Bryant v. Bell Atlantic Maryland, Inc., </em>288 F.3d 124, 132 (4th Cir.2002). Because this is a diversity case, we apply Maryland law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1652 (West 1994); <em>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Maryland\u2019s statute of repose provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">Except as provided by this section, no cause of action for damages accrues and a person may not seek contribution or indemnity for damages incurred when wrongful death, personal injury, or injury to real or personal property resulting from the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property occurs more than 20 years after the date the entire improvement first becomes available for its intended use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">Md.Code Ann., Courts and Jud. Proceedings \u00a7 5-108(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">The district court held that the pole constituted an improvement to real property that had been installed more than 20 years before it was hit by Green\u2019s truck, and that the statute of repose, therefore, barred the Estate\u2019s action against Reilly. The Estate contends that the pole never constituted an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d within the meaning of the statute of repose. Thus, the issue before us is whether the pole was an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d within the meaning of Maryland\u2019s statute of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">Maryland courts have discussed the meaning of the term \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d in the statute of repose on three pertinent occasions. First, in <em>Allentown Plaza Assocs. v. Suburban Propane Gas Carp., </em>43 Md.App. 337, 405 A.2d 326 (1979), Maryland\u2019s intermediate appellate court held that gas meters improperly attached to an underground pipeline system were not an \u201cimprovement to real property,\u201d under the statute. The court noted that \u201c[i]n determining what constitutes an \u2018improvement to real property\u2019 courts have employed two basic approaches. One applies common law fixture analysis. The other ... adopts a \u2018commonsense\u2019 interpretation of the phrase.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344-45, 405 A.2d 326 (citations omitted). It determined that Maryland courts applied the \u201ccommonsense\u201d interpretation, and held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>that the gas meters did not fall within the commonsense meaning of \u201cimprovement to real property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346-47, 405 A.2d 326.\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In <em>Rose v. Fox Pool Corp., </em>335 Md. 351, 643 A.2d 906 (1994), Maryland\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, agreed with the <em>Allentown </em>court that Maryland used a \u201ccommonsense\u201d interpretation to discern the meaning of \u201cimprovement to real property,\u201d but the <em>Rose </em>court rejected the definition of improvement that had been used by the <em>Allentown </em>court. Instead, the <em>Rose </em>court found persuasive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGY\">the narrower definition of \u201cimprovement\u201d found in <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>which several courts have relied upon in construing the term:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">[a] valuable addition made to property (usually real estate) or an amelioration in its condition, amounting to more than mere repairs or replacement, costing labor or capital, and intended to enhance its value, beauty or utility or to adapt it for new or further purposes. Generally has reference to buildings, but may also include any permanent structure or other development, such as a street, sidewalks, sewers, utilities, etc. An expenditure to extend the useful life of an asset or to improve its performance over that of the original asset. Such expenditures are capitalized as part of the asset\u2019s cost.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 918 (citing, <em>inter alia, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>757 (6th ed. 1990) (hereinafter <em>\u201cBlack\u2019s\u201d)). </em>The <em>Rose </em>court further explained that \u201cthe nature of the addition or betterment, its permanence and relationship to the land and its occupants, and its effect on the value and use of the property are factors which common sense dictates should be considered in making the case by case determination of whether it is an \u2018improvement to real property\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 5-108.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Allentown, </em>405 A.2d at 332).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Finally, in <em>Hickman v. Carven, </em>366 Md. 362, 784 A.2d 31 (2001), the Court of Appeals recently considered again what constitutes an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d under the statute of repose. There, owners of a residential subdivision lot sued the developers of the subdivision maintaining that the developers concealed a burial ground on the lot. The developers contended that removing tombstones from the plot more than twenty years earlier to develop a larger tract of land constituted an integral part of an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d and so the statute of repose barred any damages arising from the removal. The <em>Hickman </em>court \u201caccepted] the doctrine of regarding items or work that are an integral component part of a larger improvement as within the ambit of \u00a7 5-108(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38. However, the court concluded that \u201cthe removal of [tombstones and other graveyard markers] cannot reasonably be said to be an integral component part of the [land development.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">On appeal, the Estate contends that these cases support two arguments as to why the pole did not constitute an \u201cimprovement to real property.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Estate argues that the pole was not an <em>essential component </em>of any improvement. Second, the Estate maintains that if the pole was an improvement at all, it was not an improvement to the property on which it was located, and was therefore outside the statutory meaning of \u201cimprovement to real property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Initially, the Estate argues that the pole was not essential to any improvement because PEPCO could have used alternative methods to deliver electricity, such as placing the wires underground. This argument fails, however, because Maryland law does not require that an item be the <em>only </em>means of achieving a particular purpose in order to be an essential, or integral component of an improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In <em>Hickman, </em>784 A.2d at 37-38, the Court of Appeals adopted the rule that an \u201citem\u201d is \u201can-improvement if it is an integral component of a project that itself would qualify as an improvement,\u201d citing <em>inter alia, Lederman v. Cragun\u2019s Pine Beach Resort, </em>247 F.3d 812 (8th Cir.2001), and <em>Two Denver Highlands Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Dillingham Constr., </em>932 P.2d 827 (Colo.App.1996). The <em>Lederman </em>court considered a trench that had been dug by a contractor for the purpose of temporarily relocating a communications cable. <em>Lederman, </em>247 F.3d at 814. It held that the trench was an \u201cindispensible part\u201d of the overall project, although nothing suggested that the trench was the only means of relocating the cable. <em>Id. </em>at 815. Similarly, the court in <em>Two Denver Highlands </em>held that the concrete used to build a parking garage was an \u201cessential\u201d component of the improvement, notwithstanding the fact that the parking garage could surely have been built out of other material. <em>Two Denver Highlands, </em>932 P.2d at 830; <em>see also Ebert, </em>723 A.2d at 601 (\u201cThe availability of another form of energy, as valuable as it may be, does not prevent a gas line from being an improvement\u201d). Thus, as these cases make clear, the existence of a substitute for a component does not necessarily render that component non-integral.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">In this case, the pole was integral to provision of electricity because the electrical wires and transformers, like the communications cable in <em>Lederman, </em>had to be located out of harm\u2019s way. To be sure, use of the pole does not constitute the sole means by which this could be achieved, but it certainly constituted an ordinary and reasonable means to do this. Once it was determined that the wires and transformers were to be suspended above the ground, the pole was essential, allowing passage on the roadway below and reducing the risk of electrocution to people on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">Second, the Estate argues that the pole was not an improvement to the property <em>on which it was installed, </em>and was therefore outside the statutory meaning of \u201cimprovement to real property.\u201d This argument founders on its premise\u2014that the pole was not an improvement to the property on which it was installed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">In elaborating on the \u201ccommonsense\u201d meaning of \u201cimprovement to real property,\u201d the <em>Rose </em>court referred to the <em>Black\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cimprovement.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>643 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>A.2d at 918. <em>Black\u2019s </em>defines an \u201cimprovement\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">[a] valuable addition made to property (usually real estate) or an amelioration in its condition, amounting to more than mere repairs or replacement, costing labor or capital, and intended <em>to enhance its </em>value, beauty or <em>utility or to adapt it for new or farther purposes. </em>Generally has reference to buildings, but may also include any permanent structure or other development, such as a street, sidewalks, sewers, utilities, etc....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (citing <em>Black\u2019s </em>at 757).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Relying on this definition, the district court believed that \u201c[t]he utility pole is practically in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary as an improvement to real property.\u201d Given our earlier determination that the pole was an essential component to the provision of electricity, we agree that the pole clearly would be an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d under the Maryland statute of repose if, when installed, the pole had been used to provide electricity to the property on which it was located. In such circumstances, the installation of the pole would clearly \u201cenhance ... [the] utility\u201d of the property. This case, however, is complicated by the fact that the pole was <em>not </em>used to provide electricity to the land on which it was located until Kimmel sold the 25-foot right of way to the Salkelds sometime between 1980 and 1989\u2014less than 20 years before Green\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">If, for this reason, the pole cannot be regarded as \u201cenhanc[ing] ... [the] utility\u201d of the property on which it was located for the requisite twenty years, we believe it nonetheless constituted an improvement to that property under another portion of the <em>Black\u2019s </em>definition. That is, from the time the pole was installed (and therefore more than twenty years), it constituted an addition to the property on which it was installed that was \u201cintended ... to adapt it for new or further purposes.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s </em>at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">The evidence demonstrates that the pole was installed in an empty field, on a parcel of land that was theretofore undeveloped. Today, the area is a fully developed industrial park. There can be no doubt that this development would not have occurred if electricity had not been provided to the area. Although no building existed on Parcel E at the time the pole was installed\u2014and there was therefore no need for electricity on that parcel\u2014the installation of the pole facilitated the future development of that land by providing a source of electricity for the future. Thus, even at the time it was installed, the pole constituted an improvement to the land on which it was located, Parcel E, because the pole was \u201cintended ... to adapt it for new or further purposes,\u201d <em>id., </em>by facilitating the provision of electricity to any future development on Parcel E. Furthermore, it is likely that the easy access to electricity offered by the pole also \u201cenhanced ... the value\u201d of Parcel E, another component of <em>Black\u2019s </em>definition of improvement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">In sum, because the pole at issue here constituted an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d within the meaning of Maryland\u2019s statute of repose, the district court correctly ruled that the statute barred the Estate\u2019s claim against Reilly. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-13\">. The Estate also sued the owner of the property on which the pole was located, the owner of the pole, and the company responsible for inspecting the pole. Those cases have been resolved and are not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\">. Dale Salkeld testified in deposition that \"we built [the warehouse] in 1968. There was nothing else here;\u201d that the pole was installed in \u201can open area field;\u201d that the building now on Parcel E \"wasn\u2019t there\u201d in 1968; and that the buildings located on Parcel E were built after the pole was installed, when Adams sold the property. Although Dana Salkeld stated that there was an Easy Go building in the area in 1968, it appears that the Easy Go building was on the other side of the street from Parcels D and E. This fact is not <em>absolutely </em>clear from the record (because for some reason the parties chose not to include in the record the various deposition exhibits and testimony that dealt with the issue directly) but we believe it is the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence that is in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b419-8\">. The Estate also relies on cases from other jurisdictions that speak to the issue of whether a utility pole is an \"improvement to real property.\u201d We do not find these cases very helpful both because they interpret different statutes and because they reach inconsistent results. <em>Compare Turner v. Marable-Pirkle, Inc., </em>238 Ga. 517, 233 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1977) (\"The erection of a power pole, and the placing of the necessary equipment thereon, for the transmission of electricity is not such an improvement to real estate as was contemplated by the [Georgia statute of limitations]\u201d); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Steele-Waseca Coop. Elec., </em>469 N.W.2d 517, 519 (Minn.Ct.App.1991) (\"Rather than being an improvement to appellants' property, [an electric pole and transformer] is an addition to respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>distribution system\u201d under Minnesota law), <em>with Ebert v. S. Jersey Gas Co., </em>157 N.J. 135, 723 A.2d 599, 601 (1999) (holding that a gas line, although a conduit, also is a valuable improvement under New Jersey law); <em>MoraSan Miguel Elec. Coop. v. Hicks &amp; Ragland Consulting &amp; Eng\u2019g Co., </em>93 N.M. 175, 598 P.2d 218, 220 (1979) (holding that installation of a power line is a physical improvement under New Mexico law).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
