Miller appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of social security disability and supplemental security income benefits in accordance with the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">We must uphold the district court\u2019s disability determination if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2000); <em>see also Hays v. Sullivan, </em>907 F.2d 1453, 1456 (4th Cir.1990). Miller argues that the district court erred by failing to consider additional evidence submitted with her objections to the report and recommendation. This argument fails because the district court may not consider evidence that was not before the Commissioner. <em>See Smith v. Chater, </em>99 F.3d 635, 638 n. 5 (4th Cir.1996) (citing <em>United States v. Carlo Bianchi &amp; Co., </em>373 U.S. 709, 714-15, 83 S.Ct. 1409, 10 L.Ed.2d 652 (1963)). However, as a pro se litigant, Miller is entitled to a liberal construction of her pleadings. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972). Therefore, we will construe Miller\u2019s informal brief to advance the alternative argument that the district court should have remanded the case to the Commissioner in light of the additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-16\">A reviewing court may remand a case to the Commissioner on the basis of new evidence if four prerequisites are met: (1) the evidence must be relevant to the determination of disability at the time the apphcation(s) was first filed; (2) the evidence must be material to the extent that the Commissioner\u2019s decision might reasonably have been different had the new evidence been before her; (3) there must be good cause for the claimant\u2019s failure to submit the evidence when the claim was before the Commissioner; and (4) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>claimant must make at least a general showing of the nature of the new evidence to the reviewing court. <em>See Borders v. Heckler, </em>777 F.2d 954, 955 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Although Miller made the requisite showing of the nature of the new evidence by attaching copies to her objections to the report and recommendation, she fails to satisfy the remaining prongs of the <em>Borders </em>test. First, because Miller\u2019s additional evidence relates to the time period between June 2000 and October 2002, it is not relevant to the determination of disability. Moreover, even assuming the relevance of the additional evidence, it is not material because it would not reasonably have changed the Commissioner\u2019s decision had it been before her. The findings contained in the additional records appear to reflect rather mild impairments and are not accompanied by any restrictions on Miller\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Finally, Miller fails to show good cause for the failure to file the additional evidence with the Commissioner. Her only explanation is that the hospital was late in getting test results to patients. However, Miller admits to receiving some of the records prior to submitting them in order to submit all of the evidence together. Furthermore, no such explanation was offered when the ALJ left the record open on two separate occasions for the submission of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">While Miller\u2019s newly submitted evidence cannot be considered in this appeal, we note that Miller may be able to file a new claim with a new onset date where such evidence may be relevant. We express no opinion, however, as to the merits of any such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Miller v. Barnhart, </em>No. CA-01-593 (E.D.Va. Nov. 21, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
