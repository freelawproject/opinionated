Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-25\">Spivey first argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized on March 31, 1999. Spivey asserts that the police officers who stopped him did not possess the requisite reasonable suspicion that he was engaged in illegal activity. The factual findings underlying a motion to suppress are reviewed for clear error, while the legal determinations are reviewed de novo. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-26\">In <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), the Supreme Court held that, in order to conduct an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>investigatory stop of an individual, a police officer must have an objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>at 20-22, 88 S.Ct. 1868. The Court subsequently held that, in evaluating police conduct in a <em>Terry </em>stop, reviewing courts \u201cmust look at the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 of each case to see whether the detaining officer has a \u2018particular and objective basis\u2019 for suspecting legal wrongdoing.\u201d <em>United, States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417-18, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981)). Our review of the record of the suppression hearing convinces us that the officers possessed reasonable suspicion that Spivey was driving on a suspended license, and were justified in pursuing and stopping him. The district court correctly denied Spivey\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Spivey next contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to relieve counsel, and that this denial resulted in Spivey receiving ineffective assistance of counsel. Although he captions this portion of his argument as contesting the denial of a motion to relieve counsel, Spivey\u2019s argument is limited to the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. Spivey has therefore waived review of the denial of his motion to relieve counsel by failing to properly argue that issue. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Rather, to allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant must bring his claim in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See id.; United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994). An exception exists when the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>See King, </em>119 F.3d at 295. We have reviewed the record and conclude that it does not conclusively demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">Spivey\u2019s final argument is that the district court erred in determining that his two previous convictions for crack cocaine distribution were separate convictions that served as predicates for sentencing as an Armed Career Criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000). Review of a district court\u2019s application of a statutory sentencing enhancement is de novo. <em>United States v. Letterlough, </em>63 F.3d 332, 334 (4th Cir.1995). In <em>Letterlough, </em>we adopted the majority test for determining whether convictions occur on different occasions. According to that test, \u201c[cjonvictions occur on occasions different from one another if each of the prior convictions arose out of a <em>separate and distinct criminal episode.\u201d Id. </em>at 335 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Blackwood, </em>913 F.2d 139, 146 (4th Cir.1990). In this case, the district court correctly applied <em>Letterlough </em>and concluded that Spivey\u2019s two drug distribution convictions were separate for purposes of sentencing under \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">We therefore affirm Spivey\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
