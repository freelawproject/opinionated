The district court enjoined the County from enforcing those provisions of its recently enacted Bill No. 39-02 that apply to methadone treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>centers. <em>See Smith-Berch, Inc. v. Baltimore County, Maryland, </em>216 F.Supp.2d 537, 540 (D.Md.2002) <em>(\u201cSmith-Berch II\"). </em>The district court enjoined Bill No. 39-02 on the grounds that it assertedly violated an injunction that the district court had entered years earlier. The order entered in that earlier opinion stated simply that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-5\">1. Plaintiff Smith-Berch, Inc.\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-6\">2. Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is denied;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-7\">3. The Clerks shall close this case; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-8\">4. Copies of this Order and the accompanying Memorandum shall be mailed to counsel of record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-9\"><em>Smith Berch, Inc. v. Baltimore County, Maryland, </em>115 F.Supp.2d 520, 524-25 (D.Md.2000) <em>(\u201cSmith Berch F).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">The County challenges the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction in <em>Smith-Berch II, </em>arguing that the district court had lost jurisdiction after the entry of summary judgment in <em>Smith-Berch I </em>by closing the case without issuing actual injunctive relief. The plaintiff, Smith Berch, Inc. (\u201cSmith Berch\u201d), argues that the district court had actually granted injunctive relief in its <em>Smith-Berch I </em>order because the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted, contained a request for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">Though the district court\u2019s <em>Smith-Berch I </em>order may have been intended to grant the injunctive relief requested by SmithBerch, it did not do so as a matter of law. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 states, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-12\">Every order granting an injunction ... shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; <em>shall be specific in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained. ...</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d) (emphasis added). Thus, according to Rule 65(d), the district court was required to specifically state the terms of its injunction and could not simply incorporate the plaintiffs proposed injunction in its order. As the <em>Smith-Berch I </em>order does not comply with Rule 65(d)\u2014 indeed, it does not even purport to grant any injunctive relief\u2014we cannot but conclude that the district court did not issue an injunction in <em>Smith-Berch I. </em>As a result, the case was closed and the district court\u2019s jurisdiction ended. The district court\u2019s opinion and order in <em>Smith-Berch II </em>were therefore without jurisdictional basis. We accordingly vacate the district court\u2019s order in <em>Smith-Berch II </em>and remand with instructions to dismiss. If Smith-Berch wishes to challenge Bill No. 39-02, it may do so in a new, separate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-17\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
