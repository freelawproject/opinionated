He appeals the district court\u2019s denial, on the recommendation of the magistrate judge, of his motion to suppress evidence and his motion to dismiss the indictment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">First, Hendrickson asserts error in the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress a statement he made to the arresting officers. The statement was made after a search warrant was obtained that authorized a search of Hendrickson\u2019s car. The district court reviewed the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and held an evidentiary hearing. We review the factual findings underlying the denial of a motion to suppress for clear error, while reviewing the legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). While we find Hendrickson was in custody and had not received the warnings required by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), his self-incriminating statement was voluntary and was not made in response to interrogation. <em>See Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301-02, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980). Accordingly, the district court properly denied the motion to suppress the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">Second, Hendrickson appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment based on an allegation that the Government destroyed or failed to preserve exculpatory evidence. As with the motion to suppress, we review the legal conclusions underlying the denial of the motion to dismiss the indictment based on government misconduct de novo and the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. McDonald, </em>61 F.3d 248, 253 (4th Cir.1995). The district court found credible the officers\u2019 testimony that Hendrickson stated there was a gun and drugs in a duffle bag on the back seat of his car prior to the search of the car and, after evidence of criminal activity was recovered from the car, Hendrickson stated the woman accompanying him was not involved in the criminal activity. Based on these factual findings we cannot impute to the officers knowledge that the duffle bag was apparently or potentially exculpatory evidence. <em>See Arizona v. Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 57-58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988); <em>see also California v. Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 488-89, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984). Accordingly, the district court properly denied the motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">We affirm Hendrickson\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before this court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
