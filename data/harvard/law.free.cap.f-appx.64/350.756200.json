Wyatt appeals his conviction on three grounds. Wyatt claims (1) the district court should have dismissed the indictment because <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002), renders \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) unconstitutional; (2) section 2252A(a)(5)(B) violates Congress\u2019s authority under the Commerce Clause; and (3) the district court erred in denying the motion to suppress evidence because there was no probable cause for issuance of the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">Our jurisdiction is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000). For the following reasons, we affirm Wyatt\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">Wyatt first contends that <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>renders \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) unconstitutional. <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>invalidated \u00a7\u00a7 2256(8)(B) and 2256(8)(D) of the CPPA, provisions that extended the definition of child pornography to include virtual images, or any image which \u201cappears to be\u201d of a minor, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(8)(B) (2000), or \u201cconveys the impression that the material is or contains a visual depiction of a minor,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2256(8)(D). <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>122 S.Ct. at 1405-06. The Court in <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>found that these sections were overbroad, in violation of the First Amendment. <em>Id. </em>No other provisions of the CPPA were invalidated. In fact, throughout the opinion, the Supreme Court expressly limited its holding to these two provisions because they bring virtual images within the purview of the CPPA. <em>Id. </em>at 1397,1405-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">Other circuits have agreed that <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>invalidated only the criminalization of virtual pornography. <em>See United States v. Kelly, </em>314 F.3d 908, 2002 WL 31911037 (7th Cir.2003) (finding that <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>relates only to the portion of the CPPA that defines child pornography to include virtual images and concluding that the other sections of the CPPA can be severed and left intact); <em>United States v. Hersh, </em>297 F.3d 1233, 1254 n. 31 (11th Cir.2002) (noting that <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>applies only to virtual images). Wyatt was convicted under \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) of the CPPA, a section unaltered by <em>Free Speech Coalition. </em>Therefore, the district court did not err in refusing to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-17\">Next, Wyatt argues that \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) exceeds Congress\u2019s authority under the Commerce Clause because such possession of child pornography does not necessarily affect interstate commerce. However, it is well settled that Congress may regulate even purely intra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>state activity where those activities substantially affect interstate commerce. <em>See United, States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 558-59, 115 S.Ct: 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) (identifying \u201cactivities that substantially affect interstate commerce\u201d as one of three broad categories' of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power) (citing <em>Maryland v. Wirtz, </em>392 U.S. 183, 196 n. 27, 88 S.Ct. 2017, 20 L.Ed.2d 1020 (1968)). In addition, \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) regulates only knowing possession of child pornography that has been \u201cmailed, or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer\u201d or production of child pornography using materials that have been \u201cmailed, or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer.\u201d These jurisdictional elements limit the application of \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) to cases where there is a sufficient nexus to interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">For these reasons, \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) is not an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Finally, Wyatt argues that the district erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence because there was no probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant. Our review of the record indicates that there was sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for the issuance of the warrant. Therefore, we find that the district court did not err in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Wyatt\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
