Following his appeal and postconviction proceeding, he sought to raise a claim under <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995). In 2002, this court remanded a habeas corpus petition, filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000), which the district court had dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. We held that, under <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328 (4th Cir.2000), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>district court had jurisdiction to review Mohler\u2019s <em>Bailey </em>claim. <em>Mohler v. Gunja, </em>No. 01-7606, 2002 WL 312879, 30 Fed.Appx. 136 (4th Cir. Feb. 28, 2002) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">On remand, the district court concluded that the instruction given at Mohler\u2019s trial, to which no objection was made, was not in compliance with the Supreme Court\u2019s later holding in <em>Bailey. </em>The court ruled, however, that the evidence at trial was sufficient to support the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000) convictions. We agree with the district court that Mohler did not sustain his burden of proving, under the plain error standard of <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>152 F.3d 294, 300 (4th Cir.1998) (applying plain error standard in <em>Bailey </em>context). In view of the evidence of Mohler\u2019s display and discussion of the weapons, he cannot \u201cshow that the jury actually convicted him based upon an erroneous understanding of the term 'use.'\u201d <em>United States v. Hastings, </em>134 F.3d 235, 243 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision on the <em>Bailey </em>issue. Other issues Mohler attempts to raise were not properly before the district court, and we decline to rule on them. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
