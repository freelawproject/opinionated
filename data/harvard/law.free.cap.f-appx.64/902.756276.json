An appeal may not be taken to this court from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims dismissed by a district court solely on procedural grounds unless the movant can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition [or motion] states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, 252 </em>F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-23\">In dismissing Smith\u2019s motion, the district court properly relied on this court\u2019s ruling in <em>United States v. Torres, </em>211 F.3d 836, 837 (4th Cir.2000). <em>Torres, </em>however, was subsequently overruled by <em>Clay v. United States, </em>537 U.S. 522, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003). Pursuant to <em>Clay, </em>it is now clear that Smith\u2019s convictions were not final until the ninety-day period for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari had expired. <em>See Clay, </em>123 S.Ct. at 1079. Because Smith\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was filed within one year of the date his convictions became final, the motion was timely filed. Thus, Smith has shown that the district court\u2019s procedural ruling was debatable or wrong.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Rose, 252 </em>F.3d at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-24\">Although Smith satisfied the second prong of the <em>Rose </em>test, he has failed to establish the first prong. Smith\u2019s original \u00a7 2255 motion raises a substantive claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), as well as a related claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. This court has previously held that <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review where, as here, the Defendant did not raise an Apprendi-type claim at trial or on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 151 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1032, 122 S.Ct. 573, 151 L.Ed.2d 445 (2001). Further, counsel was not ineffective for failing to anticipate the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>decision. Accordingly, Smith\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion fails to state a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Rose, </em>252 F.3d at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b936-21\"> We note that the district court did not have the benefit of <em>Clay </em>when it issued its decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
