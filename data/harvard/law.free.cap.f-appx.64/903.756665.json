The district court committed him to official detention for thirty-six months imprisonment, in accordance with 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5037 (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2003). Juvenile Male appeals, and his counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel asserts that in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. However, he raises the issues of whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting the guilty plea, and whether the disposition was in violation of the law or an incorrect application of the Sentencing Guidelines. Juvenile Male, informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-23\">After reviewing the transcript of the plea proceeding, we conclude that the district court fully complied with the requirements of Rule 11 in accepting the guilty plea. As to sentencing, the Sentencing Guidelines are not necessarily applicable in juvenile delinquency proceedings. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 1B1.12 (2001). The district court carefully followed the statutory directives in arriving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>at a disposition in this case. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5037. Therefore, we find counsel\u2019s claims to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">We affirm the district court\u2019s finding of juvenile delinquency and the resulting disposition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
