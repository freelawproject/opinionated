Further, plaintiff has not disputed defendants\u2019 assertions that there was an historical practice of retaining, examining, and later disposing of an examined brain when MCL 52.205 was enacted in 1953 and that medical examiners promulgated rules to permit this practice under MCL 52.201c.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, no Michigan caselaw gives next of kin a possessory right to a decedent\u2019s brain following a lawful forensic examination.</p>\n<judges id=\"b180-7\">Kelly, C.J., and Cavanagh, Corrigan, Markman, and HATHAWAY, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b179-8\">1 See <em>Waeschle v Dragovic, </em>576 F3d 539, 551 (CA 6, 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\"> <em>In re Certified Question (Waeschle v Oakland Co Med Examiner), </em>485 Mich 1116 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b179-10\"> MCL 52.205 was originally enacted in 1953 by Public Act 181. A relative\u2019s statutory \u201cright and power to make decisions about funeral arrangements and the handling, disposition, or disinterment of a decedent\u2019s body\u201d under Michigan\u2019s Estates and Protected Individuals Code is expressly \u201c[slubject to 1953 PA 181, MCL 52.201 to 52.216 ....\u201d MCL 700.3206(1). In response to this case, the Legislature amended MCL 52.205, effective July 1, 2010. 2010 PA 108. MCL 52.205(6) now specifically addresses medical examiners\u2019 duties to next of kin under the circumstances presented here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\"> Plaintiff here did not request return of the brain. We express no opinion concerning whether, before the 2010 amendment of MCL 52.205, a medical examiner would have had a duty to return a brain in response to a relative\u2019s timely request if the medical examiner had not destroyed the brain and had no further need to examine it. MCL 52.205(6) now expressly delineates a medical examiner\u2019s duties under such circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b180-10\"> MCL 52.201c was enacted by 1969 PA 92, effective July 24, 1969.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b180-8\">YOUNG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3C\">(dissenting). I continue to adhere to my stated position in <em>In re Certified Question (Wayne Co v Philip Morris Inc), </em>622 NW2d 518 (Mich, 2001), that this Court lacks the authority under state law to answer certified questions. However, my position has failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>carry the day. See proposed amendment of MCR 7.305, 462 Mich 1208 (2000). While this Court has chosen to assert the right to exercise that authority, I will exercise careful discretion before answering any certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In light of the recent amendment of the relevant statute by 2010 PA 108, this case now only concerns a putative class of persons whose arguable claims arose before the effective date of the amendment. Accordingly, the legal significance of the question certified by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan is considerably diminished. I would decline to answer the question in this instance.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b181-6\">DAVIS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Az\">(dissenting). I would decline to answer the certified question because I am not persuaded that the Court should answer this certified question.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
