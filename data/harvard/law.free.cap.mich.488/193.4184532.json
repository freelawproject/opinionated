In <em>People v McGraw, </em>this Court held that \u201c[o]ffense variables must be scored giving consideration to the sentencing offense alone, unless otherwise provided in the particular variable.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, we hold that because the circumstances described in OV 19 expressly include events occurring after the completion of the sentencing offense, scoring OV 19 necessarily is not limited to consideration of the sentencing offense. Thus, under the exception to the general rule set forth in <em>McGraw, </em>the offense variable may be scored for conduct that occurred after the sentencing offense was completed. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in part and reinstate defendant\u2019s sentence for manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">PACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">This case stems from an automobile collision in Jackson County in June 2007. Defendant was driving his 1993 Cadillac with three passengers, including Nicole Wolfe, who sat in the front passenger seat. Wolfe testified that defendant drove recklessly and at a high rate of speed when he pulled into a lane of oncoming traffic as a green truck approached. When Wolfe screamed in fear, defendant indicated that the truck would pull off the road. Thomas Lantz, the driver of the green truck, observed defendant driving toward his truck at a high rate of speed. Lantz testified that he pulled over as far as he could, but was unable to move <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>completely off of the road because road construction precluded it. At the last moment, defendant swerved back into the proper lane, avoiding the collision with the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">After the near collision with Lantz\u2019s truck, defendant accelerated through the construction zone and crested a hill. A short distance away, the victim, Diane Sigers, sat in her compact automobile, attempting to make a left turn from a cross street. Wolfe testified that she could see the side of the victim\u2019s car and her head as defendant\u2019s car approached. Wolfe again screamed, telling defendant that the victim\u2019s car would not clear the road in time. Defendant assured her that the car would get out of his way, and further increased his speed. Wolfe remembered that defendant applied the brakes just before impact, but was too late to avoid colliding with Sigers at a high rate of speed. The forensic pathologist testified that the victim died within a few seconds after the collision because of the massive injuries she sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Wolfe spent two days in the hospital, having suffered six fractured ribs, a ruptured spleen, and a bruised heart in the collision. After she was discharged from the hospital, defendant began contacting her via telephone. Defendant told Wolfe that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t talk to anybody\u201d because \u201cthere was no proof of anything\u201d and that defendant \u201cwas innocent\u201d as long as Wolfe remained quiet. Defendant told Wolfe that if he could not \u201ctake care of the problem,\u201d then he would \u201chave somebody else do it for\u201d him. As a result of such statements, Wolfe was initially reluctant to speak with the police. Eventually, Wolfe did speak with the police, relaying what she recalled from before the collision, as well as defendant\u2019s statements to Wolfe after she was released from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>A jury convicted defendant of manslaughter,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> reckless driving,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and witness intimidation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At sentencing, defense counsel made two objections to the scoring of the sentencing guidelines, including arguing that defendant\u2019s witness intimidation conviction precluded the scoring of OV 19 for the manslaughter conviction. The trial court rejected the argument, ruling that defendant\u2019s attempt to interfere with the administration of justice was a \u201cseparately cognizable consideration[] within the sentencing guidelines .. ..\u201d The recommended minimum sentence range for defendant\u2019s manslaughter conviction was 50 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment. Defendant was sentenced within the sentencing guidelines as a second-offense habitual offender<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to 10 to 22 years for manslaughter, along with a concurrent sentence of 5 to 15 years for witness intimidation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In his appeal of right, defendant argued that scoring OV 19 in addition to his conviction for witness intimidation amounted to \u201cdoubly penalizing\u201d defendant. In an unpublished opinion per curiam,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions but remanded for resentencing, relying on this Court\u2019s recently decided opinion in <em>McGrow. </em>After noting the rule of <em>McGrow </em>that offense variables may not be scored for conduct that occurred after the completion of the sentencing offense unless provided for in the particular variable, the Court of Appeals ruled that OV 19 \u201cdoes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>not expressly or specifically provide\u201d for the consideration of conduct that occurred after the completion of the sentencing offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because defendant\u2019s threatening statements to Wolfe were committed after the manslaughter was completed, the Court of Appeals held that defendant should have received zero points for OV 19. The Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions but remanded for resentencing on the manslaughter conviction because defendant\u2019s minimum sentence fell outside the corrected guidelines range of 43 to 107 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Both defendant and the prosecution sought leave to appeal in this Court. We denied defendant\u2019s application<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and granted the prosecution leave to appeal, \u201climited to the issue whether points may be assessed pursuant to MCL 777.49 (OV 19) for conduct that occurs after the sentencing offense is completed.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The interpretation and application of the legislative sentencing guidelines, MCL 777.1 <em>et seq., </em>involve legal questions that are reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The statutory provision for OV 19 can be found at MCL 777.49, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">Offense variable 19 is threat to the security of a penal institution or court or interference with the administration of justice or the rendering of emergency services. Score <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>offense variable 19 by determining which of the following apply and by assigning the number of points attributable to the one that has the highest number of points:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">(a) The offender by his or her conduct threatened the security of a penal institution or court...............25 points</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">(b) The offender used force or the threat of force against another person or the property of another person to interfere with, attempt to interfere with, or that results in the interference with the administration of justice or the rendering of emergency services..........................15 points</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">(c) The offender otherwise interfered with or attempted to interfere with the administration of justice ... 10 points</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">(d) The offender did not threaten the security of a penal institution or court or interfere with or attempt to interfere with the administration of justice or the rendering of emergency services by force or threat of force .... 0 points</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">In <em>McGraw, </em>this Court held that \u201c[o]ffense variables must be scored giving consideration to the sentencing offense alone, unless otherwise provided in the particular variable.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, we must consider whether OV 19 provides for the \u201cconsideration of conduct after completion of the sentencing offense.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">As an initial matter, we note that the sentencing guidelines categorize all felonies into one of six distinct offense categories: crimes against a person, crimes against property, crimes involving a controlled substance, crimes against public order, crimes against public trust, and crimes against public safety.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> These six offense categories encompass a broad variety of crimes, ranging from kidnapping<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to removing a shrub <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>within a highway right of way without a permit in order to make a sign more visible.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Legislature has also directed, <em>without exception, </em>that OV 19 be scored for each and every one of these offense categories.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The aggravating factors considered in OV 19 contemplate events that almost always occur <em>after </em>the charged offense has been completed. For example, pursuant to MCL 777.49(a), 25 points are assessed under OV 19 for conduct that threatens \u201cthe security of a penal institution or court. ...\u201d It is axiomatic that every defendant charged with a felony must, at a minimum, enter a court in order to have his criminal charges resolved.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> And while not every criminal defendant is required to confront a penal institution in consequence of his felonious activity, by the time a defendant encounters <em>either </em>a courthouse or a penal institution, the sentencing offense has <em>long </em>been completed. The express consideration of these events explicitly indicates that post-offense conduct may be considered when scoring OV 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The Criminal Defense Attorneys of Michigan argues as amicus curiae that a defendant may be properly assessed 25 points under OV 19, but only if the underlying sentencing offense <em>itself </em>threatened the security of a courthouse or penal institution, such as when the sentencing offense was committed while the defendant was in prison. However, nothing in the language of MCL 777.49(a) is limited to those instances in which the sentencing offense itself occurred within a court or penal institution. Moreover, as noted earlier, the Legislature has specifically commanded that OV 19 be scored for <em>every </em>category of felony. If the scoring of OV 19 were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>limited to felonies that threatened the security of a court or penal institution, it would be unclear how the full force of OV 19 could ever be applied to crimes that do not, in and of themselves, threaten the security of a court or penal institution, such as operating a locomotive under the influence of alcohol and causing death,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> arson of woods and prairies,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> or entering a horse in a race under a false name.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Additionally, OV 19 requires the assessment of 15 points if a defendant used force or the threat of force against another person or another person\u2019s property to interfere with \u201cthe administration of justice or the rendering of emergency services . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Ten points are assessed under OV 19 if the defendant interfered with the administration of justice, but did so without the use of force or a threat of force.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In <em>People v Barbee</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court addressed the meaning of interference with the administration of justice within OV 19. In <em>Barbee, </em>the defendant gave a police officer a false name during a traffic stop. The defendant pleaded guilty of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, third offense.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Because the defendant gave the police a false name, the trial court assessed 10 points for OV 19. This Court upheld the scoring, rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that OV 19 could <em>only </em>be scored when the defendant\u2019s conduct interfered with the judicial process. Rather, we concluded that interference with the administration of justice \u201cencompasse[d] more than just the actual judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>cial process\u201d and that the scoring of OV 19 was proper because the police \u201care an integral component in the administration of justice, regardless of whether they are operating directly pursuant to a court order.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The \u201cadministration of justice\u201d process, including the \u201cactual judicial process,\u201d is not commenced until an underlying crime has occurred, which invokes the process. Because OV 19 specifically provides for the \u201cconsideration of conduct after completion of the sentencing offense,\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> conduct that occurred after an offense was completed may be considered when scoring the offense variable.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Because the circumstances described in OV 19 expressly include events occurring after a felony has been completed, the offense variable provides for the \u201cconsideration of conduct after completion of the sentencing offense.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Under the exception to the general rule set forth by this Court in <em>McGrow, </em>OV 19 may be scored for conduct that occurred after the sentencing offense was completed.

I respectfully dissent because I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that a sentencing court may employ a transactional approach to scoring offense variable (OV) 19, MCL 777.49, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>sentencing guidelines. Rather, I think that the general rule that \u201cthe appropriate offense variables are generally to be scored on the basis of the sentencing offense\u201d applies to OV 19. <em>People v </em>McGrow, 484 Mich 120, 124; 771 NW2d 655 (2009) (quotation marks omitted). Accordingly; I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">As the majority correctly recites, in <em>McGrow </em>this Court held that \u201c[o]ffense variables must be scored giving consideration to the sentencing offense alone, unless otherwise provided in the particular variable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133. The majority also correctly notes that we recognized a limited exception to this general rule. Specifically, we held that offense variables may be scored on the basis of conduct not related to the sentencing offense when an offense variable <em>\u201cspecifically </em>provide[s] otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125,129,135 (emphasis added; quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In <em>McGrow, </em>this Court considered a list of OVs that permit a transactional scoring approach. <em>Id. </em>at 125-126, quoting <em>People v Sargent, </em>481 Mich 346, 349-350; 750 NW2d 161 (2008). For example, MCL 777.44(2)(a) states that \u201c[t]he entire criminal transaction should be considered\u201d when scoring OV 14, MCL 777.42(2)(a) provides that OV 12 applies to acts that occurred within 24 hours of the sentencing offense and have not resulted and will not result in separate convictions, MCL 777.43(2)(a) allows scoring of OV 13 using \u201call crimes within a 5-year period,\u201d MCL 777.46(2)(a) permits a court to add the \u201caggregate value of the property involved\u201d when scoring OV 16, and MCL 777.38(l)(a) focuses on conduct \u201cbeyond the time necessary to commit the offense\u201d when scoring OV 8. These examples illuminate the clarity with which the Legislature made its intent known in the sentencing guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>lines. As this Court stated in <em>McGraw, </em>conduct not related to the sentencing offense may only be considered when the Legislature has <em>explicitly </em>stated that such conduct may be considered. <em>McGraw, </em>484 Mich at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Call me a strict constructionist if you must, but contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, nothing in OV 19 \u201cspecifically\u201d or \u201cexplicitly\u201d permits a transactional approach to scoring that OV The Legislature has established that it is capable of clearly and specifically expressing its intent regarding when a sentencing court may consider transactional conduct, and it would have done so in drafting OV 19 if that was truly its intent. The lack of specificity regarding the application of a transactional approach to OV 19, combined with the fact that the conduct described in OV 19 could occur during the commission of a charged offense, indicates a legislative intent to only score OV 19 on the basis of offense-specific conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The majority\u2019s reliance on MCL 777.22 to support its conclusion is equally unpersuasive. Although the majority is correct that, under MCL 777.22, OV 19 is generally applicable to all six offense categories, this does not discount the fact that a court may only score OV 19 when it is appropriate for the facts of a particular case. The Legislature provided a detailed and unambiguous explanation of when such scoring is appropriate, and a sentencing court is not permitted to ignore the statutory language of a specific OV statute and rely solely on the fact that a sentencing court is generally permitted to score a particular OV for a particular offense category under MCL 777.22. As summarized earlier, the Legislature has demonstrated that it is capable of expressly stating when a sentencing court may apply a transactional approach to scoring OVs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Because the Legislature did not do so in MCL 777.49,1 believe the general rule of applying an offense-specific approach to scoring OVs applies to OV 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Moreover, the majority erroneously extends <em>People v Barbee, </em>470 Mich 283; 681 NW2d 348 (2004), beyond its holding to support its reasoning. <em>Barbee </em>did not directly consider whether OV 19 should be scored using conduct committed after the sentencing offense is complete. Rather, <em>Barbee </em>only addressed the meaning of the phrase \u201cinterference with the administration of justice\u201d as it is used in OV 19.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although I remain committed to the holding in <em>Barbee </em>that the phrase \u201c \u2018administration of justice\u2019 \u201d \u201cencompasses more than just the actual judicial process,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 287-288, I disagree with the majority that the administration of justice \u201cis not commenced until an underlying crime has occurred,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 202, to the extent that the majority means that a crime must be <em>complete </em>before the \u201cadministration of justice\u201d can begin. Rather, I think that the \u201cadministration of justice\u201d may begin simultaneously with the commission of a crime in some circumstances. For example, if the police arrive on the scene of an ongoing crime and the defendant begins shooting at the officers or otherwise prevents the officers from \u201cadministering justice\u201d while still in the process of committing the underlying crime, the defendant is simultaneously committing the sentencing offense and interfering with the administration of justice. Similarly, a defendant interferes with the administration of justice anytime he or she threatens a witness, even if the defendant makes the threat before law enforcement is actively \u201cadminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>tering justice\u201d because the defendant\u2019s act of threatening the witness has the potential to impede the administration of justice. Under this approach, a defendant who threatens a witness while committing a crime could have points assessed under OV 19 because the defendant interfered with the administration of justice while committing the sentencing offense. Thus, applying the offense-specific approach to scoring OV 19 would not result in as narrow an application as the majority implies because the conduct considered by OV 19 does not necessarily include conduct occurring after an offense has been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Finally, applying an offense-specific approach to OV 19 would not leave defendant\u2019s crime of witness intimidation unpunished. As discussed in McGrow, a sentencing court may consider transactional conduct \u201cwhen deciding what sentence to impose within the appropriate guidelines range and whether to depart from the guidelines recommendation.\u201d <em>McGrow, </em>484 Mich at 129. Moreover, \u201cthe prosecution is always free to charge a defendant with multiple offenses if they exist, rather than a single offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130. Indeed, it is clear that the trial court and the prosecution made use of these valid alternatives in this case. First, while explaining its decision to sentence defendant at the top of the guidelines minimum sentence range for his manslaughter conviction, the trial court seemed to take defendant\u2019s crime of witness intimidation into consideration. The trial court noted that defendant had failed to take responsibility for his conduct and had threatened a witness in an attempt to avoid responsibility. Second, defendant was convicted of and sentenced for witness intimidation on the basis of the conduct that was the foundation for the trial court\u2019s decision to assess 15 points under OV 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Although defendant\u2019s conduct was deplorable, I believe the majority\u2019s holding erroneously permits a sentencing court to consider transactional conduct when scoring OV 19, contrary to the general rule explained in <em>McGraw. </em>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b383-5\">KELLY, C.J., concurred with CAVANAGH, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-5\"> Furthermore, <em>Barbee </em>is distinguishable from this case on its facts because the defendant in <em>Barbee </em>gave a false name <em>during </em>the traffic stop associated with the sentencing offense whereas here defendant did not threaten the witness until <em>days </em>after the criminal conduct that was the focus of the sentencing offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
