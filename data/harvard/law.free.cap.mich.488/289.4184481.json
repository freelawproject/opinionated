Specifically, we granted leave to appeal to address whether a \u201cconveyance\u201d as that term is used in MCL 211.27a(3) must be by means of a written instrument and whether, under MCL 211.27a(7)(h), petitioner\u2019s property was uncapped for purposes of property-tax reassessment by either the death of the other joint tenant in January 2005 or the creation of a subsequent joint tenancy in September 2005. <em>Klooster v City of Charlevoix, </em>486 Mich 932 (2010). We hold first that a \u201cconveyance\u201d for purposes of MCL 211.27a does not require a written instrument. Second, we hold that while the January 2005 termination of the joint tenancy caused by the death of a cotenant was within the joint-tenancy exception created by MCL 211.27a(7)(h) and was thus not a transfer of ownership that uncapped the property, the September 2005 conveyance from petitioner to himself and his brother as joint tenants did uncap the property, because the conveyance did not fall within the joint-tenancy exception. Therefore, we reverse the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>of the Court of Appeals and hold that respondent, the city of Charlevoix, properly issued its 2006 notice of reassessment and that the Tax Tribunal reached the correct result, albeit for the wrong reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The facts are undisputed. In 1959, James and Dona Klooster acquired title to the subject property in the city of Charlevoix and held it as tenants by the entirety. On August 11, 2004, Dona quitclaimed her interest in the property to James, leaving James as the sole owner. On that same day, James quitclaimed the property to himself and his son, petitioner Nathan Klooster, as joint tenants with rights of survivorship. On January 11, 2005, James died, leaving petitioner as the sole property owner by operation of law. On September 10, 2005, petitioner quitclaimed the property to himself and his brother, Charles Klooster, as joint tenants with rights of survivorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">In 2006, the assessor for the city of Charlevoix issued to petitioner and Charles Klooster a notice of assessment, taxable valuation, and property classification, indicating that, because of a transfer of ownership, the property\u2019s taxable value had been reassessed using the true cash value of the property. The notice did not state whether the termination of the joint tenancy caused by the death of petitioner\u2019s father in January 2005 or the September 2005 creation of the joint tenancy between petitioner and his brother constituted the transfer of ownership. As a result of the reassessment, the taxable value of petitioner\u2019s property increased from $37,802 to $72,300.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Petitioner appealed unsuccessfully to the city\u2019s board of review. Petitioner then appealed to the Tax Tribunal. The Tax Tribunal affirmed the reassessment, ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>that the transfer of ownership to petitioner by virtue of his father\u2019s death was a conveyance for purposes of the GPTA. Additionally, the Tax Tribunal ruled that the joint-tenancy exception from MCL 211.27a(7)(h) did not apply to the January 2005 transfer because petitioner was not an original owner or an already existing joint tenant before the August 2004 joint tenancy was created. The Tax Tribunal did not rule on the September 2005 conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Petitioner appealed as of right in the Court of Appeals, claiming that the transfer of ownership caused by his father\u2019s death was not a conveyance and that even if it had been, petitioner would have qualified for the MCL 211.27a(7)(h) exception from uncapping. The Court of Appeals reversed the tribunal, determining that a \u201cconveyance\u201d requires a transfer of title by a written instrument, and thus James\u2019s death and the resulting transfer of fee title to petitioner by operation of law did not constitute a transfer of ownership under the GPTA that would uncap the property. <em>Klooster v City of Charlevoix, </em>286 Mich App 435, 441-443; 781 NW2d 120 (2009). We granted respondent\u2019s application for leave to appeal. <em>Klooster, </em>486 Mich at 932-933.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND RULES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">\u201cIn the absence of fraud, review of a decision by the Tax Tribunal is limited to determining whether the tribunal erred in applying the law or adopted a wrong principle; its factual findings are conclusive if supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record.\u201d <em>Mich Bell Tel Co v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>445 Mich 470, 476; 518 NW2d 808 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Issues of statutory interpretation are questions of law that are reviewed de novo. <em>Brown v Detroit Mayor, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>478 Mich 589, 593; 734 NW2d 514 (2007). The primary goal of statutory interpretation is to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent, focusing first on the statute\u2019s plain language. <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 236; 596 NW2d 119 (1999). \u201cThe words of a statute provide \u2018the most reliable evidence of its intent....\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>United States v Turkette, </em>452 US 576, 593; 101 S Ct 2524; 69 L Ed 2d 246 (1981). When construing a statute, a court must read it as a whole. <em>People v Jackson, </em>487 Mich 783, 791; 790 NW2d 340 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">III. STATUTORY BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Resolving this case requires that we examine the January 2005 and September 2005 changes in the ownership of petitioner\u2019s property to determine whether respondent properly reassessed the property under the GPTA. We begin our analysis by briefly reviewing Proposal A and the GPTA before turning to the joint-tenancy exception and the specific conveyances at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">A. PROPOSAL A AND THE GPTA</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">In 1994, voters passed Proposal A, amending article 9, \u00a7 3 of the Michigan Constitution to limit the annual increase in property tax assessments and to authorize enabling legislation. The purpose of Proposal A was to limit tax increases on property as long as it remains owned by the same party, even though the actual market value of the property may have risen at a greater rate. <em>Toll Northville Ltd v Northville Twp, </em>480 Mich 6, 12; 743 NW2d 902 (2008). The Michigan Legislature was charged with determining the specifics needed to give effect to Proposal A\u2019s mandate. See Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 3 (providing for the reassessment of a parcel\u2019s value when ownership has been transferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>\u201cas defined by law\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). The 1995 amendments of the GPTA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> fixed the cap on assessment increases at the lesser amount of either 5 percent of the assessed value of the property for the previous year or the increase in the rate of inflation from the previous year. MCL 211.27a(2). After certain \u201ctransfers] of ownership\u201d occur, however, property becomes uncapped and thus subject to reassessment based on actual property value. MCL 211.27a(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The GPTA defines \u201ctransfer of ownership\u201d as a \u201cconveyance of title to or a present interest in property, including the beneficial use of the property, the value of which is substantially equal to the value of the fee interest.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> MCL 211.27a(6) provides a nonexhaustive list of examples of transfers of ownership, including conveyances by deed or by land contract and conveyances to or distributions from trusts. See MCL 211.27a(6)(a) through (j). From the definition of \u201ctransfer of ownership,\u201d however, MCL 211.27a(7) excludes 17 specific transfers and conveyances, including the one found in MCL 211.27a(7)(h), regarding the creation and termination of certain joint tenancies.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">B. THE JOINT-TENANCY EXCEPTION: MCL 211.27a(7)(h)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The joint-tenancy exception from the definition of \u201ctransfer of ownership\u201d provides that a transfer of ownership does not include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">[a] transfer creating or terminating a joint tenancy between 2 or more persons if at least 1 of the persons was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>original owner of the property before the joint tenancy was initially created and, if the property is held as a joint tenancy at the time of conveyance, at least 1 of the persons was a joint tenant when the joint tenancy was initially created and that person has remained a joint tenant since the joint tenancy was initially created. A joint owner at the time of the last transfer of ownership of the property is an original owner of the property. For purposes of this subdivision, a person is an original owner of property owned by that person\u2019s spouse. [MCL 211.27a(7)(h).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">While this is not the simplest provision to understand at first reading, a careful deconstruction reveals its plain meaning. We begin by noting that MCL 211.27a(7)(h) establishes the requirements for excluding three types of conveyances from the definition of \u201ctransfer of ownership\u201d: (A) the termination of a joint tenancy, (B) the creation of a joint tenancy where the property was not previously held in a joint tenancy, and (C) the creation of a successive joint tenancy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Before examining the two requirements of the joint-tenancy exception, we must first take particular care to properly construe the terms \u201ctransfer of ownership\u201d and \u201coriginal owner.\u201d Additionally, when applying the joint-tenancy exception it is essential to focus on the particular conveyance that qualifies as the \u201cconveyance at issue,\u201d especially if \u2014 as here \u2014 the parcel has been the subject of numerous conveyances, one or more of which may qualify as a transfer of ownership that uncaps the property. We discuss each of these terms in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">1. \u201cTRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">For purposes of applying the joint-tenancy exception, the terms \u201ctransfer of ownership\u201d and \u201cuncapping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>event\u201d are largely synonymous. The GPTA provides that \u201c[u]pon a <em>transfer of ownership </em>of property . . ., the property\u2019s taxable value for the calendar year following the year of the transfer is the property\u2019s state equalized valuation for the calendar year following the transfer.\u201d MCL 211.27a(3) (emphasis added). Therefore, a transfer of ownership allows reassessment of the property based on its state equalized value, lifting the cap on the rate of increase provided by MCL 211.27a(2). A transfer of ownership thus uncaps the property. Conversely, any transaction listed in MCL 211.27a(7) is not a transfer of ownership that uncaps the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">2. \u201cORIGINAL OWNER\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">To determine who is an \u201coriginal owner of the property\u201d within the narrow context of the joint-tenancy exception, one must first identify the most recent transfer of ownership that uncapped the property and then determine who owned the property as a result of that uncapping conveyance. The joint-tenancy exception provides that \u201c[a] joint owner at the time of the last transfer of ownership ... is an original owner\u201d and that \u201c[f]or purposes of this subdivision, a person is an original owner of property owned by that person\u2019s spouse.\u201d MCL 211.27a(7)(h). There are thus three possibilities for who may constitute an \u201coriginal owner\u201d under the joint-tenancy exception: (1) a sole owner at the time of the last uncapping event,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) a joint owner at the time of the last uncapping event,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and (3) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>spouse of either a sole or joint owner of the property at the time of the conveyance at issue (i.e., the conveyance that may uncap the property). See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">3. CONVEYANCE AT ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The \u201cconveyance at issue\u201d is either the creation or the termination of a joint tenancy that may or may not uncap the property for reassessment purposes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The conveyance at issue, therefore, is not the preceding uncapping event used to determine who is an original owner of the property. If the conveyance at issue is the creation of a joint tenancy, it is important to determine whether the property is being conveyed from a previous joint tenancy or some other type of ownership estate when applying MCL 211.27a(7)(h). If the conveyance at issue is the termination of a joint tenancy, however, whether the joint tenancy being terminated is a successive joint tenancy is irrelevant under the MCL 211.27a(7)(h) analysis. At the termination of a joint tenancy, the identity of ownership before the creation of the joint tenancy is only relevant under the original-ownership requirement to ensure that the continuity of original ownership remains uninterrupted.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The conveyances at issue here, therefore, are the January 2005 and September 2005 conveyances because these are the conveyances that may or may not have uncapped the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>4. THE ORIGINAL-OWNERSHIP AND CONTINUOUS-TENANCY REQUIREMENTS OF MCL 211.27a(7)(h)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The first sentence of MCL 211.27a(7)(h) establishes two requirements for satisfying the joint-tenancy exception, which we label to simplify analysis as the \u201coriginal-ownership requirement\u201d and the \u201ccontinuous-tenancy requirement.\u201d The original-ownership requirement excludes \u201ctransfer\u00eds] creating or terminating a joint tenancy between 2 or more persons if at least 1 of the persons was an original owner . . . before the joint tenancy was initially created\u201d from being considered a \u201ctransfer of ownership.\u201d MCL 211.27a(7)(h). This requirement examines ownership of the property both before and after the conveyance at issue to ensure that continuity of original ownership bridges the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The continuous-tenancy requirement provides that \u201cif the property is held as a joint tenancy at the time of conveyance, at least 1 of the persons was a joint tenant when the joint tenancy was initially created and that person has remained a joint tenant since the joint tenancy was initially created.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because of the conditional language \u201cif the property is held as a joint tenancy at the time of conveyance,\u201d this requirement applies only to conveyances terminating a joint tenancy and conveyances creating a successive joint tenancy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because it pertains to the continuous tenancy of at least one of the joint tenants from the time a particular joint tenancy was created until the time of its termination, the continuous-tenancy requirement is entirely retrospective.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>IV APPLYING THE JOINT-TENANCY EXCEPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\">All parties agree that the August 2004 conveyance from the father, James Klooster, to himself and petitioner as joint tenants with rights of survivorship was not an uncapping event because MCL 211.27a(7)(h) excludes such conveyances from the definition of \u201ctransfer of ownership.\u201d Because James did not hold the property in a joint tenancy before creating the joint tenancy with petitioner, the continuous-tenancy requirement of MCL 211.27a(7)(h) was inapplicable. Under the original-ownership requirement of MCL 211.27a(7)(h), James Klooster \u201cwas an original owner of the property before the [August 2004] joint tenancy was initially created.\u201d James acquired the status of an original owner as a result of the 1959 conveyance to James and Dona because the 1959 conveyance was the most recent \u201ctransfer of ownership\u201d that uncapped the property.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Put simply, under the joint-tenancy exception, an original owner may convey property into a joint tenancy without uncapping the property, provided the original owner is also a cotenant in the resulting joint tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">We turn now to conveyances under the GPTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">A. TERMINATIONS OF JOINT TENANCIES</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">When petitioner\u2019s father died in January 2005, the joint tenancy terminated by operation of law, vesting petitioner with sole ownership. We first examine whether the change in the nature of the ownership of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the property occasioned by the death of the only other joint tenant is even a conveyance, as that term is used in the GPTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">1. CONVEYANCES UNDER THE GPTA</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The Court of Appeals held that the vesting of sole ownership was not a conveyance because there was no written instrument. <em>Klooster, </em>286 Mich App at 442. This was error. As we will explain, the termination of a joint tenancy occasioned by the death of the only other joint tenant is a conveyance under the GPTA and does not require a written instrument beyond that which initially created the joint tenancy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">When one of only two joint tenants dies, an estate in land passes by operation of law to the survivor. This Court has described a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship as a joint life estate with a dual contingent remainder that vests the fee simple in whichever cotenant outlives the others. <em>Albro v Allen, </em>434 Mich 271, 274-275; 454 NW2d 85 (1990). A contingent remainder is \u201c[a] remainder that is either given to an unascertained person or made subject to a condition precedent.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed), p 1405. The contingent remainder is thus created simultaneously with the creation of the joint tenancy with rights of survivorship and \u201c \u2018waits patiently\u2019 for possession.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting Bergin &amp; Haskell, Preface to Estates in Land and Future Interests (2d ed), p 73. In the case of a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, the contingency is surviving the cotenants, and at the moment of death, the decedent\u2019s interest in the property passes to the survivor or survivors. <em>Albro, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>434 Mich at 274-275. When there is only one remaining joint tenant, the contingent remainder vests in the survivor a fee simple in the property. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The interest that passes to the last survivor in a joint tenancy is likewise a conveyance under the GPTA. The GPTA defines \u201ctransfer of ownership\u201d as a <em>\u201cconveyance </em>of title to or a present interest in property, including the beneficial use of the property, the value of which is substantially equal to the value of the fee interest.\u201d MCL 211.27a(6) (emphasis added). While the statute uses the word \u201cconveyance,\u201d it does not define it, and we may therefore consult a dictionary. <em>Oakland Co Bd of Co Rd Comm\u2019rs v Mich Prop &amp; Cas Guaranty Ass\u2019n, </em>456 Mich 590, 604; 575 NW2d 751 (1998). The relevant dictionary definitions of \u201cconveyance\u201d include (1) \u201c[a] voluntary transfer of a right or of property\u201d and (2) \u201c[t]he transfer of a property right that does not pass by delivery of a thing or merely by agreement.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th ed).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under the first definition, in the case of a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, the \u201cvoluntary transfer of a right or of property\u201d occurs when the joint tenancy is voluntarily created, transferring to the cotenants a joint life estate that gives the immediate right to possess and use the property as well as the last survivor\u2019s right to be vested with a fee simple. See <em>Albro, </em>434 Mich at 274-275. The conveyance occasioned by the death of the only other cotenant fits the second definition as well, because the vesting of a fee simple at the moment of death in the last surviving cotenant is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u201ctransfer of a property right that does not pass by delivery of a thing . . . Therefore, the interest that passes to the last survivor in a joint tenancy is a conveyance under the GPTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">In holding that there was no conveyance absent a writing, the Court of Appeals erred by relying on the act-specific definitions of a \u201cconveyance\u201d in MCL 565.35<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and in <em>McMurtry v Smith, </em>320 Mich 304, 307; 30 NW2d 880 (1948). <em>Klooster, </em>286 Mich App at 441-442. First, the definition of \u201cconveyance\u201d in MCL 565.35 is limited by the language \u201cas used in this chapter,\u201d and MCL 211.27a is not in chapter 565 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Second, <em>McMurtry </em>involved the recording of a supplement to a plat, and it was thus appropriate for the <em>McMurtry </em>Court to rely on the definition of \u201cconveyance\u201d in the statutory predecessor of MCL 565.35 because from its inception and regardless of where in the statutes it has been compiled, the chapter at issue has embraced the recording statutes, and the recording of interests in real property necessarily includes the use of some written instrument.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Neither of these definitions of \u201cconveyance,\u201d however, mandates the conclusion that there can be no conveyance without a writing under the GPTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Other examples of transfers of ownership in MCL 211.27a illustrate that the definition of \u201cconveyance\u201d in MCL 565.35 is inconsistent with the meaning of \u201cconveyance\u201d in the GPTA. Conveyances to a trust, distributions from a trust, and conveyances by intestate succession do not require any written instrument at the time of the transfer, yet all are transfers of ownership that will uncap property. See MCL 211.27a(6)(c), (d) and (f). Therefore, the plain text of MCL 211.27a indicates that the Legislature did not intend that conveyances must be effected by means of a written instrument for purposes of the GPTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In sum, therefore, we conclude that the vesting of a fee simple in the last surviving cotenant of a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship is a \u201cconveyance\u201d for purposes of the GPTA and requires no additional writing beyond that which created the joint tenancy. Whether this conveyance is a transfer of ownership that uncaps the property is a separate issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">2. THE JANUARY 2005 CONVEYANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The GPTA defines \u201ctransfer of ownership\u201d as a \u201cconveyance of title to or a present interest in properly, including the beneficial use of the property, the value of which is substantially equal to the value of the fee interest.\u201d MCL 211.27a(6). Unless an applicable exception exists, the interest that vests in the last survivor in a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship <em>would </em>constitute a transfer of ownership because the fee simple that vests in the survivor is a \u201cconveyance of title..., the value of which is substantially equal to the value of the fee interest.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">With regard to <em>terminations </em>of joint tenancies, MCL 211.27a(7) provides that a transfer of ownership does not include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>[a] transfer... terminating a joint tenancy between 2 or more persons if at least 1 of the persons was an original owner of the property before the joint tenancy was initially created and, if the property is held as a joint tenancy at the time of conveyance, at least 1 of the persons was a joint tenant when the joint tenancy was initially created and that person has remained a joint tenant since the joint tenancy was initially created.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In this context, the conveyance at issue is the termination of the joint tenancy because that is the event that may or may not uncap the property. In order for the termination of a joint tenancy to be exempted from uncapping, the original-ownership requirement mandates that at least one of the joint tenants in the joint tenancy being terminated was an original owner of the property before the joint tenancy was initially created. And, under the continuous-tenancy requirement, at least one of the persons in the joint tenancy being terminated must have been \u201ca joint tenant <em>when </em>the joint tenancy was initially created,\u201d and that person must have \u201cremained a joint tenant since the joint tenancy was initially created.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Here lies the critical point of contention in this case. Petitioner argues that \u201cwhen\u201d refers to that point in time at which the joint tenancy was created \u2014 not before \u2014 and that because petitioner was a joint tenant <em>as a result of </em>the creation of the joint tenancy at that point in time, he satisfies the requirement. ^Respondent argues that this use of \u201cwhen\u201d means that at least one of the persons in the joint tenancy must have also been a joint tenant in an immediately preceding joint tenancy. Because the father held the property in sole ownership, respondent argues, neither petitioner nor his father were joint tenants \u201cwhen the joint tenancy was initially created.\u201d Essentially, respondent argues that the joint-tenancy exception applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>only to successive joint tenancies.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Respondent thus reads \u201cwhen\u201d to mean \u201cbefore.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The adverb \u201cwhen\u201d refers to a distinct point in or period of time. See <em>The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition </em>(1982) (defining \u201cwhen\u201d as \u201c[a]t the time that\u201d and \u201cduring the time at which\u201d). \u201cWhen\u201d is not complete in itself, however, and requires some contextual referent to the event or period of time to which it applies. As \u201cwhen\u201d is used in the joint-tenancy exception, it is not durational; it refers to the moment in time \u201cwhen the joint tenancy was initially created . . . .\u201d MCL 211.27a(7)(h). At that moment, each cotenant acquired the status of a joint tenant by virtue of the instrument creating the joint tenancy. Had the Legislature meant to say \u201cbefore,\u201d it would have done so, as it did earlier in the joint-tenancy exception (i.e., \u201cif at least 1 of the persons was an original owner of the property <em>before </em>the joint tenancy was initially created\u201d). <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">We hold, therefore, that as applied to terminations of joint tenancies, the plain text of MCL 211.27a(7)(h) does not apply only to successive joint tenancies. For purposes of applying the continuous-tenancy requirement of the joint-tenancy exception, a person who becomes a joint tenant as a result of a conveyance is \u201ca joint tenant when the joint tenancy was initially created.\u201d We can now apply the joint-tenancy exception to the January 2005 conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The vesting of the fee simple in petitioner that occurred as a result of the death of James Klooster met the original-ownership requirement of MCL 211.27a(7)(h) because James Klooster was a cotenant and \u201cwas an original owner of the property before the joint tenancy was initially created.\u201d Because the property was held as a joint tenancy at the time of the conveyance, we must also apply the continuous-tenancy requirement that \u201cat least 1 of the persons was a joint tenant when the joint tenancy was initially created and that person has remained a joint tenant since the joint tenancy was initially created.\u201d As explained, because petitioner was a joint tenant \u201cwhen\u201d James initially created the joint tenancy in August 2004 and \u201cremained a joint tenant since the joint tenancy was initially created\u201d \u2014 until the joint tenancy terminated\u2014 the January 2005 conveyance was not a transfer of ownership under MCL 211.27a(7)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We therefore hold that the January 2005 conveyance did not uncap the property. As we will explain, however, the September 2005 conveyance was a transfer of ownership that did uncap the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">B. CREATION OF A NONSUCCESSIVE JOINT TENANCY</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">When petitioner conveyed the property to himself and his brother in September 2005, the property went from a state of sole ownership into a new joint tenancy. Before applying the joint-tenancy exemption to the September 2005 conveyance, however, we first address preservation of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">1. PRESERVATION</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Our order granting leave to appeal asked the parties to address preservation of the September 2005 conveyance as a possible uncapping event. See MCR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>7.302(H)(4)(a) (limiting appeals to issues raised in an application \u201c[u]nless otherwise ordered\u201d); MCR 7.316(A)(3) (allowing this Court to \u201cpermit the reasons or grounds of appeal to be amended or new grounds to be added\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">We note first that the fact of the September 2005 conveyance has always been part of the record on which this case was decided below and that the notice of reassessment in evidence was addressed to both petitioner and Charles Klooster. That the Tax Tribunal and the Court of Appeals chose to focus only on the January 2005 conveyance occasioned by the death of James Klooster does not remove these facts from evidence. In addition, the preservation requirement is not an inflexible rule; it yields to the necessity of considering additional issues when \u201c \u2018necessary to a proper determination of a case ....\u2019\u201d <em>Prudential Ins Co of America v Cusick, </em>369 Mich 269, 290; 120 NW2d 1 (1963), quoting <em>Dation v Ford Motor Co, </em>314 Mich 152, 160-161; 22 NW2d 252 (1946). Although this issue was not decided below, a party \u201cshould not be punished for the omission of the trial court.\u201d <em>Peterman v Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>446 Mich 177, 183; 521 NW2d 499 (1994). Lastly, an appellate court may uphold a lower tribunal\u2019s decision that reached the correct result, even if for an incorrect reason. <em>See Mulholland v DEC Int\u2019l Corp, </em>432 Mich 395, 411 n 10; 443 NW2d 340 (1989); <em>Peninsular Constr Co v Murray, </em>365 Mich 694, 699; 114 NW2d 202 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">We therefore find it appropriate to consider the September 2005 conveyance as a possible uncapping event because the facts are properly before us, the parties briefed and argued the issue in this Court, and doing so is necessary to a proper determination of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>2. THE SEPTEMBER 2005 CONVEYANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In September 2005, petitioner \u2014 who held the property in sole ownership as a result of the January 2005 vesting of the fee simple \u2014 conveyed the property to himself and his brother as joint tenants. In the context of the creation of a nonsuccessive joint tenancy, we need only consider the original-ownership requirement of MCL 211.27a(7)(h) because, as previously discussed, the continuous-tenancy requirement applies only if the property was held in a joint tenancy at the time of the conveyance. As applied to the creation of a nonsuccessive joint tenancy, the joint-tenancy exception provides that \u201c[tjransfer of ownership does not include ... [a] transfer creating ... a joint tenancy between 2 or more persons if at least 1 of the persons was an original owner of the property before the joint tenancy was initially created . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The September 2005 conveyance was not excluded from the definition of \u201ctransfer of ownership\u201d in MCL 211.27a(6) because, under the original-ownership requirement, petitioner was not an \u201coriginal owner of the property before the joint tenancy was initially created.\u201d MCL 211.27a(7)(h). As explained, the most recent event that would have been an uncapping event was the 1959 conveyance to petitioner\u2019s parents, James and Dona Klooster. <em>Only </em>James or Dona Klooster could qualify as an original owner until the time of the next uncapping event. Because the August 2004 and January 2005 conveyances were excluded by MCL 211.27a(7)(h) from the definition of \u201ctransfer of ownership,\u201d neither conveyance constituted an uncapping event and petitioner did not acquire the status of an original owner of the property. See MCL 211.27a(6). Because petitioner was not an original owner of the property before he initially created the joint tenancy with his brother, the Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>ber 2005 conveyance did not satisfy the joint-tenancy exception of MCL 211.27a(7)(h).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The September 2005 conveyance was therefore a transfer of ownership that uncapped the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Therefore, respondent properly issued the notice of assessment, taxable valuation, and property classification in 2006 because of a transfer of ownership in 2005, and the Tax Tribunal reached the correct result, albeit for the wrong reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">C. CREATION OF SUCCESSIVE JOINT TENANCIES</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Although not essential to resolving this case, we hope to provide some limited guidance by specifically addressing how MCL 211.27a(7)(h) <em>would </em>apply to the creation of a successive joint tenancy. If the property was held in joint tenancy before the conveyance <em>creating </em>a successive joint tenancy, the original-ownership requirement mandates that there must have been an \u201coriginal owner of the property\u201d before the joint tenancy was initially created who is also a joint tenant in the successive joint tenancy. The continuous-tenancy requirement pertains to the immediately preceding joint tenancy and requires that at least one of the persons in the previous joint tenancy must have been \u201ca joint tenant when the [previous] joint tenancy was initially created,\u201d and that same person must have \u201cremained a joint tenant since the [previous] joint tenancy was initially created.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and hold first that a \u201cconveyance\u201d for purposes of MCL 211.27a need not be by means of a written instrument. We hold also that while the January 2005 conveyance to petitioner of a fee simple was excluded by MCL 211.27a(7)(h) from the GPTA\u2019s definition of \u201ctransfer of ownership,\u201d the September 2005 conveyance from petitioner to himself and his brother in joint tenancy was not exempted from uncapping, and therefore respondent city of Charlevoix properly issued the notice of assessment, taxable valuation, and property classification in 2006. Therefore, we reinstate the decision of the Tax Tribunal because it reached the correct result, albeit for an incorrect reason.</p>\n<judges id=\"b489-6\">Young, C.J., and Marilyn Kelly, Markman, Hathaway, Mary Beth Kelly, and Zahra, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\"> MCL 211.1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-9\"> 1994 PA 415.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b473-10\"> MCL 211.27a(3) provides: \u201cUpon a <em>transfer of ownership </em>of property after 1994, the property\u2019s taxable value for the calendar year following the year of the transfer is the property\u2019s state equalized valuation for the calendar year following the transfer.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b473-11\"> MCL 211.27a(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b474-9\"> See corresponding parts IV(A) through (C) of this opinion for discussions of these three types of conveyances under MCL 211.27a(7)(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\"> While the statute does not specifically provide that a sole owner may be an original owner, this obvious result must follow, otherwise only a joint owner or the spouse of an owner could ever be considered an \u201coriginal owner\u201d for purposes of applying MCL 211.27a(7)(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\"> In the instant case, for example, the most recent uncapping event before the two 2005 conveyances at issue would have been in 1959, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>James and Dona Klooster acquired title to the property, had Proposal A been in effect.
