DEVER, III, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Ernst &amp; Young, LLP\u2019s (\u201cE &amp; Y\u201d or \u201cdefendant\u201d) filed a renewed motion to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), as applied through 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(3). For the reasons explained below, E &amp; Y\u2019s motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Plaintiffs filed this class action on February 12, 2004. Plaintiffs alleged various violations of the securities laws of the United States by aaiPharma, Inc. (\u201caaiP-harma\u201d), and several of its principals. <em>See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">On February 11, 2005, plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint (\u201camended complaint\u201d) naming Ernst &amp; Young, LLP as a defendant. All defendants save for E <em>&amp; </em>Y entered into a settlement with plaintiffs on March 8, 2007, which this court approved on October 2, 2007. <em>See </em>Stipulation of Partial Settlement 1; Oct. 2, 2007 Order. This action therefore remains pending only as between plaintiffs and defendant E &amp; Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">On December 9, 2005, E &amp; Y moved to dismiss the amended complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The court delayed ruling on this motion in order to permit settlement negotiations, and then denied the motion without prejudice to allow the parties to brief the court on intervening legal developments. Mar. 14, 2007 Order at 1-2. As permitted by the court, E &amp; Y renewed its motion to dismiss the amended complaint and filed a memorandum of law in support of its motion. Plaintiffs responded in opposition to the motion, and E &amp; Y filed a reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">The underlying claim in this case is securities fraud in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) [hereinafter \u201csection 10(b)\u201d] and 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5 (2007) [hereinafter \u201cRule 10b-5\u201d]. <em>See </em>Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 306-16. To prevail on a securities fraud claim, a plaintiff must show: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission, (2) made with scienter, (3) in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, (4) reliance thereon by the plaintiff, (5) economic loss by the plaintiff, and (6) a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s act and the plaintiffs loss. <em>See, e.g., Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, </em>544 U.S. 336, 341-42, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">Defendant has moved to dismiss the amended complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), as applied through 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b). A motion to dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the legal sufficiency of the complaint. <em>Kloth v. Microsoft Corp., </em>444 F.3d 312, 319 (4th Cir.2006); <em>E. Shore Mkts., Inc. v. J.D. </em>Assocs. <em>Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>213 F.3d 175, 180 (4th Cir.2000). In conducting its review, a court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, but \u201cneed not accept the legal conclusions drawn from the facts\u201d and \u201cneed not accept as true unwarranted inferences, unreasonable conclusions, or arguments.\u201d <em>Kloth, </em>444 F.3d at 319 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">Plaintiffs allege two categories of statements by E <em>&amp; </em>Y as the basis of their claim that E &amp; Y committed securities fraud. The first category concerns E <em>&amp; </em>Y\u2019s \u201csigning] off\u2019 on aaiPharma\u2019s 2003 quarterly financial statements. <em>See </em>Am. Compl. \u00b6 36. The second category concerns E <em>&amp; </em>Y\u2019s audit opinion in connection with a 2002 securities offering by aaiPhar-ma. <em>Id. </em>The court analyzes each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Plaintiffs seek to hold E <em>&amp; </em>Y liable for the misleading quarterly financial statements that aaiPharma issued in 2003. PL\u2019s Mem. in Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss 10. Essentially, plaintiffs allege that \u201cE &amp; Y simply rubber-stamped the Company\u2019s false financial results for publication to an unsuspecting market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. Plaintiffs\u2019 theory is that E &amp; Y approved these misleading financial statements, and because aaiPharma released these misleading statements to the public, E &amp; Y is therefore liable under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. <em>See </em>Am. Compl. \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 does not reach those who aid and abet a section 10(b) violation. <em>Cent. Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A., </em>511 U.S. 164, 177, 114 S.Ct. 1439, 128 L.Ed.2d 119 (1994). Although secondary actors cannot be liable under section 10(b) for aiding and abetting, they can be held liable as primary violators if they are shown to have \u201cemploy [ed] a manipulative device or ma[de] a material misstatement (or omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities relie[d].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 114 S.Ct. 1439. \u201cUnfortunately, deciding when conduct constituting aiding and abetting rises to the level of prohibited primary conduct is not well settled.\u201d <em>Anixter v. Home-Stake Prod. Co., </em>77 F.3d 1215, 1224 (10th Cir.1996), <em>cited with approval in Gariety v. Grant Thornton, LLP, </em>368 F.3d 356, 369-70 (4th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court is presently considering whether there exists some category of secondary activity greater than mere aiding and abetting, but less than a primary violation, for which a defendant can be held liable under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. <em>See generally Stoneridge Inv. Partners, LLS v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., </em>443 F.3d 987 (8th Cir.2006), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1873, 167 L.Ed.2d 363 (2007) (No. 06-43). Although <em>Stoneridge </em>is pending, the court believes that the law is sufficiently clear to resolve E &amp; Y\u2019s motion to dismiss the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The Fourth Circuit has intimated that there can be no liability under section 10(b) where a party itself does not make a representation to the market. <em>See Gariety, </em>368 F.3d at 369 (requiring district court to consider \u201cwhether [defendant] made a public misrepresentation for which it may be found primarily liable\u201d); <em>see also Glaser v. Enzo Biochem, Inc., </em>126 Fed.Appx. 593, 598-99 (4th Cir.2005) (unpublished) (interpreting <em>Gariety </em>to require that a misrepresentation must be directly attributable to the defendant for it to be actionable). This reading of the law comports with the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate in <em>Central Bank </em>that courts dealing with the implied private cause of action for securities fraud must adhere closely to the text of section 10(b), which \u201cprohibits only the <em>making </em>of a material misstatement (or omission).\u201d <em>Cent. Bank, </em>511 U.S. at 173, 177, 114 S.Ct. 1439 (emphasis supplied). Accordingly, \u201cany defendant who does not make or affirmatively cause to be made a fraudulent misstatement or omission, or who does not directly engage in manipulative securities practices, is at most guilty of aiding and abetting and cannot be held liable under [section] 10(b) or any subpart of Rule 10b-5.\u201d <em>Stoneridge, </em>443 F.3d at 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Here, plaintiffs allege that E &amp; Y \u201csigned off\u2019 on aaiPharma\u2019s misleading quarterly financial statements. Am. Compl. \u00b6 250. Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint does not allege that E &amp; Y itself made, or caused to be made, any misleading representation to the market with regard to the quarterly financial statements. Rather, plaintiffs allege that E <em>&amp; </em>Y \u201csigned off\u2019 on the statements with knowledge that investors would rely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>statements after aaiPharma released them. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6251. Plaintiffs have alleged a textbook case of aiding and abetting, a cause of action which the Supreme Court rejected in <em>Central Bank. See Anixter, </em>77 F.3d at 1225 (listing as elements of aider and abettor liability \u201c(1) the existence of a primary violation of the securities laws by another; (2) knowledge of the primary violation by alleged aider and abettor; and (3) substantial assistance by the alleged aider and abettor in achieving the primary violation.\u201d). Plaintiffs allege a claim for which relief cannot be granted, and E &amp; Y\u2019s motion to dismiss the amended complaint is granted with respect to the quarterly financial statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Plaintiffs also seek to hold E &amp; Y liable for its audit opinion with respect to a 2002 aaiPharma securities offering. <em>See </em>Am. Compl. \u00b6 36. Plaintiffs allege that E &amp; Y issued a materially misleading audit opinion approving of aaiPharma\u2019s financial state at year-end 2002, and that E &amp; Y consented to this audit opinion being incorporated into the disclosure paperwork for an aaiPharma securities offering. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 249, 251. Plaintiffs argue that, by consenting to the release of the misleading audit opinion in connection with the aaiP-harma securities offering, E &amp; Y violated section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 36, 306-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">For purposes of the motion to dismiss the amended complaint, the parties do not dispute whether there was a material misrepresentation or omission in this case. The parties do dispute the issue of scien-ter. The court must therefore determine whether plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded scienter so as to survive E &amp; Y\u2019s motion to dismiss the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">In evaluating a motion to dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), courts \u201cshould look to the specific factual allegations in the complaint to determine whether they plausibly support a legal claim for relief.\u201d <em>Alvarado v. KOB-TV, LLC, </em>493 F.3d 1210, 1215 n. 2 (10th Cir.2007) (discussing <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, ---, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1968-70, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)); <em>accord Erickson v. Pardus, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam); <em>E.E.O.C. v. Concentra Health Servs., Inc., </em>496 F.3d 773, 777 (7th Cir. 2007); <em>Iqbal v. Hasty, </em>490 F.3d 143, 155\u2014 58 (2d Cir.2007). Congress, however, altered the pleading standard with respect to the scienter element of securities fraud claims in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPSLRA\u201d). To survive a motion to dismiss a complaint, a securities fraud plaintiff must \u201cstate with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). The required state of mind in this case is \u201cscienter.\u201d <em>See Dura Pharm., </em>544 U.S. at 341, 125 S.Ct. 1627 (describing \u201cscienter\u201d as a \u201cwrongful state of mind\u201d). The court will therefore consider whether plaintiffs have pleaded with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-16\">The Supreme Court recently defined \u201cstrong inference.\u201d In <em>Tellabs Inc. v. Makar Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd., </em>the Court held that a \u201cstrong inference\u201d in the context of a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss a securities fraud action is an inference that is \u201cat least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.\u201d \u2014 U.S. -, -, 127 S.Ct. 2499, 2510, 168 L.Ed.2d 179 (2007) (footnote omitted). This standard is higher than merely requiring a plaintiff to provide a factual basis for the plaintiffs scienter allegation (i.e., \u201cto allege facts from which an inference of scienter rationally <em>could </em>be drawn\u201d). <em>Id. </em>In determining the strength <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>of an inference, courts must accept the facts as alleged in the complaint as true, and must consider all the factual allegations as a collective whole. <em>Id. </em>at 2509.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The definition of \u201cscienter\u201d is more troublesome. Plaintiffs allege that E &amp; Y acted recklessly in issuing the challenged audit opinion. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Mem. in Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss 12. The Supreme Court has expressly reserved the question of whether recklessness suffices to meet the scienter requirement. <em>See Tellabs, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2507 n. 3. However, all circuits to consider the issue, including the Fourth Circuit, have held that some level of recklessness will suffice. <em>Id.; Ottmann v. Hanger Orthopedic Group, Inc., </em>353 F.3d 338, 343-44 (4th Cir.2003). The court must therefore determine what constitutes actionable recklessness for purposes of a securities fraud action, and what methods by which it must be pleaded and proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The Fourth Circuit has refused to state precisely what level of reckless conduct that a plaintiff must plead and prove to meet the PSLRA\u2019s \u201cscienter\u201d standard. <em>See Svezzese v. Duratek, Inc., </em>67 Fed.Appx. 169, 172 (4th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (unpublished) (\u201cWe have not yet adopted a specific standard as to what precisely a plaintiff must plead in order to meet the [securities fraud] scienter requirement.\u201d); <em>Phillips v. LCI Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>190 F.3d 609, 621 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201cWe have not yet determined which pleading standard best effectuates Congress\u2019s intent.\u201d). However, the Fourth Circuit has suggested that \u201crecklessness\u201d in this context must approximate an intent to deceive. <em>See Teachers\u2019 Retirement Sys. of LA v. Hunter, 477 </em>F.3d 162, 183-84 (4th Cir.2007) (\u201cFor the second element of a securities fraud claim ... a plaintiff must allege that the defendant made the misleading statement or omission intentionally or with \u2018severe recklessness\u2019 regarding the danger of deceiving the plaintiff.\u201d); <em>Ottmann, </em>353 F.3d at 344 (\u201cSuch \u2018severe recklessness\u2019 is, in essence, \u2018a slightly lesser species of intentional misconduct.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Nathenson v. Zonagen Inc., </em>267 F.3d 400, 408 (5th Cir.2001))); <em>Phillips, </em>190 F.3d at 620 (\u201c[T]o establish scienter, a plaintiff must still prove that the defendant acted intentionally, which may perhaps be shown by recklessness.\u201d); <em>cf. Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 194 n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976) (\u201cIn this opinion the term \u2018scienter\u2019 refers to a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\u201d). Accordingly, the standard in the Fourth Circuit appears to be that plaintiffs must plead and prove \u201csevere recklessness,\u201d involving at least \u201can act so highly unreasonable and such an extreme departure from the standard of ordinary care as to present a danger of misleading the plaintiff to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.\u201d <em>Ottmann, </em>353 F.3d at 343 (quoting <em>Phillips, </em>190 F.3d at 621).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In determining what methods the plaintiff must use to prove severe recklessness, the Fourth Circuit has rejected the multi-prong tests used by some other circuits in favor of a totality of the circumstances test. <em>See Ottmann, </em>353 F.3d at 345 (\u201cWe agree that a flexible, case-specific analysis is appropriate in examining scienter pleadings.\u201d); <em>Helwig v. Vencor, Inc., </em>251 F.3d 540, 551 (6th Cir.2001) (en banc) (\u201cIn enacting the [securities fraud laws], Congress was concerned with the quantum, not type, of proof\u2019), <em>cited until approval in Ottmann, </em>353 F.3d at 345. The court must therefore look to all the facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged securities fraud in determining whether severe recklessness has been pleaded. <em>See Ottmann, </em>353 F.3d at 345 (\u201cWe therefore conclude that courts should not restrict their scienter inquiry by focusing on spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>cific categories of facts, such as those relating to motive and opportunity....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Accordingly, to survive E &amp; Y\u2019s motion to dismiss the amended complaint, plaintiffs must plead particularized facts giving rise to an inference at least as strong as any other inference that, by issuing its audit opinion, E &amp; Y committed an act so highly unreasonable that E &amp; Y either knew it would mislead the plaintiffs or must have known it would mislead the plaintiffs because the danger of misleading the plaintiffs was so obvious. Plaintiffs allege four categories of facts and circumstances in support of this inference: (1) E &amp; Y\u2019s violations of standard accounting practices; (2) E <em>&amp; </em>Y\u2019s broad access to aaiPharma\u2019s operations; (3) E &amp; Y\u2019s disregard of various \u201cred flags;\u201d and (4) E &amp; Ys motive to retain aaiPharma\u2019s business. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Mem. in Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss 13-21. The court has considered these and all other facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged fraud, and has considered plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as a collective whole. The court concludes that plaintiffs have not met the required standard because the inference that E &amp; Y was simply negligent is stronger than the inference that E <em>&amp; </em>Y was severely reckless.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Plaintiffs contend that E &amp; Y committed numerous violations of standard accounting practice, and that these violations support an inference of severe recklessness. PL\u2019s Mem. in Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss 13-15. Although plaintiffs point out six alleged violations of standard accounting practice, <em>id. </em>at 14, E <em>&amp; </em>Y correctly argues that it can only be held liable for one of those violations because the other five are in essence claims of aiding and abetting. Reply 5. The court must therefore consider whether E &amp; Y\u2019s classification of several drug lines purchased by aaiPharma as customer goodwill rather than as intangible assets supports an inference of severe recklessness. <em>See </em>PL\u2019s Mem. in Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss 14-15; Am. Compl. \u00b6 23(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">In considering a motion to dismiss a complaint, a court must accept as true only the facts, not the legal conclusions, alleged in the complaint. <em>See Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1964-65; <em>Kloth, </em>444 F.3d at 319. Here, plaintiffs do not provide factual support to connect the improper classification of the drug lines to their legal conclusion of severe recklessness by E &amp; Y. Plaintiffs argue that this improper classification resulted in governmental investigations, and that the improper classification had a significant impact on aaiPharma\u2019s bottom line. <em>See </em>Pl\u2019s Mem. in Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss 14-15. However, these facts at best support the inference that E &amp; Y was negligent, not severely reckless.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">Plaintiffs contend that E &amp; Y\u2019s broad access to aaiPharma\u2019s business operations supports an inference of severe recklessness. PL\u2019s Mem. in Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss 15-16. This argument is logically insufficient, because plaintiffs allege no facts tending to show that E &amp; Y\u2019s broad access to aaiPharma\u2019s operations supports the legal conclusion that E &amp; Y acted with severe recklessness in issuing its audit opinion. For example, merely because a person has broad access to every book in a library does not mean that the person has read and chosen to ignore facts contained in a particular book in the library. Merely alleging that E <em>&amp; </em>Y had broad access to aaiPharma\u2019s operations at best supports an inference that E &amp; Y was negligent, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>more likely supports nothing at all. Moreover, plaintiffs may not amend their complaint through their memorandum of law to repair this deficiency by alleging that E &amp; Y directly participated in the decision to improperly classify the drug lines. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Mem. in Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss 16; <em>Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>745 F.2d 1101, 1107 (7th Cir.1984) (\u201c[I]t is axiomatic that the complaint may not be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Plaintiff argues that E &amp; Y ignored various \u201cred flags\u201d that provided warning about aaiPharma\u2019s improper operations, and that these red flags support an inference of severe recklessness on the part of E &amp; Y. PL\u2019s Mem. in Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss 16-21. Plaintiffs allege four general categories of red flags: (a) news articles by financial journalists and governmental investigations questioning aaiPharma\u2019s accounting practices; (b) aaiPharma\u2019s weak internal controls; (c) various acts by aaiPharma indicating that it was \u201cchannel stuffing\u201d by moving inventory into warehouses where it would not be sold; and (d) statements to E &amp; Y by its national office and the SEC that the classification of the drug lines as goodwill was improper. <em>See id.; </em>Reply 8-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Again, each of these red flags is logically insufficient to support an inference of severe recklessness. The news articles and governmental investigations arose after E &amp; Y\u2019s audit report was issued, and thus logically cannot support the inference that E &amp; Y ignored them. <em>Compare </em>Pl.\u2019s Mem. in Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss 18 (stating earliest date of items in question as March 12, 2003) <em>until </em>Am. Compl. \u00b6 249 (indicating date of audit opinion in question as January 27, 2003). The weak internal controls cannot be used to support an inference of severe recklessness because plaintiffs have only alleged that there were weak controls, not that E &amp; Y knew of and disregarded them. <em>See </em>Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 262-64 (alleging only that aaiPharma, not E &amp; Y, admitted to inadequate internal controls). The various acts indicating \u201cchannel stuffing\u201d do not relate to the audit opinion at issue here, which covers only E &amp; Y\u2019s improper classification of various drug lines as customer goodwill. <em>See supra </em>Part II.B.l. And finally, the statements by E &amp; Y\u2019s national office and the SEC about the improper classification of the drug lines as goodwill are insufficient because they are not alleged in the amended complaint at all. <em>See Car Carriers, 745 </em>F.2d at 1107. Moreover, even were the court to grant leave for plaintiffs to add this allegation as they request, plaintiffs do not offer to show that these statements were made to E &amp; Y before it issued the audit opinion. <em>See </em>PL\u2019s Mem. in Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss 18 &amp; n. 9. E <em>&amp; </em>Y cannot have ignored what it did not know. Accordingly, none of these red flags provide support for the inference that E &amp; Y acted with severe recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Finally, plaintiffs allege that E <em>&amp; </em>Y had a motive to appease aaiPharma because the partners in E &amp; Y\u2019s Raleigh office were dependent upon aaiPharma\u2019s business to maintain their incomes, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>this motive supports an inference of severe recklessness. <em>See </em>Am. Compl. \u00b6 244; Pl.\u2019s Mem. in Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss 21-22. The Fourth Circuit has held that generalized motives shared by all companies are insufficient to support an inference of severe recklessness. <em>Ottmann, </em>353 F.3d at 352; <em>see Phillips, </em>190 F.3d at 622-23. The desire to maintain clients is certainly a generalized motive shared by all companies. Accordingly, E &amp; Y\u2019s alleged desire to appease aaiPharma does not support an inference of severe recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">5.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In sum, plaintiffs allege two categories of facts and circumstances that at best support an inference of negligence on the part of E <em>&amp; </em>Y, one category of facts and circumstances that is logically insufficient, and one category of facts and circumstances that is insufficient under Fourth Circuit precedent. Even after considering these allegations as a collective whole and in connection with all the facts and circumstances surrounding the case, the court finds that the inference that E &amp; Y was merely negligent is stronger than the inference that E &amp; Y was severely reckless. Accordingly, E &amp; Y\u2019s motion to dismiss the amended complaint is granted. In light of this ruling, the court need not consider whether plaintiffs adequately pleaded loss causation. <em>Cf. Dura Pharm., </em>544 U.S. at 345-48, 125 S.Ct. 1627; <em>Hunter, </em>477 F.3d at 185-188; <em>Glaser v. Enzo Biochem, Inc., </em>464 F.3d 474, 477 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">As explained above, E &amp; Y\u2019s motion to dismiss the amended complaint is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\">. The court is not saying that E &amp; Y was negligent or was not negligent. Rather, the court is simply analyzing the amended complaint under the governing legal standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\">. Even allowing plaintiffs to amend their complaint to properly allege facts demonstrating E &amp; Y\u2019s direct participation in classifying the drug lines as goodwill would have no impact on the outcome of this motion to dismiss. Such an allegation would be the only allegation tending to support an inference of severe recklessness. Without more, such an allegation would not raise the inference of severe recklessness to at least the same level as the inference of negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
