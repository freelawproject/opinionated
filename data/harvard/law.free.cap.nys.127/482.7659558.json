Plaintiffs had made an agreement with defendant for a contingent fee, consisting of a certain percentage of the recovery sought in an fiction against a third party. When this action came to trial, plaintiffs were in-, structed by defendant not to proceed with the trial, except with the co-operation of one Palmer, another attorney. Palmer was not present at the trial, and the defendant also absented himself, on the advice of some-one whom he does not name. The plaintiffs were, therefore, unable to prevent what the answer in the present case terms a default. Subsequently th\u00e9 defendant moved for a substitution \u00f3f attorneys and for the vacation of plaintiffs\u2019 lien on his cause of action. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-19\">The question of the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged misconduct in refusing to go on with the case, as pleaded in the defense and in the counterclaim, is shown in the pleading itself to have been necessarily litigated and decided in plaintiffs\u2019 favor on the motion for a substitution of attorneys and to vacate plaintiffs\u2019 lien. That matter, therefore, is res j udicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-20\">It appears affirmatively by defendant\u2019s pleadings that a recovery in the other action, on which plaintiffs\u2019 fee was contingent, was prevented by defendant\u2019s absence from the trial. Plaintiffs are there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>fore entitled to recover in this action on a quantum meruit. Defendant\u2019s own allegation that he instructed plaintiffs not to proceed with the trial without the co-operation of Palmer is a further violation of the agreement for the retention of plaintiffs\u2019 services and for the contingent fee therefor provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Apart from these circumstances, it appears that the entire defense and counterclaim are insufficient on the face thereof. While the pleadings charge misconduct in terms against the plaintiffs, the facts set forth in the pleadings themselves disprove the assertion. Plaintiffs do not claim that the value of their services is res judicata, but expressly admit that under the general denial in the answer this question can be litigated on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Interlocutory judgment reversed, with costs, and demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to defendant to amend within six days, upon payment of costs in this court and in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
