To prove the allegations of the complaint, it became of vital importance to plaintiff to show that a large number of postal cards, apparently signed by workmen in plaintiff\u2019s employ, were in fact in the handwriting of defendant. To this end plaintiff called a well-known handwriting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>expert, who testified that he had compared the .disputed postal cards with papers admitted by plaintiff to be in his own handwriting, and that in his opinion all were written in the same hand. The witness was then asked to state the reasons fof his opinion. An objection to this question was sustained, and the plaintiff duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\">This was error. It is a rule of general acceptance that an expert may always, if called upon, give the reasons for his opinion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\">\u201cWhenever the opinion of any living person is deemed t\u00f3 be relevant, the grounds on which such opinion is based are also deemed to be relevant.\u201d Chase\u2019s Stephen\u2019s Digest (2d Ed.) 156.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">\u201cOn direct examination the witness may, and, if required, must, point out his grounds for belief in the identity of the handwriting on the principle already considered. Without such a reinforcement of testimony the opinion of experts would usually involve little more than a counting of the numbers on either side.\u201d 3 Wigmore on Ev. \u00a7 2014.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In this state the practice of permitting handwriting experts to give: the reason for their opinion, and even to illustrate upon a blackboard, has been distinctly approved. McKay v. Lasher, 121 N. Y. 477-483, 24 N. E. 711. The reasons for the expert\u2019s opinion, if he had been permitted to give them, might, and probably would, have added great force to his testimony; for the mere expression of opinion, standing alone, has little probative force. Matter of Koch, 33 Mise. Rep. 153, 68 N. Y. Supp. 375.</p>\n<p id=\"A6U\">We cannot accede to the suggestions, made on behalf of defendant, that plaintiff\u2019s counsel should have persisted in his efforts to draw from the witness the reasons which led to his opinion. The question as to the admissibility of the evidence was squarely presented, and to ask the same question in different forms was unnecessary, and would have been indecorous.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The court was led, by acceding to a request from defendant\u2019s counsel, to apply to this case the stringent rules of the criminal law as \u2022 to the degree of proof which the plaintiff was required to make in order to obtain a favorable verdict. Although the defendant was charged with a criminal act, the action was a civil one, and all that was required of plaintiff was that it should establish its case by \u00e1 fail-preponderance of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">For these errors, the judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
