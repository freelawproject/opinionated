It appeared for the first time upon the'calendar for trial in June, 1908, when it was adjourned to October. The cause not then appearing upon the calendar, a motion was made by plaintiff to restore it thereto, which was not opposed by defendant, whereupon an order was made on March 31, 1909, granting the motion and restoring the cause to the calendar, at the foot of which it was placed under the number 854. It has never since been reached for trial, and the highest number which had been reached for trial up to the time of the making of the present motion was 719. The cause having been restored to the general calendar without objection, and not having since been reached for trial, the motion to dismiss it for failure to prosecute should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"AWkq\">The order appealed from must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to dismiss denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
