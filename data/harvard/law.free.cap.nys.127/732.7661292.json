The will further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\">\u201cFrom and after the decease of my mother, Mary Ross Colton and Mary Rowena Thomas as aforesaid and the decease of each of them, I give and bequeath the said remaining two-thirds of my estate as the same may then be, to the children of my said sister Mary Rowena Thomas, her then surviving, share and share alike.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Mrs. Weyman died August 19, 1861, and her husband was duly appointed executor. He subsequently died, and plaintiff was appointed substituted trustee. Mrs. Colton, the mother, died February 2, 1872, and Mrs. Thomas, the second beneficiary for life, died February 10, 1909. At the time of the death of the testatrix, the following children of her sister Mary Rowena Thomas were in being: Cornelia Col-ton Thomas, a defendant herein; Lucy Phillips, a defendant herein; John Dover Thomas, the father of the infant defendants Thomas Hay Thomas and John Dover Thomas, 3d; Rowena Thomas; and Mary Burton.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">The following children of Mary Rowena Thomas predeceased their mother: Rowena Thomas, who died February 12, 1862, an infant aged four years; Mary Burton, who died in July, 1893, leaving no children and no will; John Dover Thomas, 2d, who died January 17, 1898, leaving two children, Thomas Hay Thomas and John Dover Thomas, 3d, who are infants of the age of 19 and 17, respectively. The defendant Eugenia H. Thomas is the widow and administratrix of John Dover Thomas, 2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">The Special Term decided that the defendants Cornelia Colton Thomas and Lucy Phillips, being the only children of Mary Rowena Thomas surviving on the 10th of February, 1909, the date of the death of the said Mary Rowena Thomas, were the only persons entitled under the terms of the will to participate in the distribution of the principal or capital of the said trust funds and property. This estate consists entirely of personal property. The administratrix of John Dover Thomas, 2d, and the special guardian of his two children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>appeal; the claim being that the estate vested upon the death of the testatrix and that as John Dover Thomas, 2d, was then living, he became vested in a share of the estate which descended to his children. The administratrix claims in his right as the estate was entirely personal, and the children claim as his heirs and next of kin.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">In all will cases the intent of the testatrix must be ascertained from the language of the will itself if possible. General rules are of little or no help. It is true that the general rule favors the vesting of estates. Courts have sometimes seemed to strain to prevent nonvesting. It is also true that the word \u201cchildren\u201d sometimes includes grandchildren; that words of time, \u201cbefore,\u201d \u201cthen,\u201d \u201cat,\u201d \u201cafter,\u201d are variously construed in attempting to ascertain the real meaning of the testator. It is accepted doctrine, however, that each will must be construed by itself, and that, as no two are precisely alike, previous decisions are not as controlling as in other titles of the law. But there is no room for construction when the meaning is plain. The words in controversy are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">\u201cFrom and after the decease of my mother, Mary Ross Colton and Mary Rowena Thomas, * * * I give and bequeath the said remaining two-thirds of my estate as the same may then be, to the children of my said sister Mary Rowena Thomas, her then surviving, share and share alike.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">There were at the death of the last life tenant children of Mary Rowena Thomas her then surviving. Testatrix, immediately before the words \u201cher then surviving,\u201d made use of the phrase in describing the estate bequeathed, \u201cas it shall then be,\u201d indicating that she had clearly in mind the condition of affairs both financial and family which should exist at the termination of the life tenancy. If she had said \u201cto the children of my said sister,\u201d a different construction would have been required, and the language would have been construed as relating to the death of the testatrix. But it seems to me that with precision she has prevented such construction and indicated that it was her sister\u2019s children surviving at the death of Mrs. Thomas whom she had in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">In Robinson v. Martin, 138 App. Div. 310, 123 N. Y. Supp. 146, affirmed 200 N. Y. 159, 93 N. E. 488, this court and the Court of Appeals interpreted the words there used, \u201cupon the death of my said son, I give, devise and bequeath the said share to my unmarried daughters in equal shares,\u201d as applying to the condition existing at the cessation of the life estate, and decided that the bequest was to the daughters who were then unmarried, excluding three other daughters who had been married prior to the falling in of the life estate. The words so construed are not as clear as in the will at bar, which divides the estate \u201cas the same may then be\u201d to \u201cthe children her then surviving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs and disbursements to the respondents. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
