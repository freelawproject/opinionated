While Marsell was an attorney and counselor at law, and it would appear had represented th\u00e9 defendant O\u2019Brien in certain transactions, his employment, so far as it related to procuring a loan for him from plaintiffs, was not as an attorney and counselor at law, but merely as an agent, and the communications had between them did not relate to professional employment. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 835; Avery v. Lee, 117 App. Div. 244, 102 N. Y. Supp. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-8\">The conversations between these parties, if any such existed, were of vital importance in establishing the relation of principal and agent between O\u2019Brien and Marsell, which relation it was necessary for plaintiff to establish in order to maintain this action against O\u2019Brien. The error of the trial judge is emphasized in this case because he permitted the defendant O\u2019Brien to deny that he had any conversations with the witness Marsell upon the- subject, although that denial was somewhat qualified on cross-examination, while at the same time he refused to permit Marsell to testify to the fact of such conversations or the substance thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-9\">Judgment and order of the Municipal Court reversed, and a new trial ordered as to all of the appellants; costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
