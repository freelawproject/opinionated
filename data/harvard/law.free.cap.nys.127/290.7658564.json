The evidence tends to show no breach of duty by the master, unless it be in the failure to guard the rod which caught plaintiff\u2019s hair, and the charge of the court should have related only to that. The labor law (Laws 1909, c. 299, \u00a7 81) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">\u201cAll, vats, pans, saws, planers, cogs, gearing, belting, shafting,, set-screws and machinery, of every description, shall be properly guarded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The court should have submitted to the jury these questions: (1) Was it practicable to guard the rod? (2) Should! the defendant in the exercise of reasonable prudence have expected that the rod, unguarded, would expose the plaintiff to unnecessary danger in the performance of her duties? (3) Did the injury result from negligent failure to apply a practicable guard to the rod that would to a reasonable degree reduce an unnecessary exposure of the plaintiff in the due execution of her task? (4) Did the plaintiff by her own negligence contribute to her injury? (5) Did the plaintiff assume the risk of a danger obvious or ascertainable by her in the exercise of ordinary care on her part? (6) If all the questions be found in favor of the plaintiff, what is a fair compensation for her injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">The charge in regard to the defendant\u2019s alleged breach of duty did not conform to the law, which is stated in Wynkoop v. Ludlow Valve Mfg. Co., 196 N. Y. 324, 89 N. E. 827. Bor such error a new trial must be had, and it is unnecessary to review the facts. The employer\u2019s liability act cannot be invoked by the plaintiff on account of the insufficiency of the notice. Glynn v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 125 App. Div. 186, 109 N. Y. Supp. 103; Galino v. Fleischmann Realty &amp; Construction Co., 130 App. Div. 605, 115 N. Y. Supp. 334; Mattson v. Ph\u0153nix Construction Co., 135 App. Div. 234, 120 N. Y. Supp. 566; Logerto v. Central Building Co., 198 N. Y. 390, 91 N. E. 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">The judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
