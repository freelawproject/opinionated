A. 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Instead of asking for an alternative writ, the relator stood upon the moving papers and the opposing affidavits, and he is therefore in the position of. a demurrant. Matter of Steinway, supra, and cases cited at page 254 of 159 N. Y., and page 1104 of 53 N. E. (45 L. R. A. 461). It is charged in the opposing affidavits that the motive of the relator was to obtain information to furnish to the president of a competing company, who had at various times attempted to get information as to the appellant\u2019s contracts, prices, and methods of doing business; and in support of that charge affidavits were presented of two persons who had made affidavits for the relator, to the effect that they were procured to make such affidavits by the president of said competing company. An examination will not be allowed for an ulterior purpose or to embarrass the corporation. Matter of Pierson, 44 App. Div. 215, 60 N. Y. Supp. 671; Matter of Kennedy, 75 App. Div. 188, 77 N. Y.
