Subsequently the plaintiff moved for a new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence. This motion was granted and an order entered on April 20, 1910. The defendants appealed to this court, and the order was reversed \u201cwith costs and disbursements.\u201d Thereupon defendants\u2019 counsel caused a bill of costs to be taxed in the City Court; the disputed items thereof consisting of: \u201cAppeal to the Appellate Term before argument, $20. Appeal to the Appellate Term for argument, $40.\u201d They also taxed as for disbursements: \u201cPaid copy stenographer\u2019s minutes, $14.70.\u201d The plaintiff objected to the allowance of the foregoing items, and made a motion for a retaxation thereof, which was denied, and from the order denying such motion this appeal comes up.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The claim of the appellant is that all the items thus taxed were improperly allowed, for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">\u201cFirst. They could not be taxed as costs of the appeal to the Appellate Term, because by section 3251, subd. 4, of the Code of Civil Procedure, the costs of such an appeal are limited to $10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">\u201cSecond. They could not be taxed as motion costs, because (a) the costs awarded by the Appellate Term were limited to costs of the appeal; (b) the costs at Special Term were in the discretion of the court, neither party was entitled to them as a matter of right, and neither party was awarded them. The item of $14.70 was improperly allowed, because it was not a disbursement made on or rendered necessary by the motion for a new trial, or the appeal from the decision on that motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">That the items of $20 before argument and $40 for argument could not be taxed as costs \u201cupon appeal\u201d is undoubtedly true. Subdivision 3 of section 3251 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that, \u201cupon a motion for a new trial, upon a case,\u201d the same sums shall be allowed as costs \u201cas upon appeal as prescribed in subdivision fourth of this section.\u201d That a motion for a new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence must be made upon a \u201ccase\u201d there is no question. Davis v. Grand Rapids Fire Ins. Co., 5 App. Div. 36, 38, 39 N. Y. Supp. 71. Subdivision 4, referred to, was amended in 1902. Chapter 515, Laws' 1902. Prior to that time, by the terms of that section the sums of $20 and $40 were allowed \u201cto either party upon an appeal to the Supreme Court from an inferior court.\u201d By the amendment there was inserted in that section, after the words \u201can inferior court,\u201d the words \u201cexcepting upon an appeal to the Supreme Court from the City Court of the City of New York.\u201d This amendment was made at the time the General Term of the City Court was abolished, and the evident intent of the Legislature was to limit the successful party upon the denial of a motion for a new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence, the costs upon such motion, and that upon <em>appeal </em>from an order of that character no costs should be allowed in the appellate court, other than the usual $10 \u201ecosts given upon reversal or affirmance of orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">In the case at bar, motion costs could not have been allowed to the defendants in the lower court, until they became entitled thereto by reason of being the successful parties, and therefore they could tax no costs until they had succeeded upon appeal in reversing the order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>the lower court. The plaintiff was successful in the City Court,' and obtained an order granting a new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence, and in such cases the imposition of the costs of a former trial are usually imposed. Comstock v. Dye, 13 Hun, 113. Upon appeal, however, the order was reversed, and the defendants thereby became entitled to the same costs in the lower court as they would have been entitled to tax had they succeeded in that court and plaintiff\u2019s motion been denied, viz., $20 before argument and $40 for argument. Subdivision 4, \u00a7 3251, Code Civ. Proc. That in taxing such costs the defendants termed them costs \u201cupon appeal to the Appellate Term\u201d in no way affected the defendants\u2019 right to those items taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The appellant\u2019s claim that such costs were in the discretion of the Special Term, that neither party was entitled to them as a matter of right, and neither was awarded them, is not well taken. As to whether a party is entitled to such costs as a matter of right, there cannot be much doubt. In the case of Davis v. Grand Rapids Fire Ins. Co., supra, the case does not discuss the question whether motion costs are in the discretion of the court or not; but a reference to the printed case on appeal shows that the motion for a new trial was denied, and the original order granted $10 costs. Later an order was granted striking out all reference to costs, and plaintiff taxed $60 costs as a matter of right. The Special Term and the Appellate Division sustained the decision of the clerk. Milliman on Costs, p. 92, note. It was held in Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Co., 68 App. Div. 528, 73 N. Y. Supp. 898, that \u201cthe court had no discretion to change, the amount of such allowance as fixed by statute.\u201d See, also, Stitt v. Rowley, 37 How. Prac. 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">The appellant\u2019s counsel evidently appreciates the fact that such costs were allowed in the lower court' as motion costs, as she states in her brief that they were \u201capparently allowed as motion costs at the Special Term on plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial.\u201d The term \u201ccosts and disbursements,\u201d in the order of this court, had no reference to the motion costs, and simply indicated that the appellants were entitled to such costs upon appeal as are provided by statute, which in the case at bar was $10. So that in fact the defendants did not tax the full amount of costs to which they were entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">Section 3236 of the Code of Civil Procedure has no application to a case of this kind as that section simply provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-12\">\u201cCosts upon a motion in an action, where the costs thereof are not specially regulated in this act, * * * are in the discretion of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">As we have seen, costs upon a motion where a case is made are \u201cregulated by this act.\u201d It follows that the taxation of the item of $20 before argument and of $40 for argument was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">I do not think, however, that the item of $14.70 for stenographer\u2019s minutes should have been allowed. The attorneys for the respective parties at the time the motion was made for a new trial had stipulated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-15\">\u201cIt is hereby stipulated and consented that, on any motion made by plaintiff for a new trial of this action on the ground of surprise or newly diseov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>ered evidence, a copy of the case made and settled for the purpose of plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment and order denying motion for a new trial on the minutes, heretofore entered herein, may be submitted to the. court and used for the purposes of said motion and any appeal from the decision thereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">It is stated in appellant\u2019s brief, and not disputed, that the case on appeal from the judgment had been made and settled on the day this stipulation was made. The stipulation recites that the case made on the appeal from the judgment may be used \u201cfor the purposes of said motion.\u201d It is clear, therefore, that a copy of the stenographer\u2019s minutes were unnecessary for use upon the motion made herein, and such sum should not have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Order modified, by striking therefrom the sum of $14.70, costs taxed as for stenographer\u2019s minutes, and, as modified, affirmed, without .costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
