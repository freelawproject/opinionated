On a careful examination of the record, however, it seems to me that a determination of the issues on the first cause of action in favor of the plaintiff involved in no way a decision as to the merits of the second cause of action. The jury must have found that the installment of 33 dozen bears tendered to the defendants corresponded to sample and should have been accepted and paid for, and therefore awarded damages for the refusal as prayed for and proved under this cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>It was admitted by the plaintiff that the remaining 400 dozen bears had not been manufactured or tendered; plaintiff claiming only that defendants had by an absolute refusal to accept any more of these goods, committed an anticipatory breach of the contract. This was flatly denied by defendants, who claimed, on the contrary, that they had told plaintiff that they would hold him to his contract and demanded its fulfillment, but that plaintiff immediately thereupon served the summons and complaint in this action and failed to deliver any further goods. On this sharp issue of fact, the jury were perfectly entitled to, and undoubtedly did, believe defendants, and such belief amply sustained the verdict\u2014equivalent to finding that defendants prevailed on the first cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">Order reversed, and verdict reinstated, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
