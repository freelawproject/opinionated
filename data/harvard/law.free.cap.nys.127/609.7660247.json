He now asserts, however, that sufficient facts are shown to make out a cause of action for breach of contract, wrongful conversion of personal property, or injury to property. A failure to state, or a mistake in reciting, the nature of the cause of action, does not vitiate a warrant of attachment. Fox v. Mays, 46 App. Div. 1, 61 N. Y. Supp. 295. If, therefore, the plaintiff states sufficient facts to cdnstitute either of the causes of action specified, the warrant may be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-20\">In brief, the plaintiff says that his assignor, a real estate broker, employed the defendant at a salary of $15 a week and 10 per cent, of all commissions earned by sales effected by the defendant; that the latter made a sale to one Coombes and by the terms of the agreement was to be paid a commission of $1,500 by Coombes-; that the defendant thereupon left the employ of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, concealing the name of said customer, and brought a suit against Coombes, in which he recovered a judgment for $1,500; and that Coombes is about to pay the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-21\">A cause of action for money had and received is not stated, as the judgment has not been paid. It was not a breach of contract for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>defendant to leave the employment of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, as no definite term had been agreed upon. But, even if it was a breach of contract, no damages are shown. Such breach of contract did not entitle plaintiff\u2019s assignor to recover from the defendant the $1,500 wHch Coombes bad agreed to pay as commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">It was said by the learned justice at Special Term that the failure of the defendant to inform his employer of the agreement with Coombes was a breach of duty amounting to fraud, which prevented his employer from receiving the commission due, and therein was an injury to property. No doubt it was a breach of duty, on the part of the defendant, to conceal the name of his customer; but that alone did not give his employer a cause of action against him for the commission. As a matter of fact, the customer has not yet paid the commission. The mere fact that the defendant has a judgment for it does not entitle the plaintiff to recover of him the amount of the judgment. It is quite obvious that the plaintiff is seeking by an attachment to enjoin the collection of the judgment. But equitable remedies, if the plaintiff have any, should be pursued in a different way.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
