The justice sit- \u25a0 ting at Special Term has carefully analyzed the affidavits presented in his opinion on the motion, and has determined that a new trial should be granted. Although I' should probably have reached the opposite conclusion, if the question were presented to me as an original motion-, I feel that it cannot be said with any certainty that the justice\u2019s discretion has not been exercised soundly in granting a new trial. The order is, however, a distinct favor granted to the defendant, and should have been granted only upon reasonable terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">It should therefore be modified, by imposing upon him the payment of all costs and disbursements to date as a condition to the granting of the motion, and, as modified, be affirmed, without costs to either party upon this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
