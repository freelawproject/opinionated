The width of the highway varied from 39 to 65 feet. The final certificate was madp January 29, 1901, under which the amount earned by plaintiff was fixed at $280,146.16, whereof the amount for new pavement was $240,-616.64, and the retained percentage on the latter sum amounted to $72,184.99. The period of maintenance still' has over five years to run, and the first payment of 3 per cent, out of the retained percentage was ordered made on January 30, 1907, under the terms of the contract, by which the first return of 3 per cent, out of the retained 30 per cent, was to be made at the expiration of the sixth year after the acceptance of the work by the commissioner of highways. When this action was brought, the sum of $57,748.01 was claimed to be still retained by the city as security for the performance of the maintenance contract. Permits for repairs had been issued by the city of New York, through the commissioner of public works and the borough president for the year 1902 and through the borough president for the years 1903, 1904, and 1906, authorizing the Metropolitan Street Railroad Company to \"\u2018take up the pavement and excavate such portions as may be necessary of the highway along the lines of its present railways and of railways leased or controlled by.it in the borough of Manhattan for the. purpose of restoring the pavements which are in bad condition and of repairing defective tracks but not for any other purpose whatever.\u201d It further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-3\">\u201cWhenever it is necessary to open any asphalt pavement, the company shall send notice at once to this office of the location of such opening and also notice to the asphalt company having the contract for the maintenance of the pavement, and shall see that the asphalt company restores the pavement as promptly as possible; the work to be done at the expense of the railroad company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">These permits were for ordinary maintenance repairs to pavement and tracks, and to provide for. cases of accident or sudden emergency. The liability of the company for repairing the space within its tracks and for two feet on either side thereof was determined by section 98 of the railroad law (Laws 1890, c. 565), as amended by Laws 1892, c. 676, which throughout the period of maintenance has read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">\u201cEvery street surface railroad corporation, so long as it shall continue to use any of its tracks in any street, avenue or public place in any city or village shall have and keep in permanent repair that portion of such street, avenue or public place between its tracks, the rails of its tracks, and two feet in width outside of its tracks, under the supervision of the proper local authorities, and whenever required by them to do so, and in such manner as they may prescribe. In case of the neglect of any corporation to make pavements or repairs, after the expiration of thirty days\u2019 notice to do so, the local authorities may make the same at the expense of such corporation, and such authorities may make such reasonable regulations and ordinances as to the rate of speed, mode of use of tracks, and removal \u00f3f ice and snow, as the interests or convenience of the public may require. A corporation whose agents or servants willfully or negligently violate such an ordinance or regulation, shall be liable to such city or village for a penalty not exceeding $500, to be specified in such ordinance or regulation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>On August <em>25, </em>1908, the city of New York through the borough president of Manhattan granted a permit to the railroad company whereof so much as is relative to the issue is in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-4\">\u201cPermission is hereby given to the Metropolitan Railway Company to take up the pavement and excavate such portions as may be necessary of Broadway from Canal street to Forty-Second street for the purpose of renewing the tram rail and slot on this portion of Broadway, the rail to be used in such renewal to be of the same dimensions and style as that now in place, upon the following special conditions: That the company shall restore the pavement in accordance with the contracts and specifications of the following companies: The Barber Asphalt Paving Company, Broadway from Canal to Fourteenth street, dated July 29, 1901, Mack Paving Company, Broadway from Fourteenth to Forty-Second street, dated July 23, 1900 (with the exception of Broadway, N. S. of Twenty-Third to the N. S. of Twenty-Fifth street, Barber Asphalt Paving Company, dated October 23, 1907). That the company shall restore the pavement at its own cost and expense and to the satisfaction of the president of the borough of Manhattan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The railroad company thereupon had this work done at its expense by the Sicilian Asphalt Company. Thereafter the plaintiff caused to be sent the following notice of its election to treat this permit as a breach of the contract with the city, authorizing a rescission thereof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">\u201cMack Paving Company of New York, 30 Church St.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">\u201cNew York, Sept. 21st, 1908.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-8\">\u201cHon.

The contract, so far as the original performance of the work is concerned, has been entirely completed and accepted. Certain portions of the amounts earned thereunder, however, have been retained by the city of New York under the terms of said contract and have not yet been paid to us. We are now informed that, acting under a permit from your department, other parties with your acquiescence and consent are engaged in carrying on and performing a large portion of the work for which you have contracted with us as aforesaid and the performance of which was a material part of the entire consideration for our contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-12\">\u201cWhen we first learned of this violation of the said contract on your part, we verbally protested and objected thereto. Now, to avoid any possible misunderstanding in the matter, we hereby in writing, notify you that we repeat the objection and protest heretofore made against the said action above referred to upon your part and shall claim and insist that the same is a violation of the covenants contained in said contract, and that we elect to treat your illegal action as a breach of contract as aforesaid and hereby claim the immediate payment of the moneys earned and retained and the further damages to which we are entitled therefor resulting from said breach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-13\">\u201cRespectfully yours, Mack Paving Company of New York,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-14\">\u201cBy A., W. Sewall, Vice President.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>The theory upon which plaintiff seeks to escape from its liability to maintain in proper condition the paving laid by it, for a period of some five years still required by the contract, is that it was justified in rescinding the contract by reason of the breach of some covenant upon the part of the city by which plaintiff was to have the exclusive right to make all repairs to the paving of the highway in question for the full period of the contract, and that the measure of plaintiff\u2019s damage by reason of the breach was at least equal to the amount of the retained percentage. We can find no such provision therein. The maintenance of the pavement (as distinct from repairs) was an undertaking by plaintiff which formed part of the consideration for the price paid by the defendant for the entire work. It was an essential part of the entire work contracted to be performed by plaintiff, and its liability therefor did not terminate until the period of maintenance had expired. The repair work is a distinct and separate item, having no relation whatever to the original work contracted to be done or to the retained percentage. It is a clause obviously inserted for the benefit of the city to enable it to procure the immediate repairing (upon giving the notice required) of breaks or injury not covered by the maintenance clause, and the taking up, laying, and restoring of the pavement over trenches, for water and gas pipes, sewers, or other purposes, at the same rate per square yard as the contract price, and the replacing the surface in case of superficial injury at a lower rate. By this it was intended to enable the city to secure the speedy restoration of any surface damaged or temporarily interfered with for public uses. This constitutes no covenant upon the part of the city to. grant an exclusive right to the contractor to make such repairs, but is an agreement upon the part of the contractor that he will make such repairs as he is called upon by the city to make, upon receiving 48 hours\u2019 notice, and the only agreement which the city makes is to pay for repairs thus made upon notice, at the rate fixed by the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\">Under the decision in O\u2019Keeffe v. City of New York, 173 N. Y. 474, 66 N. E. 194, there can be no doubt that there was not even an absolute duty on the part of the contractor to make all repairs, but only a qualified one to make such repairs as it might be given the requisite notice to do, for otherwise the requirement for notice would be superfluous. Therefore the contractor could neither make repairs nor be held for a failure so to do, until the notice had been given. In regard to the relaying of the pavement in question by the Sicilian Asphalt Company, it was done under the orders of the railroad company which, as heretofore shown, was under the railroad law required to keep the space thus relaid in permanent repair. The contractor agreed by its contract that, in case the railroad company should desire to make a contract with it for the paving of the space within and about its tracks, the contractor would contract to do the work at a rate not greater than that fixed by the contract; but this did not bind the railroad company, which was not a party to the contract, to give such work to the contractor, nor did it bind the city, which was not chargeable with the doing of such work, to pay any one therefor. ' Of course the city never gave any notice to do the work in question. It' is dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>ficult in any event, even if the city had made such a covenant, to see how plaintiff could have recovered more than the profit it lost on the work thus done by another, or how it could have- rescinded its contract so as to be released from its absolutely binding agreement to maintain for a fixed period and to allow a sum to be retained as security for the performance of that agreement. In this case, there being no covenant by which plaintiff had an exclusive right to repair or relays and of course no breach of the contract, no cause of action had been made out by plaintiff, and the complaint should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">The contention has also been made that, plaintiff having failed to give any proof in support of its allegation of the filing of a notice of claim with the comptroller, the complaint should have been dismissed upon that ground. Under section 261 of the Greater New York Charter it was provided that no action for any cause whatever should be maintained against the city of New York unless it should appear by, and be an allegation of, the complaint that at least 30 days had elapsed since the demand, claim, or claims upon which the action was founded had been presented to the comptroller of the said city for adjustment, and that he had neglected or refused to make an adjustment or payment thereof for 30 days after such presentment. It has been held that compliance with this section of the charter is in the nature of a condition precedent, and that it must be both alleged and proved, for the failure to prove it prevents a recovery. Smith v. City of New York, 88 App. Div. 606, 85 N. Y. Supp. 150. There having been no proof offered herein, the question is presented whether any issue as to the allegation of presentation of claim was raised by the answer, for the plaintiff takes the position that the answer was insufficient to raise such an issue, and therefore no proof on this point was required. The allegation of the complaint is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">\u201cEighteenth. That heretofore and more than 30 days prior to the commencement of this action the claim sued on herein was duly presented to the comptroller of the <em>city of </em>New York for settlement and adjustment, and payment thereof duly demanded; but, notwithstanding such presentation and demand, no part of said claim has been paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">So much of the answer as refers to this paragraph of the complaint is contained in the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-7\">\u201c(1) It denies that it has any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to any of the allegations of said complaint contained in the paragraphs or subdivisions thereof marked \u2018First,\u2019 \u2018Third,\u2019 \u2018Fourth,\u2019 \u2018Fifth,\u2019 \u2018Sixth,\u2019 \u2018Seventh,\u2019 \u2018Eighth,\u2019 \u2018Ninth,\u2019 \u2018Tenth,\u2019 \u2018Eleventh,\u2019 \u2018Twelfth,\u2019 \u2018Thirteenth,\u2019 \u2018Fourteenth,\u2019 \u2018Fifteenth,\u2019 \u2018Sixteenth,\u2019 and \u2018Eighteenth.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">In Smith v. City of New York, supra, an answer containing the statement that defendant \u201chas no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of each and every allegation in said complaint contained not hereinbefore specifically admitted\u201d (the sole admission being that defendant was a municipal corporation) was deemed sufficient to raise the issue; the complaint having been dismissed upon that ground. It is true that in Purdy v. City of New York, 126 App. Div. 324, 110 N. Y. Supp. 822, and Borough Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>struction Company v. City of New York, 131 App. Div. 278, 115 N. Y. Supp. 697, it was expressly held by another department that such a denial was frivolous, for the defendant in presumption of law had full knowledge of the filing of the claim and of its contents and was not permitted to resort to what was termed \u201cthe lenient form of denial which it used.\u201d But both these cases were reversed in the Court of Appeals (Purdy v. City of New York, 193 N. Y. 521, 86 N. E. 560; Borough Construction Co. v. City of New York, 200 N. Y. 149, 93 N. E. 480), though upon grounds which rendered unnecessary the review of the question just referred to. In City of New York v. Matthews, 180 N. Y. 41, 72 N. E. 629, it was held that such a denial was frivolous when made by an individual defendant, denying knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to matters of public record, open by law to public inspection and with knowledge of which the defendant was chargeable by law. But in City of New York v. Halsey, 132 App. Div. 192, 116 N. Y. Supp. 947, it was held by this court that this did not mean that in no case can a party put in issue an allegation as to a matter of public record by a denial framed in the language of section 500, Code Civ. Proc. \u201cIt cannot be,\u201d it was there said, \u201cthat in every case a party is called upon to inspect the public records before answering and must admit or positively deny an allegation concerning the same.\u2019\u2019 In the case at bar the allegation is, not that a certain paper was placed on file in the comptroller\u2019s office and still remains there, but that \u201cthe claim sued on herein was duly presented to the comptroller of the city of New York,\u201d and that raises questions quite apart from its mere presence upon the files. The claim might have been defective or invalid, and under the decision in Purdy v. City of New York, 193 N. Y. 521, 86 N. E. 560, its retention by the city authorities without objection as to its sufficiency would constitute no waiver on its part of the right to rely upon the defects in the notice as a defense to the action. To the same effect was Forsythe v. City of Oswego, 191 N. Y. 441, 84 N. E. 392, 123 Am. St. Rep. 605. In the present case even had the plaintiff otherwise made out a case, it failed to prove the presentation of its claim as required by the charter, an issue as to which had been properly presented by the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
