The plaintiff has filed no verified complaint, and has not appeared in the action by attorney. Under such circumstances she was not entitled to costs under section 332 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, c. 580). Rice v. Hogan, 45 Misc. Rep. 400, 90 N. Y. Supp. 395. Nevertheless the trial justice has allowed her 25 cents fees and $10 extra costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-23\">The respondent claims that these additional costs are authorized by section 340, irrespective of her right to costs under section 332 of the act. I cannot concur in this view. Section 340 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-24\">\u201cIn an action brought to recover a sum of money for wages earned by a female employe * * * the plaintiff, if entitled to costs, recovers the sum of ten dollars as costs in addition to the costs allowed in this court * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-25\">I believe that the section clearly intends to give these costs only in cases where the plaintiff is entitled to an allowance of costs under the express provisions of the law, as distinguished from the fees and disbursements which she might recover by virtue of section 330 of the act, and that the same limitations are intended to apply to section 340 as to section 332. Section 340 differs from section 339 in these features: It provides specifically for the allowance of additional costs only \u201cif [the plaintiff is] entitled to costs,\u201d and these extra costs are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>\u201cin addition 'to the costs allowed in this court,\u201d instead of \u201cin addition to the other costs therein.\u201d Unless we give section 340 the construction which I have adopted, we fail to give these differences any effect or significance.</p>\n<p id=\"AqOz\">If, however, I am wrong in this construction, the costs must still be stricken from the judgment. Section 340 allows these costs in an action brought for \u201cwages earned.\u201d While this action was brought for wages earned, it is conceded by the respondent that she failed to show such a cause of action, but asks us to sustain'the judgment upon the proof of a breach of contract by wrongful discharge. \u2022 Even if we concede that such an affirmance is under the circumstances disclosed \u201caccording to the justice of the case\u201d (Municipal Court Act, \u00a7 326), we must still first regard the pleadings as amended to conform to the proof. In that event the action is to be considered as brought for breach of contract, and in such an action no additional costs may be allowed under section 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The judgment should be modified, by striking out the provision for costs, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
