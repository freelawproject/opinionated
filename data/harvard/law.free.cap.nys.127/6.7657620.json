If the action were, to recover the purchase price of the stock, as upon a sale thereof, that point would be well taken. The purchasers to whom the stock was sold on condition that the vendors would repurchase it at par could not have maintained an action without tendering the stock; but the broker who took back the stock, pursuant to his agreement made at the instance of the defendant, is not in the same position. His action is not based on any express or implied agreement on the part of the defendant to* repurchase the stock from him, but on the defendant\u2019s agreement to save him harmless. Having been obliged, owing to a breach of that agreement on the part of the defendant, to pay out this money in the performance of his agreement with the purchasers to repurchase the stock, he has a cause of action against the defendant for indemnity. The stock, having been repurchased pursuant to the .agreement, is deemed held by the plaintiff for the defendant. It is not involved in the action, as the issue is tendered by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">It follows, therefore, that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for judgment on the pleadings should be granted, with $10 costs, and judgment directed for the plaintiff as prayed for in the complaint, unless the defendant within 20 days pays the costs of the appeal and of the motion and answers the complaint. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
