The action is in ejectment. The plaintiff claims that he is the owner of certain described premises, that the defendants are in possession and withhold possession from him, and asks appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>relief. The defendants answer that they are' heirs at law of one Helen A. Jones, deceased, who died in possession of and owning the fee of the premises in question on the 28th day of November, 1907. They then proceed to set up, in paragraphs of their answer marked <em>\u201c3\u201d </em>and \u201c4,\u201d that for one year prior to her death Helen A. Jones was mentally and physically incapable of transacting business as a result of a stroke of cerebral apoplexy, and that while in this condition the plaintiff obtained from her on October 28, 1907, an instrument purporting to be a deed of the premises in question, and that he claims under this deed. There is a further allegation that, when the instrument was executed, Helen A. Jones was by reason of her enfeebled condition of mind and body incapable of comprehending the nature and effect of the instrument so procured from her by the plaintiff, and did not understand or comprehend the sanie when she executed it, nor did she comprehend the rights and interests of the defendants in said premises in' case of her death intestate. By paragraph <em>5 </em>of the answer it was further alleged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">\u201cThat said instrument was obtained from said Helen A. Jones by the deception, fraudulent importunity, and undue influence exerted on her by the plaintiff herein, at a- time when she was, by reason of her aforesaid condition, unable to resist the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">On the application of the plaintiff, an order was made directing the defendant to serve a bill of particulars, specifying, among other things, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">\u201c(1) The nature, character, and manner of each and every act of deception and fraudulent importunity and undue influence .which the said defendant will undertake to prove at the trial of this action, as having been exerted on Helen A. Jones, by the plaintiff herein, as alleged or referred to in paragraph designated \u2018Fifth\u2019 of the answers of the said defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">From this part of the order the defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">On the face of the answer it is not clear that the defendants intended in the paragraph marked \u201cFifth\u201d to do anything further than to state their conclusions of fact as to the matters alleged in the paragraphs marked \u201cThird\u201d and \u201cFourth.\u201d If such was their intent, then they should not be required to furnish a bill of particulars as to such matters; for they cannot very well do so without disclosing in detail their evidence, and this they are not required to do, as the matters set forth in paragraphs \u201cThird\u201d and \"Fourth\u201d sufficiently apprise the plaintiff of the issue which he has to meet. Hazard v. Birdsall, 61 Hun, 208, 16 N. Y. Supp. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">If, however, the defendants intended by the fifth paragraph of their answer to allege fraud and undue influence other than that stated in the third and fourth paragraphs, the allegation is so vague and indefinite as to justify the ordering a bill of particulars thereof. The situation presented is easily remedied by modifying the order, to so restrict the bill of particulars as to matters alleged in .the fifth paragraph of the answer which aver fraud or undue influence other than that alleged in paragraphs third and fourth.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">The order, so far as it is appealed from, should be' so modified, and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
