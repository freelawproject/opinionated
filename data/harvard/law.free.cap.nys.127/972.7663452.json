J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZjl\">It is clear that the theory of this action is recovery of wages. It was brought in the Municipal Court, and the pleadings were oral. The complaint is for \u201cwages due,\u201d and the bill of particulars furnished by the plaintiff states that the action is for wages due.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-21\">It appears that the plaintiff was in the service of the city of New York as a laborer, whose work was unskilled and manual. He was paid $2.50 a day when he actually worked. If the weather did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>permit him to work, he was not paid. He was \"laid off,\u201d and his claim is for a sum that represents his day wages during a period when he did not work. He testifies that a laborer named Horn took his place and did the work that had theretofore been allotted to him. I think that the judgment for the defendant was justified by the judgments in O\u2019Donnell v. City of New York, 128 App. Div. 186, 112 N. Y. Supp. 760, and the cases cited, and in Higgins v. Mayor, 131 N. Y. 138, 30 N. E. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">It is contended that the proof shows that the plaintiff was laid off or removed or suspended for the reason that he was a henchman of one faction of a political party which was in disfavor with his superior officer, and that the formality of recertification of his name to the civil service commission was not observed, so that he was not in line for re-employment. Even so, neither circumstance would render the defendant liable in this case for wages during the period when plaintiff did not work (authorities supra). Moreover, it appears that within about two months of his \u201claying off\u201d his name was placed upon the certified list. See People ex rel. Brown v. O\u2019Brien, 137 App. Div. 311, 313, 133 N. Y. Supp. 25; People ex rel. April v. Butler, 122 App. Div. 790, 792, 107 N. Y. Supp. 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">The judgment of the Municipal Court is affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
