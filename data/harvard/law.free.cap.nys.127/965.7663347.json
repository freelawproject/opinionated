There was direct evidence of such dedication in the testimony of a commissioner of highways of the town, to the effect that he had negotiated for that purpose with the plaintiff\u2019s grantor, and that oral consent was given to the building of the road on condition that the town should erect a fence on the border of the property in question the entire distance of the road, about 1,700 feet. The fact that the town built the road, constructed the fence, and has ever since paid all the expenses for the working and maintenance of the road is undisputed. When the plaintiff purchased the property, the highway was on the property, as he testified, open and in use. We cannot say that the deed which he obtained of the property was not given subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>highway rights; for, although it was offered in evidence and marked \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Exhibit I,\u201d it does not appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"AfO\">The appellant makes a point that no order laying out the highway was filed and recorded in the town clerk\u2019s office, as provided by section 191 of the highway law (chapter 30, Laws 1909 [Consol. Laws, c. 25]), relating to lands dedicated to a town for highway purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">The provision in question, however, is not mandatory, and in any event failure to comply therewith could not' operate to make the defendants trespassers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">The judgment should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
