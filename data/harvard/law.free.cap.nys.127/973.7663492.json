We think it unwise, however, to decide that question in this proceeding, as the order must be reversed upon another ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-24\">The learned justice at Special Term based the denial of the motion upon the sole ground that there was no proof that the judgment debtor had any property, and hence the appointment of a receiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>would serve no purpose. We think the court was in error, for the reason that upon such an application it is not a condition precedent to the appointing of a receiver that it be made to appear that the judgment debtor has property which may be applied to the payment of the judgment, as was held is Dease v. Reese, 39 Misc. Rep. 657, 80 N. Y. Supp. 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for the appointment of a receiver granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">JENKS, P. J., and THOMAS, J., concur. BURR and CARR, JJ\u201e concur in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
