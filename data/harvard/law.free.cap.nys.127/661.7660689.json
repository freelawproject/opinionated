Feldman?</p>\n<p id=\"b696-17\">The undisputed facts are that on March 24, 1907, the defendant transferred ten shares of its capital stock, of the par value of $100 each, to Feldman, and issued a certificate therefor, which provided that the stock was transferable only on the books of the bank, in person or by power of attorney, and surrender of the certificate. The same day that the certificate was issued Feldman obtained a loan from the plaintiff of $1,000 upon his promissory note, which was secured by an assignment of this-stock and the delivery of the certificate to plaintiff as collateral. This note was paid June 24th, and four days later another loan of $1,000 was made by plaintiff to Feldman upon his promissory note, payable in three months, which recites the pos-\" session of the stock (which plaintiff had retained) as collateral. This note was subsequently renewed for one month, and the stock was retained as collateral at Feldman\u2019s request. This last note remains unpaid. Six months after the transfer of the stock to the plaintiff, the defendant discounted promissory notes for. Feldman amounting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>$4,600, which were not paid at maturity and remain unpaid. Subsequently the defendant went into voluntary liquidation, and after the payment of all of its debts there remained a surplus for distribution among its stockholders, and dividends amounting to 73 per cent, have been paid. Checks were made payable to the order of Feldman for dividends upon the stock.standing in his name (which had not been transferred). These checks were not delivered, and at the time of the trial were in the possession of defendant. No notice was given to plaintiff of the dissolution proceeding or of any dividends. On May 14, 1908, the plaintiff gave the defendant notice of its ownership of the stock and demanded its share of the dividends.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The defendant contends that the ownership and legal title to the stock, notwithstanding the assignment to plaintiff, was in Feldman, and that, after the commencement of dissolution proceedings, some time prior to May 1, 1908, the stock had no legal status as such, and could not be transferred; that Feldman was the owner for the purposes of the distribution; that he could collect no dividends until his indebtedness was paid; and that plaintiff\u2019s legal status was no better than Feldman\u2019s. This contention is based upon the assumption that a valid transfer of the stock could not be made, except by transfer upon the books of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">I find myself unable to concur in this view. I think it is the well-settled law of this state that the delivery of a stock certificate, by assignment in blank and a power of attorney indorsed, passes the entire title, both legal and equitable, notwithstanding that by the terms of the charter or by-laws of the corporation the stock is declared to be transferable only on its books. McNeil v. Tenth National Bank, 46 N. Y. 325-331, 7 Am. Rep. 341. The defendant had no claim or lien upon the stock until after its transfer to the plaintiff. There is no proof that the stock of defendant is made transferable only on its books, by either its charter or by-laws, and in the absence of such a provision in the charter or by-laws the provision in the certificate of stock could not have the effect of limiting the unconditional right of transferring it. Kinnan v. Sullivan, 26 App. Div. 213, 50 N. Y. Supp. 95. The defendant had no lien upon the stock, and no right to offset the indebtedness of Feldman against the dividends declared thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">At common law a corporation has no lien upon its stock, and this rule is applied in this state, in the absence of statutory authority, to banks (Bank of Attica v. Manufacturers\u2019 &amp; Traders\u2019 Bank, 20 N. Y. 501) and to business corporations (Driscoll v. West Bradley &amp; C. M. Co., 59 N. Y. 96). Section 51 of the stock corporation law (Consol. Daws, c. 59) is the only statutory authority I am able to find giving a corporation the right to refuse to consent to a transfer of its stock by a stockholder until his indebtedness is paid, and this right is only given when the provisions of the section are written or printed upon the certificate of stock. The section is not applicable to the case at bar, because no reference to the provision of the section appears upon the certificate issued to Feldman.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The rights of the plaintiff became fixed and vested before the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>fendant went into liquidation, and the distributive share of its assets to which the plaintiff as a stockholder was entitled is not subject to any set-off on account of the indebtedness of Feldman at the'time of its dissolution. Bridges v. National Bank of Troy, 185 N. Y. 146, 151, 77 N. E. 1005; Pearsall v. Nassau Nat. Bank, 74 App. Div. 89, 77 N. Y. Supp. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The record discloses no errors, and the judgment must therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
