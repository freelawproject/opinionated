A judgment in favor of the plaintiff was reversed in 1908 (192 N. Y. 412, 85 N. E. 667, 21 L. R. A. (N. S.) 283; 193 N. Y. 646, 86 N. E. 1125), and since that time no move has been made. The judgment of reversal held, in effect, that the plaintiff had no cause of action as the pleadings then stood, and no motion has been made to amend the pleadings. Junior issues have been placed upon the calendar, and tried and disposed of, since the reversal, and the only excuse for delay is that made by the plaintiff, that she and her mother and other members of the family have been- ill. This clearly did not prevent\" her attorney from taking the necessary steps to amend the complaint, nor did it prevent making an application to read the plaintiff's testimony on a former trial, or to take her testimony at her own home. The learned court below has granted the defendant\u2019s \u2022 motion to dismiss the complaint, and we are of the opinion that there is no reason for interfering with the discretion thus exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-22\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
