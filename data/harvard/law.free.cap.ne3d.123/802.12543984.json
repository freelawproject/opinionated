L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1B). Concluding that there is no genuine issue of material fact that the defendants carried out an actual reduction in force, and that the plaintiff was unable to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   paradigm, we affirm.

If the employee successfully establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts under the second stage of the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   paradigm and the employer must rebut the prima facie showing by \"articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its [employment] decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Bulwer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802483\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/473/672/#p680\">\n    473 Mass. at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Blare\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Husky Injection Molding Sys.

Although the plaintiff challenges the existence of a reduction in force, he raises no genuine issue of material fact on this question.

The defendants presented unrebutted evidence that there was a declining case count in the Boston staff counsel office and that the employer believed that this trend was likely to continue. Moreover, the defendants did not replace the plaintiff or hire anyone else after the reduction in force. There was conflicting testimony regarding whether the plaintiff's supervisor played a role in deciding to initiate the reduction in force, and the employer failed to involve the director of human resources in the decision. These facts, however, reveal no discriminatory animus and are not significant enough to raise an issue that the reduction in force was pretextual.

At most, they reveal procedural irregularities, but raise no genuine issue whether the plaintiff was terminated as part of an actual reduction in force. Accordingly, we review this case under the reduction in force framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Prima facie case\n   </em>\n   . To establish a prima facie case in a reduction in force case, the employee must prove that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he performed his job at an acceptable level; (3) he was terminated; and (4) his layoff occurred in circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination.

The plaintiff contends that his fifty-four year old coworker should have been laid off instead of him. The coworker, however, is less than four years younger than the plaintiff and \"an age disparity of less than five years, by\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   , is too insignificant to support a prima facie case of age discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Avon Prods., Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"201283\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/438/413/#p425\">\n    438 Mass. 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 425 (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Likewise, the plaintiff's allegation that his rating was manipulated in January of 2013 from \"Meets Expectations; Low\" to \"Partially Meets Expectations\" to fit a bell curve in the office, or to justify laying off the plaintiff instead of his coworker, is insufficient to carry his burden. Even before being adjusted, the plaintiff's recommended rating was the lowest rating of any of the Boston attorneys. Moreover, the plaintiff's need to improve his performance was well-documented in performance reviews and warnings throughout his employment. Because the plaintiff failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that his layoff occurred in circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination, the judge properly granted summary judgment to the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Tortious interference\n   </em>\n   .
