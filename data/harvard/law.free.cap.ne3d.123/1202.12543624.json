(Merck). The two lawsuits involve four plaintiffs, who allege their family members died of pancreatic cancer caused by their use of Januvia. The plaintiffs allege that, as of the time their family members were taking Januvia, Merck knew that use of Januvia caused or increased the risk of developing pancreatic cancer and it failed to warn of this risk in the drug's labeling. The four plaintiffs' decedents used Januvia at various times between 2007 and 2012. It is undisputed that Januvia's labeling did not contain any mention of pancreatic cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Januvia was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 as a drug to treat type 2 diabetes, a disease that results in chronically elevated blood-sugar levels. If left untreated, type 2 diabetes can lead to various significant health complications. Januvia is one of two classes of drugs sometimes referred to as \"incretin-based therapies.\" Incretins are gastrointestinal hormones that cause an increase in the amount of insulin released from cells in the body after eating. Incretin-based therapies essentially prolong the effect of an incretin hormone that stimulates the production of insulin and in turn lowers blood sugar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Merck filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiffs' failure-to-warn claims were preempted by federal law. Specifically, Merck argued that federal law made it impossible for Merck to satisfy its duties under state tort law (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , by providing the warnings on Januvia's label that the plaintiffs alleged were necessary) because, according to the federal statutes and regulations that controlled the labeling of pharmaceutical drugs, the FDA would have rejected any attempt by Merck to add that warning to Januvia's label. This appeal addresses the specific question of whether Merck's affirmative defense presents a question to be resolved by the judge or by a jury. The trial court ruled that the question presented a factual inquiry that a jury should decide, and it denied Merck's motion for summary judgment. In doing so, however, it certified to this court the following question of law pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 308 (eff. July 1, 2017):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">\n   \" 'Under\n   <em>\n    Wyeth v.

Specifically, Merck argued that its evidence showed that since at least 2009, the FDA had been investigating the pancreatic safety of incretin-based medications, it had conducted a serious scientific study of the issue, and it made an affirmative scientific decision that the evidence did not warrant a change in labeling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 17 First, Merck submitted two FDA memoranda showing that in 2009, the FDA had reviewed its adverse event reporting databases for incidents of pancreatic cancer\n   associated with use of Januvia and Bayetta, a similar drug. One memorandum stated that \"little inference for risk [could be] appreciated from review of spontaneous reports of pancreatic cancer in adult recipients\" of the drugs, as pancreatic cancer is relatively common in adults. In response, the plaintiffs argued that more recent statements by the FDA indicated a greater level concern that a causal association exists between pancreatic cancer and use of Januvia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 18 Second, Merck argued that in 2009, the FDA required the manufacturer of Bayetta to conduct pancreatic safety studies of that drug to assess the relative risk of pancreatic cancer and patients using metformin or glyburide. In response, the plaintiffs argued this fact supported their contention that the FDA would recognize the existence of \"some basis to believe there is a causal relationship\" between incretin-based drugs and pancreatic cancer, which would have satisfied the standard for Merck to have added pancreatic cancer as an \"adverse reaction\" to Januvia's label through the CBE regulation.

Food &amp; Drug Admin., FDA Drug Safety Communication: FDA Investigating Reports of Possible Increased Risk of Pancreatitis and Pre-Cancerous Findings of the Pancreas From Incretin Mimetic Drugs for Type 2 Diabetes (Mar. 14, 2013), https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm343187.htm [https://perma.cc/ZNG2-AUVV]. The plaintiffs also relied on this same communication as significant evidence supporting their position. The 2013 Drug Safety Communication was apparently prompted by the findings of Dr. Peter Butler and his colleagues, who conducted a study that concluded that the use of Januvia increased the odds of developing pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Because the 2013 Drug Safety Communication is significant to an understanding of both parties' arguments, its pertinent text is set forth as follows:\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    This option is known as the \"Prior Approval Supplement\" or \"PAS.\" In cases involving the\n    <em>\n     Wyeth\n    </em>\n    inquiry, the PAS procedure is generally not involved because the FDA regulations provide that prior FDA approval is not required for a label change to \"add or strengthen a contraindication, warning, precaution, or adverse reaction,\" which is the kind of label change usually at issue in cases involving the\n    <em>\n     Wyeth\n    </em>\n    inquiry.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.70\">\n     21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.70\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(2)(v)(A), (c)(6)(iii)(A) (2012).

According to Merck, the FDA was announcing it would \"conduct a comprehensive evaluation of a possible association between incretin-based medications and pancreatic cancer,\" and that it would consider the entire body of scientific research and data available to date, as well as the Agency's own \" 'further investigat[ion] [into the] potential pancreatic toxicity associated with the incretin mimetrics.' \" (Brackets used by Merck.) The plaintiffs, by contrast, argued that the study the FDA undertook was merely \"a 'comprehensive' evaluation of the Butler group's findings, not of the 'totality of available scientific data.' \"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    \u00b6 21 The plaintiffs argued that the 2013 Drug Safety Communication was the most significant statement of the FDA's position relevant to the issue of whether \"clear evidence\" existed that the FDA would have rejected an attempt by Merck to add a pancreatic cancer warning to Januvia's label through the CBE regulation. They pointed to its statements that the FDA was continuing to evaluate all available data to understand the issue and would communicate its final conclusions and recommendations when the review was complete or when it had additional information to report. They further cited the requirement of the FDA's Guidance on Drug Safety Information that a document such as the 2013 Drug Safety Communication was to be updated if \"data become available that provide sufficient evidence that a drug is not associated with the safety concern previously described by the Agency as an emerging drug safety issue,\" and they pointed out that the FDA had not updated the 2013 Drug Safety Communication through any of its official methods for doing so as of the as of the time of the summary judgment briefing in 2017.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    \u00b6 22 Fourth, Merck argued that the 2013 Drug Safety Communication was followed by a publication by Dr. Amy G. Egan,\n    <em>\n     et al.\n    </em>\n    , in the February 27, 2014, issue of the\n    <em>\n     New England Journal of Medicine\n    </em>\n    titled, \"Pancreatic Safety of Incretin-Based Drugs-FDA and EMA Assessment\" (Egan article). See Amy G. Egan\n    <em>\n     et al.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Pancreatic Safety of Incretin-Based Drugs-FDA and EMA Assessment\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=370%20New%20Eng.%20J.%20Med.%20794\">\n     370 New Eng. J. Med. 794\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2014). (The \"EMA\" is the European Medicines Agency.) The significance of the Egan article was a major point of disagreement between the parties.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    \u00b6 23 Merck argued that the Egan article constituted \"an official statement of FDA,\" in which the \"FDA stated that (i) the scientific data do not support a causal association between the medications and pancreatic cancer, (ii) there is no evidence to support a change to the existing labeling, and (iii) the current warnings are adequate.\" Merck pointed to the article's statements that the FDA performed its own pancreatic toxicology studies with exenatide (Bayetta) using three rodent models of disease and a non-diseased control. Data from two of the models did not identify exenatide-related pancreatic injury, and the third showed minimal-to-moderate exacerbations of background findings after 12 weeks of treatment meriting further investigation. Merck pointed to the article's statement that the FDA reevaluated\n    more than 250 toxicology studies conducted in nearly 18,000 healthy animals, which yielded no findings of overt pancreatic toxic effects or pancreatitis. Merck also pointed to a similar EMA review showing drug-induced pancreatic tumors were absent in rats and mice that had been treated up to 2 years with incretin-based drugs, even at doses that greatly exceeded the level of human clinical exposure. Merck pointed to the article's statement that the FDA had required sponsors of marketed incretin-based drugs to conduct 3-month pancreatic toxicity studies in a rodent model of diabetes, of which three had been submitted reporting no treatment-related adverse effects on the pancreas. Also, three FDA pathologists conducted independent and blinded examinations of approximately 120 histopathology slides from one of the three studies, and those examinations were \"generally concordant with the sponsor's report.\" Merck also cited the statement in the report that a pooled analysis of data from 14,611 patients with type 2 diabetes from 25 clinical trials in the sitagliptin (Januvia and Janumet ) database provided no compelling evidence of an increased risk of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    \u00b6 24 Merck argued that, based on the results of the study reported in the Egan article, the FDA made an affirmative decision that the scientific evidence did not warrant a change in Januvia's labeling, a fact that indicated it would have rejected an attempted change through the CBE regulation. Merck relied on the following passage from the Egan article:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    \"Both agencies [\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , FDA and EMA] agree that assertions concerning a causal association between incretin-based drugs and pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, as expressed recently in the scientific literature and in the media, are inconsistent with the current data. The FDA and the EMA have not reached a final conclusion at this time regarding such a causal relationship. * * * The FDA and the EMA believe that the current knowledge is adequately reflected in the product information or labeling, and further harmonization among products is planned in Europe.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    \u00b6 25 The plaintiffs, by contrast, argued that, for purposes of determining whether \"clear evidence\" exists that the FDA would have rejected an attempt by Merck to add a pancreatic cancer warning to Januvia's label through the CBE regulation, the second sentence from the above passage is significant, in which the article states the FDA had \"not reached a final conclusion at this time regarding such a causal relationship.\" The plaintiffs pointed to various other statements in the Egan article indicating that the issue of whether a causal association exists between increin-based drugs and pancreatic cancer is the subject of ongoing review within the FDA. Thus, the plaintiffs argued that the statements in the Egan article cannot amount to an \"affirmative decision\" by the FDA that it would have rescinded an attempt by Merck to amend its label under the CBE regulation, pending the outcome of that review. Instead, they argued that the mere fact that the FDA considers its investigation ongoing, when combined with the existing scientific data, indicates there exists \"some basis to believe there is a causal relationship\" between use of Januvia and pancreatic cancer, which satisfies the standard for adding it as an \"adverse reaction\" to Januvia's label.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20201.57\">\n     21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.57\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(7) (2012). They argued it also satisfies the standard for adding a warning, which does not require causation to be \"definitely established\" (\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20201.57\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 201.57(c)(6)(i) ), but only that there be \" 'reasonable' evidence of a causal association with the drug,\" which can be met by \"a wide range of evidence.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Supplemental Applications Proposing Labeling Changes for Approved Drugs, Biologics, and Medical Devices, 73 Fed. Reg. at 49,604.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    \u00b6 26 The plaintiffs further argued that the evaluation undertaken by the FDA as reported in the Egan article was not nearly as comprehensive as Merck suggested. The plaintiffs argued the study was merely a review of the findings of Dr. Butler's group, and it did not amount to a rejection by the FDA of any causal connection between incretin-based drugs and pancreatic cancer. The plaintiffs proffered the testimony of a controlled expert witness in FDA labeling, Dr. Alexander Fleming, who testified that the Egan article should be interpreted as an effort to respond to the findings of Dr. Butler's group and to make a \"clear statement that this particular assertion, again, by a particular investigator, are not supported by the data [the FDA] reviewed.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    \u00b6 27 The parties also disputed whether the Egan article constituted an \"official statement\" of the FDA. The parties agreed it constituted an \"FDA-Assigned article\" under the FDA staff manual. Merck argued that an FDA-Assigned article represents the official position of the FDA, as the absence of a disclaimer on the Egan article stating that it was not an official statement of the FDA means it was an official statement. Merck pointed out that the article states it is by \"the Office of New Drugs, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration\" and argued that it is \"replete with statements about the 'FDA's' position on the issues.\" The plaintiffs, by contrast, argued the absence of a disclaimer does not mean the article was an official statement. Rather, they argued that, based on how it was published, under the staff manual and regulations, it amounts merely to \"an informal communication that * * * does not necessarily represent the formal position of FDA, and does not bind or otherwise obligate or commit the agency to the views expressed.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2010.85\">\n     21 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (k) (2012). The plaintiffs contended that only the document pertinent to this case that constitutes an \"official statement\" of the FDA under its staff manual is the 2013 Drug Safety Communication.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    \u00b6 28 Fifth, Merck relied on the FDA's denial in 2014 of a petition submitted in 2012 by the Public Citizen's Health Research Group (Public Citizen), requesting that the FDA remove the drug Victoza (liraglutide) from the market. The parties disputed the extent to which the risk of pancreatic cancer was an issue in the Public Citizen's petition, as only two paragraphs of the FDA's 37-page response were dedicated to discussing pancreatic cancer. Merck pointed out that the FDA's response does state that \"[a]ny causal association between exposure to Victoza and pancreatic cancer is indeterminate at this time.\" The response further states,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n    \"In our review of 49 unique cases recovered from [the FDA's adverse event database] we found no new evidence regarding the risk of pancreatic carcinoma in association with the use of Victoza that would support any changes to the current approved labeling. Therefore, any suspicion of causal association between exposure to Victoza and pancreatic cancer is indeterminate at this time.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    \u00b6 29 The plaintiffs, by contrast, pointed out that Public Citizen's petition did not request a pancreatic cancer warning for Victoza. They argued the FDA's decision not to mandate the addition of a warning is not the same as determining that it would reject a warning the manufacturer attempted to add through the CBE regulation. The plaintiffs cited the testimony of their regulatory expert, Dr. Fleming, that the FDA's denial of the Public Citizen petition does not support the conclusion that FDA found that adverse events reports\n    do not support changes to the current approved labeling for Victoza. They pointed out that, for purposes of assessing clear evidence that the FDA would have rejected an attempted label change by Merck, Dr. Fleming testified it was more significant that the FDA stated it was \"indeterminate\" whether any causal association existed between Victoza and pancreatic cancer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    \u00b6 30 Sixth, Merck relied on a 2014 \"FDA Briefing Document\" concerning the drug Saxenda (liraglutide). Merck pointed to two statements by FDA reviewers in that document. The first states, \"Risk for pancreatic cancer has more recently emerged as a concern with GLP-1-based therapies, including liraglutide. * * * However, animal, observational, and clinical trial data reviewed by FDA to date have not supported a causal association.\" The second states,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n    \"To date, studies have been inconclusive in evaluating the risk of pancreatic cancer with incretin mimetric use. Both FDA and the [EMA] have explored multiple data streams to evaluate pancreatic toxicity as a potential drug safety signal, which to date, do not support pancreatic cancer as an incretin mimetic-mediated event.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    \u00b6 31 The plaintiffs pointed out that the FDA Briefing Document contained a disclaimer, which Merck did not include in its submission to the trial court, stating the assessments, conclusions, and recommendations therein \"do not necessarily represent the final position of the individual reviewers, nor do they necessarily represent the final position of the Review Division or Office.\" The plaintiffs pointed to other statements in the FDA Briefing Document that, they argued, support their contention that the FDA would not have rejected an attempted label change by Merck through the CBE regulation. For example, they point out that the document confirms \"a disproportionate number of liraglutide associated thyroid and pancreatic cancers\" and \"the medical literature offers inconclusive data to determine the role that liraglutide may play in these malignancies.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    \u00b6 32 Finally, the plaintiffs responded to Merck's overall reliance on the above evidence by arguing that the evidence demonstrated Merck also had \"new safety information\" that it could have provided to the FDA to substantiate the need for a change to Januvia's label under the CBE regulation. See Supplemental Applications Proposing Labeling Changes for Approved Drugs, Biologics, and Medical Devices, 73 Fed. Reg. at 49,604 -05. The plaintiffs argued this \"new safety information\" included a comprehensive signal assessment provided to Merck in 2013 by Health Canada that found the \"use of Januvia may be associated with an increased risk of cancer of the pancreas.\" The plaintiffs cited testimony by Dr. Fleming giving the opinion that this study by Health Canada outlines both the biological plausibility and disproportionate spontaneous adverse event reports, which would amount to \"reasonable evidence of a causal association\" between use of Januvia and pancreatic cancer.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20201.57\">\n     21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.57\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(6)(i) (2012). The plaintiffs also argued that Merck could have provided the FDA with \"new safety information\" that clinical trials had shown an imbalance of pancreatic cancer cases in users of incretin based drugs. The plaintiffs argued that Merck's regulatory expert admitted in his deposition that an imbalance in clinical trials could affect FDA's assessment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    \u00b6 33 The trial court issued a written order reviewing the above evidence and the parties' dispute about whether the \"clear evidence\" test should be decided by the judge or by the jury. The trial court\n    noted that the case was not one in which Merck was able to supply evidence of its own attempts to change Januvia's label and FDA's actual responses to that request. Rather, Merck had submitted circumstantial evidence of how the FDA would have responded if it had tried to do so, in the form of clinical studies, FDA correspondence, clinical data, expert depositions, periodicals, and expert reports. The plaintiffs had submitted similar evidence in opposition to the motion. The trial court stated that, whether the issue of \"clear evidence\" was decided by a judge or jury, the decision required weighing the evidence, drawing inferences from the facts presented, comparing evidence that is not similar, and assessing the credibility of that evidence. The trial court recognized that under both Illinois and federal law, these responsibilities are traditionally the function of a jury, not a judge. The trial court stated that the dispute before it \"involves extremely complex scientific issues that require explanation and context from the parties' witnesses,\" and thus the decision would be best made after a full trial in which all evidence is presented. Thus, the trial court concluded the \"clear evidence\" inquiry should be resolved by the jury. It found that genuine issues of material fact prevented it from granting summary judgment in favor of Merck on its affirmative defense that the plaintiffs' failure-to-warn claims were preempted by federal law. At Merck's request, the trial court certified the question of law to this court as set forth above.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    \u00b6 34 ANALYSIS\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    \u00b6 35 The certified question requires us to determine whether it is for a judge or jury to decide in a pharmaceutical product liability case whether a drug manufacture has shown \"clear evidence\" that the FDA would not have permitted it to include the plaintiffs' requested warning in the labeling of the drug at issue. In most reported cases where this issue has arisen, the question of whether that standard has been satisfied has been resolved by the judge.

The FDA's regulations provide the legal standards of causation and proof through which that dispute must be analyzed, but the substantive question to be resolved is whether enough was shown through scientific, medical, or other evidence to allow the decision maker to draw a clear conclusion that if Merck had attempted through the CBE regulation to add a pancreatic cancer warning to Januvia's labeling, the FDA would have rescinded that change.

Within this broader dispute are various subsidiary disputes, such as the scope of what the FDA studied scientifically concerning the link between incretin-based drugs and pancreatic cancer and what scientific and medical conclusions it drew from its examination of those issues. Another subsidiary dispute is how the FDA's actions concerning other incretin-based drugs, such as Bayetta, Victoza, and Saxenda, support the conclusion of how it would have viewed an attempted change to Januvia's label. Yet another example is the question of whether Merck had other \"new safety information\" available that it could have used to substantiate to the FDA that a causal association existed between the use of Januvia and pancreatic cancer and how this would have affected the FDA's decision to\n    allow Merck to change Januvia's label through the CBE regulation. We do not believe these kinds of issues can be classified as questions of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    \u00b6 42 As the parties framed their dispute in the trial court, it does not present a case where the issue can be resolved solely by applying the language of FDA regulations to undisputed facts that allow for only one interpretation. Although Merck argues to the contrary, we do not believe this case presents a situation in which the issue can be resolved simply by looking at documentary evidence in light of those regulations. We agree with the trial court that far more context and explanation would be necessary to appropriately answer this question. Both the plaintiffs and Merck have proffered expert witnesses to testify about how the FDA actually makes drug-labeling decisions, what the FDA has studied or done with respect to the link between various incretin-based drugs and pancreatic cancer, what inferences can fairly be drawn from public or internal statements by FDA employees, and ultimately what conclusions should be drawn from the evidence about how the FDA actually would have responded if faced with an attempt by Merck to add a pancreatic cancer warning to Januvia's labeling. Regardless of whether the decision maker is the judge or jury, we do not believe that the decision could be made without hearing all of the testimony by and cross-examination of all the expert witnesses on all scientific, medical, and regulatory issues in the case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    \u00b6 43 We believe that Merck overstates the extent to which an understanding of the FDA's \"complex regulatory regime\" plays the determinative role in the\n    <em>\n     Wyeth\n    </em>\n    inquiry. We find the FDA regulations cited to us by both parties, as well as those discussed in the pertinent case law (see,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Wyeth\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/\">\n     555 U.S. at 568-73\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/\">\n     129 S.Ct. 1187\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ), to be similar to the kinds of legal standards of causation and burdens of proof that juries regularly apply when making decisions in tort cases. For example, the regulations at issue provide that a manufacturer must revise a drug's labeling to include a warning about a clinically significant hazard as soon as there is \"reasonable evidence of a causal association with a drug,\" although a causal relationship need not have been definitely established.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20201.57\">\n     21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 201.57\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(6)(i), 314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A) (2012). The comments to the final rule elaborate that a manufacturer may revise a label under the CBE regulation \"even if that evidence would not also support a higher evidentiary standard, such as a finding that there is a 'preponderance' of evidence that a product actually causes a particular kind of adverse event.\" Supplemental Applications Proposing Labeling Changes for Approved Drugs, Biologics, and Medical Devices, 73 Fed. Reg. at 49,604. These concepts of \"reasonable evidence,\" \"causal association,\" and evidentiary standards or proof are the same kinds of concepts that we entrust to properly-instructed juries to resolve in almost every tort case. See Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions, Civil, No. 15.01 (2011) (hereinafter IPI Civil No. 15.01 ) (defining \"proximate cause\"); IPI Civil No. 21.01 (defining burden of proof in civil cases). We see no reason why a different practice would be required with the\n    <em>\n     Wyeth\n    </em>\n    inquiry.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    \u00b6 44 Rather, we find that the issue presented by the\n    <em>\n     Wyeth\n    </em>\n    inquiry is simply a particular application of the task juries regularly perform in tort cases, determining what the evidence shows probably would have happened if the allegedly wrongful conduct had not occurred. In this case, the allegedly wrongful conduct is the failure to add a pancreatic cancer warning to the labeling for Januvia. The\n    <em>\n     Wyeth\n    </em>\n    inquiry asks whether, if this had not occurred, and Merck did in fact add such a warning through the CBE regulation,\n    there is nevertheless clear evidence that the FDA would have rescinded it. Juries are commonly given the task of resolving questions of what probably would have happened absent allegedly wrongful conduct. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Lee v.

We believe it is significant that, in these cases where the issue was decided by the judge, the conclusion was that the evidence was insufficient to support the affirmative defense, on which the defendant would have the burden of proof at trial. Generally speaking, when a trial court can decide on the merits that, regardless of whether the facts are disputed, the defendant's best evidence is not of the quantum or quality of proof necessary to support the affirmative defense pled, this is a proper basis for determining that the defense as insufficient as a matter of law. When that occurs, there is no need for a trial on the merits of the defense. But that is not the same thing as saying that a trial court can just as easily decide on the merits that, despite the existence of genuine issues of material fact, the defendant should be entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the defense. The former is usually proper, but the latter normally requires that the issue be submitted to the jury for a decision on the merits. We believe these cases above fall into the former category, and we do not read them to stand for the\n    proposition that the latter procedure is appropriate where the question involved is the\n    <em>\n     Wyeth\n    </em>\n    inquiry.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    \u00b6 51 Of the reported decisions cited to us by Merck, it appears that only in\n    <em>\n     Dobbs\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5905013\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/797/1264/#p1270\">\n     797 F.Supp.2d at 1271-80\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     In re Incretin-Based Therapies\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228546\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/142/1108/#p1114\">\n     142 F.Supp.3d at 1120-32\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and\n    <em>\n     Seufert\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141632\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/187/1163/#p1170\">\n     187 F.Supp.3d at 1170-78\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , did the district judge resolve disputed facts in favor of the drug manufacturer and grant summary judgment on the preemption defense in the defendant's favor.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    Of these three cases, the only one in which the court addressed whether the issue presented a decision for the judge or jury was\n    <em>\n     In re Incretin-Based Therapies\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228546\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/142/1108/#p1114\">\n     142 F.Supp.3d at 1114\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , which was vacated on other grounds.\n    <em>\n     Seufert\n    </em>\n    was decided by the same district judge as\n    <em>\n     In re Incretin-Based Therapies\n    </em>\n    , and it did incorporate by reference part of the discussion from\n    <em>\n     In re Incretin-Based Therapies\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Seufert\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141632\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/187/1163/#p1170\">\n     187 F.Supp.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1169 n.10.

Furthermore, the district judge in the\n    <em>\n     In re Incretin Based Therapies\n    </em>\n    case relied on the fact that the plaintiffs had filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on the affirmative defense and found that fact \"supports the Court's conclusion that summary judgment is appropriate for resolution of Defendants' conflict preemption defense.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228546\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/142/1108/#p1114\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228546\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/142/1108/#p1114\">\n     at 1114-15\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Thus, we reject Merck's argument that, for the purpose of the issue we are deciding, we should find significance in the fact that the Supreme Court did not remand the case. We do not discern any direction from the Supreme Court's application of the test in\n    <em>\n     Wyeth\n    </em>\n    that judges and not juries should resolve the \"clear evidence\" test when doing so would require deciding genuine issues of material fact.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    \u00b6 58 Merck next argues that the\n    <em>\n     Wyeth\n    </em>\n    inquiry should be treated as a question for resolution by the judge because determining what conclusion the FDA reached is similar to judicial review of the correctness of administrative agency action. Merck argues that the decision maker in the \"clear evidence\" determination must discern from the FDA's words and action whether there is \"clear evidence\" that the agency reached a regulatory conclusion that the available science did not support a warning. It argues that \"\n    <em>\n     Wyeth\n    </em>\n    preemption is similar to an assessment of whether an agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously,\" in that both inquiries require courts to \"review the administrative record, examine the words and conduct of the relevant agency actors, and decide for themselves.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    \u00b6 59 Although some cases involving the\n    <em>\n     Wyeth\n    </em>\n    inquiry may simply require review of an actual FDA decision, we disagree that the dispute Merck and the plaintiffs presented to the trial court in this case was akin to judicial review of administrative agency action. We believe there is a significant difference between the question presented to the trial court in this case and a typical administrative review case. Put simply, when a court reviews an action or decision by an administrative agency, there exists an actual, specific action taken or decision made by an agency with substantive expertise in the subject matter, which a court reviews for compliance with certain legal standards. In almost all such cases, the court employs a standard of review that gives substantial deference to the agency's action or decision, by ensuring it was not arbitrary and capricious or contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.

The court does not substitute its own reasoning or judgment for that of the agency.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 506,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20Ill.%20Dec.%20531\">\n     120 Ill.Dec. 531\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=524%20N.E.2d%20561\">\n     524 N.E.2d 561\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The substantive correctness of the decision or action is usually not as significant as ensuring that the agency complied with the law in reaching that decision or taking that action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    \u00b6 60 Here, Merck is not pointing to an actual FDA action or decision to be reviewed (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , an actual rejection by the FDA of an attempt to add the warning at issue to the label by the manufacturer). Instead, the decision maker is being asked to extrapolate from other evidence whether it is clear what the FDA's action or decision\n    <em>\n     would have been\n    </em>\n    if Merck had attempted to change Januvia's label through the CBE regulation to add the warning that the plaintiffs allege was necessary. The decision maker is being asked to ascertain the substantive answer to this\n    question. Doing so requires the decision maker-whether judge or jury, normally has no expertise in the substantive subject matter-to discern from the totality of evidence presented by the parties whether it is clear what the FDA's substantive action would have been in the first instance. The substance of the FDA's decision is what matters, not the FDA's compliance with the law in reaching that decision. Thus, we perceive these inquiries to be different and believe that the\n    <em>\n     Wyeth\n    </em>\n    inquiry presents a question for the jury in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    \u00b6 61 Merck next argues that, assuming the \"clear evidence\" inquiry involves both legal and factual elements, the trial judge should nevertheless make those factual determinations as a matter of institutional competence, as judges have training in interpreting statutes, regulations, and other legal texts, as well as in assessing agency action in light those statutes and regulations. It further argues that consistent application of the \"clear evidence\" standard is crucial in pharmaceutical product liability litigation, and judges are more likely than juries to apply the standard consistently from case to case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    \u00b6 62 Merck relies principally on the case of\n    <em>\n     Markman v.

For the reasons discussed above, we believe the nature of the fact-finding called for under the\n    <em>\n     Wyeth\n    </em>\n    inquiry as the parties presented it to the trial court goes far beyond the kind of preliminary factfinding that a judge performs in resolving personal jurisdiction and choice-of-law disputes. It requires much more extensive and substantive fact-finding appropriately decided after a full trial, and thus the jury should be the appropriate fact-finder. We thus reject Merck's arguments that reasons of judicial competence or the need for uniformity provide a basis for holding that the judge should make the factual determinations involved in the\n    <em>\n     Wyeth\n    </em>\n    inquiry.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    \u00b6 65 CONCLUSION\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    \u00b6 66 For the foregoing reasons, our answer to the certified question is that a jury should resolve the issue of whether a defendant drug manufacturer has presented \"clear evidence\" that the FDA would not have permitted the manufacturer to include in a drug's labeling the warning alleged to be necessary by the plaintiffs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    \u00b6 67 Certified question answered.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Justices Howse and Cobbs concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-100\">\n     Both the Seventh Circuit and the Tenth Circuit have acknowledged the decision reached by the Third Circuit in the\n     <em>\n      Fosamax\n     </em>\n     case, but neither court needed to resolve the issue to decide the case before it.\n     <em>\n      Dolin v.

The California Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's judgment on other grounds, and in doing so it declined to address the issue of whether the\n     <em>\n      Wyeth\n     </em>\n     inquiry presents a question to be decided by a judge or jury.\n     <em>\n      Rotondo v.
