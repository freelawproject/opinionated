L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10, contains identical language).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The father first argues that the record does not support the judge's findings regarding the father's abusive conduct. We disagree. The record here amply supports the judge's finding of a \"serious incident of abuse.\" G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   ). Both the father and the mother's testimony substantiated the judge's finding that on March 30, 2014, the father picked up the parties' one year old daughter, who was crying, and physically blocked her from turning her head to look at the mother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge found, based on the father's testimony, that the father did so because he felt that he \"wasn't getting enough space with [his] daughter,\" and wanted her to see that \"it was ok\" for the father to \"deal with\" her. Additionally, the judge found, based on both parties' testimony, that the father \"smacked [the daughter] under the chin so hard that her head snapped backward.\" The judge found that the father then \"put [his daughter] on the floor and pinned her feet under his legs and her hands under his feet.\" This finding was corroborated by both parents' testimony. The judge credited the mother's testimony that the father told the mother that \"babies are like horses, they need to be broken.\" In addition, the judge implicitly credited the mother's testimony when the judge found that the father put his \"legs over [his daughter's] chest making it difficult for her to breath[e],\" but stopped and \"threw [her] down on the bed,\" after the mother began filming him with her cell phone. Both the father's testimony -- and a certified copy of a conviction introduced at trial -- reinforced the judge's finding that, based on this incident, the father pleaded guilty to assault and battery of the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Given these facts, the judge did not err in concluding that the father's actions on March 30, 2014, constituted \"a serious incident of abuse\" as defined by G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   ), because the judge found that the father \"attempt[ed] to cause serious bodily injury\" to his daughter \"by striking her so hard in the chin that her head snapped backward and by pinning her on the floor under his legs such that it was difficult for her to breath[e].\" This finding created \"a rebuttable presumption\" that it was not in the daughter's best interest \"to be placed in sole custody, shared legal custody, or shared physical custody with\" the father. G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   ). As discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the father did little to rebut this presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Parenting abilities\n   </em>\n   . The father contends that when evaluating the children's best interests, the judge unfairly disregarded the father's evidence of his efforts to improve his parenting skills. On the contrary, the judge explicitly found that the father had completed a batterer's program, a nurturing father's group program, participated in counselling, and took steps \"to improve and enrich his parenting skills.\" Nevertheless, the judge weighed the father's progress against evidence of the father's inability to prioritize his children's needs. Specifically, the judge found that when attempting to explain his abusive actions of March 30, 2014, \"[a]t no point ... did father discuss [his daughter's needs], he only discussed his needs.\" The judge found that the father \"admitted that he put both of his legs over [his daughter's] body and that he held her hands down.\" The judge found that the father sought to justify this act by saying: \"I wanted to focus on the fact that I wanted to bond with her.\" The judge found that \"[a]t no point in his recitation of the events did father discuss [his daughter's] ability to regulate her conduct.\" The judge found that the father did not take responsibility for his actions on March 30, 2014, and that the \"father does not believe his behavior was abusive.\" The judge concluded, based on testimony from both the father and the facilitator for the nurturing father's group, that the \"father blamed the mother for his arrest\" for the March 30, 2014 incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the issue of visitation, the judge concluded that it would not be in the children's best interest to have unsupervised parenting time with the father because both children were \"too young to effectively communicate their needs or feelings.\" The judge endeavored to balance the father's desire for visitation and the children's welfare by ordering supervised visitation, reasoning that supervised visitation would both \"ensure[ ] the safety of the children and provide[ ] the best opportunity for [the] father and children to develop a strong bond.\" These findings and conclusions were well within her discretion.

The judge found, based on testimony from the son's early intervention counsellor and a Department of Children and Families (department) case manager that the mother was meeting the children's needs; keeping a clean, appropriate home; complying with her department service plan; undergoing substance abuse treatment; meeting with her department case manager on a monthly basis; and engaging her son in early intervention services. In addition, the judge found that neither the case manager nor the early intervention counsellor had concerns with the mother's parenting abilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Finally, the father argues that the judge erred in awarding the mother sole legal and physical custody of the children because the father and mother had a past history of successful coparenting. We find the father's contention unavailing. Judges may shift custodial arrangements in order to effectively promote the child's interests.

Here, the record strongly supported the judge's finding that the parties could not successfully share legal or physical custody of the children. Significantly, the judge found that the parties had been unable to coparent between 2011 and 2014, due to tension caused by various life events and diverging views of the children's needs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270270\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/458/540/#p547\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270270\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/458/540/#p547\">\n    . at 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
