Here, the discussion of the Jello shot would not have been important evidence in light of the other compelling evidence of the defendant's intoxication. The defendant gave inconsistent statements regarding the amount of alcohol he had consumed and \"kept flipflopping between saying he had nothing to drink and admitting to drinking alcohol.\" The defendant also exhibited physical signs of intoxication, such as bloodshot and glassy eyes and a strong odor of alcohol coming from his person. Moreover, the defendant's performance on field sobriety tests suggested that the defendant was intoxicated. The defendant swayed and used his arms for balance and struggled to perform the one-legged-stand test and the walk-and-turn test as instructed. In light of the compelling evidence of intoxication, we are satisfied that any error with regard to this potential evidence did not influence the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Jury instruction on the defendant's election not to testify\n   </em>\n   . The defendant asked for an instruction regarding the defendant's election not to testify, and the judge stated that he would give such an instruction. When the judge failed to give such an instruction, however, the defendant did not object. Accordingly, we review for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.

In his remarks to the venire, the trial judge communicated the defendant's right not to testify, stating \"there is no burden on a defendant\" and a defendant \"does not have to testify or present evidence.\" The trial judge further informed the venire that, \"[i]f a defendant remains silent, the jury may not use it against him in deciding the case.\" In the judge's preliminary instructions during trial, he explained the presumption of innocence by stating that \"[t]he law does not require the defendant to prove his innocence or to produce any evidence.\" He reiterated this in his final charge by instructing that \"[t]he defendant is not required to call any witnesses or produce any evidence, since he is presumed to be innocent.\" These instructions adequately conveyed the impropriety of an adverse inference such that we can discern no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.
