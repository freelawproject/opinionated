(Fair Port), appeals from a Superior Court judgment. He argues that the judge erred in allowing the defendants' motions for summary judgment and abused her discretion by denying his motion to amend the complaint and striking his reply briefs. The lawsuit arises out of defendant Maxim Avraamov's embezzlement of money and other property from Fair Port. Because the claims against Avraamov for breach of contract and the claims arising from those breaches -- breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, constructive trust, and restitution -- and the claim of violation of G. L. c. 93A state injuries to the plaintiff personally, we reverse the judgment as to those counts. We affirm the remainder of the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n   . \"Summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Caira\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zurich Am.

Here, many of the plaintiff's claims against Avraamov and his wife, defendant Oleysa Avraamova, are premised on wrongs Avraamov committed against Fair Port. For these claims, the plaintiff cannot properly bring a direct suit against Avraamov and Avraamova because it is Fair Port, not the plaintiff, that suffered the harm and would receive the benefit of any recovery. See\n   <em>\n    Culverhouse\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Paulson &amp; Co\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6814756\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/133/195/#p198\">\n    133 A.3d 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 198-199 (Del. 2016). Avraamov wrote and cashed at least forty fraudulent checks, all charged to Fair Port, totaling $ 47,362. Avraamov also deposited checks into a bank account that he had surreptitiously created, rather than depositing the money into Fair Port's account. Avraamov deposited at least seventeen checks into this secret account, stealing approximately $ 59,440.90. The plaintiff's claims against Avraamov for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, deceit, and negligent misrepresentation, and his claims against Avraamov and Avraamova for money had and received all are premised on these thefts from Fair Port. Despite the plaintiff's ownership of Fair Port and his contractual claim to the first $ 200,000 of Fair Port's profits, the fact remains that Avraamov stole from Fair Port, not from the plaintiff, and Fair Port, not the plaintiff, would be entitled to repayment.

Prior to buying Avraamov's interest in Fair Port, the plaintiff and Merk entered into an agreement with Avraamov that he would transfer to the plaintiff the titles of eight trailers that the plaintiff and Avraamov held jointly, as well as registrations and related documents for two tractors that were held in the plaintiff's name, but were still in Avraamov's possession. Because these assets and documents were to be transferred to the plaintiff, not Fair Port, the plaintiff has raised a genuine issue whether Avraamov breached a contractual duty to the plaintiff personally to transfer the vehicles and related papers to him. See\n   <em>\n    Donahue\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Draper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3988733\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/22/30/#p41\">\n    22 Mass.

Accordingly, summary judgment should not have been granted on this contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff's claims of breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and restitution arise from the plaintiff's personal contract claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in every contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Savings Bank Life Ins.

Because the plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Avraamov breached the contract to form Fair Port by embezzling money from Fair Port, the plaintiff's claim of breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing survives summary judgment.
