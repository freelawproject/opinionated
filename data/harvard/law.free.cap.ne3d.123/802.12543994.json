Bigelow, appeals from a postforeclosure judgment for possession issued by the Housing Court in favor of the plaintiff, Reem Property, LLC (Reem Property). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . Bigelow granted a mortgage to World Savings Bank, FSB on real property located at 33 Whiting Road in Oxford (property). World Savings Bank, FSB later became known as Wachovia Mortgage, FSB (Wachovia) and subsequently merged into Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo). When Bigelow defaulted on his mortgage, Wells Fargo initiated foreclosure proceedings through its attorneys and notice was posted in a local newspaper. At the foreclosure sale, Reem Property was the highest bidder and obtained a foreclosure deed. The foreclosure deed was recorded with an affidavit of sale, containing the dates of publication and a statement of the affiant that the sale complied with G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 14. Thereafter, Reem Property served Bigelow with a notice to quit and vacate, which he did not comply with. Accordingly, Reem Property served Bigelow with a summary process summons and complaint pursuant to G. L. c. 239, \u00a7 1. Bigelow answered the complaint, denying that he was unlawfully occupying the property and alleging that Reem Property did not have any rights associated with the property. Reem Property filed a motion for summary judgment, which was allowed following a hearing. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n   .

Bigelow challenges the validity of the foreclosure of the property and Reem Property's title to the property. In postforeclosure summary process cases, \"the plaintiff is required to make a prima facie showing that it obtained a deed to the property at issue and that the deed and affidavit of sale, showing compliance with statutory foreclosure requirements, were recorded.\"\n   <em>\n    Bank of N.Y\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4271897\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/460/327/#p334\">\n    460 Mass. 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 334 (2011).

Where these documents meet the requirements of G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 15, it is \"incumbent on a defendant to counter with his own affidavit or acceptable alternative demonstrating at least the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685152\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/635/#p642\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685152\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/635/#p642\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \"[P]roof that the title was acquired strictly according to the power of sale provided in the mortgage ... is subject to challenge.

Nonetheless, Bigelow argues that the foreclosure sale is void because the attorneys and the auctioneer lacked the authority to conduct the sale and because Wells Fargo was not the mortgagee by merger. Although it is true that \"[a]ny effort to foreclose by a party lacking jurisdiction and authority to carry out a foreclosure under [ G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 21, and G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 14,] is void,\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ibanez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269799\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/458/637/#p647\">\n    458 Mass. 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 647 (2011) (\n   <em>\n    Ibanez\n   </em>\n   ), here, the affidavits filed with the motion for summary judgment sufficiently state that the law firm retained by Wells Fargo was given the power of attorney, and had the proper authority to conduct the sale. Bigelow has not offered his own affidavit or other evidence to counter this. Accordingly, Bigelow's argument that the auctioneer was not a proper agent because it was hired by the foreclosure attorney on behalf of Wells Fargo, is also without merit. See G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 21.
