The trial court overruled the motion without a hearing, determining that Parker had failed to rebut the presumption of proper service and that laches applied. In three assignments of error, Parker argues the trial court erred by overruling his motion. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand for an evidentiary hearing on Parker's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background Facts and Procedure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In May 1999, the Altmans filed a complaint against Parker for personal injuries and property damage resulting from a motor vehicle accident. The complaint was sent by certified mail to 4232 Lowry Avenue, Norwood, Ohio, the address listed on the complaint. The certified mail was returned unclaimed, but ordinary mail service to the same address was never returned. Parker failed to file a responsive pleading, and the Altmans obtained a default judgment against him in August 1999. In April 2011, the Altmans revived the judgment and began garnishing Parker's wages. Parker did not appeal from the revivor order, which was sent to him at a Kentucky address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In June 2017, Parker moved to set aside the 1999 default judgment for lack of service, claiming the judgment was void. He additionally requested the dismissal of the complaint, on the ground that the claims were time barred, and the return of all monies he had paid in the action. Parker submitted materials in support of his motion, including his own affidavit asserting that he had not received service of process in 1999 and had not lived at the Lowry address since 1986. In his deposition testimony, Parker explained that he had been raised by his grandparents until the age of 17 at the Lowry address, where his grandmother still resides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The Altmans opposed the motion and requested a hearing to present evidence to rebut Parker's claim of defective service. They argued also that Parker's attempt to vacate the judgment was\n   barred by laches. The trial court denied the motion without holding a hearing, determining that Parker had failed to rebut the presumption of proper service and that his motion was barred by laches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Parker now appeals, raising three assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In his second and third assignments of error, which we address first, Parker maintains that the 1999 default judgment is void for failure of service, and that the trial court erred by overruling his motion to set aside that judgment. Ordinarily, we review a trial court's decision on a common-law motion to set aside a void judgment under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    Terwoord v.

Civ.R. 4.1 and 4.4. Here, the Altmans used the certified mail method of service, and when the certified mail service was returned unclaimed, filed a written request for ordinary mail service to the same address. When that ordinary mail envelope was never returned, the Altmans completed service as contemplated by Civ.R. 4.6(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Parker moved the trial court to set aside the allegedly void judgment on the grounds that his own affidavit asserting that he had not received service, and other materials supporting that assertion, sufficiently rebutted the presumption of service. On appeal, he maintains that his materials were sufficient to rebut the presumption of receipt, and argues the trial court was required to grant his motion because the Altmans failed to present \"evidentiary quality\" materials to contradict his assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In support for this argument, Parker cites\n   <em>\n    Rafalski v.

The\n   <em>\n    Rafalski\n   </em>\n   court held that when a defendant seeking to vacate an allegedly void judgment for defective service makes \"an uncontradicted sworn statement that she never received service of a complaint, she is entitled to have the judgment against her vacated even if her opponent complied with Civ.R. 4.6 and had service made at an address where it could reasonably be anticipated that the defendant would receive it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66-67,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=477%20N.E.2d%201212\">\n    477 N.E.2d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} This court, however, has not followed\n   <em>\n    Rafalski\n   </em>\n   .

An evidentiary hearing is additionally warranted in this case because the Altmans requested one so that they could present evidence rebutting Parker's assertion of defective service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On remand, the trial court shall hold a hearing that will allow it to appropriately access Parker's credibility and the persuasiveness of his evidence and any evidence the Altmans present.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} For these reasons, we sustain Parker's second and third assignments of error in part and overrule them in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In his first assignment of error, Parker attacks the order granting the revivor, arguing that it too is void, but for a different reason. We lack jurisdiction, however, to review any assignment of error related to the revivor order, which became final and appealable in 2011. To invoke this court's jurisdiction to review a final order, a party must timely appeal from that order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 3(A). Parker did not list the 2011 order on the notice of appeal filed in this case, and that notice of appeal was filed long after the 30-day deadline set forth by App.R. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Although we cannot reach the merits of Parker's first assignment of error, we note that if the default judgment is determined to be void for lack of personal jurisdiction, all orders arising out of that judgment, including the revivor order, are also a nullity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The trial court erred by overruling Parker's motion to set aside the allegedly void 1999 default judgment, because laches does not bar a movant from seeking relief from a void judgment, and the court was prohibited from making a credibility determination without first holding an evidentiary hearing to assess the credibility of Parker's unrebutted assertion that he had not received service of the Altmans' complaint. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with the law and this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Judgment reversed and cause remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mock, P.J., and Deters, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Notwithstanding this request, the Altmans assert in their brief that the parties waived a formal hearing.
