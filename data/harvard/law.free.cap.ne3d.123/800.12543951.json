The plaintiffs contend that the judge erred by 1) finding that the carriage house on the property did not lose its protections as a prior nonconforming use as a residence; and 2) in upholding the particular manner in which the board calculated the size of the reconstructed residence that the defendants would be allowed to build.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Continuous nonconforming use\n   </em>\n   . The plaintiffs contend that the judge erred as a matter of fact and law in finding that the carriage house was continuously used as a residence since before 1928. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   A judge's findings from a bench trial must stand unless clearly erroneous, Mass. R. Civ.

And, we review \"determinations of law, including interpretations of zoning bylaws, de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Doherty\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Planning Bd. of Scituate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317724\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/467/560/#p567\">\n    467 Mass. 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 567 (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Under the Concord zoning bylaw \u00a7 7.1.6, \"[a] nonconforming use or structure which has been abandoned, or not used for a period of two years, shall lose its protected status and be subject to all of the provisions of this zoning bylaw.\" Although the bylaws define \"abandonment,\" they do not define \"nonuse.\" Generally, nonuse of a nonconforming dwelling requires both vacancy and the lack of any attempt to rent, sell, or maintain the dwelling. See\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Appeals of Lakeville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3992577\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/23/664/#p665\">\n    23 Mass. App. Ct. 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 665-666 (1987) (apartments vacant, unmaintained, and not advertised for ten years lost protection for prior nonconforming use).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Here, the carriage house is a nonconforming structure that predates the promulgation of the Concord zoning bylaws in 1928. The judge found that it has been occupied as a residence since before 1928 with only a nineteen-month gap from 1998 to 2000. The record supports the judge's findings and the town census, which lists the residents of the carriage house with only some reasonably explainable gaps in time, is not inconsistent, as Nicholas Boynton, who owned the property from 2003 until 2014, testified that the town both knew of the residential use of the carriage house and considered it a rental unit long before his ownership. Further, there was testimony that the gaps in the census do not necessarily reflect that no one resided at the property but rather that its residents could have failed to return a completed census form. On this record, we discern no clear error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The judge also ruled as a matter of law that, even if the gap in occupancy was longer than nineteen months, it did not qualify as nonuse since the evidence showed that the owners maintained and held out the carriage house as residential rental space. Both\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   and the evidence before the judge support this determination. Specifically, Michael Bushnell, who rented the carriage house from 1993 to 1998, testified that the then owner periodically asked him to do repairs on the carriage house after 1998 to maintain it as a residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Gross floor area calculation\n   </em>\n   . The plaintiffs next contend that the ground floor of the carriage house should not count toward its gross floor area for purposes of Concord zoning bylaw \u00a7 7.1.5 because it was never part of the prior nonconforming use as a residence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"We accord deference to a local board's reasonable interpretation of its own zoning bylaw ... with the caveat that an 'incorrect interpretation of a statute ... is not entitled to deference.' \"\n   <em>\n    Doherty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317724\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/467/560/#p567\">\n    467 Mass. at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Shirley Wayside Ltd.

Section 1.3.12, which does not differentiate floor area based on use but merely ceiling height, reasonably supports the board's interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Canton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of the Massachusetts Highway Dep't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665204\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/455/783/#p794\">\n    455 Mass. 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 794 (2014), quoting\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Superior Court Dep't of the Trial Court for the County of Worcester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783237\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/446/123/#p126\">\n    446 Mass. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126 (2006) (\"We do not read into [a] statute a provision which the [legislative body] did not see fit to put there, nor add words that the [legislative body] had an option to, but chose not to include\"). Accordingly, even if another interpretation is equally availing, where the board's interpretation finds reasonable support in the bylaws, we owe it deference. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Falmouth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Civil Serv.

The parties do not dispute that the board's interpretation of its bylaws means the proposed reconstruction of the carriage house would increase the gross floor area by forty-nine percent -- slightly below the fifty percent threshold which prompts the special permit requirement.
