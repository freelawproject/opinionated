Disc. R. 23, Section 11.1(b),\" requesting that Respondent be suspended immediately from the practice of law in this State, pending further order of this Court or final resolution of any resulting disciplinary action, due to alleged misconduct that may cause Respondent's continued practice of law during the pendency of a disciplinary investigation or proceeding to pose a substantial threat of harm to the public, clients, potential clients, or the administration of justice.
