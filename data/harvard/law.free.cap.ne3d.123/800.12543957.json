She challenges the Juvenile Court's jurisdiction to enter a permanent order concerning the child's welfare because the child had not resided within the Commonwealth for at least six months prior to commencement of the proceedings. The mother also takes exception with the judge's failure to order posttermination visitation but, with the exception of the jurisdictional challenge previously noted, she does not challenge the judge's finding of unfitness or the termination of her parental rights. We conclude that the Juvenile Court lacked jurisdiction over the child and the judge failed to take the necessary steps under G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ), to secure jurisdiction prior to entry of the decree, which is a permanent order. We accordingly vacate the decree and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . \"A Massachusetts court's exercise of jurisdiction over custody determinations must be based solely on\" one of the four bases provided by G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    MacDougall\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Acres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310215\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/363/#p366\">\n    427 Mass. 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 366 (1998). Here, the trial judge made no jurisdictional findings pursuant to G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) (3) or (4), and neither \u00a7 2 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) (1) or (2) favors Massachusetts in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   General Laws c. 209B, \u00a7 2 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) (1), confers jurisdiction to the courts in a child's \"home state,\" which is defined as \"the state in which the child immediately preceding the date of commencement of the custody proceeding resided with ... a parent, ... for at least 6 consecutive months.\" G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The mother and the child lived in California from December, 2009, until mid-February, 2014, and the Department of Children and Families (DCF) commenced these proceedings on April 28, 2014, when the child had resided in Massachusetts for approximately two months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, California is the child's home state under \u00a7 2 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) (1), with jurisdiction over the child. It follows that \u00a7 2 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) (2) does not confer jurisdiction over the child on Massachusetts, as it requires \"that it appear[ ] that no other state would have jurisdiction under [ \u00a7 2 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) ] (1),\" and it is clear that jurisdiction over the child under that provision lies with the State of California, where the mother and the child resided for over six months before traveling to Massachusetts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   That said, the trial judge could have attempted to obtain jurisdiction to enter permanent orders pursuant to G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) (3), after the assertion of temporary emergency jurisdiction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   by determining whether California \"has declined to exercise jurisdiction, has stayed its proceedings or has otherwise deferred to the jurisdiction of a court of the commonwealth.\" The trial judge also could have attempted to obtain permanent jurisdiction under \u00a7 2 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) (4), which, as applicable to this case, requires that \"(i) ... another state has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that the commonwealth is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child, and (ii) it is in the best interest of the child that a court of the commonwealth assume jurisdiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A State declines to exercise jurisdiction when a court of competent authority communicates that declination. See\n   <em>\n    MacDougall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310215\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/363/#p366\">\n    427 Mass. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   369 &amp; n.7 (Louisiana judge wrote to Probate and Family Court, refusing to decline jurisdiction under G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2 [\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ] [4] ). There is no evidence of any such communication here. Nevertheless, DCF asserts California met the statutory criteria of declination when its child welfare agency declined to take action on two requests from DCF to place the child with the mother in California pursuant to the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children. We are not persuaded. DCF has not identified any statutory or precedential authority, nor are we aware of any, which confers to the child welfare agency of a State the authority to decline jurisdiction for the courts of that State. That authority rests solely with a State court of competent jurisdiction. See\n   <em>\n    MacDougall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310215\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/363/#p366\">\n    427 Mass. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   369 &amp; n.7. Because there is no evidence in this case, either by way of a letter or other form of communication, that a court in the State of California has either declined jurisdiction or affirmatively conferred jurisdiction on Massachusetts, the judge here lacked jurisdiction to enter any permanent orders pertaining to the child. Accordingly, we vacate the decree.

Because we have no reason to believe that the State of California is prohibited from assenting to jurisdiction nunc pro tunc, we retain jurisdiction over this matter until the state of California has spoken.

Accordingly, we remand this case to the trial judge to determine within thirty days, and report back to this court, whether a court of competent jurisdiction in California declines or asserts jurisdiction in this case. We do not dictate how the trial judge should do this, but we note that \u00a7 110 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, the successor to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, pertains to this type of communication between courts.

L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) (4), she must also determine whether \"it is in the best interest of the child that a court of the commonwealth assume jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203410\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203410\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n   .
