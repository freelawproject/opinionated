We explained the procedural history in the prior case:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} \"In 2005, [Fred] Harris contacted Rossi to pursue an action on behalf of Forest Glen Properties, LLC against the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. [Rossi] filed the action in the federal court of claims on behalf of Forest Glen Properties, LLC. The case was ultimately dismissed in 2013 based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Harris was not a party plaintiff, but was one of two member owners of Forest. Harris advised Rossi that he wanted to appeal, but the time to appeal had passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} \"In July 2014, Harris and Forest filed a malpractice suit against [Rossi] based on their alleged failure to timely notify appellants of the dismissal and their right to appeal. The malpractice complaint also asserted a breach of fiduciary duty claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} \"[Rossi] moved for summary judgment against Harris only arguing that Harris was not its client, and as such, he had no cause of action. [Rossi] did not argue that Forest lacked capacity to sue in Ohio in its summary judgment motion or in its supplemental motion for summary judgment. [Harris and Forest] eventually responded to the summary judgment motion and subsequently voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice before the trial court addressed the merits of Rossi's motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} \"[Rossi] moved for attorney fees under Civ.R. 11 and R.C. 2323.51. The trial court magistrate held a hearing and awarded attorney fees and costs under R.C. 2323.51 only. She found Harris, Forest and their counsel jointly and severally responsible for Rossi's fees and costs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Harris and Forest refiled their complaint before we issued our decision in the prior appeal, and this appeal arises from the refiled case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Fred Harris and Forest Glen Properties, LLC refiled their complaint in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas in April of 2016 alleging legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary duties, and breach of contract. The refiled case was transferred to the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to Rossi's motion to transfer based on improper venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Following the transfer, Rossi moved the court for an order requiring Harris, Forest, and their attorney to pay costs and expenses associated with its motion to transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} We issued our decision on September 30, 2016 affirming in part and reversing in part the trial court's award of attorney fees in Rossi's favor based on the frivolous conduct of Harris, Forest, and their attorney at the time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Thereafter, in the present case, Fred Harris voluntarily dismissed his claims only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On December 21, 2016, the trial court granted Rossi's request to amend its answer instanter to include the affirmative defense that Forest Glen Properties LLC lacked the legal capacity to file suit in Ohio because its Delaware articles of incorporation had been canceled. This action was also in response to our prior decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Rossi subsequently moved for summary judgment on statute of limitations\n   grounds alleging that Forest's first suit was a nullity because it lacked capacity to file its first lawsuit, and as such, it did not have the one-year right to refile under statute. Accordingly, Rossi claims the statute of limitations ran.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Rossi filed a separate motion for summary judgment arguing that Forest cannot prove its claims because Forest did not identify an expert witness before the expiration of the trial court's expert witness deadline. Thus, without an expert, Rossi claims that Forest cannot show that a breach occurred or that but for Rossi's negligence, Forest would have been successful in its underlying case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On April 19, 2017, the trial court granted summary judgment in Rossi's favor based on Forest's lack of evidence establishing breach and proximate cause and overruled Rossi's motion based on statute of limitations. Both parties appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Forest raises one assigned error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 17} \"The trial court erred by granting Respondents' motion for summary judgment on the basis that: (1) Appellant was required to present expert testimony that an attorney has a duty to preserve a client's appellate rights, and (2) Appellant needed 'further information' other than statements of Respondent Michael D.

It is likewise undisputed\n   that Attorney Rossi and his firm did not receive from the clerk of courts a copy of the dismissal of Forest's complaint against HUD, and as such, it neither appealed nor notified Forest of the dismissal within the time to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In their motion for summary judgment captioned \"proximate cause,\" Rossi relies solely on Forest's lack of an expert and the passage of the trial court's expert deadline. This motion raises two grounds for summary judgment. Rossi argues that absent an expert, Forest cannot establish the standard of care and as such, cannot show that a breach occurred. Rossi also argues that without an expert, Forest cannot establish that it would have been successful on the merits of its appeal from the dismissal of its complaint against HUD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The trial court agreed with both arguments. It granted summary judgment in Rossi's favor, finding Forest lacked evidence establishing standard of care and breach, holding that \"[w]hile Plaintiff summarily asserts that Defendants negligently failed to 'police' the Court of Claims docket, this Court cannot find under these circumstances that Defendants acted negligent as a matter of law, nor could an average juror, without expert testimony, infer that a reasonable attorney in a similar situation would have acted differently than Defendants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 25} As for Rossi's proximate cause argument, the trial court held:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 26} \"[T]here is virtually no information before this Court regarding the underlying case or the likelihood that Plaintiff would have prevailed on appeal. While Plaintiff has submitted a letter in which Defendant Rossi suggested that both he and opposing counsel in the underlying case believed Plaintiff would prevail on at least part of its claim, the letter predates the decision of the Court of Claims, which apparently believed otherwise * * *. Absent further information regarding the underlying case, this Court can find no support for Plaintiff's claim that it would have obtained a better outcome but for Defendants' negligence and thus suffered damages * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 27} \"In order to prove that a defendant breached a legal duty, a plaintiff must first demonstrate the standard of care from which the legal duty arises.\"\n   <em>\n    Brunstetter v.

Forest's claimed damages for each of its claims is the adverse judgment against it, i.e., the dismissal of its complaint against HUD by the federal court of claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Expert testimony is required to support allegations of legal malpractice in most cases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.

However, Rossi confirms that he never received notice from the federal court of claims clerk of the adverse judgment against his client. Instead, Rossi learned about the dismissal of Forest's lawsuit only after checking the court's docket and only after the time during which to appeal had expired. These facts are unchallenged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 31} In response to Rossi's summary judgment motion, Forest provides three reasons why it believes it does not need an expert witness to testify on its behalf. First, Forest claims that an attorney's failure to notify a client within the time to appeal and the failure to timely appeal an adverse judgment within the time to do so, constitutes apparent negligence within the ordinary knowledge of a layperson. Forest also contends that Rossi essentially admitted that his conduct was erroneous, and as such, no expert witness is needed. Finally, Forest argues that Rossi's negligence was so clear to constitute negligence as a matter of law, and as such, no expert was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 32} We disagree with Forest's contention that Rossi admitted that his conduct was erroneous, and as such, it did not need an expert to establish the applicable standard of care and subsequent breach. Contrary to Forest's argument, Attorney Rossi testified that he did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   commit malpractice. He stated on cross-examination:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 33} \"Q You did testify that you believed that there was no malpractice committed?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 34} \"A That is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 35} \"* * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 36} \"A The complaint was dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 37} \"* * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 38} \"Q Okay.

The clerk never sent me the final judgment notice. I didn't know it was dismissed probably for months. * * * And then I thought, * * * the appeal time runs when you're notified of the case disposition. And sure enough, there's a rule in the Court of Claims that says no, that's no defense. So that when I realized that it couldn't be appealed * * *.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 44} \"* * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 45} \"Q Mr. Rossi, did you ever refer to the docket throughout the case?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 46} \"* * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 47} \"Q There must have been some type of electronic docket to refer to.

Rossi likewise did not state that his conduct fell below the applicable standard of care for an attorney in his situation. Thus, Forest's contention that it established the applicable standard of care and breach via Rossi's admission lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Notwithstanding, we agree with Forest's third contention that Rossi's alleged negligence was so clear to constitute negligence as a matter of law, and as such, no expert was required to establish the applicable standard of care and breach.

Thus,\n   <em>\n    the theory of this malpractice case places the merits of the underlying litigation directly at issue\n   </em>\n   because it stands to reason that in order to prove causation and damages, appellees must establish that appellant's actions resulted in settling the case for less than appellees would have received had the matter gone to trial.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 64} As stated, each of Forest's claims stem from Rossi's failure to notify Forest about the dismissal of its complaint by the federal court of claims, or its failure to timely appeal the dismissal. Forest's claimed damages for each of its claims is\n   the adverse judgment against it. As in\n   <em>\n    Environmental Network,\n   </em>\n   the theory of Forest's malpractice against Rossi depends on the merits of its appeal as well as the merits of the underlying claim against HUD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Notwithstanding, Forest did not intend to present an independent expert witness to establish the merits of its appeal from the dismissal or to show the underlying merits of its court of claims case against HUD. Instead, Forest relied solely on a letter drafted by Attorney Rossi to Forest in August of 2008 in which Rossi sets forth his opinion regarding the merits of the underlying claims. Rossi details a discussion with the attorney representing HUD and their unofficial \"agreement\" as to the merits of Forest's claims. It states in part,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 66} \"We agreed in part that the Court would probably find in our favor on the first period and against us on the third period. Regarding the second period, I submitted that HUD offered the Receivers a contract and that, despite the absence of a signed contract, the Receivers performed, i.e., the housing was provided. [Attorney] McGriff countered that we never certified our applications for payment, a contract condition; that we weren't even close to meeting HUD's already-low standards of living; and that such constituted a material breach of our presumed contract, thereby excusing HUD's performance thereunder.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 67} Thus, Forest intends to use Rossi to testify to establish the merits of Forest's claims, thereby eliminating the need for an independent expert of its own. As Forest argues, we agree that this letter coupled with Rossi's testimony is some evidence creating a genuine issue of fact as to the merits of Forest's underlying claim against HUD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 68} However, Forest fails to direct the trial court or this court to any evidence in the record showing it would have been successful in its appeal from dismissal by the court of claims. Absent evidence showing that Forest's appeal from the dismissal of its claims against HUD had merit, the potential success of its underlying claims against HUD are of no consequence. Accordingly, summary judgment was properly entered in Rossi's favor as a matter of law. Forest's sole assigned error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 69} Rossi asserts two assignments of error in their cross-appeal:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 70} \"[1.] The trial court erred in denying appellee-cross-appellants' motion for attorney fees as sanctions under R.C. 2323.51(A)(II) and (III) and Ohio Civ.R. 3(C) based upon appellant intentionally refiling a legal malpractice action in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, a place of improper venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 71} \"[2.] The trial court erred in denying appellees-cross-appellants motion for summary judgment on the basis that appellants' claims were barred by 2305.11(A).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Because we find that summary judgment was proper under Forest's sole assigned error, Rossi's second assigned error that alleges that summary judgment was warranted on an alternative basis is moot.

The refiled case was eventually transferred to the Trumbull County Court of\n   Common Pleas on May 13, 2016 following Rossi's motion to transfer based on improper venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 85} Rossi then moved the trial court for an order requiring Harris, Forest, and their attorney to pay costs and expenses associated with Rossi's motion to transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 86} At the hearing, Rossi established that the instant action was refiled in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, which is none of the counties identified in Civ.R. 3(B)(1)-(11) as the proper venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 87} The testimony at the motion for sanctions hearing reveals that Forest and Fred Harris had different counsel in their prior case and appeal, and that Attorney Antonio Nicholson represented them at the time the case was refiled. Nicholson testified that he was aware that the lawsuit he was filing was a refiled lawsuit that had previously been pending in Trumbull County, Ohio. And at the time of his refiling the complaint in Cuyahoga County, Nicholson was aware that the defendant resided in and had his principal place of business in Trumbull County. In response to discovery, Nicholson advised that he refiled the suit in Cuyahoga County for the plaintiff's convenience since Harris lived there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 88} However, Nicholson testified that the alleged malpractice that forms the basis for Forest's complaint arose via a lawsuit that was filed and dismissed by a federal court in Cuyahoga County. Nicholson explained that the malpractice occurred in Cuyahoga County because that was where Rossi failed to file the appeal. But upon being advised that the United States Court of Federal Claims is located in Washington, D.C., Nicholson retracted his statement that the HUD complaint had been filed and dismissed in a Cuyahoga County federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 89} Thereafter, Nicholson still felt that filing suit in Cuyahoga County was acceptable since Fred Harris signed the attorney-client representation agreement in Cuyahoga County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 90} Based on the foregoing, we find competent, credible evidence supporting the trial court's decision finding that Forest did not refile the suit in Cuyahoga County \"merely to harass or maliciously injure\" or for \"another improper purpose, including, but not limited to, causing unnecessary delay or a needless increase in the cost of litigation.\" R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(i). Moreover, because improper venue is an affirmative defense that is waived if not raised, we are reluctant to find that even the intentional filing of a complaint in the wrong venue constitutes frivolous conduct. Civ.R. 12(H)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 91} In light of its no frivolous conduct finding, the trial court's decision not to award sanctions comports with reason and the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 92} Rossi also argues that the trial court erred in holding that Rossi should have sought its fees and costs from the transferor court, the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. As Rossi contends, the magistrate alternatively concludes that Rossi should have sought its costs and attorney fees from the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, and that it declines to extend R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11 to cover Rossi's allegations. The magistrate cites\n   <em>\n    Welfare Fin. Corp. v. Burd,\n   </em>\n   4th Dist. Lawrence No. 1410,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1980%20WL%20351070\">\n    1980 WL 351070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *1 (Aug. 6, 1980), for the proposition that Civ.R. 3(C)(2) authorizes only the transferor court, not the transferee court, to award costs and attorney fees following a motion to transfer based on improper venue. Because Rossi did not move for fees under Civ.R. 3(C), the trial court's findings are inconsequential dicta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 93} Notwithstanding, Civ.R. 3(C)(2) states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 94} \"When an action is transferred to a county which is proper, the court may assess costs, including reasonable attorney fees, to the time of transfer against the party who commenced the action in a county other than stated to be proper in division (B) of this rule.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 95} We agree with Rossi's argument that a plain reading of Civ.R. 3(C)(2) permits either the transferee or transferor court to assess fees and costs. This finding is consistent with the Tenth District Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Paul v.

Thus, the trial court erred as a matter of law upon finding that Rossi could not recover fees from it under Civ.R. 3, but instead should have sought its fees and costs from the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 96} However, Rossi's motion sought sanctions under Civ.R. 11 or R.C. 2323.51 as sanctions for frivolous conduct. For reasons unbeknownst, they did not move for fees under Civ.R. 3(C)(2) and this issue is waived.\n   <em>\n    Quick v. Jenkins,\n   </em>\n   7th Dist.

Thus, the trial court's erroneous holding that Civ.R. 3(C)(2) provided Rossi an avenue of relief\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   in Cuyahoga County was of no consequence and did not result in prejudice. And because its decision finding no frivolous conduct is supported by competent, credible evidence and not an abuse of discretion, Rossi's first assigned error lacks merit and is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 97} The trial court's decisions are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   CYNTHIA WESTCOTT RICE, J.,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   COLLEEN MARY O'TOOLE, J.,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
