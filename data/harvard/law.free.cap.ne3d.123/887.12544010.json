Because Kesterson\n   has not shown that she is entitled to additional records beyond those that she has already received pursuant to her request, we deny the writ. We award Kesterson statutory damages in the amount of $1,000 and attorney fees, but deny court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 2}\n   </strong>\n   On February 2, 2016, by e-mail and certified mail, Kesterson sent a public-records request to Kent State, seeking three categories of records:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-10\">\n   1. All personnel records, including records of training and discipline, for the following individuals: Karen Linder, Eric Oakley, Jessica Toocheck, Erin Barton, and Joel Nielsen;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-11\">\n   2. All records regarding training or information provided to the Kent State varsity softball team regarding Title IX [ 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. ], gender equity, sexual harassment, sexual assault, Sexual and Relationship Violence Support Services, or the University's policies or procedures for reporting instances of gender-based harassment or sexual assault (from the 2012-13 academic year to the present); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   3. All records regarding student-athlete reviews of Coach Karen Linder from the 2010-11 academic year until her resignation in August 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 3}\n   </strong>\n   On February 3, 2016, Kent State acknowledged the request and stated that records were being identified and gathered. Kesterson sent multiple follow-up requests that month, and on February 24, Kent State provided her with redacted personnel files for each of the five identified individuals and a student-athlete handbook. The following day, Kent State sent redacted summaries of student-athlete reviews of softball coach Karen Linder, bringing the total amount of documents provided to Kesterson to more than 750 pages of records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 4}\n   </strong>\n   After receiving the documents, Kesterson contacted Kent State to question its response and to request legal authority for the redactions. On March 2, she wrote to Kent State raising additional concerns, including its failure to provide the originals of the student-athlete reviews and records of sexual-assault training.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 5}\n   </strong>\n   Kent State responded with a letter on March 14 and provided additional records, including Linder's 2008 and 2011 employment contracts. At that time, Kent State also gave Kesterson an undated memorandum from Loretta Shields, executive director of benefits and compliance, to the equal-employment/affirmative-action coordinator, Erin Barton, regarding Barton's \"excessive use of accrued sick/vacation leave.\" Kent State explained to Kesterson that the originals of the student-athlete reviews had been destroyed, pursuant to the university's records-retention\n   policy, after the summaries were created. With respect to Kesterson's request for training regarding Title IX, sexual assault, sexual harassment, and other related matters, Kent State responded, \"You were provided with the student [athlete] handbook, which is responsive to this request.\" Further, the March 14 letter explained that the school did not \"centrally maintain\" records involving Title IX/sexual-assault\n   \"[t]raining provided to the softball team, specifically and separately from training provided to student-athletes, or even the general student body * * *. Training materials on these issues are kept by the sponsoring departments and organizations, not the softball team.\" It also stated that Kent State did \"not view R.C. 149.43 as requiring an item-by-item list of the grounds for each redaction absent a specific question.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 6}\n   </strong>\n   Kesterson filed her mandamus complaint with this court on April 21, 2016, alleging that Kent State had failed to fully respond to her February 2 request and \"littered the records that were provided with improper redactions\" and that her request \"has been outstanding for 78 days.\" The complaint asks for a \"peremptory writ of mandamus directing Kent State * * * to make responsive public records available promptly and without improper redactions.\" Additionally, it seeks an award of attorney fees, court costs, and \"any other relief available to the firm under R.C. 149.43 * * * and any other relief as is appropriate.\" We referred this case to mediation on August 5, 2016, and Kent State subsequently produced more than 200 additional pages of records through November of 2016, including presentations provided to \"all incoming Kent State students\" that addressed sexual harassment and sexual misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 7}\n   </strong>\n   On October 11, 2017, we denied Kent State's motion to dismiss and granted Kesterson an alternative writ setting forth a schedule for the parties to present evidence and file briefs.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12285305,12285331,12285315,12285342\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/150/1449/\">\n    150 Ohio St.3d 1449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12285571,12285583,12285458,12285342,12285471,12285602,12285355,12285485,12285615,12285372,12285502,12285638,12285510,12285390,12285650,12285529,12285409,12285668,12285541,12285557,12285436\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio/2017/8136/\">\n    2017-Ohio-8136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20N.E.3d%20936\">\n    83 N.E.3d 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Those facts, together with its assertion that upon receiving the public-records request in February, DeCaprio contacted \"relevant departments and individuals\" such as\n    Kent State's Human Resources Records, Human Resources Training and Development, and Athletics departments, belie Kent State's argument that it\n    <em>\n     timely\n    </em>\n    provided all responsive records.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 20}\n    </strong>\n    Although Kent State contends that the records it provided in October and November were not responsive to Kesterson's request, and that this production\n    was done merely as a \"courtesy,\" we are not persuaded.
