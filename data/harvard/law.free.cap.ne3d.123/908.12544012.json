INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 1}\n   </strong>\n   This is a workers' compensation case in which appellee Industrial Commission awarded appellee Thomas Trousdale additional compensation for the violation of a specific safety requirement (\"VSSR\") by appellant, Byington Builders, Ltd. (\"Byington Builders\"). Byington Builders asks this court to reverse the Tenth District Court of Appeals' judgment denying its request for a writ of mandamus compelling the commission to vacate its VSSR award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 2}\n   </strong>\n   Byington Builders raises two issues in this appeal: (1) whether the commission abused its discretion by finding that Byington Builders violated a specific safety requirement and (2) whether the commission abused its discretion by failing to find that the proximate cause of Trousdale's injuries was his own \"unilateral negligence.\" We affirm the denial of the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Although aspects of the Tenth District's analysis were flawed, that court reached the correct result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Trousdale's Employment and Injury\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 3}\n   </strong>\n   On September 2, 2011, Trousdale fell from the pitched roof of a two-story apartment building in Sandusky, while working for Byington Builders. Trousdale was an experienced roofer and a union carpenter who had been assigned to install caps at the peak of the roof. On his way to get more caps, Trousdale stepped on some loose shingles midway down the roof, slipped, slid down the surface, went over the edge, fell 22 feet, and hit the ground, landing on his buttocks. He was transported to a hospital by ambulance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 4}\n   </strong>\n   Trousdale filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits. The claim was allowed for compression fracture ; lumbar compression fracture ; buttock, left-hip, and left-elbow contusions; disc protrusion; stenosis; chronic compression deformities of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae; substantial aggravation of pre-existing disc protrusion and of degenerative disc disease ; and severe and chronic major depressive disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Trousdale's VSSR Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 5}\n   </strong>\n   On November 8, 2012, Trousdale filed an application for an additional award for a VSSR. Trousdale claimed that Byington Builders violated specific safety requirements set forth in former Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-3-09(E) (current Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-09, regarding the installation of roofing brackets), which is not at issue in this appeal, and former Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-3-09(F)(1) (current Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-09(F)(1), regarding the installation of catch platforms or a lifeline for pitched roofs).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 6}\n   </strong>\n   Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-09(F)(1) provides, \"On pitched roofs with a rise of four inches in twelve [inches] or greater, sixteen feet or more above ground, and not having a parapet of at least thirty inches in height, catch platforms shall be installed. * * * Safety belts or harnesses attached to a lifeline which is securely fastened to the structure may be used in lieu of a catch platform.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 7}\n   </strong>\n   A staff hearing officer (\"SHO\") for the commission took evidence at a hearing that was held on November 12, 2014. At the hearing, the owner of Byington Builders, Aaron Byington (\"Byington\"), stipulated that the roof from which Trousdale fell had a pitch of 6 inches in 12, was 22 feet above the ground, and had no parapet. Trousdale testified that he thought the pitch was 8 inches in\n   12 but that he could not be certain and that \"[s]ix 12, eight 12 is not very much of a difference by looking.\" It is therefore undisputed that the pitch was at least 6 inches in 12-i.e., that the roof gained 6 inches in height for every 12 inches in length.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Because the pertinent language of the rule has not changed, this opinion will refer to the current code number.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 8}\n    </strong>\n    Trousdale, Byington, and Thomas Mock, Byington Builders' \"lead man\" on the job, all testified that on the day that Trousdale fell, no catch platforms had been installed and no safety belts, harnesses, or lifelines were being used by anyone working on the apartment roof. Byington admitted that he did not require his employees to use safety harnesses and that\n    he was aware that no one was using safety equipment on this job. He testified, \"[A] lot of times when you do have these harnesses and ropes, you trip and fall over it nonstop. And people weren't comfortable-don't get comfortable with them. I've seen more accidents with that. I've had more accidents with them on than I have without them.\" Both Mock and Tyson Pengob, another Byington Builders supervisor, testified that they had never instructed anyone on the job site that using safety equipment was required. The day that Trousdale fell, Mock and Pengob were both working on the roof without any safety equipment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 9}\n    </strong>\n    Trousdale testified that a few days before he fell, another Byington Builders employee fell from the same roof and landed on an apartment balcony. According to Trousdale, Byington Builders made no changes in the use of safety equipment after this incident. Coworker Rodney Clift, a fellow union carpenter, also testified that an employee fell from the roof and landed on a balcony. Byington Builders presented no testimony or other evidence at the hearing disputing the fact that another employee fell from the same roof a few days before Trousdale did.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 10}\n    </strong>\n    The parties presented conflicting testimony about whether any safety harnesses and lifelines were available at the job site. Byington, Mock, and Pengob all testified that they had made Trousdale aware that safety harnesses and lifelines were kept in an equipment trailer that, according to Byington, was located ten feet from the building from which Trousdale fell. By contrast, Trousdale testified that he never saw the trailer or any harnesses, ropes, lanyards, or roofing brackets on the job site and that neither Byington nor any supervisor ever told him that he was required to get safety equipment from a trailer. Clift also testified that he never saw a trailer or any safety equipment at the job site.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Order\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 11}\n    </strong>\n    In the commission's order, mailed on November 20, 2014, the SHO denied Trousdale's VSSR application in part and granted it in part. The SHO found that Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-09(F)(1) applied to the roof from which\n    Trousdale fell, that Byington Builders had violated it, and that the violation was the proximate cause of Trousdale's injuries.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 12}\n    </strong>\n    The SHO resolved the factual dispute regarding the availability of the safety equipment in Byington Builders' favor but found that \"[e]ven when construing the evidence in favor of the Employer, [i.e.,] that the safety equipment was on-site and that the Injured Worker knew of its availability,\" Byington Builders still violated the provision. Mere availability did not suffice, because \"[e]ven assuming safety belts were available, [Ohio Adm.Code] 4123:1-3-09(F)(1) requires that they be 'attached to a lifeline which is securely fastened to the structure' in order to satisfy the requirement of being used 'in lieu of a catch platform.' \" Accordingly, the SHO found that \"the Employer has the option to either install a catch basin [sic: platform] or to fasten a lifeline to the roof so that those wishing to use a safety belt would have something to attach the safety belt to on the structure,\" and \"[t]he employer in the instant case did not install either of those devices.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 13}\n    </strong>\n    The SHO awarded additional compensation in the amount of 40 percent of Trousdale's maximum weekly rate due to this VSSR, finding that the violation was serious and noting that another worker had fallen off the same roof a few days before Trousdale fell.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    <strong>\n     4. Motion for a Rehearing\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 14}\n    </strong>\n    Byington Builders moved for a rehearing, arguing that Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-09(F)(1) must be read in conjunction with Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-03(J)(1) and that under the latter provision, which relates to personal protective equipment, it is the responsibility of the employee, not the employer, to use a safety harness. Byington Builders argued that the proximate cause of Trousdale's injuries was his own \"unilateral negligence\" in failing to use the lifelines that Byington Builders claimed it had made available. It further argued that securely fastening a lifeline to the structure would have done nothing to prevent injury, because workers may have failed to use the available lifeline. A different SHO denied the motion for a rehearing, finding that Byington Builders had not submitted any new and relevant evidence nor shown that the original order was based on an obvious mistake of fact or clear mistake of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      C. Byington Builders' Mandamus Action\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 15}\n    </strong>\n    In April 2015, Byington Builders filed its mandamus complaint asking the Tenth District Court of Appeals to issue a writ directing the commission to vacate its prior decisions and to enter an order denying Trousdale's request for a VSSR award. In support of its claim that the commission abused its discretion, Byington Builders again asserted that it had not violated Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-09(F)(1), because that rule, when read in conjunction with\n    Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-03(J)(1), required it to do no more than make lifelines and safety harnesses available for employees and did not require Byington Builders to affix either catch platforms or lifelines to the building, as the SHO had ruled. Byington Builders again asserted that the proximate cause of Trousdale's injuries was his own unilateral negligence in failing to use available safety harnesses. Byington Builders additionally asserted that the commission failed to strictly construe Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-09(F)(1) and to resolve all reasonable doubts regarding its interpretation in favor of the employer as required by this court's caselaw.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 16}\n    </strong>\n    A Tenth District magistrate recommended that the court deny the writ.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-2623\">\n     2017-Ohio-2623\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201650151\">\n     2017 WL 1650151\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at \u00b6 51.

It is not the responsibility of the worker to rig his own lifeline or to request that his employer rig a lifeline.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-2623\">\n     2017-Ohio-2623\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at \u00b6 47. Because it was undisputed that Byington Builders failed to install a catch platform or rig a lifeline and had therefore violated Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-09(F)(1), the magistrate further concluded that \"neither proximate cause nor unilateral negligence are truly issues.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 48.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 17}\n    </strong>\n    Byington Builders objected to the magistrate's recommendation, reiterating its prior arguments and asserting that the facts in\n    <em>\n     Avalotis\n    </em>\n    are distinguishable from those in this case. The Tenth District overruled Byington Builders' objections and adopted the magistrate's decision as its own.

It is likewise undisputed that the roof from which Trousdale fell had a pitch of at least 6 inches in 12 (which is greater than 4 inches in 12), was 22 feet above the ground, and had no parapet.

Accordingly, I dissent and would reverse the judgment of the Tenth District Court of Appeals denying a writ of mandamus to compel the commission to vacate its award.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 47}\n    </strong>\n    While working as a roofer for Byington Builders, Trousdale fell from a roof and sustained injuries. He was awarded workers' compensation benefits and then sought an additional award for a violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-09(F)(1), which provides: \"On pitched roofs with a rise of four inches in twelve [inches] or greater, sixteen feet or more above ground, and not having a parapet of at least thirty inches in height, catch platforms shall be installed. * * * Safety belts or harnesses attached to a lifeline which is securely fastened to the structure may be used in lieu of a catch platform.\" After a hearing, the commission determined that Byington Builders had violated this requirement by failing to install a catch platform or fasten a lifeline to the roof that its roofers could use with a safety belt, and it awarded Trousdale additional compensation as a penalty for the violation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 48}\n    </strong>\n    Byington Builders filed this mandamus action in the Tenth District Court of Appeals, seeking to vacate the VSSR award. The Tenth District denied the writ, and a majority of this court affirms, holding that\n    Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-09(F)(1) required Byington Builders to \"use\" safety belts securely fastened to lifelines if it did not install catch platforms and that making the equipment available did not satisfy this requirement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 49}\n    </strong>\n    The majority's analysis in affirming the court of appeals disregards the standard of review, which requires the court to strictly construe specific safety requirements and to resolve all doubts concerning the meaning and applicability of a particular requirement in favor of the employer.\n    <em>\n     State ex rel. 31, Inc. v.

Construing this provision strictly and in favor of the employer precludes a holding that Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-09(F)(1) requires the employer to fasten the lifeline to the structure.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 51}\n    </strong>\n    Nonetheless, the majority's analysis focuses on the word \"use,\" explaining that \"[t]he dictionary definition of 'use' is 'to put into action or service * * * EMPLOY .' \" (Ellipsis and capitalization sic.) Majority opinion at \u00b6 24, quoting\n    <em>\n     Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n    </em>\n    2523 (2002). It reasons that because Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-09(F)(1) contains the word \"use,\" it required Byington Builders to do more than \"provide\" or \"make available\" lifelines and safety harnesses and belts. But the majority fails to explain why lifelines and safety belts and harnesses can only be used if the employer first fastens the lifeline to the structure. Lifelines and safety belts and harnesses are used if the employer supplies that equipment and the employee is then responsible for fastening the lifeline to the structure and tying onto it with a safety belt or\n    harness. Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-09(F)(1) is broad enough to encompass both uses of the equipment, and it is at best ambiguous and therefore does not impose \"mandatory specific duties\" that are \"apparent to an employer interpreting [the] provision.\"\n    <em>\n     Oliver\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1749809\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/76/26/#p28\">\n     76 Ohio St.3d at 28\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=665%20N.E.2d%201108\">\n     665 N.E.2d 1108\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 52}\n    </strong>\n    Another rule, Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-03(J)(1), however, resolves any ambiguity by providing that \"[l]ifelines, safety belts or harnesses and lanyards shall be provided by the employer, and it shall be the responsibility of the employee to wear such equipment when exposed to hazards of falling where the operation being performed is more than six feet above ground or above a floor or platform, except as otherwise specified in this chapter * * *.\" It is true, as the majority points out, that Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-09(F)(1) makes special provisions for roofs, but that is because Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-03(J)(1) does not specifically apply to work performed on a platform such as a pitched roof. Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-09(F)(1) therefore supplements that rule and specifies that on certain pitched roofs, either catch platforms or lifelines and safety belts or harnesses must be used. But nothing in the roof-specific rule conflicts with the more general provision that it is the employer's responsibility to supply and the employee's responsibility to wear this safety equipment. The majority fails to explain why these administrative rules would have separate requirements for the same type of fall hazard. But reading these two provisions in harmony makes sense, because the employer is in the best position to provide a lifeline and harness or safety belt for its employees and a roofer is in the best position to fasten and use the equipment, moving the lifeline as he or she completes work on the roof. Taking the commission's reasoning to its logical conclusion will mean that an employer must remain on the jobsite at all times in order to fasten and refasten the lifeline as work is completed, because the employee has no obligation to do it him or herself. And any time the employer fails to move the lifeline or permits a roofer to do it, the employer could be subject to a new VSSR penalty if an accident follows. Such a result is palpably unreasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 53}\n    </strong>\n    The majority's attempt to buttress its analysis as being consistent with the commission's interpretation of Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-3-09(F)(1) bears little fruit. The commission's factual determination that a worker's injury resulted because of a violation of a specific safety requirement is final pursuant to\n    Article II, Section 35 of the Ohio Constitution, but its interpretation of an administrative rule is not, because the commission cannot rewrite administrative rules in the guise of interpreting them. \"Only the Administrator of Workers' Compensation or the General Assembly may rewrite safety requirements.\"\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.
