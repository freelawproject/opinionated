Alford, as the Personal Representative of the Estate of James H. Smith (deceased), appeals the final judgment of the Gallia County Court of Common Pleas, entered July 27, 2017. Ms. Alford (\"Appellant\"), filed a complaint against Arbors at Gallipolis (\"Arbors\") and named various other defendants, including Gallipolis Care, LLC and Extendicare Health Services Inc., alleging the named parties were neglectful and negligent, thereby directly and proximately causing James H. Smith's death. Appellees filed a motion asking the trial court to permanently stay the case pending arbitration. In the appealed-from entry, the trial court granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant raised three assignments of error with regard to the court's July 27, 2017 entry. Based upon our de novo review in this matter, we find Appellant's arguments are without merit. As such, we overrule the assignments of error and affirm the decision of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The factual record before the trial court was extremely limited, and the following are the only facts upon which the parties agree. James H. Smith was admitted to Arbors in late March or early April 2015. His admission paperwork, including an arbitration agreement, was signed by his daughter Stephanie A. Alford. On March 29, 2016, Smith died at Arbors. The arbitration agreement was made part of the trial court's record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On March 27, 2017, Appellant filed a complaint in the Gallia County Court of Common Pleas against Appellees Arbors at Gallipolis, Gallipolis OPCO, LLC, Gallipolis Care, LLC, Extendicare Health Services, Inc., ARK OPCO Group, LLC, Prestige Healthcare, LLC, Fortis Management Group, LLC, Noble Healthcare Management, LLC, Craig Flashner, Yitzchok Perlestein, and John Does 1-10. The complaint\n   contained allegations that James H. Smith was a resident of Arbors at Gallipolis Nursing Home and that the defendants owned and/or operated Arbors when Mr. Smith choked on food and died on March 29, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint also set forth that it was filed in order to pursue both the wrongful death claims and survivorship claims on behalf of Mr. Smith's next of kin. Contemporaneous to this filing, Appellant filed a motion for extension of time to file an affidavit of merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On April 21, 2017, all named defendants filed an answer denying liability and setting forth various affirmative defenses. The defendants reserved the right to set forth additional affirmative defenses as they became known through the course of discovery, requested a dismissal of all claims and also requested that the matter be set for a jury trial. On April 27, 2017, a separate answer on behalf of defendants Extendicare Health Services, Inc., and Gallipolis Care, LLC (\"Appellees\") was filed. In this pleading Appellees asserted that Appellant's claims were subject to a binding and enforceable arbitration agreement. In this answer, Appellees also requested dismissal and a jury trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On May 22, 2017, Appellees filed a Motion to Stay Pending Arbitration and Alternative Motion to Dismiss with the arbitration agreement executed by Appellant attached to the motion to stay as \"Exhibit A.\" On May 30, 2017, Arbors joined in the motion to stay. On June 12, 2017, Appellant filed a motion for extension of time to respond to both motions. Appellant requested 60 days. Appellant indicated the need to conduct discovery in the way of obtaining Mr. Smith's admission documents and deposing everyone involved in the admission process, with regard to execution of the arbitration agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On June 19, 2017, Appellees filed a reply in support of their motion to stay or dismiss and also opposed the motion for extension of time. Appellees asserted that discovery was unnecessary in that Appellant herself was the person who executed the arbitration agreement and thus would have all pertinent information. On June 26, 2017, Appellant filed a Motion for Additional Extension of Time to File Affidavit of Merit and a Motion to Compel. Appellant asserted she had not received a complete copy of all Mr. Smith's nursing home records. Appellees and Arbors also opposed this motion. On July 10, 2017, Appellant filed a reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On July 27, 2017, the trial court filed the appealed-from journal entry which stated simply: \"Upon review of pending cases, the Court finds this matter shall be stayed pending arbitration.\" This timely appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"I.

This presumption applies equally to arbitration agreements between nursing home residents and nursing homes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under Appellant's first assignment of error, she first asserts that the arbitration agreement is not enforceable pursuant to R.C. 2711.22.

Smith, Extendicare Health Services, Inc., Arbors at Gallipolis, and Charlene Smith as \"Center Representative.\" Appellant asserts: (1) her father did not sign the arbitration agreement; (2) she did not do so with legal authority; (3) Arbors at Gallipolis is not a legal entity; and, no one signed the arbitration agreement on behalf of Extendicare.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellees respond that Appellant's argument is contrary to law, given that business entities such as Arbors and\n   Extendicare are incapable of personal signatures and therefore, delegate such authority from principal to agent. Appellees point out Charlene Smith, Arbors' employee, acted as the agent.

Pursuant to Footnote 5 above, the trial court record does not contain evidence as to the actual legal relationship of the defendants/appellees as \"parents\" or \"subsidiaries.\" However, based on the conduct of the defendants/appellees in filing joint answers and adoption of pleadings, it is reasonable to conclude that they are in some manner \"affiliates.\" Black's Law Dictionary (Abridged Sixth Edition), defines \"Affiliate\" as signifying a \"condition of being united; being in close connection; allied, associated; or attached as a member or branch. Affiliate company. Company effectively controlled by another company. A branch, division, or subsidiary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 25} It is also reasonable to conclude that the remaining defendants/appellees ratified Charlene Smith's actions in signing the arbitration agreement. For ratification to occur, the person performing the act, even though not an agent, must at that time purported to have acted as an agent for the party subsequently adopting the act as its own.\n   <em>\n    Ashville Bank v.

Charlene Smith signed as \"Center Representative,\" on behalf of Extendicare Health Services, Inc., and its affiliates, including Arbors. It is also reasonable to conclude that in filing joint answers and pleadings, and adoption of pleadings, the affiliates have ratified Smith's actions in signing the agreement as their representative as well.

Because no discovery has taken place below, the record does not contain evidence as to Appellant's authority or lack thereof for her to make decisions on her father's behalf. Appellant also asserts she did not have apparent authority to execute the arbitration agreement. \"In order for a principal to be bound by the acts of his agent under the theory of apparent agency, evidence must affirmatively show: (1) that the principal held the agent out to the public as possessing sufficient authority to embrace the particular act in question, or knowingly permitted him to act as having such authority, and (2) that the person dealing with the agent knew of those facts and acting in good faith had reason to\n   believe and did believe that the agent possessed the necessary authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Primmer, supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 23, quoting\n   <em>\n    Master Consol.

Indianspring of Oakley,\n   </em>\n   1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-110864,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-4124\">\n    2012-Ohio-4124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203985953\">\n    2012 WL 3985953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Vogt,\n   </em>\n   the daughter of a long-term care facility patient brought claims against the facility as her mother's legal representative. The court of common pleas denied the facility's motion to stay proceedings and refer the matter to arbitration. The facility appealed and the court of appeals reversed, holding that the case was subject to arbitration absent a showing by the daughter that she lacked authority to sign the arbitration agreement as the patient's legal representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Indianspring argued that the trial court erred when it failed to find the arbitration agreement was valid and enforceable. An arbitration agreement \"shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except upon grounds that exist at law or in equity for the revocation.\" R.C. 2711.01(A).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. Vogt's argument was that the arbitration agreement was not valid because she, not her mother, had signed the agreement. Vogt also emphasized certain certification language in the agreement which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \"If Resident is unable to sign this Agreement, then a legal representative of the resident may sign on his/her behalf. The person signing below certifies that he/she has the legal authority to enter into this Agreement on Resident's behalf with the Facility either through a valid Power of Attorney or a guardianship appointment.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Because of this language, Vogt argued the burden was on Indianspring to demonstrate that [Vogt's mother] was unable to sign the agreement. The appellate court observed: \"In signing the agreement (and initialing various clauses of the agreement) Vogt held herself out as the legal representative of [her mother].\" The court stated that Vogt's contention ignored the presumption in favor of arbitrability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. The court concluded: \"As the burden was on Vogt to show that the agreement was unenforceable, she had to demonstrate that she had not validly exercised her authority as [her mother's] legal representative. She did not make such a demonstration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 30} In this case, Appellant has acted exactly as Vogt did in initialing and signing the arbitration agreement. On the signature page, there are two lines requesting James H. Smith's name: first, the \"Signature of Resident\" and second, the printed \"Name of Resident.\" Mr. Smith did not sign on the first line. His name is typed on the second line. Below, there are lines for the signature and printed names of the \"Legal Representative for Healthcare Decisions\" and the \"Legal Representative for Financial Decisions.\" Appellant signed on both signature lines and printed names' lines. The printed name lines call for the legal representative, in addition to printing a name, to print the \"Relationship or Title\" held, such as guardian, conservator, power of attorney, or proxy. Appellant signed only her name on the lines and did not list a relationship or title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The certification language in the arbitration agreement herein states near the top of the signature page:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"If signed by a Legal Representative, the representative certifies that the Center may reasonably rely upon the validity and authority of the Representative's signature based upon actual, implied or apparent authority to execute this Agreement as granted by the Resident.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In\n   <em>\n    Vogt,\n   </em>\n   the certification language specified that the person signing had authority pursuant to a valid power of attorney or a guardianship appointment. However, there was no evidence in the record that Vogt provided that documentation. The same is true here. As in\n   <em>\n    Vogt,\n   </em>\n   we find Appellant failed in her burden of showing that she did not validly exercise authority as her father's legal representative when she signed the arbitration agreement and thus, has failed to show that the agreement is unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Finally, we point out that Appellant initialed and signed the arbitration agreement as her father's Legal Representative for Healthcare Decisions and as his Legal Representative for Financial Decisions. She purported to make both healthcare and financial decisions on behalf of her father.

There is nothing in the record to indicate that Appellant unwillingly signed the agreement. For these reasons and based on the limited record before us, we find no merit to her argument herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Is the arbitration void under Ohio law?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Appellant argues that the arbitration agreement in this case fails to meet the requirements of R.C. 2711.23. That statute provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \"To be valid and enforceable pursuant to R.C. 2711.01 and 2711.22 of the Revised Code for controversies involving a medical claim, the agreement shall include and be subject to the following conditions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \"(A) The agreement shall provide that the care, diagnosis, or treatment will be provided whether or not the patient signs the agreement to arbitrate; * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (C) The agreement shall provide that the decision whether or not to sign the agreement is solely a matter for the patient's determination without any influence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (D) The agreement shall, if appropriate, provide that its terms constitute a waiver of any right to a trial in court, or a waiver of any right to a trial by jury; * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (F) Any arbitration panel shall consist of three persons, no more than one of whom shall be a physician or the representative of a hospital;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (G) The arbitration agreement shall be separate from any other agreement, consent, or document * * *.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 36} We find no merit to Appellant's argument that the arbitration agreement is void pursuant to R.C. 2711.23. Subpart (A) above requires that care, diagnosis, and treatment shall be provided whether or not the patient signs the arbitration agreement. That requisite is satisfied by the boldface, underlined statement in all capital letters underneath the caption of the agreement on Page 1, as follows: \"SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT IS NOT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   A CONDITION OF ADMISSION TO OR CONTINUED RESIDENCE IN THE CENTER.\" Furthermore, Page 5 of the arbitration agreement under \"Resident's Understanding,\" explicitly states again that \"this Agreement is not a condition of admission to or continued residence in the Center.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Subpart (C) which states that \"the decision whether or not to sign the agreement is solely for the patient's determination, without any influence,\" is also accounted for in the agreement. Paragraph 2 of the agreement is captioned \"Voluntary Agreement to participate in ADR,\" and provides at Line 4 of the Paragraph: \"The Parties voluntarily agree that any disputes covered by this Agreement * * * that may arise between the Parties shall be resolved exclusive by an ADR process * * *.\" Furthermore, on Page 5 of the agreement, Line 4, in bold print, the parties agree that \"they have excused this Agreement voluntarily intending to be legally bound * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Subpart (D) requires that the agreement shall provide that its terms constitute a waiver of a right to jury trial. Again, Paragraph 13, \"Resident's Understanding,\" provides in boldface and capital letters that \"THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND, ACKNOWLEDGE, AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT THEY ARE GIVING UP THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR DISPUTES DECIDED BY A COURT OF LAW.\" The agreement also provides at the top of Page 2: \"The Parties' recourse to a court of law shall be limited to an action to enforce a binding arbitration decision * * *.\" This language is sufficient to comply with R.C. 2711.23(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Appellant also argues that the agreement is not compliant with Subparts (F) and (G). We disagree, although Appellant's contention that Subpart (F), requiring that the arbitration panel consist of three persons and providing that no more than one individual on the panel may be a doctor or a representative of the hospital, is not part of the agreement is debatable. The agreement provides in pertinent part at \"Paragraph 5. Administration\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \"ADR under this Agreement shall be conducted by a Neutral and administered by an independent, impartial entity that is regularly engaged in providing mediation and arbitration services. * * * The request for ADR shall be made in writing and may be submitted to DJS Administrative Services Inc., (\"DJS\") * * *.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 40} However, the Administration clause further provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   \"If the parties choose not to select DJS * * * the parties shall select an alternative independent and impartial entity that is regularly engaged in providing mediation and arbitration services to serve as Administrator.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Under this language, the Parties are not limited to requesting alternative dispute resolution (ADR) through DJS Administrative Services. The Parties may select an alternative entity. And, while it does not specifically state that the arbitration panel must be limited to one physician or hospital representative, the requirement is not precluded in any way by Paragraph 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Further, the arbitration agreement contains a severability clause at Paragraph 10. A court will not lightly conclude that the invalidity of a particular contract term requires invalidation of the entire agreement.\n   <em>\n    Taylor Bldg. Corp. of Am. v.

We find that the language\n   of Paragraph 5 suffices to allow compliance with Subpart (F). However, even if it can be said to be insufficient, Paragraph 5 is severable and does not require invalidation of the entire arbitration agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Lastly, Subpart (G) requires that the arbitration agreement be separate from any other agreement, consent, or document.

Four months passed between the commencement of the action and the trial court's entry granting the stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Under the totality of the circumstances, Appellant has not demonstrated that Appellees' actions are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate. It appears that Appellees' have had minimal participation in the case and have protected their rights to a jury trial. At this juncture, Appellant has not shown any prejudice attributable to Appellees. We find no merit to Appellant's argument that Appellees have waived any right to arbitration by actively litigating this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   {\u00b6 59} As set forth above, we find no merit to any of the arguments set forth under Appellant's first assignment of error.

While the appellate court indicated the trial court relied solely upon the terms of the agreement, the trial court also had before it Petersen's affidavit.

Harrison bought a vehicle from Ganley which was alleged to be defective. Harrison filed suit against Ganley and Toyota Motor Sales, making breach of contract, lemon law, and unfair sales practices' claims. Ganley eventually moved to stay the proceedings pending arbitration and attached a copy of the contract, which contained the arbitration clause, to its motion. In response, Appellant alleged that the arbitration clause was unenforceable and moved the trial court to postpone its ruling on Ganley's motion until Appellant could conduct discovery. However, the trial court granted Ganley's motion and determined that the arbitration clause was enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   {\u00b6 66} In its decision, the\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   court observed at *2 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   \"Some procedures, though ostensibly providing for arbitration, are by their very nature unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

We find nothing in this record to suggest that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Appellant's Motion for Extension of Time to Respond to Defendants' Motion to Stay. As such, her argument is without merit and the second assignment of error is also overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR THREE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   {\u00b6 71} Appellant also asserts the trial court erred in ruling on Appellees' Motion to Stay Pending Arbitration without giving Appellant an opportunity to oppose the Motion to Stay. Appellant points out she was never able to file a brief in opposition to the motion to stay. Rather, she filed the Motion for Extension of Time in order to conduct additional discovery before responding. Appellant asserts that the trial court never ruled on Appellant's Motion, nor did she give Appellant notice she would be ruling on the Motion to Stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 72} It has generally been held that \"a trial court's failure to rule gives rise to a presumption that the trial court has denied the motion.\"\n   <em>\n    GMAC Mtge., LLC v.

Appellant also argues even if the trial court was not inclined to give Appellant additional time to conduct discovery, it should have given her formal notice through the grant of a limited continuance, that the court was about to render judgment in the case. If given notice, Appellant could have challenged the arbitration clause even without additional discovery. Appellant concludes the trial court abused its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   {\u00b6 73} We have found no authority that requires the trial court to notify Appellant it was about to rule on the Motion to Stay. The Motion to Stay had been pending two months. Appellant made no attempt to file a response directed at the merits of the Motion to Stay. We do not find the trial court abused its discretion in failing to notify Appellant. Therefore, the third assignment of error is also overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   {\u00b6 74} Accordingly, having overruled all of Appellant's assignments of error, we affirm the decision of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Hoover, P.J.: Concurs in Judgment and Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Harsha, J.: Concurs in Judgment Only.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    It is also alleged that Defendants John Does 1-10 were working under contract or otherwise for the named defendants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    On May 9, 2017, Attorneys Romanello and Poling withdrew as counsel for Extendicare and Gallipolis Care.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    On August 18, 2017, Appellant voluntarily dismissed Defendant Fortis Management Group, LLC, pursuant to Ohio Rule 41(A)(1)(a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    In support of her argument that her father did not sign the agreement and she did not do so with legal authority, Appellant attached an affidavit to her merit brief. Appellees filed a motion to strike the affidavit as it was not part of the trial court's record. We agreed. Since the affidavit was not part of the trial court record, we do not consider it on appeal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    App.R. 9(A) and App.R. 12(A)(1)(b).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    Appellant's brief throughout references the arbitration agreement as an \"arbitration clause.\" The \"Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement-Ohio\" consists of six pages including thirteen subparts and a signature page.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
