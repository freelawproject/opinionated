General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 32, prohibits \"knowingly ... possess[ing]\" a \"controlled substance\" \"with [the] intent to ... distribute\" that substance.

Officers searched the house, to and from which the defendant and Antrim returned and emerged after each suspected hand-to-hand drug transaction.
