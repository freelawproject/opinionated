Since the time of the divorce trial in April of 2013, the mother had \"purposely withheld the children from parenting time with [the] [f]ather,\" by \"fabricating claims about health issues for the children and seeking unnecessary medical treatment\" for the children after their visits with the father.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, the father \"had parenting time with all six children on only five occasions\" between April of 2013 and March of 2014. During that same twelve-month period, the mother \"enlist[ed] the children to report fictitious or exaggerated accounts of abuse by [the] [f]ather to mandated reporters,\" which resulted in the filing of fourteen 51A reports (see G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A,) with the Department of Children and Families (DCF).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The DCF investigators assigned to the case concluded that the child abuse and neglect allegations against the father were not supported, which the judge credited. The case was referred to DCF's clinical review team,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   which ultimately added \"a new allegation\" of neglect against the mother \"due to concerns\" that her campaign against the father \"was negatively impacting [the] children's emotional well-being,\" and recommended that DCF remove the children from the mother's home and intervene in support of the father's request for sole custody. The children were transferred to the father's temporary sole custody in March of 2014, and the judge found that they had \"adjusted very well\" and were \"thriving\" in the father's care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Crediting the testimony of several witnesses (including the father and several DCF employees assigned to the case), the judge concluded that the father was a capable caretaker with an appropriate home environment, and that he was \"willing to foster a positive relationship between the children and [the] [m]other.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685794\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/488/#p494\">\n    463 Mass. at 496, 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming the award of sole custody to the only parent willing to foster the child's relationship with the other parent). In contrast, the judge found that the mother made \"extreme\" parenting decisions\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and demonstrated a \"clear inability\" to place the children's \"emotional well-being\" above her own needs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Zatsky\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zatsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4017584\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/36/7/#p13\">\n    36 Mass.

The judge found the mother \"fabricated th[e] story\" of the children being locked in the trunk of the father's car \"in order to generate a 51A report,\" noting that the father's car, a Sport Utility Vehicle, did not have a trunk. The judge also credited the testimony of the DCF investigators that during their visits to the father's home, they observed no evidence of pets and the refrigerator was well-stocked with nutritious food.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    Janica Midiri, the DCF supervisor who referred the matter to the clinical review team for a case management recommendation, testified that she has only referred three cases to the clinical review team in the entire course of her career.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    The judge found that, since being in the father's care, the children are \"all involved in a variety of age appropriate activities,\" their various health issues are \"under control,\" their school attendance has substantially improved, and they are all doing well academically (two children are honor roll students, and several others have made significant academic progress).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    The judge also found that the father had allowed the children to visit with some members of the mother's family, as he believed those relationships were \"important\" for the children to maintain.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    By way of example, the mother kept one child out of school for thirty-three days due to a broken leg, and \"on the days that she did permit [the child] to attend school, she would accompany [the child] to carry her up and down stairs, as her school did not have an elevator.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    The judge found that the mother had not seen the children since July of 2014, having \"abruptly\" cancelled all future visits due to a conflict with the visitation center over her continued violation of their policies. The judge further found that the mother \"failed to comply with all of the tasks\" required by her DCF service plan, including undergoing a psychological evaluation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    During the six-day modification trial, the judge heard testimony from ten different witnesses and admitted over 7,200 pages of exhibits in evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    We are likewise unpersuaded by the children's contention that the mother's domestic violence allegations were irrelevant to the modification proceedings insofar as they predated the divorce judgment and therefore could not be used to establish a material change in circumstances. The burden of establishing a material change in circumstances fell to the father, as the party seeking modification, not the mother.

L. c. 208, \u00a7 31A, expressly requires the judge to consider evidence of \"past\" abuse; there is no language indicating that the Legislature intended to confine this inquiry to evidence of abuse occurring after the last judgment.
