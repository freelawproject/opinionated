The plaintiffs' complaint suggested that Bell \"harass[ed]\" them by sending them a cease and desist letter regarding DuLaurence's interactions with Bell's office staff. This vague and conclusory allegation, as the motion judge concluded, was insufficient to state a claim against the defendants.

On appeal, the plaintiffs do not appear to argue that the cease and desist letter constituted harassment. Instead, they appear to assert that their harassment claims are supported by a letter that the motion judge stated was not part of the rule 12 (b) (6) motion. As that letter is not part of the record on appeal, we do not address it. See\n   <em>\n    Currens\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Assessors of Boston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"312591\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/370/249/#p254\">\n    370 Mass. 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 254 (1976) (\"An appealing party may not by his brief attempt to place before an appellate court facts which are not stated or incorporated in the record on appeal\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Retaliation\n   </em>\n   . The plaintiffs maintain that the judge erroneously dismissed their retaliation claims under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 18 (c. 186 retaliation claims), because their complaint sufficiently alleged \"reprisal\" and \"constructive eviction\" by Bell following the plaintiffs' reports to the board of health of Salem. Because the plaintiffs filed their complaint in the Superior Court, their c. 186 retaliation claims are subject to G. L. c. 212, \u00a7 3, which states that an \"action[ ] may proceed in the [Superior] [C]ourt only if there is no reasonable likelihood that recovery by the plaintiff will be less than or equal to $ 25,000.\" Consequently, \"[i]f it appears to the court, from the statement of damages by the plaintiff that there is no reasonable likelihood that the estimated damages will be consistent with the civil money damage limits of the court, ... the judge, after receiving written responses from the parties and after a hearing, if requested by any party, may dismiss the case without prejudice for failure to comply with the requirements ... regarding the amount necessary for proceeding in the superior court.\" G. L. c. 212, \u00a7 3A (\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ). If the judge dismisses a case in accordance with G.

Consequently, the judge dismissed those claims for failing to meet the monetary threshold required for actions brought in the Superior Court. See G. L. c. 212, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 3A (\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ).

The judgment which dismissed the plaintiffs' c. 186 retaliation claims entered on February 14, 2018. The plaintiffs did not appeal from the dismissal of those claims to a single justice of the Appeals Court, as required by G. L. c. 212, \u00a7 3A (\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   ). Because the plaintiffs' purported appeals from the judgment insofar as it dismissed their c. 186 retaliation claims are not properly before us, we must dismiss them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Motions for sanctions\n   </em>\n   . Finally, the plaintiffs argue that the judge erred in declining to hear their motions for sanctions concurrently with the defendants' motion to dismiss.
