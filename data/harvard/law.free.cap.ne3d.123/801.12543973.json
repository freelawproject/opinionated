Officer Thomas Bernier, a member of the department's youth violence strike force, was called to the area after receiving a report that the two groups were engaged in a verbal altercation in front of a multifamily residence. When Officer Bernier arrived at the scene, he walked to the backyard of the residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Bernier observed the juvenile sitting on a porch, \"breathing heavily with his chest rising and falling.\" Officer Bernier asked the juvenile whether he lived at the residence, and the juvenile responded that he did -- a statement the motion judge found to be false. While the two were conversing, Officer Peter O'Brien observed an overturned bucket next to the stairs leading up to the porch. Officer O'Brien tilted the bucket over slightly, revealing a firearm. Officer O'Brien pointed at the bucket to warn Officer Bernier and then made his way onto the porch. The juvenile attempted to climb over a railing and escape, but was stopped and arrested. The juvenile was charged with unlicensed possession of a loaded firearm, possession of ammunition without an FID card, and additional criminal acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . \"When a defendant is charged with a crime in which possession of the seized evidence at the time of the contested search is an essential element of guilt, the defendant shall be deemed to have standing to contest the legality of the search and the seizure of that evidence.\" Commonwealth v.\n   <em>\n    Amendola\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3883991\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/406/592/#p601\">\n    406 Mass. 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 601 (1990).
