When the State tried to use statements Ruiz made during the interrogation as evidence against him in a criminal trial, he moved to suppress them as inadmissible. The trial court granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State appealed, arguing suppression was contrary to law because Ruiz-although interrogated-was not in custody. Finding substantial, probative evidence that he was in custody, we affirm the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In a small, windowless room in a secured area of the Seymour Police Department, two police officers tag-teamed an interrogation of Ernesto Ruiz, who had been accused of a crime. Neither officer gave him\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, and multiple times the officers told Ruiz that he was to \"sit tight\" in the interrogation room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Later, the State sought to use a video of the interrogation as evidence against Ruiz in a criminal trial. Ruiz moved to suppress it, arguing his statements in the video were inadmissible because they were made during custodial interrogation in the absence of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court heard evidence on the matter: testimony from the two officers who interrogated Ruiz, and the audio-video recording of the interrogation. The court also heard arguments, which the court considered overnight along with relevant caselaw. The next day, the court heard more testimony and argument, and then granted Ruiz's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In granting the motion, the court recognized-rightly-that whether Ruiz was in custody turns on objective circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It then determined that the environment\n   was \"a police setting\" in which multiple officers questioned Ruiz in an accusatory and focused way in a room behind several closed doors. The court observed that although Ruiz went to the police station on his own, he \"had to be buzzed into the area or taken into the area of a secure room.\" And although the first officer told Ruiz he could walk out of the interrogation-room door, the court found that statement, in this specific context, would not make a reasonable person feel free to leave. The court emphasized that after the second officer later entered the room, shut the door, and took on the role of interrogator, Ruiz was not told that he could leave or that the first officer's initial statement remained valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State claimed that it could not proceed without the evidence that had been suppressed. For this reason, and since a jury had already been empaneled, the court declared a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The State appealed the suppression decision,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-38-4-2\">\n    Ind.

But substantial, probative evidence in the record points in the opposite direction and supports the trial court's suppression ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To start, the time and place of the interrogation were directed by Detective Greg O'Brien, who showed up at Ruiz's home, informed Ruiz of the allegations against him, explained that he \"needed to interview\" Ruiz, and \"asked him to come up to the police station.\" Importantly, Detective O'Brien did not inform Ruiz that any other time or place would suffice for the interview.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathiason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7010\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/492/#p493\">\n    429 U.S. at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7010\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/492/#p493\">\n    97 S.Ct. 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defendant returned officer's phone calls to set up a meeting, and officer asked defendant where it would be convenient to meet).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ruiz came to the police station shortly after getting dressed. Detective O'Brien then led Ruiz through various sections of the station house: from the lobby through a door that required a key fob to enter; into a secured area containing the police squad room; \"up the elevator and the\n   stairs\"; through a second keyed door that was propped open; and into a small interview room with no windows and a single door, which the officers closed for the interrogation. Although he was not handcuffed or locked inside the interrogation room, Ruiz was physically and visually cabined to the small compartment with officers positioned near the single, shut door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Inside the interrogation room, Ruiz was at first alone with Detective O'Brien, who began the questioning. But after about thirteen minutes, Detective Troy Munson entered, closed the door, and became the primary interrogator. At this time, and through the end of the interrogation, the police outnumbered Ruiz in the room two-to-one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   When Detective O'Brien started to question Ruiz, he told Ruiz-a single time-that he could walk out \"that door.\" But the trial court did not err in concluding that this statement was not enough to make a reasonable person feel free to leave, for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   First, the officers told Ruiz to \"sit tight\" multiple times, belying any prior indication that Ruiz was free to go.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, the circuitous path by which Detective O'Brien took Ruiz into the interrogation room drew a labyrinthine exit route with many obstructions to egress. One of the doors Detective O'Brien led Ruiz through required a key fob when heading toward the interrogation room. And nobody told Ruiz that it was unlocked going the opposite direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, and most importantly, the police significantly undercut any initial message of freedom when they dramatically changed the interrogation atmosphere. Shortly after Detective O'Brien began the interview, a second officer-whom Ruiz had not yet met-entered the interview room; shut the door; and took over as the main, and more aggressive, interrogator. In this way, the police completely recast the interrogation, subverting the force and applicability of Detective O'Brien's earlier walk-out-that-door statement. And at no point did either officer say anything to preserve that statement's validity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Other statements the officers said or omitted, along with the character of their questioning, point toward curtailed freedom of movement. Detective O'Brien did not tell Ruiz that he didn't have to respond to other detectives who may question him. Nor did the detectives tell Ruiz that he wasn't under arrest; that he could end the interrogation at any time; or that he was free to leave once Detective Munson suddenly injected himself into the interrogation and began aggressive questioning.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Luna v.

And their questions were accusatory-not exploratory, like ones to identify suspects in the early stages of an investigation. Detective Munson emphasized this with deception-saying that the person who made the accusations had passed a lie-detector test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The questioning was also prolonged, lasting almost an hour. Although the length of an interview, alone, does not determine whether a person is in custody, the questioning here was sustained and relatively drawn out, especially compared to roadside traffic-stop questioning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berkemer v.

And the officers continued the interrogation past the time they knew Ruiz was supposed to pick up his daughter, telling him to \"sit tight\" until they were satisfied. Indeed, the interrogation did not end until after the officers had extracted incriminating remarks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Altogether, the circumstances surrounding the interrogation add up to a situation in which a reasonable person would not feel free to end the interrogation and leave. So, the record supports the conclusion that the curtailment-of-movement criterion was met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As custody turns on the totality of the circumstances, the conditions bearing on the curtailment-of-movement inquiry also factor into the second custody inquiry: whether the person was subjected to coercive pressures that necessitate\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   safeguards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Rather, it took place at the station house in an isolated room-removed from Ruiz's friends, family, and familiar environment, and with multiple officers employing various interrogation tactics for almost an hour, trying to convince their suspect to incriminate himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The officers also applied multiple layers of subtly coercive forces that, together and in the absence of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   's safeguards, would impair their suspect's free exercise of the privilege against self-incrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   First, after the interrogation began, the officers kept Ruiz \"off balance\" in the already unfamiliar environment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p444\">\n    384 U.S. at 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p444\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

They suggested that if Ruiz didn't talk right then about what he had done, they would make things worse for him in the future-because they would worry that he wasn't honest and that he had done \"something more\" than the alleged wrongdoing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

And here, certain elements, taken in isolation, may suggest an inference of no custody. But custody depends on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation. In this case, the totality of the circumstances, supported by substantial, probative evidence in the record, amount to\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   custody. So, the State failed to show that the trial court's suppression ruling was contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Fifth Amendment secures a suspect's right against self-incrimination. And to protect this right from the inherently compelling pressures of custodial interrogation,\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   requires police to provide certain safeguards. Here, the police did not provide those safeguards to Ruiz before interrogating him at the station house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Because the totality of objective circumstances evidenced on this record supports the trial court's conclusion that the interrogation was custodial, we affirm the suppression of Ruiz's statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   David and Goff, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Massa, J., concurs in result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Slaughter, J., dissents, believing transfer should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The trial court also rightly recognized that statements made in coercive settings implicate Article 1 of the Indiana Constitution. Ruiz made a similar acknowledgment in his motion to suppress, alleging that his rights under the Indiana Constitution were violated alongside his federal constitutional rights. But Ruiz did not advance any state constitutional arguments separate from those based on the Federal Constitution. While the rights protections of the state and federal constitutions often run parallel, they do not always mirror one another exactly, and they derive from independent sources of authority. For these reasons, claims brought under each charter warrant separate arguments.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Litchfield v.
