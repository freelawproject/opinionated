L. c. 208, \u00a7 28. The father maintains that instead of the inconsistency standard, \u00a7 II.C of the guidelines should have been applied here. That section states that \"[t]he child support obligation for the portion of combined available income that exceeds $250,000 shall be at the discretion of the Court.\" As such, the father claims, the judge should have made a fact-based analysis regarding material changes, including the mother's improved lifestyle. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As discussed above, the judge credited the mother's testimony regarding her income and employment, and did not find that the combined total available income of the parties exceeded $250,000. Therefore, the inconsistency standard applied to this modification action and not \u00a7 II.C of the guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After determining that the mother's income was $657.46 per week and that the father's income was $3,846.15 per week, the judge, pursuant to the guidelines, calculated the father's child support order to be $758 per week. Accordingly, because the judge found that there was an inconsistency between the existing child support order of $600 per week and the amount that would result from application of the guidelines, the father's child support obligation was modified to $758 per week.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The father further claims that the judge should have followed a \"cross-guidelines\" calculation pursuant to \u00a7 II.D of the guidelines, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Where two parents expect to or do share equally, or approximately equally, the financial responsibility and parenting time for the children, the child support order shall be determined by calculating the guidelines worksheets twice, first with one parent as the recipient, and second with the other parent as the recipient. The difference in the calculations shall be paid to the parent with the lower weekly support amount.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The judge's rationale explains that \"[w]hile Father's parenting time was expanded from the schedule established at the time of the divorce, the parties do not have equal or close to equal parenting time,\" which is required in order to calculate the guidelines' worksheet twice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We discern no abuse of discretion in the calculation or modification of the father's child support obligation.
