Diantonio, of assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ). In this consolidated appeal, the defendant challenges (1) the sufficiency of the Commonwealth evidence to support a conviction, (2) the judge's denial of her motion for a new trial, which was premised on the judge's failure to inform counsel before closing arguments that he would be instructing on consciousness of guilt, and (3) trial counsel's performance. We conclude that, although the evidence was sufficient, the order denying the motion for a new trial must be reversed because the judge's failure to notify trial counsel of his intention to instruct on consciousness of guilt prior to summations resulted in prejudicial error. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Degro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285239\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/432/319/#p332\">\n    432 Mass. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332 (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency\n   </em>\n   . The defendant contends that the Commonwealth's case deteriorated when (1) the prosecution witnesses offered differing accounts of how many times the defendant struck the victim, (2) the photographic evidence did not amply depict the location of the victim's injuries, (3) an officer on the scene testified that he observed no injuries on the victim when he interviewed her after the altercation, and (4) the defendant and her boyfriend testified that it was the victim who punched the defendant, and not the converse. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   At trial, the Commonwealth proceeded on the theory that the defendant committed a harmful battery. As such, the Commonwealth was required to prove that the defendant (1) touched the victim, (2) intentionally, (3) without any right or excuse, and (4) \"with such violence that bodily harm is likely to result.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Geordi G\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%2082\">\n    94 Mass.

The Commonwealth supported this theory with the testimony of the victim and two other witnesses, who together testified that the defendant grabbed the victim, threw her to the ground, and punched her repeatedly. This evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Latimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337417\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/671/#p677\">\n    378 Mass. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 677 (1979), is sufficient.

The defendant asserts that the evidence she presented drastically differed from the Commonwealth's evidence, and did just that. We disagree.

The defendant also asserts that the judge abused his discretion in denying her motion for a new trial because the consciousness of guilt instruction lacked an evidentiary basis and, further, because he gave it without providing the defendant notice of his intention to so instruct prior to closing arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We review the denial of the motion for a new trial to determine whether it was \"an abuse of discretion that produces a manifestly unjust result.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pingaro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772152\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/44/41/#p48\">\n    44 Mass.

Here, both the victim and others testified that after the victim screamed for someone to call the police, the defendant left the scene of the incident with her boyfriend.

In contrast, the prosecutor labeled the defendant's flight \"probably the most important evidence\" in the trial. The contrast was particularly critical here because the trial came down to a credibility contest between the witnesses on each side. The unannounced instruction made it possible for the jury to accept, without challenge by the defendant, the prosecutor's claim that the defendant believed herself to be guilty of the battery in stark contradiction of her defense.
