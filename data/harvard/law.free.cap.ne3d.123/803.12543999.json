We begin with an overview of the applicable cases to provide context for our discussion. The assessors are responsible for making a \"fair cash valuation\" of property that is subject to taxation. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 38. \"Fair cash value\" means \"fair market value,\" or \"the price an owner willing but not under compulsion to sell ought to receive from one willing but not under compulsion to buy.\"\n   <em>\n    Boston Gas.

In determining the propriety of proposed rates, the DPU permits a utility to earn a reasonable return on investment, which is calculated as a percentage return on the utility's rate base.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270141\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/458/715/#p718\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270141\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/458/715/#p718\">\n    . at 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If one of these circumstances is present, the burden shifts back to the taxpayer to establish that the assessed value is in excess of the property's fair cash value.\n   <em>\n    Boston Gas Co\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270141\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/458/715/#p718\">\n    458 Mass. at 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n   . The taxes at issue were assessed on NStar's personal property, specifically electric utility transmission and distribution property located throughout the city of Boston. For fiscal year 2012, the net book value of the property was $1.155 billion. The assessors, however, valued it at $1.586 billion. For fiscal year 2013, the net book value of the property was $1.182 billion, but the assessors valued it at $1.635 billion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At a hearing before the board, NStar offered testimony from three fact witnesses familiar with NStar's operations and two expert witnesses, John Reed and David Moody. Reed was qualified as an expert in regulatory matters relating to utilities, including rate-making and valuation issues. He testified that he was not aware of any DPU rate cases that deviated from the carry-over rate base rule. Based on this testimony and his belief that no other special circumstances warranted a departure from net book value, Reed testified that the fair cash value of NStar's personal property was net book value. Reed further testified that he was not aware of any asset sales occurring over net book value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Moody was qualified as an expert appraiser and discussed three different valuation methods in addition to net book value: an income approach known as the discounted cash flow approach, a sales comparison approach, and a reproduction cost new less depreciation (RCNLD) approach. Moody testified that his discounted cash flow approach accounted for the effects of the carry-over rate base rule. He further testified that he could not derive an indicator of value from a sales comparison approach and that he accorded his RCNLD approach no weight.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, Moody relied on his discounted cash flow approach and on net book value in reaching his opinion that the fair cash value of NStar's personal property for both fiscal years was $1.2 billion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The assessors offered testimony from their expert appraiser, George Sansoucy, who testified that the fair cash value of NStar's personal property for both fiscal years was $1.95 billion. Sansoucy developed indicators of value under three income approaches, a sales comparison approach, and an RCNLD approach. While Sansoucy testified that the best approach is the RCNLD approach, he used indicators from each of his approaches in reaching his opinion as to fair cash value. Sansoucy further testified that he did not rely on net book value because it is an accounting entry and not a valuation method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The board found that a number of special circumstances would induce a buyer to pay more than net book value for NStar's personal property, including a policy change with respect to the carry-over rate base rule. Because Moody's opinion as to fair cash value failed to account for those special circumstances and instead heavily relied on the effects of the carry-over rate base rule, the board did not credit his testimony as to fair cash value.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the board also did not credit Sansoucy's opinion as to fair cash value, the board did find that he successfully refuted NStar's \"bald net book assertions.\" The board thus concluded that NStar failed to meet its burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    NStar's arguments on appeal\n   </em>\n   . NStar's primary argument on appeal is that the record does not support the board's finding of special circumstances. NStar also argues that, regardless of whether there were special circumstances, it met its burden of proving that the assessors overvalued the property. Neither argument has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

In particular, the parties dispute whether the DPU's policy with respect to the carry-over rate base rule has changed. NStar contends that the board impermissibly relied on factual findings made in prior, unrelated cases in determining that the rule has changed. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Both parties presented evidence on the carry-over rate base rule. NStar relied on Reed, who testified that he was not aware of any DPU rate case that that has deviated from the carry-over rate base rule. The assessors, on the other hand, relied on relevant DPU decisions made from 1993 to 2010 that describe how the carry-over rate base rule has changed. Those decisions were entered into the record as a joint submission and were properly before the board. NStar does not argue otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After listening to Reed's testimony and reviewing the DPU decisions, the board found that the DPU has abandoned a strict carry-over rate base rule. This finding was supported by the DPU decisions. In fact, the Supreme Judicial Court has discussed the same DPU decisions at length in prior cases and has reached the same conclusion.

See Guidelines &amp; Standards for Acquisitions &amp; Mergers, D.P.U. 93-167-A (1994). In that order, the DPU stated that it would \"no longer follow the practice of denying acquisition premium recovery on a per se basis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"820804\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/402/1/#p15\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"820804\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/402/1/#p15\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Boston Gas Co\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270141\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/458/715/#p718\">\n    458 Mass. at 722-723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Supreme Judicial Court has acknowledged the DPU's policy change in at least three cases since 1994.

In its review of the DPU decisions, the board was not relying on factual findings made in those cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The board was instead analyzing how the DPU's use of the carry-over rate base rule has changed.
