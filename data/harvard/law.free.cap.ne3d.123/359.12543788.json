For the following reasons, we affirm, in part, and reverse, in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background and Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Othmar died in August 2015. In February 2016, Pollard presented a claim to Othmar's estate for $167,045.39 plus interest for unpaid child support, $40,000 for improper disposition of Othmar's real estate, and $120,000 for fraud related to the transfer of the real estate. The estate rejected the claim in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Pollard then filed a complaint in the trial court alleging that Othmar's estate owed her money based on child support that Othmar failed to pay while he was alive (\"the civil litigation\"). Attached to the complaint were two judgment entries from the Erie County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, that were issued in Pollard and Othmar's divorce case (\"the divorce litigation\"). The first, issued on October 4, 1974, ordered Othmar to pay child support in the amount of $70 per week, plus poundage. Of the support amount, $20 per week was to be applied to Othmar's arrearages. The second judgment entry, issued on June 24, 1975, noted that Othmar was $8,288.06 in arrears on his child support obligation. In her responses to requests for production of documents, Pollard stated that she had not received any child support payments \"[f]rom the date of the child support order per the pleadings to the present * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Elber filed a motion for summary judgment based on laches, speculative damages, and waiver. She also sought summary judgment on the issue of prejudgment interest. In support of her motion, Elber submitted: (1) two judgment entries and the docket sheet (which appears to be incomplete) from the divorce litigation; (2) two letters from Pollard to Othmar and one letter from Othmar to one of Pollard and Othmar's children; and (3) Pollard's responses to Elber's requests for production of documents and interrogatories. Other than the discovery responses, none of the documents are certified or incorporated into an affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In her memorandum in opposition, Pollard argued that Elber's claim of laches was not supported by the facts of the case; Pollard could, in fact, determine her damages; Elber's waiver argument misconstrues the law; and Pollard was entitled under the common law to prejudgment interest. In support of her arguments, Pollard attached as exhibits: (1) portions of Elber's responses to requests for production of documents; (2) three judgment entries from the divorce litigation that were not certified or incorporated into an affidavit; and (3) a certified copy of a balance sheet from 1978 showing that the predecessor of the Erie County Child Support Enforcement Agency did not collect any child support payments from Othmar or disburse any child support payments to Pollard. Pollard also asked the court to strike the letters attached to Elber's motion\n   because they were irrelevant and unauthenticated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In her reply, Elber reiterated the arguments from her motion and asked the court to take judicial notice of the records in the divorce litigation. She also attached as exhibits five additional judgment entries from the divorce litigation that were neither certified nor incorporated into an affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In response to Elber's request for the trial court to take judicial notice of the divorce litigation, Pollard filed a motion to consolidate the civil litigation with the divorce litigation and objected to the court taking judicial notice of the divorce litigation file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On August 4, 2017, the trial court issued its judgment entry granting summary judgment in Elber's favor and dismissing Pollard's case. After taking judicial notice of \"the filings contained in the divorce proceedings as well as the Court's docket reflecting same,\" the court found that Pollard's complaint was barred by laches. The court determined that Pollard waited at least 29 years before asserting her known right to collect unpaid child support. It also concluded that Pollard had no excuse for the delay because she was aware of Othmar's whereabouts, maintained contact with him, and knew of some of his assets, but did not attempt to secure a judgment for child support while he was alive. The court found unpersuasive Pollard's argument that the delay was excusable because she believed, based on her prior, unsuccessful motions to show cause, that further attempts to collect the child support would have been futile. The court discounted Pollard's excuse because \"a previous show cause action by Plaintiff resulted in some funds being collected and released to Plaintiff.\" Finally, the court determined that Elber was prejudiced by Pollard's delay because Pollard did not provide an affidavit attesting to her claimed damages and was \"clearly relying only on the Court's file\" to support her claims even though \"there are some entries in the Court's file which are not reflected anywhere in the docket.\" The court concluded that this made it \"simply impossible for the Defendant's estate to attempt to generate a defense * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Despite dismissing Pollard's complaint, the court went on to analyze her claim for prejudgment interest. The court found that the statute providing for prejudgment interest on unpaid child support was enacted in July 1992 and could not be applied retroactively. It also determined that the only way interest could be collected on unpaid child support accruing prior to July 1992 was if the amount had been reduced to a judgment, which Pollard had not done in this case. Finally, the court \"found no authority to support the Plaintiff's position that interest can be awarded under a theory of common law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Pollard now appeals the trial court's decision, raising five assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   First Assignment of Error[:] The trial court erred in basing its summary judgment ruling upon documents that were non-evidentiary, i.e. they were either not supported by an affidavit or were not certified and were therefore inadmissible as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Second Assignment of Error[:] The trial court erred by citing statements of counsel as \"facts\" when there is no evidence in the record to support them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Third Assignment of Error[:] The trial court erred by taking judicial notice of a file in a different case without having the file properly before it, as it had no jurisdiction to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Fourth Assignment of Error[:] The trial court erred by improperly weighing\n   the evidence, on every occasion finding against appellant, and resolving the questions concerning the evidence in favor of appellee, the moving party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Fifth Assignment of Error[:] The trial court erred by refusing to consider the question of prejudgment interest at common law, which is occasioned by the loss which a parent sustains by being deprived of child support, and on account of the gain made from its use by the other parent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Elber's Evidence does not Support Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In her first three assignments of error, Pollard argues that the trial court based its summary judgment decision on improper evidence. Specifically, she contends that the documents Elber submitted with her motion for summary judgment were not proper under Civ.R. 56(C), the trial court adopted unsupported statements from Elber's counsel as facts, and the trial court improperly took judicial notice of the file from the divorce litigation. Elber responds that the information in the divorce litigation was before the court in the civil litigation because Pollard reopened the divorce case and joined the estate as a party, making the trial court aware of the information from the divorce litigation. Assuming that the information from the divorce litigation was not properly before the trial court after Pollard reopened the divorce case, Elber contends that the court properly took judicial notice of the divorce litigation file. Finally, Elber argues that Pollard waived the issue of judicial notice on appeal by not requesting a hearing under Evid.R. 201(E). We address each issue in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Trial Court Improperly Took Judicial Notice of the Divorce Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 12} We will first address Pollard's third assignment of error. In it, she contends that the trial court erred by taking judicial notice of the file in the divorce litigation because a court cannot take judicial notice of determinations made in a separate case unless the file in the separate case is before the court. Elber responds that the trial court did not have to take judicial notice of the divorce litigation because the case was already reopened, which put the divorce litigation before the court. Alternatively, Elber contends that the trial court properly took judicial notice of the divorce litigation docket, which was sufficient to justify granting summary judgment. Elber also argues that Pollard waived any objection to the trial court taking judicial notice of the divorce litigation file by failing to request a hearing under Evid.R. 201(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Under Evid.R. 201, a court may take judicial notice of adjudicative facts (\"i.e., the facts of the case\") when the facts are not subject to reasonable dispute and are either \"(1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" Evid.R. 201(A), (B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} \"Judicial notice allows a court to accept, 'for purpose of convenience and without requiring a [party's] proof, * * * a well-known and indisputable fact.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re C.Y.\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist.

Although the civil litigation involves the same parties and Pollard's claims arise from the child support orders issued in the divorce litigation, this is a separate action. Because this is a separate action, the trial court was only permitted to take notice of the docket from the divorce litigation, and then only to the extent that the court used the docket \"to establish the fact of\" the divorce litigation.\n   <em>\n    Coles\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20 ;\n   <em>\n    Indus.

Instead, the trial court relied on information contained in the docket sheet to prove \"the truth of the matters asserted in the other litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Coles\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. For example, the trial court used the docket to establish the amount of Othmar's child support obligation, when the obligation was modified, that Othmar had amassed arrearages, and that Pollard did not attempt to collect unpaid child support from Othmar after January 1975. None of this information is the type that can be established by judicial notice of a case docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Elber argues that the divorce litigation was before the trial court-and thus did not require judicial notice to be considered by the court-because Pollard reopened the divorce case. She relies on the fact that both the civil litigation and the divorce litigation were \"before the same court and the same Judge with the same parties utilizing the same underlying facts to address the exact same issue.\" A judge's personal knowledge of an issue is not sufficient to allow the court to consider a fact as evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Staffrey v. Smith\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 09-MA-107,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-1296\">\n    2010-Ohio-1296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%201177647\">\n    2010 WL 1177647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 38 (a judge cannot notice a fact based on personal knowledge). Further, Elber's argument is directly contrary to the rule that courts cannot take judicial notice of prior proceedings, unless the prior proceedings happened earlier in the same case, even if the court, judge, parties, facts, and issues are identical to those in the separate case.\n   <em>\n    McMahon\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34 ;\n   <em>\n    Dombelek\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. Moreover, the only information from the divorce litigation that is in the civil litigation record are the uncertified, unauthenticated docket sheet and judgment entries\n   that the parties submitted as exhibits. Without having the record from the divorce litigation, we are unable to review all of the information that the trial court might have considered in reaching its decision on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 18} We also disagree with Elber's contention that Pollard waived the issue of judicial notice. Under Evid.R. 201(E), \"A party is entitled upon timely request to an opportunity to be heard as to the propriety of taking judicial notice and the tenor of the matter noticed.\" If a party fails to request an opportunity to be heard, the party waives or forfeits the issue on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The trial court agreed that Pollard's delay in filing prejudiced Elber because Pollard \"is not relying on her own records or independent recollection of events but is exclusively relying on the records maintained by the court\" to support her claims for unpaid child support, but the court file from the divorce litigation was incomplete. The court concluded that with the \"file being incomplete it is impossible to generate an accurate arrearages figure, if in fact there are arrearages.\" The trial court's assessment was based largely on the contents of the divorce file, which was not properly before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 33} A review of the evidence demonstrates that Elber failed to show that Pollard's delay materially prejudiced Elber's case.

The Civ.R. 56(C) evidence does not address whether Pollard voluntarily relinquished her right to collect unpaid child support from Othmar. Therefore, Elber did not meet her burden of showing that no genuine issues of material fact remain regarding waiver, and the trial court's decision on summary judgment cannot be upheld on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.

Pollard alleged that Othmar did not pay any child support from the date of their divorce until his death, which she calculated based on records from the divorce litigation. Although Elber pointed to issues with calculating the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of Pollard's damages (by claiming that the divorce file was incomplete), she did not submit any evidence showing that the\n   <em>\n    existence\n   </em>\n   of Pollard's damages is in dispute. We find, therefore, that genuine issues of material fact remain regarding damages and that the trial court's decision on summary judgment cannot be upheld on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Pollard's Fourth Assignment of Error is Moot\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 41} In her fourth assignment of error, Pollard argues that the trial court improperly weighed the evidence when it granted Elber's motion for summary judgment. Because we have found that the trial court relied on improper evidence and that the evidence properly before the court does not support summary judgment, we need not reach this issue. Accordingly, Pollard's fourth assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Pollard is not Entitled to Prejudgment Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In her fifth assignment of error, Pollard challenges the trial court's decision-notwithstanding its summary judgment decision dismissing Pollard's case-that Pollard would not be entitled to prejudgment\n   interest on any unpaid child support. Pollard admits that she is not entitled to statutory prejudgment interest, but argues that she is entitled to prejudgment interest under the common law. Elber counters that Pollard is not entitled to prejudgment interest under either R.C. 1343.03 or 3113.219.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Generally speaking, R.C. 1343.03(A) allows a court to add postjudgment interest to an award for unpaid child support based on a support order-such as the one at issue here-that was entered or modified before July 1, 1992.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunbar v.

First, Pollard did not cite any case law that supports her position that prejudgment interest is available to her under the common law. Second, she did not argue that we should extend the concept of common-law prejudgment interest to an award for unpaid child support. And finally, Pollard's delay of nearly 30 years before filing suit would make granting Pollard prejudgment interest inequitable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Pollard's claim for prejudgment interest. Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion, we find that Pollard's fifth assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 49} The record before us shows that Elber was not entitled to summary judgment because she did not submit competent Civ.R. 56(C) evidence upon which the trial court could have properly based its decision. All but one of the documents that Elber submitted fell outside the purview of Civ.R. 56(C) and were not incorporated into an affidavit under Civ.R. 56(E). Nor could the trial court rely on information from the divorce litigation because the trial court could not take judicial notice of proceedings in another case. The properly-considered evidence shows that genuine issues of material fact remain and that Elber is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, we find that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to Elber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Additionally, because Pollard did not support her argument that an award for unpaid child support is entitled to prejudgment interest under the common law, we also find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by deciding that prejudgment interest would not apply to any award of unpaid child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Accordingly, the August 4, 2017 judgment of the Erie County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed as to the denial of Pollard's request for prejudgment interest. The trial court's decision on summary judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
