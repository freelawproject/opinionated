For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On May 17, 2016, 2016 Am.S.B. No. 331 was introduced by the Ohio Senate, proposing to amend and enact numerous provisions to R.C. Chapter 956 (regulation and licensing of dog kennels). The stated purpose of the bill was \"to regulate the sale of dogs from pet stores and dog retailers and to require the Director of Agriculture to license pet stores.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On May 25, 2016, the Senate passed the bill after expanding it slightly \"to regulate the sale of dogs from pet stores and dog retailers, to require the Director of Agriculture to license pet stores, to revise the civil penalties applicable to dog breeders and other specified entities, and to make an appropriation.\" It was introduced to the House of Representatives on May 31, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} After stagnating in the House for several months, 2016 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 331 (\"S.B. 331\") eventually emerged from the House Finance Committee on December 7, 2016, with proposed amendments and enactments to R.C. Chapters 956, 959 (offenses relating to domestic animals), 1717 (humane societies), 4111 (minimum fair wage standards), 4113 (miscellaneous labor provisions), and 4939 (use of municipal public way). The stated purpose of the bill was substantially expanded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [T]o regulate the sale of dogs from pet stores and dog retailers, to require the Director of Agriculture to license pet stores, and to revise the civil penalties applicable to dog breeders and other specified entities; to govern construction and attachment activities related to micro wireless facilities in the public way; to prohibit political subdivisions from establishing minimum wage rates different from the rate required by state law; to generally grant private employers exclusive authority to establish policies concerning hours and location of work, scheduling, and fringe benefits, unless an exception applies; to prohibit a person from engaging in sexual conduct with an animal and related acts, to provide for the seizure and impoundment of\n   an animal that is the subject of a violation, and to authorize a sentencing court to require an offender to undergo psychological evaluation or counseling; to prohibit and establish an increased penalty for knowingly engaging in activities associated with cockfighting, bearbaiting, or pitting an animal against another; to remove the residency requirement for the appointment of an agent to a county humane society; and to make an appropriation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} This version of the bill was passed by the House, approved by the Senate, and signed into law by Governor John Kasich on December 19, 2016, with an effective date of March 21, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In separate actions, the city of Toledo and the cities of Maumee, Napoleon, Sylvania, and Perrysburg (\"the cities\"), filed complaints against the state of Ohio for declaratory and injunctive relief, seeking to invalidate S.B. 331. The cities' cases were consolidated on May 8, 2017. The cities raised a number of reasons to invalidate the bill. Pertinent to our discussion here, they claimed that it violates the one-subject rule of Article II, Section 15(D) of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On July 12, 2017, the trial court granted a motion by CTIA-the Wireless Association (\"CTIA\") to intervene in this action. CTIA \"represents diverse stakeholders in the wireless industry,\" and claimed that those stakeholders would be impacted by the amendments and enactments to R.C. Chapter 4939. CTIA had been permitted to intervene in a number of similar suits filed in Cuyahoga, Franklin, Hamilton, and Summit counties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Cleveland v.

In a judgment journalized on December 19, 2017, the trial court found that the bill does violate the one-subject rule, and it granted summary judgment in favor of the cities and against the state and CTIA. It declared S.B. 331 unconstitutional and incapable of being severed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The state and CTIA both appealed. The state assigns the following error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court erred when it invalidated Senate Bill 331 under Article II, Section 15(D) of the Ohio Constitution, commonly referred to as the single-subject rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   CTIA assigns the following errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1. The trial court erred in ruling that 2017 Sub. S.B. No. 331 (\"S.B. 331\") violates Article II, Section 15(D) of the Ohio Constitution (the \"single-subject rule\").

Chapter 956-the chapter of the Revised Code governing the regulation and licensing of dog kennels. The bill that ultimately was approved and signed into law added diverse new provisions, including provisions governing construction and attachment activities related to micro wireless facilities in the public way; prohibiting political subdivisions from establishing minimum wage rates different from the rate required by state law; granting private employers exclusive authority to establish policies concerning various terms of employment; criminalizing sexual conduct with animals; prohibiting cockfighting, bearbaiting, or pitting animals against each other; removing residency requirements for county humane society agents; and appropriating funds for programs involving animal health and food safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The state argues that the topics of S.B. 331 are unified by a common purpose: \"to standardize the manner in which businesses are regulated in Ohio to avoid a patchwork of local ordinances.\" Similarly, CTIA argues that S.B. 331 \"reflects a single legislative public-policy determination-that economic development in Ohio is better served when certain types of business activity are freed from a patchwork quilt of differing local regulations, and instead subjected to a uniform statewide rule.\" CTIA claims that while the Senate initially chose to apply this policy determination solely to the regulation of dog sales, the House chose to expand it to \"three additional business activities\"-\"minimum wages, employment conditions, and micro-wireless equipment installation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The city of Toledo insists, however, that S.B. 331 addresses a \"hodgepodge of subjects\" and \"fails to provide any glimmer of a unifying theme.\" The other plaintiff-cities maintain that \"[t]he assertion that the purpose is business regulation or uniform business regulation throughout the state is not clearly identified in the subject of the bill and is so strained that it lacks legitimacy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The trial court agreed with the cities. It found that \"[t]he final version of S.B. 331 embodies a jumble of incongruous provisions governing disparate activities and relations across several substantive areas of law without any suggestion of a single subject, overreaching purpose, or unifying scheme that brings them into common focus.\" It further found that \"the proposed hypothetical subjects in this case are unreasonably broad and capacious in their attempt to conjoin the disparate matters embraced by S.B. 331.\" And, citing\n   <em>\n    Sheward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"870116\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/86/451/#p498\">\n    86 Ohio St.3d 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=715%20N.E.2d%201062\">\n    715 N.E.2d 1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it concluded that the proposed\n   hypothetical subjects are \" 'a ruse by which to connect blatantly unrelated topics.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The trial court's conclusion is in accord with the conclusions reached by the Cuyahoga, Franklin, and Hamilton County common pleas courts, which considered the same issue.

We agree with the well-reasoned decision of the trial court, and we find beyond a reasonable doubt that S.B. 331 violates the one-subject rule contained in Article II, Section 15(D) of the Ohio Constitution and is, therefore, unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 27} We find the state's assignment of error and CTIA's first assignment of error not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

And because the bill lacks a discernible primary subject, the severance doctrine cannot operate to save any portion of it. Accordingly, we find the state's sole assignment of error and CTIA's two assignments of error not well-taken. We affirm the December 19, 2017 judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas.
