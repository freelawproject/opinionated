On appeal he argues that the judge erred in denying two pretrial motions: one to admit third-party culprit evidence showing that the victim's then boyfriend, who was present at the scene of the incident, had a pattern of violence against women, and another to admit evidence that the victim previously texted nude photographs to the defendant. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The defendant and the victim have a romantic history. The status of their relationship at the time of the incident was contested, however. The victim testified that they were just friends; the defense's theory was that they were still dating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On the day of the incident, the defendant visited the victim at her workplace, as he sometimes did. When the defendant arrived, the victim was in the parking lot with her boyfriend. She approached the defendant and asked him to leave, but the defendant refused. An argument ensued, during which the defendant grabbed the victim, threw her into his car, held her down by the face, and screamed at her. The victim heard her boyfriend scream \"get off of her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Eventually, the defendant released the victim, returned to his car, and backed up at a high rate of speed. The victim thought he had left the area, but then heard her boyfriend yelling to get out of the way. The victim turned and saw the defendant driving toward her, missing her by inches. Afterward, the victim spoke to the police and identified the defendant as her assailant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Third-party culprit evidence\n   </em>\n   . The defendant sought to introduce evidence to show that, despite the victim's identification, her boyfriend was actually the one who committed the crimes. Specifically, the defendant sought to introduce evidence that (1) in 2016 the boyfriend grabbed his then girlfriend by the neck and threw her to the ground after discovering her messages to other men, (2) in 2008 he pushed, hit, and threw a compact disc case at a different girlfriend following an argument, and (3) in 2005 he slammed a woman repeatedly against a car and held her down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Generally, \"[a] defendant may introduce evidence that tends to show that another person committed the crime or had the motive, intent, and opportunity to commit it.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"896016\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/395/296/#p300\">\n    395 Mass. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 300 (1985).

The victim herself reported the crimes to the police, and identified the defendant as the perpetrator, immediately after the crimes occurred. There is little support in the evidence or in logic that the victim would have reported the crimes, and concocted a story about the defendant, had the boyfriend been the real perpetrator; she could have protected the boyfriend simply by remaining silent. And though the defendant argues that the boyfriend had a motive to attack the victim (jealousy), and that the prior incidents show the boyfriend's \"history of jealousy issues,\" the link between this alleged motive and the proffered evidence is too attenuated for the evidence to be admissible. There is no indication that the 2005 and 2008 incidents involved jealousy on the part of the boyfriend. Moreover, the defendant made no offer of proof (and no evidence was put forth at trial) that the boyfriend was jealous of the relationship between the victim and the defendant. Without such evidence, any connection between the boyfriend's purported jealousy issues and his motive to assault the victim is purely speculative.
