Pierre filed a complaint in the Superior Court against the defendant, Ashford University, LLC (Ashford), alleging fraud and breach of contract after Ashford dismissed him from its business administration graduate program due to his unsatisfactory academic performance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ashford moved to dismiss Pierre's complaint or compel arbitration, and, after a hearing, a judge ordered the parties to proceed to arbitration, per the terms of Ashford's enrollment agreement, which Pierre had signed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After reviewing the parties' written submissions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the arbitrator ruled in favor of Ashford on all claims, concluding that there was insufficient evidence of fraud or breach of contract. Pierre then returned to the Superior Court and moved to vacate the arbitrator's award. After a hearing, the same judge who had ordered the parties to arbitration denied Pierre's motion to vacate and confirmed the arbitrator's award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, Pierre argues that the judge improperly confirmed the arbitrator's award because the arbitrator unlawfully disregarded the parties' agreement that Pierre would be awarded at least $ 180,000, and that the judge made various other errors of fact and law.

Pierre implicitly argues that the arbitrator exceeded his authority either because (1) the parties \"consented to the arbitration[ ] agreement ... upon condition that [Pierre] should receiv[e] [an] award of $ 180,000,\" or (2) the parties agreed that the arbitrator would make an award to Pierre of an amount not less than $ 180,000. The parties' second preliminary conference report, however, merely specifies that Pierre's damages claim was for $ 180,000, not that the parties agreed that Pierre would be awarded $ 180,000 -- a point the judge reiterated at the hearing on Pierre's motion to vacate the award. Similarly, Pierre argues that the judge \"specifically explained that [Pierre] must received [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] $ 180.000.00 [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ]\" because the parties \"consented to the arbitration upon [that] condition.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   But as the judge articulated -- both in his order denying Pierre's motion to vacate the award, and at the motion hearing -- his allowance of Ashford's motion to dismiss Pierre's complaint did no more than order that Pierre's claims proceed to arbitration. That order in no way addressed the merits of Pierre's claims. The arbitrator did not exceed his authority by declining to award Pierre $ 180,000 because there was no mutual agreement, or court order, that Pierre would be awarded any amount in arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074208\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/87/503/#p505\">\n    87 Mass.
