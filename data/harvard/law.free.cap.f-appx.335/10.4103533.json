After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-14\">I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b33-15\">Moulton argues that the evidence is insufficient to support his convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-16\">A. Mail Fraud</p>\n<p id=\"b33-17\">To establish mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201c(1) intentionally participated in a scheme or artifice to defraud and (2) used the United States mails to carry out that scheme or artifice.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellington, </em>348 F.3d 984, 990 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks omitted). Moulton argues that the government did not prove either that he intended to defraud American Express or that he used the United States mails. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>The evidence, construed in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict, shows that in July 2008, Moulton applied for an American Express corporate account for his company, Magic City, Inc., and that in support of his application, Moulton submitted a copy of Magic City\u2019s 2001 federal corporate tax return. However, the 2001 tax return included with the application had not been filed with the IRS. American Express issued Moulton a corporate charge card and mailed it from Omaha, Nebraska to Moul-ton\u2019s address in Trussville, Alabama via United States mail. As of the time of trial, the charge card\u2019s balance of $201,042.47 was unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The testimony of Sally Wynn, who prepared the tax return for Moulton, showed that Moulton knew the 2001 tax return he submitted to American Express had not been filed with the IRS and, therefore, was fraudulent. Wynn testified that she instructed Moulton to attach a check for $10,203 to the tax return and mail it to the IRS by March 15. Wynn was emphatic that she never mailed tax returns for her clients because of liability concerns. Wynn\u2019s testimony established that Moul-ton knew that he was responsible for mailing Magic City\u2019s tax return to the IRS and allowed the jury to infer that Moulton knew it was not mailed to the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">In addition, the jury was free to, and obviously did, disbelieve Moulton\u2019s own trial testimony that he did not know the tax return had not been filed with the IRS. \u201c[A] statement by a defendant, if disbelieved by the jury, may be considered as <em>substantive evidence </em>of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>53 F.3d 312, 314 (11th Cir.1995). This evidence, in combination with Wynn\u2019s testimony, was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Moulton intended to defraud American Express by submitting a fraudulent tax return in support of a credit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">There was also sufficient evidence supporting the jury\u2019s finding that Moulton used the United States mails to carry out the scheme to defraud. \u201cOne causes the mails to be used when he does an act with knowledge that the use of the mails will follow in the ordinary course of business, or where such use can reasonably be foreseen, even though not actually intended.\u201d <em>United States v. Toney, </em>598 F.2d 1349, 1355 (5th Cir.1979) (quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fact that Moulton submitted an application for a credit card makes it reasonably foreseeable that the United States mails would be used to transmit the card to him once the application was approved. Thus, the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that Moulton used the United States mails.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">B. Misuse of Social Security Numbers</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">\u201cIn order to establish a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(7)(B), the government must prove that the defendant, \u2018with intent to deceive, falsely represented] a number to be [his Social Security number], when in fact such number [was] not [his Social Security number].\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>376 F.3d 1282, 1291 (11th Cir.2004) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(7)(B)). \u201cThus, the elements of the offense are (1) false representation of a Social Security number, (2) with intent to deceive, (3) for any purpose.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">Moulton argues that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to deceive Crescent Bank (\u201cCrescent\u201d) and Ultimate Automotive Group (\u201cUAG\u201d) when he applied for a car loan at UAG\u2019s car dealership. The gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>eminent presented evidence that Moulton completed UAG\u2019s credit application and, in the space provided for the applicant\u2019s \u201cSocial Security number,\u201d Moulton listed his company\u2019s Dunn &amp; Bradstreet (\u201cD&amp;B\u201d) number rather than his social security number. This loan application was submitted to Crescent for approval, along with a paycheck stub from Moulton\u2019s employment, which listed the D&amp;B number as his employee ID number. The government also submitted evidence that Moulton had prior convictions for using a false social security number, which the district court instructed the jury it could use to determine whether Moulton had the requisite intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Although Moulton testified that he acci-dently put his D&amp;B number on the loan application, the jury did not believe him and, as already discussed, could use this testimony as substantive evidence of Moul-ton\u2019s guilt. Furthermore, representatives of both UAG and Crescent testified that their companies do not engage in corporate transactions and, thus, do not accept a D&amp;B number. UAG\u2019s finance manager testified that Moulton\u2019s car purchase was not represented to him as a business purchase. Additionally, the D&amp;B numbers appear in a different format (xx-xxx-xxxx) than a social security number (xxx-xx-xxxx), making it less likely that Moulton accidentally provided his company\u2019s D&amp;B number instead of his social security number. From this evidence, the jury could reasonably conclude that Moulton intended to deceive UAG and Crescent when he used his D&amp;B number on the loan application.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">II. Reasonableness of 90-month Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion using a two-step process. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189-90 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, we look at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the advisory guidelines range, treating the guidelines as mandatory or failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>Then, we look at whether the sentence is substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although we do not apply a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence imposed within the correctly calculated advisory guidelines range, we ordinarily expect such a sentence will be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">Moulton argues that his sentence is pro-eedurally unreasonable because the district court deferred \u201cto the prescriptions of the guideline calculations and the request of the Government.\u201d The record does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>support this claim. The district court specifically stated that the guidelines were advisory and did not impose the 96-month sentence requested by the government. Instead it chose a 90-month sentence based on Moulton\u2019s mitigation argument that his loss calculation \u201cputs him into that higher range just barely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Furthermore, Moulton\u2019s 90-month sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3558(a) factors. As the district court pointed out, Moulton had \u201crepeatedly engaged in these types of criminal behaviors.\u201d Moulton\u2019s criminal history, which included convictions for misuse of social security numbers, indicated that previous sentences had failed to deter him from committing economic crimes. Furthermore, the district court found that Moul-ton\u2019s testimony at trial was \u201coutlandish\u201d and that his conduct before and after his arrest \u201cshowed a disregard for the criminal justice system.\u201d The district court stated that it could not \u201cignore the defendant\u2019s consistent denials, untrue statements, and attempts to cover up his behavior that [the court] witnessed during the trial.\u201d Considering the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in imposing a 90-month sentence, in the middle of the advisory guidelines range of 77 to 96 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b33-7\">. We review <em>de novo </em>challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence in criminal cases. <em>United States v. Futrell, </em>209 F.3d 1286, 1288 (11th Cir.2000). \u201c[A]n appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility determinations in favor of the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>228 F.3d 1294, 1299 (11th Cir.2000). \"A conviction must be upheld unless the jury could not have found the defendant guilty under any reasonable construction of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Byrd, </em>403 F.3d 1278, 1288 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b34-6\">.
