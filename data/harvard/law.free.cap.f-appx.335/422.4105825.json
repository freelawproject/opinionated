Zamora argues that the subsequent amendment of certain sections of the United States Sentencing Guidelines should result in a reduction of his sentence. He asserts that some of these amendments were \u201cclarifying\u201d amendments, which can be applied retroactively regardless of whether the Guidelines specifically designate the amendment as retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant may have his sentence modified if he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based upon a sentencing range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission. The district court may grant a reduction if consistent with the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission has stated in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 that unless an amendment is listed in \u00a7 1131.10(c), a reduction based on the amendment under \u00a7 3582(c) is not consistent with the policy statement of \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). We review a district court\u2019s refusal to lower a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217-18 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Although Zamora argues that certain guidelines sections have been amended, he has not specified which amendments he is referring to or shown that these amendments apply retroactively. In addition, we have held that, except on direct appeal, a clarifying amendment is not retroactively applied unless the amendment is listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See Drath, </em>89 F.3d at 217. Finally, Zamora has not shown that the district court was required to provide additional reasons to explain its denial of his motion. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Zamora\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
