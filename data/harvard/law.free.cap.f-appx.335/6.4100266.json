After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce an incarcerated defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(l). However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-17\">Pliego based his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on Amendments 706 and 715 to the Sentencing Guidelines. Amendment 706 lowered most of the base offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) for crack cocaine offenses. Amendment 715 amended the commentary to \u00a7 2D1.1 to clarify that, generally, if an offense involved cocaine base and one or more other drugs, the combined offense level calculated after converting each of the drugs to its marijuana equivalency should be reduced by two offense levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 10(D)(i). However, the reduction does not apply if \u201cthe 2-level reduction results in a combined offense level that is less than the combined offense level that would apply ... if the offense involved only the other controlled substance(s) <em>(ie., </em>the controlled substance(s) other than cocaine base).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 10(D)(ii)(II).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-18\">The district court did not err in concluding that Pliego was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pliego\u2019s drug conspiracy involved several drugs, including 158 kilograms of marijuana, 26 kilograms of cocaine powder, 28.7 kilograms of methamphetamine and 201 grams of crack cocaine. At Pliego\u2019s original sentencing, the district court converted these drug amounts to their marijuana equivalency and attributed to Pliego a total of 85,690.69 kilograms of marijuana. The combined drug amount resulted in a base offense level of 38 under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-19\">Subtracting two levels from Pliego\u2019s combined offense level results in an offense level of 36. However, subtracting the crack cocaine marijuana equivalency of 4,020 kilograms, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 10(E), from the total of 85,670.69 kilograms of marijuana still results in a base offense level of 38. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (setting offense level at 38 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>for 30,0000 kilograms or more of marijuana). Because the combined offense level for all the drug types after the two-level reduction is less than the offense level when the crack cocaine amount is excluded, the two-level reduction does not apply, and Pliego\u2019s base offense level remains 38. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n.' 10(D)(ii)(II). Thus, because Amendments 706 and 715 do not have the effect of lowering Pliego\u2019s applicable guidelines range, the district court correctly concluded Pliego was ineligible for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Pliego actually seems to concede that, based on the commentary to \u00a7 2D1.1 as outlined above, he does not qualify for a sentencing reduction. We reject as merit-less Pliego\u2019s main argument that he nonetheless should receive a reduction because one of his co-defendants erroneously received the reduction. The statute does not authorize a district court to entertain a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b29-16\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v.
