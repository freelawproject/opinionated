He sued certain prison officials under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 for supposedly acting with deliberate indifference towards his serious medical needs. The district court dismissed his lawsuit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 after the court concluded that he was not eligible to proceed in <em>forma pauperis. </em>We vacate the decision of the district court and remand the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">. Section 1915 allows a prisoner to file three frivolous lawsuits at a reduced rate. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(b), (g); <em>Dupree v. Palmer, </em>284 F.3d 1234, 1236 (11th Cir.2002). After the third baseless complaint, however, a prisoner must pay the full filing fee. <em>Dupree, </em>284 F.3d at 1236. The only exception is if the prisoner faces imminent danger of serious physical injury when he files suit. <em>Medberry v. Butler, </em>185 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir.1999). Jackson does not dispute that he has already filed three frivolous lawsuits; thus, he may proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>here only if he was in imminent danger of serious harm when he filed suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-12\">We believe Jackson has met this standard. In his \u2022 complaint, Jackson claims that he has a hernia that causes him to suffer from severe pain in his testicles and abdomen, blood in his urine, nausea, and weight loss. Jackson contends that without surgery, which the defendant prison officials will not approve,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he will continue to suffer from those injuries and may even face tissue death, gangrene, and internal bleeding. Based on these allegations, which we must construe liberally, accept as true, and view as a whole, <em>Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1350 (11th Cir.2004), we conclude that Jackson has sufficiently demonstrated that he was in imminent danger of serious physical injury when he filed suit. Jackson may proceed with his lawsuit <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-13\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-11\">. Jackson asks us to enter a default judgement in his favor and to reconsider our earlier order denying him leave to amend his appeal papers; we reject his requests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b37-23\">. In his appeal papers, Jackson indicates that he received his surgery after filing his complaint. What effect this development has on his lawsuit, if any, we save for the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
