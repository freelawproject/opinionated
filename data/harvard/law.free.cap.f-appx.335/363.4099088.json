Arzate argues that the district court erred in calculating the amount of drugs attributable to him and that the sentence imposed was unreasonable under the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He also asserts that the sentence imposed was not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness, and he argues for the first time on appeal that there was no empirical evidence to support the guideline under which his sentence was calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we engage in a bifurcated review process of the sentence imposed by the district court. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 751-52 (5th Cir.2009). First, we consider whether the district court committed \u201ca significant procedural error,\u201d such as miscalculating the advisory guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>Remand is required if such an error occurred unless the proponent of the sentence establishes that \u201cthe error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 753 (quoting <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992)). If there is no error or the error is harmless, this court may proceed to the second step and review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 751-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>We review the district court\u2019s determination of drug quantity for clear error. <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005). The district court based its determination of drug quantity on Arzate\u2019s admission that he had been allowing loads of drugs to pass through a border checkpoint for fifteen years. He admitted to having allowed loads of five to ten kilograms of cocaine to pass through the checkpoint for a man named Froylan Villanueva. The estimate that he allowed ten kilograms from Villanueva to pass through the checkpoint is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>76 F.3d 82, 84-85 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Arzate also admitted that he had been paid $3,000-$7,000 every three or four months by David Soto to allow drugs to pass through the border checkpoint and that this activity had occurred between 2001 and 2006. The district court\u2019s estimate that Arzate allowed 15 loads of drugs to pass through the checkpoint during this time frame also is supported. Although Arzate contends that his offense involved both marijuana and cocaine, the only transaction shown to have involved marijuana is one that involved a cooperating witness. Arzate\u2019s admitted dealings with Soto and with Soto\u2019s partner involved cocaine. The one transaction with Soto to which Arzate specifically admitted involved Arzate\u2019s transportation of a load of 40.8 kilograms of cocaine across the border. Although this incident involved more active conduct by Arzate, he has not provided any evidence as to why this amount does not constitute a reliable estimate of the amount of cocaine contained in the other loads that were passed through the border on Soto\u2019s behalf. Arzate\u2019s contention that he was paid $1,000 a kilogram to allow drugs to pass through the border on someone else\u2019s behalf does not dispel the reliability of the district court\u2019s calculation. Using that figure, Arzate should have received at least $40,800 to drive the load containing 40.8 kilograms of cocaine through the border checkpoint. Instead, he received $14,000. Because the district court based its drug quantity calculation on the only type and quantity of drugs that Arzate admitted were transported across the border on Soto\u2019s behalf, the district court did not clearly err in estimating that Arzate\u2019s offense involved allowing 15 loads of 40.8 kilograms of cocaine to pass through the checkpoint. <em>See Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d at 247-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Arzate also argues that the sentence imposed by the district court is unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals sent forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that he does not pose a danger to the public, that the 55-year sentence is not necessary for deterrence purposes since he is 48 years old and would be over 90 by the time of his release, and that a 15 to 30-year sentence would be sufficient to deter other criminals. He also contends for the first time on appeal that the sentence imposed by the district court is based on a guideline that lacks empirical support.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Because the district court imposed a sentence within the properly calculated guidelines range, it is presumptively reasonable, and this Court \u201cwill infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Arzate\u2019s contention that his sentence is unreasonable because it is based on a guideline lacking empirical support is without merit. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). The district court rejected Arzate\u2019s request for a shorter sentence, determining that his offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>was very serious, that he had harmed a number of people through his actions, that his offense conduct had occurred over the course of many years, and that it was important to deter other government agents from abusing their position of trust. Arzate has not shown that the sentence imposed was unreasonable. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519; <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525-26 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 616 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
