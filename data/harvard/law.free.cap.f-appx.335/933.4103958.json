At sentencing, the district court imposed on Count One a prison sentence on Count One of 96 months, an upward variance of 50 months from the high end of the Guidelines sentence range,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and on Count Two a consecutive prison sentence of 84 months, the minimum sentence prescribed by statute, for a total term of imprisonment of 180 months. Jackson now appeals, contending that his total sentence was not substantively reasonable because it did not take into account all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and it was greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-23\">We may review a sentence for procedural or substantive reasonableness. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). In considering the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, we employ an abuse of discretion standard, \u201c[rjegardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>128 S.Ct. at 597. The party challenging the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">\u201c[Ajfter giving both parties an opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate, the district judge should then consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine whether they support the sentence requested by a party.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. at 596. Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(c), the court should state its reasons for imposing a particular sentence, and, in doing so, should \u201ctailor its comments to show that the sentence imposed is appropriate, given the factors to be considered as set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181 (11th Cir.2006) (internal citation and quotations omitted); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1). These factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-5\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-6\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). We have held, however, that <em>\u201cnothing </em>in this Circuit\u2019s precedent or <em>Bookey</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>requires the district court, in its explanation of sentence under \u00a7 3553(c)(1), to articulate its consideration of each individual \u00a7 3553(a) factor.\u201d <em>Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d at 1182 (emphasis in original). Further, the district court shall impose a sentence that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). \u201c[TJhere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">With respect to sentences imposed outside the applicable Guidelines sentence range, the district court must \u201censure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Nonetheless, we \u201cmay not apply a presumption of unreasonableness. [We] may consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe fact that [we] might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018We may find that a district court has abused its considerable discretion if it has weighed the factors in a manner that demonstrably yields an unreasonable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">Although the district court fashioned an upward variance of 50 months on Count One, it properly considered and weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and thoroughly explained its reasons for the variance. In our view, the court\u2019s justifications for the variance were compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b955-17\">. The court imposed the variance because of the circumstances surrounding the Count One armed bank robbery and Jackson's significant criminal history, which included convictions for a prior bank robbery and possession with intent to distribute cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b956-11\">. <em>United States v.
