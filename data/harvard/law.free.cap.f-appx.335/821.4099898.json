On appeal, Irvin\u2019s primary argument is that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint on collateral estoppel grounds because this lawsuit raises a different issue than the one he raised in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>earlier lawsuit. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions, including the applicability of the collateral estoppel doctrine. <em>See United States v. Weiss, </em>467 F.3d 1300, 1308 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cA district court\u2019s factual determinations underlying its legal conclusion are upheld unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The relevant facts and procedural history are as follows. Plaintiff Irvin is a veteran who receives health benefits from the Department of Veteran Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d), and who has suffered lower back pain caused by lumbar stenosis. He previously was a patient at the North Georgia Pain Clinic (\u201cNGPC\u201d), and while there, his physician treated his back pain with an implanted drug infusion system (also referred to as a morphine pump). Thereafter, Irvin transferred his care from the NGPC to the Atlanta VAMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">In September of 2003, the VAMC determined that the implanted drug infusion system was medically unnecessary for Irvin\u2019s stenosis, and that his back pain could be addressed using oral medications and a Fenatyl patch. As a result, the VAMC decided that it would reimburse Irvin\u2019s physician for his treatment with the implanted drug infusion system only to the extent needed to wean Irvin off of it. On December 3, 2003, Irvin filed a federal court complaint challenging the VAMC\u2019s reimbursement decision (the \u201c2003 Complaint\u201d). The complaint challenged the VAMC\u2019s decision to limit its reimbursement of Irvin\u2019s treatment with a morphine pump to the taper and removal of the pump, and sought injunctive relief. The government moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction the complaint under the Veterans\u2019 Judicial Review Act (the \u201cVJRA\u201d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-7\">The Secretary shall decide all questions of law and fact necessary to a decision by the Secretary under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the' Secretary to veterans or the dependents or survivors of veterans.... [T]he decision of the Secretary as to any such question shall be final and conclusive and may not be reviewed by any other official or by any court, whether by an action in the nature of mandamus or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511(a). On January 14, 2004, the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction on grounds that the VJRA barred judicial review of a benefits decision by the VA.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">In October of 2004, the VAMC reversed its decision and authorized payment to Irvin\u2019s non-VAMC physician for the morphine pump after the attempts to wean Irvin off of the pump failed. Irvin does not contend that the VAMC ever issued any subsequent denial decisions with regard to the morphine pump after October of 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">Nevertheless, in October of 2007, Irvin filed a new complaint (the \u201c2007 Complaint\u201d), challenging the VAMC\u2019s decision to taper and remove his morphine pump, and seeking money damages for his \u201cextreme pain and suffering.\u201d On the government\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed the 2007 Complaint on collateral estoppel grounds \u2014 concluding that the issue of the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction to review the VAMC\u2019s reimbursement decision regarding Irvin\u2019s implanted drug infusion system had already been decided, and that Irvin was precluded from relit-igating the same issue again. Irvin now appeals that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">Collateral estoppel refers to the concept of \u201cissue preclusion,\u201d whereby the re-litigation of an issue that has been previously litigated and decided is precluded. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number><em>Christo v. Padgett, </em>223 F.3d 1324, 1339 (11th Cir.2000). To apply collateral estop-pel, the court must find that the following four prerequisites have been satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-5\">(1) the issue at stake is identical to the one involved in the prior proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">(2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-7\">(3) the determination of the issue in the prior litigation must have been \u201ca critical and necessary part\u201d of the judgment in the first action; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-8\">(4) the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted must have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">On the record here, we disagree with Irvin\u2019s claim that the district court erred in dismissing the 2007 Complaint on collateral estoppel grounds. As for the first prong of the test, the issued involved in both lawsuits is identical. In the 2003 Complaint, Irvin sought to enjoin the VAMC\u2019s order \u201cto reduce my pain management system by 10% every two weeks and remov[e] ... the implanted Meditronic Drug Infusion System.\u201d 2003 Compl. \u00b6 2. In the 2007 Complaint, Irvin sought monetary compensation for the pain and suffering caused by the VAMC\u2019s order to \u201ctaper and remov[e] ... the Plaintiffs Implanted Drug Infusion System\u201d and substitute with oral medications. 2007 Compl. at 2. Both complaints thus challenge the VAMC\u2019s 2003 order to remove Irvin\u2019s morphine pump \u2014 an order that clearly constitutes a \u201cdecision by the Secretary ... that affects the provision of benefits by the Secretary to veterans.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511(a). As a \u201cdecision ... affectfing]\u201d the provision of benefits, the challenged order was subject to Section 511(a) of the VJRA, and as a result, the district court\u2014 in both cases \u2014 was required to determine whether Section 511(a) prohibited judicial review of the VAMC\u2019s order. Because the issue in both the 2003 and 2007 cases is whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over Irvin\u2019s challenge to the VAMC\u2019s 2003 order, the issue is an identical one.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">Irvin claims that the issues are different because he was challenging the VAMC\u2019s order in the 2003 Complaint, while he was suing for torts resulting from the VAMC\u2019s order in the 2007. We are unpersuaded. As an initial matter, Irvin does not delineate any new actions since the VAMC\u2019s 2003 order in the 2007 Complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, both complaints challenge the same 2003 order, regardless of the different causes of action Irvin ascribes to his claim. As the Supreme Court has held, \u201c[u]nder collateral estoppel, once a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision may preclude relit-igation of the issue in a suit on a different cause of action involving a party to the first case.\u201d <em>Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>(1980); <em>see also Shields v. Bellsouth Advertising and Pub. Co., </em>228 F.3d 1284, 1289 n. 7 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201ccollateral estop-pel does not require identity of the claim\u2014 so long as the issue was determined in the previous action and there is identity of the parties, that issue may not be re-litigated, even as part of a different claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">As for the next two prongs of the collateral estoppel test, the issue was \u201cactually litigated\u201d in the earlier lawsuit, and was \u201ccritical and necessary\u201d to the resolution of that suit. When ruling on the 2003 Complaint, the district court heard and decided that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to review the VAMC\u2019s 2003 order. Accordingly, the very same issue in this case \u2014 whether the district court had jurisdiction to adjudicate another challenge stemming from the VAMC\u2019s 2003 order\u2014 was \u201cactually litigated\u201d in the prior one. In addition, it was \u201ccritical and necessary\u201d to the resolution of that suit, since it meant that the district court was without jurisdiction and unable to proceed to the merits of the suit. As we have recognized, jurisdictional determinations are entitled to pre-clusive effect under the collateral estoppel doctrine. <em>See North Ga. Elec. Membership Corp. v. City of Calhoun, Ga., </em>989 F.2d 429, 433 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201cAlthough the dismissal of a complaint for lack of jurisdiction does not adjudicate the merits so as to make the case res judicata on the substance of the asserted claim, it does adjudicate the court\u2019s jurisdiction, and a second complaint cannot command a second consideration of the same jurisdictional claims.\u201d) (quotations omitted). In any event, based on the record before us, Irvin has no basis for his contention that the torts he now seeks to pursue in his 2007 Complaint had not yet occurred at the time of the 2003 Complaint. To the contrary, as the government points out, he brought a pain and suffering claim in an administrative action against the VA in 2003, <em>before </em>he filed his 2003 Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">As for the final prong of the collateral estoppel test, Irvin had a \u201cfull and fair opportunity\u201d to litigate the issue in the first lawsuit. Irvin was not only a party, but was given a full and fair opportunity to respond to the VAMC\u2019s argument that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the 2003 Complaint. Again, to the extent that Irvin argues that he was not given a full and fair opportunity to argue his tort claims in the earlier lawsuit, that is not the issue here. The issue\u2014 both then and now \u2014 is whether the district court had jurisdiction over a complaint challenging the VA\u2019s provision of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Irvin\u2019s other arguments contesting the district court\u2019s dismissal of his lawsuit on collateral estoppel grounds likewise fail. First, as the government argues, the 2007 Complaint was not dismissed on res judica-ta grounds, and it is therefore irrelevant whether that doctrine applies here. Second, because the district court properly dismissed the case on collateral estoppel grounds, it was unnecessary for the court to relitigate the very issue raised in the 2003 and 2007 Complaints \u2014 whether it had jurisdiction to review the VA\u2019s 2003 order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Third, contrary to Irvin\u2019s argument, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>VA did not waive a collateral estoppel defense \u2014 among other things, we have held that a party does not typically waive collateral estoppel unless it proceeds to trial without having raised it, and that has not occurred here. <em>See North Ga. Elec. Membership, </em>989 F.2d at 432 (\u201cdefendants deemed to have waived a defense of ... collateral estoppel generally raise[ ] the issue for the first time quite late in the proceedings \u2014 after a trial has been lost, or on appeal\u201d) (citations omitted). Finally, the fact that the district court\u2019s dismissal of the 2003 Complaint was without prejudice is irrelevant for purposes of collateral estoppel. <em>See Christo, </em>223 F.3d at 1339 n. 47 (\u201cThe rules of res judicata are applicable only when a final judgment is rendered. However, for purposes of issue preclusion (as distinguished from merger and bar), \u2018final judgment\u2019 includes any pri- or adjudication of an issue in another action that is determined to be sufficiently firm to be accorded conclusive effect.\u201d) (quoting Rest. (2d) Judg. \u00a7 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-11\">. Irvin does vaguely list several torts arising after the 2003 order in other parts of his initial brief, but \u201d[i]ssues that clearly are not designated in the initial brief ordinarily are considered abandoned.\u201d <em>Hartsfield v. Lemacks, </em>50 F.3d 950, 953 (11th Cir.1995) (quotations omitted). Moreover, all the potential torts he lists \u2014 negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress because the VA's order was without expert review and against expert advice, and the VA allowed the pump to go into emergency status for six months: reckless conduct, negligence, and medical malpractice because the VA failed to review medical records before removing the pump, failed to have other treatment options in place, and failed to communicate risks and choices to Irvin; and pain and suffering due to the attempted removal of the pump \u2014 involve the VAMC's 2003 order, and more broadly, are \u201cquestions of law and fact necessary to [the VA\u2019s] decision ... affectfing] the provision of benefits by the Secretary to\u201d Irvin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-5\">. Moreover, <em>Thomas v. Principi, </em>394 F.3d 970, 974 (D.C.Cir.2005) \u2014 which allowed a plaintiff to bring a tort claim against the VA for failing to notify the plaintiff of a schizophrenia diagnosis \u2014 does not help Irvin's argument, because as the D.C. Circuit realized, \u201cnone of the[plaintiff\u2019s] claims alleges that the VA failed to pay for treatment (or even provide for treatment) [nor do] they raise ... 'questions of law [or] fact necessary lo a decision by the Secretary under a law that affects the provision of benefits,\u201d and thus did not trigger Section 511(a). Here, however, as discussed earlier, Irvin\u2019s claim in both tire 2003 and 2007 Complaints is based upon a decision affecting the VA's provision of benefits to Irvin \u2014 its 2003 order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
