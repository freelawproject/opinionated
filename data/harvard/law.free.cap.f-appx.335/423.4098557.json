Gricco asserts that his claims were properly brought pursuant to \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2241 petitions and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motions are \u201cindistinguishable.\u201d Alternatively, he denies that he challenges the legality of his convictions or sentences and contends that relief under \u00a7 2241 is his \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d for his ongoing illegal detention. He further alternatively contends that he has satisfied the requirements to proceed under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal de novo. <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). Grieeo\u2019s argument that \u00a7 2241 relief and \u00a7 2255 relief are indistinguishable is patently incorrect. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). Similarly unavailing is his argument that he is not challenging the validity of his convictions or sentences. The claims Gricco raises challenge the validity of his convictions and sentences, not the manner in which his sentences are being executed, and they therefore should have been brought in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Tolliver, </em>211 F.3d at 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-15\">A \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may nevertheless be entertained if the petitioner establishes, under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). The savings clause \u201capplies to a claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. In an effort to make the required showing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Griceo now cites two Supreme Court cases in support of his claims, <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988) and <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972). However, these cases are neither new, as they both predate Gricco\u2019s convictions, nor retroactively applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Grieco additionally asserts that he could not have raised his claims earlier as they were foreclosed by then-existing precedent, but he fails to identify any authority that would have foreclosed his claims had they been timely brought in a \u00a7 2255 motion. Thus, as the district court properly concluded, Gricco has not met the requirements to proceed under the savings clause. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Gricco\u2019s motions for the appointment of counsel and to allow attachments to his appellate brief are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
