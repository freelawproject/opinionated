Carlos PUPO, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b939-12\">No. 08-12177</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASM\">Non-Argument Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b939-13\">United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b939-14\">July 2, 2009.</decisiondate>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b939-22\">Before TJOFLAT, PRYOR and FAY, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b939-23\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b939-24\">On a plea of guilty, appellant was convicted on 19 counts of alien smuggling for the purpose of commercial advantage and private financial gain, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii), and the district court sentenced him to concurrent prison terms of 60 months with three years of supervised release. He now appeals his sentences, contending the district court erred by enhancing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6), because there was no evidence that: (1) he intended to create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person; (2) he operated the vessel; (3) the vessel was not seaworthy; and (4) any of the passengers were injured or at risk of injury. He also contends that the court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-25\">Regarding Sentencing Guideline issues, we review purely legal questions <em>de novo, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>and the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. In most cases, we afford \u201cdue deference\u201d to the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts. <em>United States v. White, </em>335 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2003). For a finding of fact to amount to clear error, we must be left \u201cafter reviewing all of the evidence, ... with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Foster, </em>155 F.3d 1329, 1331 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Section 2Ll.l(b)(6) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that if an alien smuggling, transporting, or harboring offense \u201cinvolved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person,\u201d the base offense level is increased by two levels, but if the resulting offense level is less than 18, the offense level is increased to 18. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6). Reckless conduct under this subsection \u201cincludes a wide variety of conduct (e.g., transporting persons in .the trunk or engine compartment of a motor vehicle, carrying substantially more passengers than the rated capacity of a motor vehicle or vessel, or harboring persons in a crowded, dangerous, or inhumane condition).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1, comment. (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Because the record shows that appellant recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person, the district court did not clearly err when it enhanced his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Section 2L1.1(b)(5)(A) of the Guidelines provides that \u201c[i]f a firearm was dis-chai'ged, increase by 6 levels, but if the resulting offense level is less than level 22, increase to level 22.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(A). Appellant argues that the court erred by enhancing his offense level, pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(5)(A) because: (1) he could not foresee that the pursuing vessel would shoot at his vessel; (2) he did not \u201cinduce or willfully cause\u201d the pursuing vessel to discharge its firearms; (3) Espinosa (his co-defendant) was in control of the vessel; (4) he told Espino-sa to stop the vessel; and (5) Count 20 of the indictment only charges Espinosa with failing to obey an order by an authorized federal law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">Section 2L1.1(b)(5)(A) concerns specific offense characteristics of the offense of smuggling, transporting, or harboring of an unlawful alien, and states, as noted above: \u201cIf a firearm was discharged, increase by 6 levels.\u201d Based on our decision in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>51 F.3d 1004, 1011 (11th Cir.1995), <em>overruled on other grounds, Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), concerning an analogous Guideline section, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(A), we conclude that the court did not err in applying the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">Appellant argues that, if we find that the district court erred by applying the \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) and \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(A) enhancements to his offense level, his sentence is unreasonable because it \u201cviolated the overriding principle and basic mandate of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d He also argues that, if the enhancements were not applied to his offense level, he would be entitled to a downward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">We review a sentence for \u201cunreasonable[ness].\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Supreme Court in <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), clarified that the reasonableness standard of review announced in <em>Booker </em>requires appellate courts to review the ultimate sentence imposed under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>When assessing a sentence, we \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range [or] ... failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Only after the district court correctly calculates the Guideline range, may it consider imposing a more severe or lenient sentence. <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 750 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), namely to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. The court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable Guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">We conclude that the court did not miscalculate the Guideline sentence range; thus, the court committed no procedural error. Moreover, appellant has failed to show that his concurrent sentences are substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
