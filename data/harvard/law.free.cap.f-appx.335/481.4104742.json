Because he has failed to brief the dismissal of his claim regarding the denial of medical treatment, that issue is deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">Johnson argues that the district court failed to properly weigh and assess the relevant factors regarding his claim of excessive force. Our review indicates that all of those factors weigh against Johnson\u2019s excessive-force claim. <em>See Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 5-7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). The record shows that there was a need for the application of force, Johnson ignored a clear warning regarding the need for force, and Captain Roger Lewis\u2019s use of force was a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline. As to his claim regarding denial of access to the courts, Johnson\u2019s arguments that he may have been prejudiced by the loss of certain legal materials fail to show the actual prejudice required to support his claim. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351-52, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">Regarding his due process claim, Johnson argues for the first time on appeal that the Rule Violation Report (RVR) issued by Captain Lewis, in conjunction with two other RVRs Johnson received on other occasions, resulted in his placement into D-custody- and administrative lockdown. That argument is not cognizable because it was not presented to the district court. <em>See LeMaire v. La. Dep\u2019t of Transp. &amp; Dev., </em>480 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.2007). Moreover, even if we were to consider that argument, it fails to implicate a protected liberty interest because Johnson\u2019s placement into D-custody and administrative lockdown do not present atypical, significant deprivations in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 486, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Wilson v. Budney, </em>976 F.2d 957, 958 (5th Cir.1992). As the district court\u2019s dismissal of Johnson\u2019s complaint was therefore proper, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. <em>See Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The district court\u2019s dismissal of Johnson\u2019s complaint counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Johnson has already accumulated at least two other strikes. <em>See Johnson v. Dorsey, </em>No. 4:08-CV-00023 (N.D.Miss. Apr. 4, 2008); <em>Johnson v. Presley, </em>No. 4:07-CV-00105, 2007 WL 2159311 (N.D.Miss. July 26, 2007). Johnson is therefore barred from proceeding in forma pauperis pursuant to \u00a7 1915 while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">AFFIRMED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b504-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
