On appeal, Lyons argues that he was eligible for a reduction pursuant to Amendment 706, and the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on the ground that his sentence was based upon an enhanced statutory mandatory life term of imprisonment. Moreover, he contends, the government\u2019s 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 information, which was filed during his trial and notified him of the government\u2019s intent to seek enhanced penalties, was defective. In addition, he asserts that the district court had the authority to reduce his sentence pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and that his sentence was enhanced based on facts not found by the jury, in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may reduce the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements provide that \u201ca reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with this policy statement if\u2019 a retroactive amendment applies to the defendant, but \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Here, Lyons was sentenced based on a range that was determined by application of a statutory mandatory life term of imprisonment, resulting in a sentence that was ultimately based on something other than the crack cocaine offense level calculation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). Accordingly, Amendment 706 did not affect his sentencing range, and the district court correctly found that he was precluded from a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339-42 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">As to Lyons\u2019s remaining arguments, we have made clear that: (1) where a defendant is not eligible for sentence reduction under the Amendment, <em>Booker </em>does not provide an independent basis for relief, <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009); and (2) <em>\u201cBooker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664). Moreover, we have held that \u201ca sentencing adjustment undertaken pursuant to Section 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing,\u201d and <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis in original). As a result, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
