Rome now brings claims against the sheriff of Tangipahoa Parish and the arresting deputies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and Louisiana law, arguing that he was illegally arrested and maliciously prosecuted. Defendants moved for summary judgment, and the district court obliged. Because the court correctly determined that defendants had probable cause to arrest Rome and that the record presents no genuine issue of fact suggesting otherwise, we affirm the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">On May 5, 2005, Terri Rome, Jerry Rome\u2019s daughter, called the Ponchatoula Police Department dispatcher and the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriffs Department dispatcher and told them that she had just confronted her father about his earlier arrest for soliciting prostitution and that he thereafter left in his pick-up truck with a loaded handgun saying that he was going to hunt down the officer that arrested him. The Ponchatoula dispatcher confirmed that Officer John Cieutat had arrested Rome on February 5, 2005, for soliciting prostitution and notified all officers on duty to be on the lookout for Rome.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">Deputy Terry Guillory was then dispatched to Rome\u2019s house. There, he interviewed Terri and Rome\u2019s ex-wife, Dixie Catoire. Both women provided written statements describing how Rome reacted by becoming angry after Terri confronted him with the fact of his February arrest, how he stated that he was going to hunt down the officer who had arrested him and \u201ctake care of all the lies about him,\u201d how he obtained and loaded his handgun, and how he left in his black Chevy Silverado pick-up truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">Deputy Henry Neihaus, after hearing of these events over the radio, encountered Rome\u2019s pick-up truck on the road and performed a traffic stop near Ponchatoula High School, which is roughly two miles from the Ponchatoula Police Department. After Rome\u2019s truck was stopped, Deputy Dale Athmann arrived and observed a fully loaded handgun on the console of Rome\u2019s truck. Deputy Guillory then appeared, and Rome was arrested for simple assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-15\">Rome later filed this civil suit against Sheriff Daniel Edwards and Deputies Guil-lory, Athmann, and Neihaus (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. He alleged claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, arguing that Defendants violated his Fourth Amendment rights by illegally arresting him without probable cause and by employing excessive force. Additionally, he brought state-law claims, asserting that he was illegally arrested and maliciously prosecuted. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the record evidence showed that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>were entitled to qualified immunity from the \u00a7 1983 claims and that the state-law claims failed because Defendants had probable cause to arrest Rome and because they had not used excessive force. Rome filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, asserting otherwise. The district court ruled in favor of Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Rome filed a timely notice of appeal. He challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 claim that he was illegally arrested without probable cause and the court\u2019s dismissal of his state-law claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s order granting Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and apply the same standard as did the district court. <em>Cornerstone Christian Sch. v. Univ. Interscholastic League, </em>563 F.3d 127, 133 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cWe will affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment \u2018if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">All of Rome\u2019s claims will fail if the district court correctly determined that Defendants possessed probable cause to arrest Rome and that no genuine issue exists as to that determination. To overcome Defendants\u2019 qualified immunity defense<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to Rome\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim that he was arrested in violation of the Fourth Amendment, Rome must make a showing of no probable cause. <em>See Club Retro, </em>568 F.3d at 204 (\u201cThe constitutional claim of false arrest requires a showing of no probable cause.\u201d). Similarly, both of Rome\u2019s state law claims \u2014 false arrest and malicious prosecution \u2014 require, among other things, a showing of no probable cause. <em>See Deville v. Marcantel, </em>567 F.3d 156, 172-73 (5th Cir.2009) (explaining (1) that false arrest occurs when an officer arrests an individual without statutory authority and that, absent a warrant, the officer has such authority when he has \u201cprobable cause for the arrest,\u201d and (2) that an element of the state-law claim of malicious prosecution requires \u201cthe absence of probable cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">\u201cProbable cause exists when the totality of the facts and circumstances within a police officer\u2019s knowledge at the moment of arrest are sufficient for a reasonable person to conclude that the suspect had committed or was committing an offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164; <em>see also Club Retro, </em>568 F.3d at 204 (\u201cThe Supreme Court has defined probable cause as the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge that are sufficient to warrant a prudent person, or one of reasonable caution, in believing, in the circumstances shown, that the suspect has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">Defendants assert, and the district court agreed, that they had probable cause to arrest Rome for simple assault. \u201cSimple assault is an assault committed without a dangerous weapon,\u201d La.Rev.Stat. Ann. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\u00a7 14:38, and \u201c[a]ssault is an attempt to commit a battery,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 14:36. Battery, in turn, \u201cis the intentional use of force or violence upon the person of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 14:33. A crime is attempted when \u201c[a]ny person who, having a specific intent to commit a crime, does or omits an act for the purpose of and tending directly toward the accomplishing of his object,\u201d regardless of \u201cwhether, under the circumstances, he would have actually accomplished his purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 14:27(A). The statute further delineates what does and does not constitute an attempt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">Mere preparation to commit a crime shall not be sufficient to constitute an attempt; but ... searching for the intended victim with a dangerous weapon with the intent to commit a crime, shall be sufficient to constitute an attempt to commit the offense intended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 14:27(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In this case, the district court determined that Defendants had probable cause to arrest Rome and that the record raised no genuine issue as to that determination. We agree. The summary judgment evidence . demonstrates that Defendants knew: (1) that Rome stated he was going to the Ponchatoula Police Department to shoot the officer who had arrested him in February; (2) that Rome loaded his handgun before leaving the house; (3) that he took his gun with him when he left the house in his pick-up truck; and (4) that Rome had his gun with him when he was pulled over nearly two miles from the Pon-chatoula Police Department. Based on this knowledge, a prudent person would believe that Rome was committing assault \u2014 that is, attempted battery \u2014 because he was searching for his intended victim with a dangerous weapon and with the intent to use force or violence on that victim. Rome points to no fact that would raise a genuine issue as to this conclusion, and, indeed, we find nothing in the record suggesting that a genuine issue exists concerning Defendants\u2019 probable cause to arrest Rome. Thus, summary judgment in favor of Defendants is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Rome argues that the district court reached its conclusion by improperly \u201cbootstrapping\u201d its reasoning from a determination that Rome committed the nonexistent offense of attempted assault. However, Rome misconstrues and misunderstands the district court\u2019s explanation. The court did not conclude that Rome committed an attempted assault. Instead, it properly looked at the definition of attempt in \u00a7 14:27 to determine what constitutes an attempted battery. In fact, it explicitly recognized that attempted assault is not an offense because assault is, among other things, attempted battery. <em>See State v. Eames, </em>365 So.2d 1361, 1363 (La.1978) (\u201cIf the definition of another crime includes the attempt to do something, the attempt statute, [\u00a7 ] 14:27, cannot be employed, for then a defendant would be charged with an attempt to attempt to do an illegal act.\u201d). We find no flaw in the district court\u2019s reasoning, and Rome fails to provide any authority suggesting that assault, as an attempted battery, cannot be determined by looking to \u00a7 14:27. On the contrary, the Reporter\u2019s Comment to \u00a7 14:36, which defines assault, specifically references \u00a7 14:27 in discussing assault as an attempted battery. <em>See </em>La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14:36 cmt. (stating that \u201c[a]ny attempt to commit a battery will constitute an assault\u201d and referencing \u00a7 14:27\u2019s \u201cdiscussion of\u2018attempts\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Rome additionally urges that the district court\u2019s conclusion found a violation of \u00a7 14:27 itself. This argument, again, ignores the district court\u2019s actual reasoning, and therefore fails for the same reasons stated above: the court correctly looked to \u00a7 14:27 to determine whether the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>had probable cause to believe an assault was about to be or was being committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-2\">Because the record raises no genuine issue concerning the conclusion that Defendants had probable cause to arrest Rome, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Rome\u2019s \u00a7 1983 and state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b448-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\">. Rome does not challenge the court's conclusion concerning his excessive force claim, which is therefore waived. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>509 F.3d 682, 693 n. 10 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b449-9\">. Qualified immunity involves a two-prong test: first, did Defendants violate the constitution under current law; second, were Defendants\u2019 actions objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law as it existed at the time of the alleged violations. <em>See Club Retro LLC v. Hilton, </em>568 F.3d 181, 203-06 (5th Cir.2009). Here, the analysis begins and ends with the first prong because we conclude, as did the district court, that no fact issue exists suggesting that a constitutional violation occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
