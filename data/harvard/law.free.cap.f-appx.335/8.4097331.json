He was convicted in 1993 on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>three counts of an indictment: conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, Count One; attempting to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, Count Two; and using and carrying a firearm in relation to a drug offense, Count Three. The court sentenced him to concurrent prison terms of 360 months on Count One, 240 months on Count Two, and life on Count Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">In March 2008, Brewster moved the district court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to cocaine base.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court granted his motion in part by reducing his adjusted offense level for the Count One offense from 42 to 40 and his sentence range from 360 months to life to 292 to 365 months and then resentencing him on Count One to a prison term of 292 months. Brewster now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">In his opening brief, Brewster argues that his Count One sentence is unreasonable, and that the district court erred in refusing to sentence him below the minimum of the amended Guidelines sentence range \u2014 despite his presentation of mitigating factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and documents showing his post-sentencing rehabilitative achievements \u2014 in light of the advisory nature of the Guidelines under <em>United States v. Booker,. </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">While we review the sentence initially imposed by the district court for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1321 (11th Cir.2008), reasonableness review does not apply in the present context because a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding does not constitute a full re-sentencing, <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). Instead, \u201c[w]e review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentence range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In addressing a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the court must engage in a two-part analysis: (1) by recalculating the sentence based on the amendment, \u201cleaving] all other guideline application decisions unaffected;\u201d and (2) by exercising its discretion, based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, to impose a new sentence or to retain the original. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements provide that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court (1) struck down the statutory provisions that made the Sentencing Guidelines mandatory (the procedural holding), 543 U.S. at 245, 258-60, 125 S.Ct. at 756-57, 764-65, and (2) reaffirmed that, under the Sixth Amendment, \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>viction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (the substantive holding), <em>id. </em>at 244, 125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">To the extent that Brewster claims his sentence runs afoul of the advisory nature of the Guidelines, in accordance with <em>Booker\u2019s </em>procedural holding, the court did not err by declining to reduce his sentence further, because it was not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 to make such a reduction. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664). In addition, to the extent that he seeks to challenge his sentence as unreasonable under <em>Booker, </em>such review does not apply where, as here, a defendant is not subject to a full resen-tencing. <em>See Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. Finally, to the extent, if any, that Brewster seeks to challenge the Sixth Amendment constitutionality of any aspect of his original sentence under <em>Booker\u2019s </em>substantive holding, his argument is not properly before us because he raised it for the first time in his reply brief, <em>see United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1242-43 (11th Cir.2004) (noting that issues not raised in the appellant\u2019s initial brief normally will be considered abandoned), and, in any event, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not the proper vehicle for such a challenge, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (governing collateral attacks to sentences).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-8\">. We interpret Brewster's request for relief under the November 1, 2007 amendment to \u00a7 2D1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines as a claim under Amendment 706, as the district court apparently did, even though he referred t\u00f3 this enactment in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as \"Amendment <em>9.\" See Gomez-Diaz v. United States, </em>433 F.3d 788, 791 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that we must liberally construe the pleadings of a <em>pro se </em>petitioner).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
