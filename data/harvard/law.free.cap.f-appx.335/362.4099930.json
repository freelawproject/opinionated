The district court dismissed Isom\u2019s in for-ma pauperis (IFP) suit sua sponte for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-24\">A district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim is reviewed under the same de novo standard as a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 734 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must plead \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vanderbrook v. Unitrin Preferred Ins. Co. (In re Katrina Canal Breaches </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>Litigation), </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1230, 170 L.Ed.2d 63 <em>and </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1231, 170 L.Ed.2d 63 (2008) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Isom argues that the district court erred by dismissing his suit because the defendants\u2019 failure to provide him with safe equipment violated his due process rights. However, as the district court held, the defendants may not be held liable for their alleged negligent acts under \u00a7 1983. <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 328, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986) (\u201c[T]he Due Process Clause is simply not implicated by a <em>negligent </em>act of an official causing unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty, or property.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Isom also contends that he was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Isom has not alleged that the defendants were aware that his backpack was defective; he has failed to allege that defendants were aware of any facts from which an inference of risk to his health could be drawn. His Eighth Amendment claim is thus not plausible on its face. <em>See Burleson v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>393 F.3d 577, 589 (5th Cir.2004); <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Isom\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for failure to state a claim counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Isom is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-17\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
