The district court denied Scales\u2019 motion because, among other reasons, he was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-21\">Scales was convicted of conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and \u00a7 846. Before trial, the government filed a notice of its intent to seek enhanced penalties under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 based on Scales\u2019 three previous convictions for drug offenses. For Scales, the enhanced penalty was a minimum sentence of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Scales was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-22\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). The sentencing guidelines provide that \u201ca reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2)\u201d if a retroactive amendment applies to the defendant but \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range \u2022 because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt n.l(A). A defendant is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706 when his sentence is based on a statutory mandatory minimum and not on the guideline range. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339-40 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">Because Scales was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment, Amendment 706 has no effect on his sentencing range and he therefore is not eligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See id. </em>The district court therefore lacked the authority to reduce Seales sentence under \u00a7 3582.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
