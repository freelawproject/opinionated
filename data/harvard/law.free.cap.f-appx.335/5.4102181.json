Rivers, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his <em>pro se </em>motion for a sentence reduction, which he filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Rivers\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 709, which generally affected the calculation of a defendant\u2019s criminal history score. On appeal, Rivers argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because, as a clarifying amendment, Amendment 709 retroactively applied to reduce his guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-24\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may mod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>ify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in \u00a7 1B1.10, state that a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if \u201cnone of the amendments listed in subsection (c) is applicable to the defendant....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(A). Amendment 709 is not listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Here, Rivers was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on Amendment 709 because Amendment 709 is not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(A); <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 907-08 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that the district court did not err in determining that the defendant\u2019s sentence could not be reduced under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when the amendment at issue was not listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c)). To the extent that Rivers argues that Amendment 709 applies retroactively because it is a clarifying amendment, his argument fails because we have held that, while consideration of a clarifying amendment \u201cmay be necessary in the direct appeal of a sentence or in a petition under [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255, it bears no relevance to determining retroactivity under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d at 908-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
