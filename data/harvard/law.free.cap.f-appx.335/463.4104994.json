She argues that her removal proceedings should have been reopened because counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to establish her eligibility for cancellation of removal based upon the hardship of her removal on her spouse. She also argues that the BIA erred in not tolling her voluntary departure period during the pendency of her motion to reopen and in not ruling on her motion to reopen before her voluntary departure period expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">We do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that a petitioner does not qualify for relief from removal under the hardship provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). We do have jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law raised upon a petition for review. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">This court has assumed, without deciding, that an alien\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance may implicate due process concerns under the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Mai v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475-76 and n. 2 (5th Cir.2004). Because Rodriguez\u2019s claim of attorney ineffectiveness relates solely to her eligibility for discretionary relief, however, her claim does not amount to a due process violation. <em>Assaad, </em>378 F.3d at 474-76. Her petition for review of the denial of her motion to reopen based upon her ineffective assistance claim is therefore denied for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 476. We also lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision not to sua sponte reopen Rodriguez\u2019s removal proceedings. <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 249-50 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The BIA was without authority to extend Rodriguez\u2019s voluntary departure period. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b); <em>Dada v. Mukasey, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 128 S.Ct. 2307, 2316, 171 L.Ed.2d 178 (2008); <em>Banda-Ortiz v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 387, 388, 390-91 (5th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rodriguez did not seek to withdraw her request for voluntary departure prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period. <em>See Dada, </em>128 S.Ct. at 2318-20. Thus, the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to toll the voluntary departure period was not error. Rodriguez provides no support for her concluso-ry argument that the BIA should have ruled on her motion to reopen prior to the expiration of her voluntary departure period. Accordingly, that argument is deemed waived as inadequately briefed. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b485-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\">. The Department of Justice's recent amendments to regulations regarding voluntary departure, effective January 20, 2009, apply prospectively only, not retroactively. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(b)(3)(iii) and (e)(1); Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion To Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 73 Fed.Reg. 76,936, (Dec. 18, 2008). Thus, the new regulations do not apply in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
