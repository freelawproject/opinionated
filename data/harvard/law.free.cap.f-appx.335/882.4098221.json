After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-22\">Hawes is serving a life sentence for murder, armed robbery, aggravated assault and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. Hawes was convicted in 1977 and paroled in 1993. On October 28, 1998, after a hearing, the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles (\u201cParole Board\u201d) revoked Hawes\u2019s parole for failing to carry out his parole officer\u2019s instructions to participate in mental health counseling and to maintain gainful employment. On the same date, the Parole Board notified Hawes of the decision by letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-23\">On March 5, 2005, Hawes filed this \u00a7 2254 petition challenging the revocation of his parole. The district court dismissed the \u00a7 2254 petition as successive and time-barred. We conclude that the district court correctly dismissed Hawes\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as barred by the one-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAED-PA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214. Thus, we do not address the district court\u2019s alternative conclusion that Hawes\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>\u00a7 2254 petition was successive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">The AEDPA imposes a one-year statute of limitations on petitions filed pursuant to \u00a7 2254. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). When, as here, the petitioner is challenging a parole board decision, the limitations period begins to run on \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d <em>See Brown v. Barrow, </em>512 F.3d 1304, 1307 &amp; n. 1 (11th Cir.2008) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Here, on October 28, 1998, the Parole Board revoked Hawes\u2019s parole and sent him a letter notifying him of the decision. Thus, Hawes\u2019s deadline for filing a federal habeas petition was October 28, 1999. <em>See Brown, </em>512 F.3d at 1307-08 (concluding that, for a Georgia prisoner serving a life sentence, the AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period begins to run when the Parole Board\u2019s decision is made and that subsequent requests for reconsideration do \u201cnot affect the finality [of the Parole Board\u2019s decision] or otherwise toll the limitations period\u201d). However, Hawes\u2019s \u00a7 2254 was not filed until March 5, 2005, over five years after the limitations period expired. Thus, unless the one-year limitations period was tolled, Hawes\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">AEDPA\u2019s limitations period is tolled for the \u201ctime during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment dr claim is pending.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). However, \u201ca state court petition ... that is filed following the expiration of the federal limitations period cannot toll that period because there is no period remaining to be tolled.\u201d <em>Tinker v. Moore, </em>255 F.3d 1331, 1333 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted). Therefore, if a state habeas petition is properly filed more than one year after the \u00a7 2244 statute of limitations began to run, a subsequent federal habeas petition will be time-barred notwithstanding the properly filed state habe-as petition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Hawes filed two possible tolling documents between the time that his parole was revoked and his \u00a7 2254 petition was filed. First, on October 14, 2002, Hawes filed a state habeas petition. Because the one-year limitations period already had expired on October 28, 1999, Hawes\u2019s state habeas petition did not toll the statute of limitations. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2); <em>Tinker, </em>255 F.3d at 1333.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Second, Hawes claims he filed a petition for a writ of mandamus with the Fulton County Superior Court in either October 2001 or October 2002.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record does not contain a copy of Hawes\u2019s mandamus petition. The only record evidence pertaining to Hawes\u2019s alleged petition for mandamus is a February 15, 2002 order by the Superior Court denying his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>request to file a mandamus petition <em>in forma paupe\u00f1s. </em>Specifically, the order states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-5\">Pursuant to O.C.G.A. Section 9 \u2014 15\u20142(d), the Court finds that the pleading has such a complete absence of any justicia-ble issue of fact or law that it cannot be reasonably believed that a court could grant relief. Accordingly, Petitioner\u2019s request to file the pleading, in forma pauperis, is DENIED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Thus, the record is silent as whether and when Hawes actually ever filed his state mandamus petition and what its contents might have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">In his district court pleadings, Hawes stated that he mailed the state mandamus petition and it was returned by the United States Postal Service in March 2003 in an envelope \u201cobviously not mailed from [the] court\u201d and with a handwritten notation \u201cNo Sender\u2019s Address; Return to Sender.\u201d According to Hawes, the returned mandamus petition did not have a file number and had not been served on the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">This Court has not yet addressed whether a state mandamus petition challenging a Parole Board decision constitutes an \u201capplication for State post-conviction or other collateral review\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(2). <em>See Brown, </em>512 F.3d at 1308 n. 2 (noting that \u201ca properly filed State mandamus petition would probably toll the limitations period,\u201d but declining to address the question). We need not reach the issue because Hawes has not presented any evidence that his alleged mandamus petition was either \u201cfiled\u201d or \u201cproperly filed\u201d within the AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period that ended October 28, 1999. <em>See Webster v. Moore, </em>199 F.3d 1256, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2000) (placing burden on habeas petitioner to show post-conviction motions were properly filed and thus tolled AEDPA\u2019s limitations period under \u00a7 2244(d)(2)). Thus, Hawes has not shown that his \u00a7 2254 petition is saved by the statutory tolling provision of \u00a7 2244(d)(2). For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hawes\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-7\">.The certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) granted by the district court limited the issues on appeal to whether a 2001 letter Hawes wrote to the district court was an initial federal habeas corpus petition and whether the instant \u00a7 2254 petition was either successive or time-barred. Thus, we do not address the other arguments Hawes raises relating to the merits of his parole revocation, which are outside the scope of the COA. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b906-11\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's determinations that a petition for federal habeas corpus relief is time-barred under \u00a7 2244(d) and that the limitations period was not tolled. <em>Steed v. Head, </em>219 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b906-12\">. Hawes's objection to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation stated that Hawes filed his state mandamus petition in October 2001. However, Hawes's motion for reconsideration stated that the state mandamus petition was filed in October 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
