Alvarez argues that the immigration judge erred by denying her application for cancellation of removal be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>cause her removal would impose an exceptional and extremely undue hardship on her United States-born, minor children. The Government argues that this court lacks jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s order dismissing Alvarez\u2019s appeal because she failed to file a timely petition for review from that decision. The Government further arg-ues that Alvarez has waived any challenge to the denial of her motion for reconsideration by failing to brief the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Alvarez did not file a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s April 23, 2008 order dismissing her appeal. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394-95, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Guevara v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 173, 176 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision dismissing her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Although Alvarez\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion for reconsideration is timely filed, she raises no issue with respect to the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion for reconsideration. Issues that are not briefed are waived. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">For the foregoing reasons, Alvarez\u2019s petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b502-18\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
