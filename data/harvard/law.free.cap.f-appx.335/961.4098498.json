Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 (later amended by Amendment 711) to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses by two levels. On appeal, Johnson argues that the district court erred in not reducing her sentence below her amended guideline range. Although U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) purports to limit a district court\u2019s authority to grant such a reduction, Johnson contends that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>section, like all other provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines, was rendered advisory by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-17\">We \u201creview <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may reduce the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Nevertheless, any such sentence reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements provide that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-18\">Johnson\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by precedent. In <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009), we held that <em>Booker </em>applies only to original sentencing proceedings and is not applicable to proceedings under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Consequently, a district court is bound by the limitations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-21\">In this case, the district court found that Johnson had an amended guideline range of 41 to 51 months, and resentenced her to the low end of that range, 41 months. Johnson\u2019s request for a further sentence reduction below her amended guideline range was precluded by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) and by our court\u2019s opinion in <em>Melvin. </em>Therefore, the district court did not err in declining to resentence Johnson below her amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
