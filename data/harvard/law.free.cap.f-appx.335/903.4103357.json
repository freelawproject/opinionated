On appeal, Padilla-Urbina argues that the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, specifically, whether there was an unwarranted sentencing disparity between his nine-month sentence and the six-month sentence of his co-conspirator, Cecilia Diaz-Hernandez. He contends that, although the underlying facts were the same, his sentence was 50 percent higher than that of Diaz-Hernandez. He also asserts that his sentence was unreasonable, given that the district court failed to address the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-23\">We review \u201call sentences \u2014 whether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range \u2014 under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we must review the sentencing process for both procedural error and substantive reasonableness. <em>Livesay, </em>525 F.3d at 1091. Procedural errors occur when the district court fails to calculate or improperly calculates the guidelines range, treats the guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>It is sufficient for the district court to acknowledge that it has considered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) factors, but it need not explicitly discuss each of them. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). We examine substantive reasonableness \u201cunder an abuse of discretion standard, taking into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Livesay, </em>525 F.3d at 1091 (quotations omitted). Our reasonableness review is deferential, and requires that we \u201cevaluate whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The party challenging the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection,\u201d namely, to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, pimteet the public from future crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). \u201cDisparity between the sentences imposed on codefendants is generally not an appropriate basis for relief on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Regueiro, </em>240 F.3d 1321, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">We have recognized that \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Necessarily, there are also \u201csentences outside the range of reasonableness that do not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553(a) and that thus the district court may not impose.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir.2006). Although a sentence within the advisory guidelines range is not per <em>se </em>reasonable, we would ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788; <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 345-49, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-63, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (noting that a sentence within the properly calculated Guidelines range \u201csignificantly increases the likelihood that the sentence is a reasonable one.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">The record here demonstrates that the district court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and sentenced Padilla-Urbina within the guidelines range. Contrary to Padilla-Urbina\u2019s contention, that the record also demonstrates that the district court considered the three-month disparity between Padilla-Urbina\u2019s sentence and that of his co-conspirator, and explained why Padilla-Urbina deserved a higher sentence, given that he was the \u201csoul and inspiration\u201d of the smuggling operation. Moreover, we conclude that Padilla-Urbina has not satisfied his burden of establishing that his sentence was unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm Padilla-Urbina\u2019s nine-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
