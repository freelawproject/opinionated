Thereafter, the BIA affirmed and adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not clearly erroneous. On appeal, Lin con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>tends that he was eligible for withholding of removal and CAT relief based on his claim that he would be persecuted for violating China\u2019s family-planning policies. In those arguments, however, Lin fails to attack the IJ\u2019s determination that he failed to provide credible evidence to support his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">As an initial matter, Lin originally sought asylum relief, but in his brief before us, Lin has not argued this issue and has therefore abandoned it. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283 n. 12 (11th Cir.2001) (stating that issues not argued in the initial brief on appeal are deemed abandoned). In addition, Lin did not properly raise his claim for CAT relief before the BIA, and we dismiss this portion of his petition for review. <em>See Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1253 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that we lacked jurisdiction over a claim when the petitioner did not discuss the merits of the claim, resulting in failure to exhaust available administrative remedies).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Nreka v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>408 F.3d 1361, 1368 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284). In this case, the BIA both expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision and made its own observations, so we review both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">To the extent the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). However, factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the ... decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (quotation omitted). Thus, a finding of fact will be reversed \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal....\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201c[T]he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary....\u201d). In addition we \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-10\">We may not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ and BIA with respect to credibility findings. <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818. \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the ... credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-11\">The IJ must make an explicit, or \u201cclean,\u201d determination that an applicant\u2019s testimony is not credible, which will be viewed as conclusive unless a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). A comment on the sufficiency of the evidence concerning a certain point, without more, may not constitute a sufficient credibility finding. <em>See id. </em>at 1201 (holding that an IJ\u2019s statement that an applicant\u2019s testimony was \u201cextremely inconsistent and [made] absolutely no sense whatsoever\u201d was not a clean credibility finding but a comment on the sufficiency of the evidence). Furthermore, if the IJ does not make a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>finding as to credibility, the petitioner\u2019s testimony is presumed to be credible. <em>See Niftaliev v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2007) (finding that the IJ stated the petitioner was not incredible and testimony was consistent with the application).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Indications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments. <em>See In re B</em>\u2014 , 21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 66, 70 (BIA 1995). An adverse credibility determination alone may be the basis for denying an asylum application if the applicant produces no evidence other than his testimony. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. If the applicant produces evidence then it must also be considered by the IJ, and the IJ may not rely solely on an adverse credibility determination in denying relief in those instances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">An IJ or the BIA may require a petitioner to present corroborating evidence. Under the REAL ID Act of 2005, \u201c[n]o court shall reverse a determination made by a trier of fact with respect to the availability of corroborating evidence ... unless the court finds ... that a reasonable trier of fact is compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable.\u201d Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B, \u00a7 101(e), 119 Stat. 231, 305 (2005). This provision is retroactively applicable to all cases in which the final administrative order was issued before, on, or after May 11, 2005, the effective date of the REAL ID Act of 2005, and thus, it applies to Lin. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 101(h)(3), 119 Stat. at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">The IJ listed numerous inconsistencies among Lin\u2019s testimony, his 2001 Application, and his 1994 Application. The IJ also determined that Lin had failed to present credible evidence of the number of children he had and whether or not his wife was sterilized. The specific inconsistencies cited by the IJ and BIA are supported by the record, given that Lin did not mention the existence of his second daughter until after he initially filed the 2001 Application, as well as the fact that Lin\u2019s 1994 Application put him in the United States at the time of the child\u2019s alleged date of conception and birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">Because substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s determinations that Lin failed to provide credible evidence with regard to his withholding of removal claim, we deny this portion of the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">Upon review of the record on appeal, and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-11\">PETITION DISMISSED, IN PART, AND DENIED, IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
