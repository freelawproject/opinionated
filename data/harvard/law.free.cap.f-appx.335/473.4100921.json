He appeals <em>pro se </em>the decision of the United States Tax Court granting the Government\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and assessing his tax deficiency at $21,322 with additional penalties totaling $7,465. Even though we construe Armbruster\u2019s pleadings and arguments liberally, <em>Longoria v. Dretke, </em>507 F.3d 898, 901 (5th Cir.2007), he failed to argue below any of the issues he raises on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Armbruster\u2019s appeal presents three arguments, none of which were presented to the Tax Court, where he also proceeded <em>pro se. </em>Armbruster\u2019s response to the Government\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings did not contain any argument why the Government\u2019s calculation of a deficiency was incorrect factually or as a matter of law. Instead, he accused the Government\u2019s attorneys of violating ethical rales and asserted merely that he had \u201cassigned error\u201d to the Government\u2019s assessment of a deficiency. Such a general assertion, devoid of any factual or legal argument, even from a <em>pro se </em>party, will not preserve an argument on appeal. <em>See Stearman v. Comm\u2019r, </em>436 F.3d 533, 537 (5th Cir.2006) (affirming a dismissal of a <em>pro se </em>tax complaint for failure to raise arguments below in response to the government\u2019s motion to dismiss). The only other pleading in the record, Armbruster\u2019s petition for determination of a deficiency, asserts two frivolous arguments that he has abandoned on appeal. Arguments raised for the first time on appeal are waived. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225, 227 (5th Cir.1993) (declining to consider issue raised for the first time on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>appellant). Accordingly, the judgment of the tax court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b496-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court, has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
