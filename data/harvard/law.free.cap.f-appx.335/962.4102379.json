The complaint was seeking relief of some kind with respect to Georgia statutes relating to the adjudication of minors as delinquent by juvenile courts, and committing them to the custody of the Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">On November 10, 2008, District Judge Robert L. Vining, Jr. granted the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motion for permission to file a more definite statement. In his order, he instructed appellant\u2019s counsel to file a complaint succinctly and clearly setting forth specific facts giving rise to each specific alleged constitutional violation, without any extraneous matter. Appellant\u2019s counsel then filed the sixth (6th) effort to state appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-13\">On May 6, 2009, the district court granted the defendants-appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss on the basis that the plaintiff-appellant, in her proposed sixth amended complaint, had still filed nothing more than a quintessential \u201crambling, prolix\u201d pleading, condemned by this court. In fact, we have specifically instructed district courts to prohibit, as fatally defective, shotgun pleadings similar to the one filed in this action. <em>See, e.g., Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol, </em>516 F.3d 955, 979 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Byrne v. Nezhat, </em>261 F.3d 1075, 1130 n. 108 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-14\">We have carefully reviewed the record and the tortured procedural history of this case. We commend the district judge for his diligent efforts in trying to obtain compliance with the requirements for drafting a proper pleading. Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b985-10\">. The plaintiff-appellant is styled as \u201cB.L.E., by and through her next friend and counsel, Sherri Jefferson; on her own behalf and on behalf of those similarly situated.\u201d While the State of Georgia was an original defendant, the styled defendants-appellees are four persons, Sonny Perdue, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Georgia; Albert Murray, in his individual capacity and in his official capacity as Commissioner of the Department of Juvenile Justice; Amy Howell, in her individual and official capacity as the Legal Services Director and in her official capacity with the Department of Juvenile Justice; and Rob Rosenbloom, in his official capacity with the Department of Juvenile Justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b985-18\">. Neither the district court or this court has been able to discern from the plaintiff's filings the substance of any complaints and neither court has passed upon any issues that might have been contained in adequate and proper pleading.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
