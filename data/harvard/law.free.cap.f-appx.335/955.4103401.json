He now appeals his sentence, contending that it is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing. Specifically, he argues that: (1) a sentence within the guidelines sentence range would have accomplished the goal of deterrence; (2) the district court failed to consider mitigating circumstances, such as the physical abuse he suffered as a child, his history of homelessness, and his history of depression and substance abuse; and (3) the district court placed too much weight on his previous offenses, which included more than 24 immigration violations and repeated drunk driving convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-23\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court held that sentences are to be reviewed for \u201cunreasonable[ness].\u201d Conducting such review, we \u201cmerely ask[ ] whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number><em>States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), appellate review for reasonableness is a two-step process. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Second, we consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Section 3553(a) provides that, in fashioning a sentence, district courts must consider: (1) the applicable Guidelines Sentence range; (2) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (4) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (5) the need for adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (6) protection of the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (7) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(6). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (quotations and alterations omitted). In imposing a reasonable sentence, a court may impose an upward variance based on conduct that has been accounted for in a sentencing enhancement. <em>See id. </em>at 833-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">\u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Here, the district court explicitly discussed many of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Fuentes-Villafranco\u2019s history and characteristics and the need to protect the public. Given, among other things, Fuentes-Villafranco\u2019s repeated disregard for the laws of the United States, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentence at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
