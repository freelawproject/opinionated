On appeal Nunez-Gutierrez and Mondragon-Garcia argue that: (1) the district court erred by issuing them three-level role enhancements pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b); and (2) them high-end of the guideline range sentences are unreasonable. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-20\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts <em>de novo. United States v. McGuinness, </em>451 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2006). We review the ultimate sentence the district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>\u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">First, we reject the appellants\u2019 argument that the district court erred by issuing them role enhancements. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, a district court may increase a defendant\u2019s offense level by three levels if \u201cthe defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). To qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the manager or supervisor of one or more participants. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2). A \u201cparticipant\u201d is \u201ca person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.l). If a defendant managed or supervised the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization, but did not manage or supervise another participant, a role enhancement is not warranted. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.2); <em>United States v. Glover, </em>179 F.3d 1300, 1302-03 (11th Cir.1999). To determine whether a crime was \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d the district court must consider \u201call persons involved during the course of the entire offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.3) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">A defendant\u2019s subordinate role to another individual does not absolve a defendant\u2019s role as a manager or supervisor. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>933 F.2d 1541, 1546-47 (11th Cir.1991). In another drug conspiracy ease, we held that a defendant who planned operational aspects of the smuggling effort, made unilateral decisions regarding landing, loading, and timing of trips, and had the responsibility of ensuring that the smuggling venture would succeed warranted a three-level role enhancement. <em>Id. </em>We held that the defendant had a supervisory role in coordinating and managing the delivery and transportation of drugs into the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 1547. We have also attributed a management enhancement to a defendant who hired others to work for the conspiracy, in addition to arranging drug transactions and negotiating sales with others. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>168 F.3d 1234, 1249 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">Here, Nunez-Gutierrez and Mondra-gon-Garcia do not dispute the number of conspiracy participants or the otherwise extensive nature of the conspiracy. Indeed, as the record shows, both Nunez-Gutierrez and Mondragon-Garcia hired senior level crew members, supervised the distribution of payments, and coordinated the transportation of cocaine through the use of legitimate freight shipping contracts. On this record, the district court did not clearly err by finding that Nunez-Gutierrez and Mondragon-Garcia were managers or supervisors of the MW Gatun and its eleven crew members.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">We likewise find no merit in the appellants\u2019 claim that their high-end of the guideline range sentences are unreasonable. In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 -including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>(2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If we conclude that the district court did not proeedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). We \u201cexpect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">\u201c[T]he district court must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). The \u201csentencing judge is not required to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d but \u201cshould set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cThe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">In this case, the district court did not make any procedural errors related to sentencing. The district court properly calculated Nunez and Mondragon\u2019s guideline imprisonment ranges and explicitly discussed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors during sentencing. Moreover, the court explained that, based on the goals of sentencing, it could have sentenced Nunez and Mondra-gon to sentences above the guideline range and would have been justified in sentencing them to substantially higher sentences. Additionally, the drug quantity properly influenced the district court\u2019s \u00a7 3553(a) analysis. The district court correctly noted that Nunez and Mondragon had attempted to import 19.5 tons of cocaine into the United States. In order to consider the need to impose a sentence that reflected the seriousness of cocaine smuggling, promoted respect for the law, provided just punishment for cocaine smuggling, and provided adequate deterrence to drug smugglers, the district court had to consider the amount of drugs in the instant case and the subsequent effects of those drugs. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(B). Furthermore, in order for the district court to consider the nature and circumstances of the complex cocaine smuggling conspiracy, it had to evaluate the quantity of drugs involved. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1). Thus, despite what Nunez and Mondragon argue, the district court had to consider the quantity of drugs involved in order to complete its \u00a7 3553(a) analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">The district court also imposed a substantively reasonable sentence based on the totality of the circumstances. First, Nunez and Mondragon were managers or supervisors of the freighter smuggling 19.5 tons of cocaine. Second, they were responsible for a quantity of cocaine that was over 100 times more than the minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>amount required for the highest possible base offense level awarded under the sentencing guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). Third, they were involved in one of the largest drug seizures in history. Fourth, the district court could have issued an upward departure based on the cocaine amount but chose not to. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.16) (stating that an upward departure above offense level 38 may be warranted when the quantity of drugs is \u201cat least ten times the minimum quantity required for level 38\u201d). Based on the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion by issuing sentences at the high end of the guideline imprisonment range.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Accordingly, we affirm both sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-6\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
