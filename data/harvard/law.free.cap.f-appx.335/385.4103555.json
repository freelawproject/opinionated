He contends that the district court unlawfully revoked supervised release based on hearsay evidence adduced in violation of his limited right to confront adverse witnesses. Castillo has served the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation, and the district court imposed no further term of supervised release. Therefore, Castillo has no \u201cconcrete and continuing injury,\u201d and there is no case or controversy over which this court may exercise jurisdiction under Article III, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution. <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 14, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). His appeal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
