On appeal, Austin argues that there was a \u201cjury question\u201d as to whether he was actually speeding which entitled him to a jury trial and that therefore his conviction and \u201cthe $120.00 in fines imposed upon him by the Municipal Court Judge ... for allegedly speeding\u201d violated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>right to due process. Accordingly, Austin asserts that his conviction is invalid and seeks the recovery of the $120.00 fine as damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Reviewing this \u00a7 1983 claim <em>de novo </em>and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Austin, <em>Cruz v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1379, 1382 (11th Cir.2005), we conclude that it is barred by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The Supreme Court held in <em>Heck </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-6\">[T]o recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. A claim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has not been so invalidated is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Thus, a plaintiff in a civil suit alleging facts which challenge the fundamental legality of a conviction cannot bring an action under \u00a7 1983 without proving that the subject conviction has been invalidated. In this case, a judgment in favor of Austin would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction for speeding. <em>See Abusaid v. Hillsborough County Bd. of County Com\u2019rs, </em>405 F.3d 1298, 1315 (11th Cir.2005). Hence, Austin\u2019s claims are not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 because his speeding conviction has not been reversed on direct appeal, expunged, invalidated by a tribunal, or questioned by a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
