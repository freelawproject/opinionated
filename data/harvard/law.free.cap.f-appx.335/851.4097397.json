Second, Al-Shishani argues that his hearing before the IJ was fundamentally unfair because (i) the IJ was biased against him; (ii) he was not notified of a change in the asylum hearing date; (iii) he was not properly served with a notice to appear (\u201cNTA\u201d); (iv) he was physically and mentally ill during the hearing; and, (v) the interpreter was inadequate. Third, he challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of his second motion to extend the briefing deadline and its refusal to accept his late-filed brief. Finally, he challenges the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and the denial of his withholding of removal and CAT claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Frech v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>491 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir.2007). An alien can apply for asylum if he \u201cdemonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within [one] year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). The BIA may consider a late application \u201cif the alien demonstrates ... either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within [one year].\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">Section 1158(a)(3), however, divests us of jurisdiction to review any such determination. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (\u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination ... under paragraph (2).\u201d); <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). In addition, we have held that \u00a7 106(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13,. 119 Stat. 231, 310, which amended the INA to provide for appellate jurisdiction over \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law,\u201d did not affect our prior precedent addressing our jurisdiction to review untimely applications. <em>See Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-16\">Here, Al-Shishani did not file his asylum application for sixteen years, and neither the IJ nor the BIA found that he had demonstrated an extraordinary circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>stance to warrant such a delay. Because we lack jurisdiction to consider Al-Shisha-ni\u2019s untimely asylum claim, we dismiss his petition in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">As noted above, we review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Frech, </em>491 F.3d at 1280. Furthermore, we \u201cmust inquire into subject matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 44, 172 L.Ed.2d 22 (2008). \u201c[Ajbsent a cognizable excuse or exception, we lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect thereto.\u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This requirement ensures that the BIA has a full opportunity to consider \u201cthe niceties and contours of the relevant arguments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1250. .</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">While constitutional challenges to the INA procedures and some due process claims may not require exhaustion if the BIA did not \u201chave the power to adjudicate those claims,\u201d where the BIA can remedy the constitutional claim, \u201cthe exhaustion requirement applies with full force.\u201d <em>Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1325 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that an alien should have exhausted his due process claim that the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s application of an immigration statute violated the Constitution because \u201c[i]t was within the BIA\u2019s authority to reconsider and change its decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">When jurisdiction is present, we review constitutional challenges <em>de novo. Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). \u201c[T]he Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.\u201d <em>Reno v. Flores, </em>507 U.S. 292, 306, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 1449, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993). Accordingly, aliens must receive \u201cnotice and an opportunity to be heard in their removal proceedings.\u201d Fernan<em>dez-Bernal v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1310 n. 8 (11th Cir.2001). To prevail on a due process challenge, however, an alien must show substantial prejudice \u2014 namely, that the outcome would have differed \u201cin the absence of the alleged procedural deficiencies.\u201d <em>Patel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1263 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">We lack jurisdiction over Al-Shishani\u2019s claims that the IJ was biased against him and that he was not notified of a change in the asylum hearing date because he did not exhaust these arguments in his notice of appeal to the BIA. These claims constitute due process claims within the scope of the BIA\u2019s authority. It was within the BIA\u2019s authority to review the transcript of the asylum hearing, determine whether the IJ\u2019s actions demonstrated bias against Al-Shishani and in favor of the government, or that he did not receive adequate notice of the date change, and if so, to remand the matter for a new hearing. Accordingly, we dismiss his petition in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">With regard to Al-Shishani\u2019s remaining due process claims \u2014 that he was not properly served with a NTA, that he was ill during the asylum hearing, and that his interpreter was inadequate \u2014 he has failed to show how these alleged deficiencies prejudiced his case. First, he did, in fact, appear at the initial removal proceeding. Second, the IJ granted at least six continuances during the ensuing ten months before the asylum hearing to ensure that Al-Shishani had sufficient time to prepare his case. Al-Shishani has not explained what he would have done differently but for his illness. Finally, he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>not identified any specific mistranslations. Thus, we deny Al-Shishani\u2019s petition in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">\u201c[N]o court shall have jurisdiction to review ... any other decision or action of the Attorney General ... the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). \u201cThe phrase \u2018specified under this subchapter\u2019 refers to subchapter II of Chapter 12, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151\u2014 1378.\u201d <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1361 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">By contrast, we have jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions which are governed by federal regulations. <em>Id. </em>Such decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 1364. The BIA abuses its discretion when its decision is arbitrary and capricious. <em>Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Under the federal regulations, an alien in custody generally has 21 days in which to file a brief to the BIA, but, \u201cupon written motion, [the BIA] may extend the period for filing a brief or a reply brief for up to 90 days for good cause shown.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(c)(1). Furthermore, \u201c[i]n its discretion, the [BIA] may consider a brief that has been filed out of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn the interests of fairness and the efficient use of administrative resources,\u201d extension requests are disfavored. <em>See </em>BIA Practice Manual, \u00a7 4.7(c)(i). Accordingly, it is the BIA\u2019s policy to grant a first briefing extension, but to only grant second requests \u201cin rare circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 4.7(c)(i)(A). Likewise, the BIA only will consider allowing a late-filed brief if it is accompanied by a motion that \u201cset[s] forth in detail the reasons for the untimeliness\u201d and is supported by \u201caffidavits, declarations, or other evidence.\u201d <em>See Id. </em>at \u00a7 4.7(d). Even then, it \u201crarely\u201d considers the motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">As an initial matter, we have jurisdiction to review denials of motions to extend the briefing deadline because they are governed by the federal regulations. Nevertheless, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Al-Shishani\u2019s second request to extend the briefing deadline. The BIA\u2019s policy of denying second requests \u201cin the interests of fairness and the efficient use of administrative resources\u201d is not arbitrary and capricious, and Al-Shishani has failed to show how his request satisfied the \u201crare circumstances\u201d exception. Likewise, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by refusing to accept Al-Shishani\u2019s untimely brief because its policy of requiring petitioners to explain the reasons for the untimeliness in a motion supported by evidence is not arbitrary and capricious. Moreover, the record does not reflect that he filed such a motion. Accordingly, we deny the petition in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">Where the BIA addresses, <em>sua sponte, </em>issues \u2014 such as the propriety of an adverse credibility finding, or the denial of withholding of removal and CAT claims on the merits \u2014 that an alien does not exhaust in his notice of appeal or supporting brief, we \u201ccannot say the BIA fully considered the petitioner\u2019s claims, as it had no occasion to address the relevant argu<em>ments----\u201d Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250-51. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review such arguments on appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">Here, the BIA addressed the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and the substantive denial of Al-Shishani\u2019s withholding of removal and CAT requests <em>sua </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number><em>sponte, </em>but we cannot say that it fully considered the relevant arguments. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review these unexhausted issues on appeal, and we dismiss the petition in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petitioner\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
