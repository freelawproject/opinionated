The district court granted a certif\u00edcate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on two issues. On appeal, Hester raises only one of the two issues:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0k\">Whether movant was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial when defense counsel rested without calling the movant to testify on his own behalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Hester argues that the district court erred in denying this ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and that the district court further erred by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As Hester is proceeding <em>-pro se, </em>we will construe his pleadings liberally. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 792 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">First, we discuss Hester\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Then, we turn to the district court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">A. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">With regard to a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, we review legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). An ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a mixed question of law and fact that is subject to de novo review. <em>Gordon v. United States, </em>518 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">A criminal defendant has a fundamental constitutional right to testify on his own behalf at trial, and this right cannot be waived by defense counsel. <em>Gallego v. United States, </em>174 F.3d 1196, 1197 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cA claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is the proper framework to analyze defendant\u2019s allegation that his attorney has violated his right to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Sixth Amendment gives criminal defendants the right to effective assistance of counsel. U.S. Const., amend. VI; <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 684-86, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2063, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must demonstrate both (1) that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, <em>i.e., </em>the performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that he suffered prejudice as a result of that deficient performance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 691-92, 104 S. Ct. at 2064-67. This Court need not \u201caddress both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">In order to prove prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. \u201cA reasonable probability is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693, 104 S.Ct. 2067.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">On this record, we are compelled to conclude that there is no reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different had Hester testified in his own defense. Hester makes two arguments. First, Hester would have testified that he never carried a gun during drug transactions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, in light of all the evidence, there is not a reasonably probability that his testimony would have changed the outcome of the trial. Four witnesses testified that Hester carried a gun during drug transactions. In addition, a law enforcement officer identified a handgun recovered from Hester\u2019s home. Finally, Hester\u2019s mother, testifying for the defense, made the following statements on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-5\">Q: Was it unusual to see handguns in [Hester\u2019s] house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-6\">A: No, sir, no, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-7\">Q: Was it unusual to see [Hester] with a handgun on him, in his pocket or in a holster or anything of that nature?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-8\">A: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-10\">Q: Was that something that was common?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-11\">A: Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-12\">Accordingly, Hester cannot satisfy the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-13\">Second, Hester argues that his testimony would have provided a basis for an entrapment defense or, at a minimum, sentencing manipulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We reject both arguments.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-14\">A successful entrapment defense requires two elements: 1) government inducement of the crime, and 2) lack of pi-edisposition on the part of the defendant. The defendant bears the initial burden of production to show government inducement. The mere suggestion of a crime or initiation of contact is not enough. Rather, inducement requires an element of persuasion or mild coercion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-15\"><em>United States v. Padron, </em>527 F.3d 1156, 1160 (11th Cir.2008) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Here, Hester\u2019s own affidavit demonstrates that he willingly produced a gun. Turning to Hester\u2019s second argument, we note that, \u201cto bring sting operations within the ambit of sentencing factor manipulation, the government must engage in extraordinary misconduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1271 (11th Cir.2007). There is no evidence of such misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>here. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cThe fact that law enforcement may provide drugs or guns essential to a willing and predisposed offender does not necessarily constitute misconduct.\u201d). Accordingly, Hester cannot satisfy the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis, and we conclude that Hester did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">B. <em>Failure to Hold an Evidentiary Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding for abuse of discretion. <em>Aron v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 708, 714 n. 5 (11th Cir.2002). When confronted with a \u00a7 2255 motion, a district court must grant an evidentiary hearing \u201cunless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(b); <em>Tejada v. Dugger, </em>941 F.2d 1551, 1559 (11th Cir.1991). Because Hester\u2019.s claim of prejudice \u2014 even liberally construed \u2014 is unsupported on the face of the record, the district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">For the forgoing reasons, the opinion of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-10\">. Issues not argued on appeal are abandoned. <em>See United States v. Futch, </em>518 F.3d 887, 895 n. 10 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 396, 172 L.Ed.2d 285 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b973-13\">. Hester also requests that we expand the COA to include the issue of whether his trial and appellate attorneys were ineffective for failing to challenge his sentence. We need not (and do not) address whether his request is timely, because the challenge to his sentence that he now asserts \u2014 i.e., that the gun enhancement of his drug distribution sentence renders his conviction on the gun count a violation of Double Jeopardy \u2014 is foreclosed by <em>Witte v. United States, </em>515 U.S. 389, 399, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 2206, 132 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995) (\"We thus made clear that use of evidence of related criminal conduct to enhance a defendant's sentence for a separate crime within the authorized statutory limits does not constitute punishment for that conduct within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b974-9\">. Hester's affidavit states that he would have testified to the following facts: (1) Hester was \"very interested in and collected guns\u201d since the age of eleven; (2) Hester \"had a number of rifles, pistols and shotguns,\u201d which were \"usually kept\u201d in his gun safe; (3) Hester had a permit to carry a pistol; (4) Hester's wife had been injured by the accidental discharge of a pistol and imposed a \"house rule\u201d that pistols could not be carried inside the home; (5) as a joke, Hester played along with a statement by an informant that he had a gun in his pants; (6) when one of the informants asked about buying a pistol, Hester took it out of the safe to show it to her; (7) the informant's were long-time friends and never appeared \"intimidated\u201d by Hester; (8) Hester never owned an ankle holster or carried a pistol on his ankle; and (9) Hester never pulled out a gun or threatened anyone with a gun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b974-17\">. Hester argues that he was entitled to a defense of sentencing entrapment. This Circuit does not recognize sentencing entrapment as a viable defense. <em>See United States v. Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b975-11\">. Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss all issues not granted in the certificate of appealability is dismissed as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
