On appeal, Pettaway argues that he brandished the firearm while attempting to buy cocaine base, not while selling cocaine, and, accordingly, did not brandish the firearm \u201cin relation to\u201d the underlying drug trafficking offense. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">The interpretation of a criminal statute is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Murrell, </em>368 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">Section 924 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-13\">[A]ny person who, during and in relation to any ... drug trafficking crime ..., uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-14\">(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-15\">(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-16\">(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-17\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Section 924(c)(1)(A) defines a single criminal offense for using or carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, while the \u201cbrandished\u201d and \u201cdischarged\u201d subsections are sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Chuy, </em>260 F.3d 1267, 1281-82 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-18\">To satisfy the possession-in-furtherance-of prong of the offense, the government must show that there was a nexus between the possession and the underlying offense, such that the defendant\u2019s possession of the firearm \u201chelped, furthered, promoted, or advanced the drug trafficking.\u201d <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1252 (11th Cir.2002). The nexus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-19\">can be established by the type of drug activity that is being conducted, accessibility of the firearm, the type of the weapon, whether the weapon is stolen, the status of the possession (legitimate or illegal), whether the gun is loaded, proximity to the drugs or drug profits, and the time and circumstances under which the gun is found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 1253 (quotation omitted). The Supreme Court, in holding that the \u201cdischarge\u201d sentencing-factor enhancement requires no separate proof of intent, recently rejected the construction of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) as applying the \u201cin relation to\u201d and \u201cin furtherance\u201d phrases to the sentencing-factor subsections. <em>See Dean v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1849, 1854, 1856, 173 L.Ed.2d 785 (2009). Finally, a firearm is \u201cbrandished\u201d if the defendant displays all or part of the firearm, or otherwise makes its presence known to another person, in order to intimidate that person. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">As applied here, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent construction of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) indicates that the government did not need to prove that Pettaway brandished the firearm \u201cin relation to\u201d or \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 the drug trafficking crime. <em>See Dean, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1854. Rather, the government needed to establish only that Pettaway: (1) used or carried the firearm in relation to, or possessed the firearm in furtherance of, the drug trafficking offense, <em>ie., </em>that he committed the elements of an offense under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A); and (2) brandished the firearm at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">The first part was established by Petta-way\u2019s conviction on Count Two, which he does not challenge. Indeed, the trial testimony and PSI readily supported the inferences that the firearm, which Pettaway possessed illegally as a convicted felon, was on his person (as was the crack cocaine), was loaded, had an obliterated serial number, and was used to beat another man during a fight arising out of some type of drug deal. Accordingly, the nexus between the gun and his possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine was established by the accessibility of the gun, its proximity to the drugs, the likelihood that the weapon was stolen, the fact that he possessed it illegally, and the time and circumstances under which it was found. <em>See Timmons, </em>283 F.3d at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">The government clearly satisfied the brandishing prong as well, by demonstrating that Pettaway displayed the firearm or made its presence known in order to intimidate another, as the evidence at trial plainly demonstrated that Pettaway pistol-whipped the other man during a fight. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(4). In addition, the sentencing enhancement was proper because the brandishing was done in the course of the underlying offense \u2014 possessing the firearm in furtherance of possessing with intent to distribute crack cocaine. <em>Cf. Dean, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1854, 1856. In short, the district court did not err in applying the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
