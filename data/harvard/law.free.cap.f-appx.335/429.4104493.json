Rodriguez-Funez appeals his sentence. He argues that he should be resentencecl because the district court erroneously believed that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>prior conviction was for an aggravated felony. He concedes that this claim is reviewed for plain error only due to his failure to raise it in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">A review of the record shows that the same sentence could be imposed upon Rodriguez-Funez if this case were remanded for resentencing. This review likewise does not show that it is reasonably probable that Rodriguez-Funez would have received a different sentence but for the district court\u2019s erroneous belief concerning his prior conviction. Consequently, Rodriguez-Funez has not shown plain error in connection with his sentence, nor has he established that he should receive relief on this claim. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 437-38 (5th Cir.2006). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
