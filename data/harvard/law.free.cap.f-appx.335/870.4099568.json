We find no error and affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b893-18\">In the factual basis for his guilty plea, Saftchick agreed that he participated in a conspiracy \u201cto acquire distribution quantities of marijuana and provide the marijuana to others\u201d between January 2005 and May 2007 with codefendants Christopher Hutchins and Howard Fisher. Saftchick also agreed that he and his codefendants delivered over 100 kilograms of marijuana to Justin Mikhael<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Dest\u00edn, Florida, and that the marijuana \u201cwould then be stored at Mikhael\u2019s residence until Mikhael would, in turn, distribute the marijuana to others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-19\">According to the presentence investigation report (the \u201cPSI\u201d), Mikhael operated a large drug-trafficking network, and Saftchick was a primary source of marijuana for Mikhael. Saftchick transported high-quality marijuana from Florida to New York, where it was ultimately sold. Mikhael received 10 to 20 pounds of marijuana from Saftchick and his codefendants on at least 20 occasions, and he paid an average of $3,500 per pound. Saftehick\u2019s codefendants also delivered marijuana to Mikhael on multiple occasions. A review of telephone records by law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>revealed a \u201csignificant amount of telephone activity\u201d between Saftchick, Mikhael, and Fisher. Additionally, a quantity of marijuana and numerous firearms were seized from Mikhael\u2019s residence on April 5, 2007, and Saftchick was observed visiting that residence after that date, on April 9, 2007. In January 2008, Saftchick, Hutchins, and Saftchick\u2019s mother were arrested in California after police found 21 pounds of marijuana in their motel room. In May 2008, officers found a handgun at Saftchick\u2019s residence, numerous firearms at Hutch-ins\u2019s residence, and records at Hutchins\u2019s residence reflecting that 348 pounds of marijuana were distributed to persons other than Mikhael during the course of the conspiracy. In the same month, law enforcement found numerous firearms at Mikhael\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">In calculating the sentencing guidelines range, the probation officer applied a base offense level of 26 because the offense involved between 100 and 400 kilograms of marijuana, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7). The officer applied a two-level enhancement because a dangerous weapon was possessed, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), finding that Saftch-ick was accountable for firearms possessed by Mikhael during the conspiracy. The officer also applied a four-level enhancement because Saftchick was an organizer or leader of criminal activity involving five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b). With a total offense level of 29 and a criminal history category of II, the guidelines range was 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment. The offense carried a statutory minimum of 5 years\u2019 imprisonment and a maximum of 40 years, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Saftchick\u2019s appeal relates to two objections he made to the PSI. First, Saftchick objected to the four-level \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement, arguing that although he held a leadership position in the conspiracy, he supervised less than five people in the conspiracy and therefore should receive only a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), rather than the four-level \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement. Second, Saftch-ick objected to the two-level \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement, asserting that Mikhael was merely a buyer, not a co-conspirator, that Saftchick was unaware that Mikhael possessed firearms, and that Saftchick, therefore, should not be held responsible for the firearms Mikhael possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">At the sentencing hearing, the government presented Agent Michael Bettis in support of the \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement, who testified that Saftchick regularly provided distribution quantities of marijuana to Mikhael, who then distributed the drugs to \u201cnumerous\u201d other individuals. Also, Saftchick acted in concert with Hutchins and Fisher, along with several \u201cmules,\u201d or transporters of the drugs, including Maria Saftchick. The ledger found in Hutchins\u2019s home \u201cclearly depiet[ed] marijuana going out by group members ... as well as monies going to sources of supply for payments of large marijuana loads.\u201d Moreover, the marijuana was regularly \u201cfronted\u201d to Mikhael in \u201can ongoing operation.\u201d The district court found that the enhancement applied because the criminal activity involved five or more participants, including Mikhael. The court also found that even if there were fewer than five participants, the enhancement applied because the conspiracy was \u201cotherwise extensive,\u201d as it ran from January 2005 through May 2007, Saftchick transported marijuana between Florida and New York, the marijuana was of high quality, and a significant amount of money was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">The court also overruled Saftchick\u2019s objection to the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement based on MikhaePs possession of firearms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>Per agent Bettis\u2019s previous testimony during a codefendant\u2019s sentencing hearing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> firearms were found in Mikhael\u2019s home on April 5, 2007, and Mikhael stated that he needed them for protection after he was robbed during a drug transaction. The court found that the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement applied because Mikhael was a co-conspirator, even though not charged as such, he possessed the firearms in furtherance of and in close temporal proximity to the conspiracy, and it was reasonably foreseeable that firearms would be possessed in light of the nature of the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The court sentenced Saftchiek to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment, and Saftchiek timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Perez-Oliveros, </em>479 F.3d 779, 783 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cA district court\u2019s determination as to a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review.\u201d <em>United States v. Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1993). The factual determination that a coeonspir-ator possessed firearms in furtherance of the conspiracy is also reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Nino, </em>967 F.2d 1508, 1514-15 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">\n<em>Section SB 1.1 (a) Enhancement for a Leadership Role</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Saftchiek argues that the court erroneously applied the \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement because, although he had a leadership role in the conspiracy, it did not involve five or more participants and was not otherwise extensive. Thus, Saftchiek claims he should only have received a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Saftchiek asserts that Mikhael was just a buyer and not a participant in the conspiracy. Saftchiek, relying on <em>Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, also asserts that the district court erred in finding that the operation was otherwise extensive. We disagree and affirm the enhancement of Saftchick\u2019s sentences under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">The guidelines provide for a four-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). The application notes instruct that \u201c[a] \u2018participant\u2019 is a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.l). \u201c[I]n deciding whether individuals were participants in the criminal activity, the court must consider, in addition to the criminal act itself, the individuals\u2019 involvement in the events surrounding the criminal act.\u201d <em>United States v. Holland, </em>22 F.3d 1040, 1046 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">The application notes further instruct that \u201c[i]n assessing whether an organization is \u2018otherwise extensive,\u2019 all persons involved during the course of the entire offense are to be considered.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.3). \u201cAlthough this circuit does not employ a precise definition for the \u2018otherwise extensive\u2019 standard, there are a number of factors relevant to the extensiveness determination, including the length and scope of the criminal activity as well as the number of persons involved.\u201d <em>Holland, </em>22 F.3d at 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>Here, the district court committed no error in finding that Saftchick held a leadership position in an organization involving five or more participants nor in finding that his organization was \u201cotherwise extensive.\u201d Between January 2005 and May 2007, Saftchick and his codefendants regularly delivered over 100 kilograms of marijuana to Mikhael, who in turn operated a large drug-trafficking network. Officers discovered a \u201csignificant amount of telephone activity\u201d between Saftchick, Fisher, and Mikhael. Moreover, the marijuana was regularly \u201cfronted\u201d to Mikhael, <em>ie., </em>Mikhael would pay Saftchick and his codefendants after receiving money from Mikhael\u2019s \u201cnumerous\u201d buyers. The court did not err in interpreting this evidence to mean that Mikhael was a participant in Saftchick\u2019s organization. <em>See United States v. Matthews, </em>168 F.3d 1234, 1249-50 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that fronting drugs to another individual is sufficient to make that individual a part of the defendant\u2019s criminal organization and to warrant use of a similar leadership enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(b)). Additionally, Saftchick did not need to have control over every co-conspirator for \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) to apply, so long as he held a leadership role and the organization involved five or more people. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">In addition, the district court properly found that the organization was \u201cotherwise extensive.\u201d Saftchick transported high-quality marijuana from Florida to New York. Mikhael paid Saftchick and his co-defendants approximately $3,500 per pound of marijuana. Several \u201cmules\u201d were employed as drug couriers, and a ledger found in Hutchins\u2019s home indicated that Saftchick and his codefendants distributed 348 pounds of marijuana to persons other than Mikhael. Further, Saftch-ick and his co-defendants were arrested with, collectively, over 60 pounds of marijuana in their possession. These facts demonstrate Saftchick\u2019s criminal activity was otherwise extensive. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>981 F.2d 1199, 1200 (11th Cir.1993) (finding that the defendant was involved in \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d criminal activity when he \u201cwas organizing a drug transaction that extended from Columbia to Florida to Boston to New York, and which included the purchase and street distribution of 100 kilos of cocaine worth $350,000 in the wholesale market\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">As a final matter, <em>Yates </em>is distinguishable. In <em>Yates, </em>this court reversed the district court\u2019s application of a \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement to someone whom the government had not proved held a leadership role in the organization, but was instead simply a supplier to an extensive operation. 990 F.2d at 1181-82. The district court applied \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) based solely upon the extensive nature of the distribution ring. <em>Id. </em>at 1180-81. This court vacated and remanded because the government had presented no evidence that the defendant \u201cwas an organizer or leader\u201d and the evidence indicated at most \u201ca continuing seller/buyer relationship\u201d between the defendant and the head of the drug ring. <em>Id. </em>Here, on the other hand, Saftchick acknowledged that he occupied a leadership role in the conspiracy, the evidence clearly reflected more than a mere buyer/seller relationship existed with Mikhael, and Saftchick was not merely held accountable for selling drugs to the leader of an otherwise extensive trafficking operation. Accordingly, we affirm the application of the \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">\n<em>Section 2D 1.1 (b)(1) Enhancement for Possession of a Firearm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Saftchick also argues that the district court erroneously applied the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement based on Mik-hael\u2019s possession of firearms, because Mikhael was not charged as a co-conspirator nor unavailable for indictment. Moreover, Saftchick contends that Mikhael\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>possession of firearms was not reasonably foreseeable because they were hidden in his bedroom, and there was no connection between the firearms and Saftchick. In addition, Saftchick argues that he never admitted the facts in support of this enhancement, and that the application of the enhancement therefore violated the Sixth Amendment under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Finally, Saftchick argues that Mikhael\u2019s possession of firearms was not in furtherance of the conspiracy, as he was merely a buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">In the case of a drug-trafficking offense, the guidelines provide for a two-level enhancement \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). \u201c[T]he [\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) ] enhancement is to be applied whenever a firearm is possessed during conduct relevant to the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>127 F.3d 1388, 1390 (11th Cir.1997). For this enhancement to apply to a defendant based on a co-conspirator\u2019s possession of a firearm, the government must show that: \u201c(1) the possessor of the firearm was a co-conspirator, (2) the possession was in furtherance of the conspiracy, (3) the defendant was a member of the conspiracy at the time of possession, and (4) the co-conspirator possession was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Gallo, </em>195 F.3d 1278, 1284 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cOnce the government shows that a firearm is present at the site of the charged conduct, the evidentiary burden shifts to the defendant to show that a connection between the firearm and the offense is clearly improbable.\u201d <em>United States v. Westry, </em>524 F.3d 1198, 1221 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted), <em>cert. denied, Carter v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 251, 172 L.Ed.2d 189 (2008), and <em>Hinton v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 902, 173 L.Ed.2d 119 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">This court has indicated that the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement may apply to a defendant, based on a co-conspirator\u2019s possession of a firearm, only when the possessor is charged as a co-conspirator. <em>See United States v. Otero, </em>890 F.2d 366, 367 (11th Cir.1989). This court, however, later explained that <em>Otero </em>should not be read strictly and that the general import of <em>Otero </em>is to avoid sentence enhancements for firearms possession by persons outside a conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Nino, </em>967 F.2d 1508, 1514-15 (11th Cir.1992) (applying the enhancement even though the weapons were possessed by co-conspirators who are not charged because one died before the conspiracy ended and the other cooperated with the government in exchange for immunity). The <em>Otero </em>rationale \u201cis satisfied if the possessor of the firearm is a co-conspirator of the defendant whose sentence is enhanced,\u201d so long as the co-conspirator\u2019s firearms possession is in furtherance of the conspiracy and reasonably foreseeable. <em>United States v. Luiz, </em>102 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir.1996); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. Accordingly, Mik-hael\u2019s firearms possession could be attributed to Saftchick as a co-conspirator, regardless of whether Mikhael was indicted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Thus, the district court did not err in enhancing Saftchick\u2019s offense level based on Mikhael\u2019s possession of firearms. As discussed earlier, the facts support the finding that Mikhael was a co-conspirator and not a mere buyer. Also, Mikhael possessed numerous firearms at his residence \u2014 from where Saftchick and his co-defendants regularly distributed large quantities of marijuana \u2014 and Mikhael stated that he purchased them for protection after being robbed in a drug deal. The fact that firearms were found at the home of a co-conspirator who stored and distributed drugs as a part of their conspiracy supports the finding that Mikhael pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>sessed firearms in furtherance of the conspiracy and that Mikhael\u2019s doing so was reasonably foreseeable by Saftchick. <em>See United States v. Fields, </em>408 F.3d 1356, 1359 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that firearms were possessed in furtherance of a drug conspiracy and reasonably foreseeable when found at the location from which the defendant\u2019s co-conspirators distributed drugs); <em>see also United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1246 (11th Cir.2006) (recognizing that, in light of the \u201cfrequent and overpowering connection between the use of firearms and narcotics traffic,\u201d it is \u201creasonably foreseeable that a eo-conspirator would possess a firearm where the conspiracy involved trafficking in lucrative and illegal drugs.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Additionally, Saftchick was a member of the conspiracy when Mikhael possessed the firearms. The charged conspiracy ran from January 2005 until May 2007, the firearms were found in Mikhael\u2019s residence on April 5, 2007, Saftchick\u2019s codefendants engaged in nareotics-trafficking activities at Mikhael\u2019s residence through March 2007, and Saftchick was observed visiting Mikhael\u2019s residence on April 9, 2007. Finally, Saftchick has not shown that a connection between the firearms and the conspiracy was clearly improbable, and the record does not support such a conclusion, in light of the location of the firearms and Mikhael\u2019s stated purpose for possessing them. <em>See Fields, </em>408 F.3d at 1359. As a result, the district court did not err in applying the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">As a final matter, Saftchick argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights, as explained in <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, by imposing an enhancement for Mikhael\u2019s possession of the firearms even though the facts supporting that enhancement \u2014 that Mikhael possessed firearms \u2014 were neither found by a jury nor part of Saftchick\u2019s plea. Saftchick asserts that he was unaware that Mikhael possessed any weapons. <em>\u201cBooker </em>holds that \u2018the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where under a mandatory guidelines system a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1228 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005)). \u201cAfter <em>Booker, </em>district courts may still impose fact-based sentencing enhancements under an advisory guidelines system without violating the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, nothing in the record suggests that the district court applied the guidelines in a mandatory fashion. Accordingly, we affirm the offense level enhancement for possession of a firearm of a conspirator under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Saftchick\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-13\">. The parties spell this name differently. We use the spelling used in the presentence investigation report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b895-11\">.
