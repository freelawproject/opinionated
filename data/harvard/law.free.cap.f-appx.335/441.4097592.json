As his sole issue, Morales challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his request for an offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. He notes that, at trial, he contested only the question of his alienage and that he conceded the other elements of the offense of illegal reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Alienage is one of the elements of an offense under \u00a7 1326. <em>See United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, </em>987 F.2d 1129, 1131-1132 (5th Cir.1993). By challenging at trial whether he was an alien, Morales contested one of the essential factual elements of the offense of illegal reentry and put the Government to its burden of proof as to this element. The district court\u2019s determination that Morales was not entitled to an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was not \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>340 F.3d 222, 227 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b463-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
