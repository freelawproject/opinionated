McGee, acting without the benefit of counsel, brought this action in district court seeking a declaratory judgment and other equitable relief from certain orders entered by Judge Carlton L. Kell of the Superior Court of Cobb County, Georgia. McGee alleged that these orders, which found that McGee was in contempt of the state court\u2019s order for child support and ordered McGee to pay the unpaid support and to make payments necessary to clear title on certain real property, were invalid because they were based upon un-sworn statements and did not properly set forth the court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. The district court dismissed McGee\u2019s complaint, finding that it \u201clacks subject matter jurisdiction to review and reverse state court orders and judgments\u201d under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">McGee appeals, asserting that the district court erred in finding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider his complaint. We disagree. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine recognizes that federal courts, other than the Supreme Court, do not have jurisdiction to review final state court decisions. <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 476, 103 S.Ct. 1303. More recently, the Supreme Court instructed that the doctrine applies only to \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>The instant case fits squarely within the admittedly narrow confines of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. McGee was a \u201cstate-court loser\u201d in his divorce proceeding and child custody dispute who is now \u201ccomplaining of injuries caused by\u201d the allegedly improper state court contempt orders entered by Judge Kell. <em>See id. </em>The district court, therefore, properly found that it had no jurisdiction to consider McGee\u2019s claims. For this reason, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
