Porter was held accountable for 123.86 grams of cocaine, 81.82 grams of cocaine base, and 5.72 grams of methamphetamine. Pursuant to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2D1.1, these quantities were converted to their marijuana equivalents, which totaled 1,672.61 kilograms of marijuana. The district court sentenced Porter to 145 months\u2019 imprisonment and a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">Porter filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, seeking a sentencing reduction based on the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s adoption of: Amendment 706, which modified the sentencing ranges applicable to crack-cocaine offenses to reduce the disparity between crack-cocaine and powder-cocaine sentences; and Amendment 709, which, in part, clarified which misdemean- or and petty offenses are counted in determining a defendant\u2019s criminal history points under Guideline \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., supp. to app. C, amend. 706, pp. 226-31 &amp; amend. 709, pp. 235-41 (1 Nov. 2007) (amending Guideline \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1(c) and 4A1.2). The district court construed Porter\u2019s motion as being under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-15\">Porter appeals that denial, asserting the court erred in: construing his motion as arising under \u00a7 3582(c); and denying his request for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 709. He does not re-urge his claim that his sentence should be reduced based on Amendment 706 or otherwise challenge the district court\u2019s determination that the application of Amendment 706 would not reduce his sentence. Accordingly, that issue is deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-16\">Porter fails to demonstrate the district court improperly construed his motion as arising under \u00a7 3582(c). As a general rule, \u201creview of the merits of a federal prisoner\u2019s claim is not circumscribed by the label attached\u201d to the claim; accordingly, the \u201cessence\u201d of the claim, rather than its title, controls. <em>United States v. Santora, </em>711 F.2d 41, 42 n. 1 (5th Cir.1983). Under \u00a7 3582(c), a defendant may have his sentence modified if he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based upon a sentencing range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Because Porter claimed that his sentence should be reduced based on amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, he has failed to show the district court improperly construed his motion as being under \u00a7 3582(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">The decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is discretionary; accordingly, the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c) motion is reviewed for abuse of that dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>cretion. <em>See United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.1997). Section 3582(c)(2) applies only to retroactive Guidelines amendments, as set forth in Guideline \u00a7 lB1.10(a) (the Guidelines policy statement regarding reduction in term of imprisonment for amended Guideline ranges). <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28-29 (5th Cir.1994). The Sentencing Commission has stated that, unless an amendment is listed in Guideline \u00a7 IB 1.10(c), a reduction based on that amendment under \u00a7 3582(c) is not consistent with Guideline \u00a7 1B1.10\u2019s policy statement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A) (May 2008). Amendment 709 is not listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c) as an amendment covered by the policy statement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c) (May 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Insofar as Porter contends Amendment 709 is a clarifying amendment that should be applied retroactively, even though it is not listed in Guideline \u00a7 1B1.10(e), this court has held that, except on direct appeal, a clarifying amendment is not to be applied retroactively unless the amendment is listed in Guideline \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217-18 (5th Cir.1996). Moreover, even if Amendment 709 had been retroactively applied, Porter\u2019s criminal history category would have remained a category II, and his Guidelines sentencing range would have remained unchanged. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion to unseal the record is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
