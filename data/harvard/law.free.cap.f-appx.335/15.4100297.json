On appeal, he challenges the district court\u2019s application of a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) and its failure to award him a minor-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(b). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-21\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment against Baptiste and several codefen-dants \u2014 including his brother, Gary Baptiste (\u201cGary\u201d) \u2014 charging Baptiste with: conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), and (b)(1)(A) (Count 1); and possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B) (Count 26).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The government prepared a factual statement in support of Baptiste\u2019s anticipated guilty plea, which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">During the time period charged in the indictment, Defendant Kevin Baptiste assisted his brother and co-defendant Gary Baptiste in the distribution and possession of cocaine. Defendant Kevin Baptiste assisted Gary in a number of ways including distributing cocaine, collecting money for cocaine sales, storing drugs and drug proceeds in his residence and speaking with a source of supply regarding per kilogram price negotiations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">In November 2006, Gary traveled to Haiti for a period of several days. While he was gone, Defendant Kevin Baptiste handled all of the cocaine sales and money collections on Gary Baptiste\u2019s behalf. This included collecting money for co-defendant Luckner Mones-tine for cocaine, distributing two kilograms of cocaine to him on November 4, 2006, and contacting the supplier of this cocaine to arrange for a price reduction when it was determined that a portion of the cocaine was wet. Kevin Baptiste also distributed cocaine to other persons during Gary\u2019s absence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">On December 12, 2006, officers executed a search warrant at the residence of Kevin Baptiste. In Defendant Kevin Baptiste\u2019s bedroom, officers located $57,505, a Smith and Wesson handgun and a shotgun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">At the plea hearing, Baptiste, through counsel, admitted the facts contained in the proffer, including the fact that the guns and money were found in his bedroom. Baptiste thereafter pled guilty to both Counts 1 and 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">The probation officer prepared a pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) and calculated Baptiste\u2019s applicable guideline range as follows. The probation officer determined that Baptiste was responsible for at least 50, but less than 150, kilograms of cocaine, giving him a base offense level of 36. The probation officer applied a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). She also applied a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility based on a written statement made by Baptiste, which read in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-11\">I admit that I assisted my brother, Gary Baptiste with the activities of distributing cocaine. When Gary was out of town, he would have me distribute the cocaine and collect monies on his behalf. My mom\u2019s house was used as the location where the cocaine would be picked up and where monies from drug sales would be collected. I further admit and acknowledge that I negotiated a price reduction [for] some wet cocaine that was previously sold on behalf of my brother, Gary Baptiste.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">In this respect, the PSI reported that Baptiste resided at his mother\u2019s house and that 172.8 grams of cocaine and 17.4 grams of marijuana were discovered there during the execution of the search warrant. The probation officer also noted that no role reduction was warranted because, although Gary and several other co-conspirators were \u201clarge quantity narcotics\u201d suppliers or distributors, Baptiste \u201cworked at the direction of his brother Gary Baptiste as a narcotics supplier.\u201d The probation officer ultimately determined that Baptiste had a criminal history category of IV which, when coupled with his total offense level of 35, produced an applicable guideline range of 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Baptiste raised three objections to the PSI. First, he argued, without explanation, that he was responsible for 5 kilograms or less of cocaine. The government responded that the evidence at Gary\u2019s trial demonstrated that Gary participated in telephone calls related to 92.5 kilograms of cocaine and, because Baptiste acted as Gary\u2019s assistant, he should be held responsible for this drug quantity as well. Second, Baptiste objected to the firearm enhancement on the ground that the firearms did not belong to him. The government responded, and the probation officer agreed, that the enhancement was appropriate because, regardless of whether the firearms \u201cbelonged\u201d to Baptiste, they were discovered \u201cin close proximity to several thousand dollars and [were] located within Kevin\u2019s bedroom and at the residence where the defendants stored the cocaine ... and conducted their drug transactions.\u201d Finally, Baptiste argued that he should have received a minor-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). The government and the probation officer responded that such a reduction was inappropriate because Baptiste assisted his brother in the sale and storage of multiple kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">At sentencing, the government clarified that the evidence at Gary\u2019s trial demonstrated that Gary was directly responsible for 92.5 kilograms of cocaine, but Baptiste personally handled only 14.625 kilograms of that amount. Although the government argued that Baptiste should be held accountable for all 92.5 kilograms, it pointed out that, if the court found Baptiste accountable only for the 14.625 kilograms, then this would undermine his minor-role objection because the court had to measure Baptiste\u2019s role against the conduct for which he was held accountable. In addressing the drug quantity issue, defense counsel acknowledged that Baptiste handled cocaine distribution for Gary while he was out of town, but he emphasized that Baptiste could not do anything without first calling Gary and getting his permission. With respect to the firearm enhancement, defense counsel reiterated that the firearms did not belong to Baptiste, and he also asserted that the firearms were found in a guest room, not Baptiste\u2019s bedroom, to which the government responded by pointing to the factual proffer supporting the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The court ultimately sustained Baptiste\u2019s drug-quantity objection in part, finding that he was accountable only for the 14.625 kilograms of cocaine with which he was directly involved, thereby reducing his base offense level from 36 to 32. The court, however, upheld the firearm enhancement, finding that \u201cthe two firearms were found in the defendant\u2019s bedroom where the defendant stored both cocaine and drug proceeds.\u201d In addition, the court found that Baptiste failed to meet his burden with respect to a minor-role reduction. In light of the above rulings, the court determined that Baptiste had an applicable guideline range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment and, after hearing argument from the parties, sentenced Baptiste to 160 months\u2019 imprisonment on both counts, to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">\u201cThe Court reviews the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the sentencing guidelines to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Anton, </em>546 F.3d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>(U.S. Apr. 20, 2009) (No. 08-1183). \u201cFor sentencing purposes, possession of a firearm involves a factual finding, which we review for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Stallings, </em>463 F.3d 1218, 1220 (11th Cir.2006). We also review for clear error the district court\u2019s determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>a defendant\u2019s role in an offense. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937-38 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">A. Firearm Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level enhancement to a defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed\u201d during a drug-trafficking offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). The Guidelines instruct the district court to apply this enhancement \u201cif the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.3). As a result, we have held that the government has the initial burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the firearm was present at the site of the charged conduct. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>46 F.3d 62, 63-64 (11th Cir.1995) (concluding that \u201cpresence of the weapon is all the Government need show\u201d). \u201cIf the government is successful in meeting this initial burden, then the evidentiary burden shifts to the defendant, who must demonstrate that .a connection between the weapon and the offense was clearly improbable.\u201d <em>Stallings, </em>463 F.3d at 1220 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">In this case, the government met its burden to show that the firearms were present at the site of the charged conduct. This is so because the firearms were found in the same house where Baptiste engaged in acts in furtherance of the drug-trafficking conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>111 F.3d 845, 847 (11th Cir.1997) (stating that firearms are \u201cpresent\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2D 1.1(b)(1) when they are \u201cfound where acts in furtherance of the conspiracy [take] place\u201d); <em>United States v. Hansley, </em>54 F.3d 709, 716 (11th Cir.1995) (upholding the enhancement where the firearm was discovered in a house where the defendant \u201cengaged in conspiratorial conversations\u201d). Thus, Baptiste\u2019s assertion that the firearms did not belong to him is irrelevant to the analysis, and, in any event, it is undermined by his admission at the plea hearing that the firearms were found in his bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">Thus, the burden shifts to Baptiste to demonstrate that a connection between the firearms and the conspiracy was clearly improbable. <em>Stallings, </em>463 F.3d at 1220. He has failed to meet this burden because the factual proffer upon which his guilty plea was based established that the two firearms were found alongside $57,505 in cash and in the house out of which the drug conspiracy operated. Under the circumstances, the fact that there were no drugs found in the bedroom does not establish that a connection between the firearms and the drug conspiracy was clearly improbable. Indeed, the PSI reported that 172.8 grams of cocaine were found elsewhere in the house, and Baptiste does not dispute that the cash in his bedroom represented drug proceeds. Accordingly, we affirm the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">B. Minor-Role Reduction</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">Under the Guidelines, a defendant may receive a two- to four-level reduction where his role in the offense can be described as minor, minimal, or somewhere in between.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The proponent of the downward adjustment bears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the burden of establishing his role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 934, 939, 946.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">\u201c[T]he district court must assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941; <em>accord United States v. Ryan, </em>289 F.3d 1339, 1349 (11th Cir.2002) (measuring the defendant\u2019s role in relation to the conduct used to calculate his base offense level). \u201cOtherwise, a defendant could argue that [his] relevant conduct was narrow for the purpose of calculating [his] base offense level, but was broad for determining [his] role in the offense. A defendant cannot have it both ways.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 941. In other words, \u201c[o]nly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable\u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In this case, the district court held Baptiste accountable for 14.625 kilograms of cocaine at sentencing. Significantly, this drug quantity represented the amount of cocaine with which Baptiste was directly involved, and it did not include the all of the 92.5 kilograms of cocaine attributed to his brother Gary or the cocaine attributed to other members of the conspiracy. This fact is fatal to Baptiste\u2019s argument because he cannot show that he was a minor participant with respect to the drug-trafficking activities with which he was directly and personally involved. <em>See United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1276-78 (11th Cir.2002) (upholding the district court\u2019s determination that \u201cit would be a rare case indeed to find a defendant to be a minor participant in his own conduct if that\u2019s the only conduct he is being held accountable for\u201d). In this respect, Baptiste admittedly distributed cocaine, collected money for cocaine sales, stored drugs and drug proceeds, and negotiated prices with suppliers. Moreover, Baptiste was held accountable for nearly 15 kilograms of cocaine, a fairly substantial amount, which also counsels against awarding him a minor-role reduction. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 943 (noting that the amount of drugs at issue is a material, and sometimes dispositive, factor in assessing the defendant\u2019s role).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Baptiste counters that he was a minor participant as compared to Gary and the other members of the conspiracy. With respect to Gary, defense counsel emphasized at sentencing that Baptiste took no action without first getting approval from Gary. However, this point highlights the undisputed fact that Baptiste personally handled all of the cocaine transactions while Gary was out of town. In light of Baptiste\u2019s direct involvement \u2014 and even if he was arguably less culpable than Gary in relation to this relevant conduct \u2014 it cannot be said that Baptiste was a minor participant. <em>See id. </em>at 944 (\u201cThe fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor or minimal participants.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">With respect to the other co-conspirators, the PSI indicates that several were \u201clarge quantity narcotics\u201d suppliers or distributors, but there is nothing in the record establishing that these individuals were involved in the relevant conduct for which Baptiste was held accountable. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[T]he district court may consider only those participants who were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant.\u201d). Thus, Baptiste has not shown that the court clearly erred by re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>fusing to award him a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In sum, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err by applying the two-level firearm enhancement or declining to award Baptiste a minor-role reduction. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-8\">. A minor participant is entitled to a two-level reduction and is someone who is \"less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), comment, (n.5). A minimal participant is entitled to a four-level reduction and is someone who is \"plainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2(a), comment, (n.4). Defendants who are more than a minimal participant but less than a minor participant qualify for a three-level reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
