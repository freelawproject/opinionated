His motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. On appeal, he argues that the district court erroneously determined that it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>no authority to reduce his sentence because his sentence was based on a sentence range that was lowered by Amendment 706, even though he was ultimately sentenced as a career offender. He further argues that the Guidelines, including \u00a7 3582(e)(2), are to be applied in an advisory manner, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He concedes that our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), controls this appeal, but states that he seeks to preserve the issue for future review.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">A district court may reduce the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706, which was made retroactive by Amendment 713, reduced the offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 for crack cocaine offenses by two levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amends. 706, 713 (2008). Any sentence reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B), state a reduction of a term of imprisonment is not authorized if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">The arguments McKenzie presents are foreclosed by precedent. The district court was not authorized to reduce his sentence because he was sentenced as a career offender pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327 (holding that a defendant sentenced as a career offender pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1 is not entitled to \u00a7 3582 relief because Amendments 706 and 713 did not lower the applicable guideline range for career offenders). As for his <em>Booker </em>argument, it is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1193 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>and its progeny have no application to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
