Grice challenges (1) the validity of the search warrant issue for the residence at 589 Holcombe Street; (2) the traffic stop which led to his arrest; and (3) the Government\u2019s exercise of a peremptory challenge during jury selection. We find no merit in these challenges, and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">The events that led to the issuance of the search warrant and Grice\u2019s arrest are thoroughly set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation which formed the basis of the district court\u2019s denial of Grice\u2019s motion to suppress and are implicated in Grice\u2019s first two challenges.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-8\">On November 1, 2005, at approximately 11:45 to 12:00 a.m., Corporal R.J. Steelman, a police officer with the Montgomery Police Department, received information from a confidential source (CS) that Preston Grice and \u201cCorey,\u201d along with someone else called \u201cBunky,\u201d were at 879 Holcombe Street cooking or cutting a large amount of crack cocaine. The CS indicated that a black Cadillac and a dark mini-van, as well as an older dark blue or black truck and an older Chevy Caprice were parked at the residence, which was next to two vacant lots at the corner of Holcombe and South Street. Steelman ran Preston Grice\u2019s name through the police department\u2019s narcotics files, and his name came up in the database as being involved with drugs in some way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-9\">At approximately 12:20 or 12:30 p.m. on the same day, Steelman drove to the 800 block of Holcombe Street, but could not locate the house or the vehicles. He then proceeded to the 500 block of the same street and found a black pick-up truck, a mini-van and a black Cadillac at 589 Holcombe Street (\u201cthe residence\u201d), which was a white single story dwelling near the corner of Holcombe and South Streets, with a vacant lot on either side. A Caprice was parked at the rear of the residence. Steelman set up surveillance near this residence. He observed foot traffic throughout the area \u2014 -people walking down the street and a man (later identified as defendant [Corey] Harvey) coming from the front of this house and meeting cars. Steelman believed that these activities were consistent with street level drug dealing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-10\">After 20 or 30 minutes passed, a black male (later identified as Leenandora Woods) came out of the residence with a plastic bag in his hand and got into the Cadillac. Steelman called Sergeant Drummond on the radio, told him what he had heard and seen, and asked him to get the Cadillac stopped. Corporal Mills, who was also with the Montgomery Police Department, stopped the Cadillac at Drummond\u2019s request. Woods consented to a search of the vehicle, and no drugs were found; however, a narcotics dog thereafter alerted on the center console. Woods took off running on foot, and</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">Lieutenant Bullard used his Taser to stop him. Corporal Conway, the K-9 officer who had arrived with the drug dog, found approximately 450 grams of crack cocaine and 99 grams of powder cocaine in the console area of the car....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-12\">When Steelman was informed of the results of the search of the Cadillac, he left the residence to prepare an applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>tion for a search warrant at the police department\u2019s Special Operations Division, and Lieutenant Caviness and Captain Hughes set up surveillance in his place. At some point, DEA special agent Neil Thompson \u2014 who had also received a call from the CS, and was riding with Drummond \u2014 participated in the surveillance. Meanwhile, Detective Hamil typed the warrant affidavit as Steelman dictated it. While they were working on the affidavit, officers still on Holcombe Street saw four other vehicles leave the residence. One of these was a black Ford Escort. Detective Wright stopped this car, which took off and had to be pursued. During the pursuit, Wright observed a large quantity of marijuana thrown from the window. A mini-van driven by Preston Grice also left the residence and was stopped. No drugs were found in Grice\u2019s possession or in this van.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-4\">When Steelman and Hamil completed the warrant affidavit, they took it to municipal judge Troy Massey, who issued a search warrant for the residence. Police executed the warrant and found documents there in the name of Corey Harvey. Harvey, who was observed across the street, was taken into custody. According to the evidence log, police seized numerous bags and bricks of marijuana, bags of crack cocaine, digital scales, a quantity of U.S. currency, and multiple firearms from the residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN6\">Report and Recommendation, March 15, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">The denial of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. <em>United States v. Delancy, </em>502 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.2007). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its interpretation and application of the law <em>de novo. Id. </em>\u201cProbable cause to support a search warrant exists when the totality of the circumstances allow[s] a conclusion that there is a fair probability of finding contraband or evidence at a partic-' ular location.\u201d <em>United States v. Brun-didge, </em>170 F.3d 1350, 1352 (11th Cir.1999). The \u201cveracity\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d of an informant\u2019s tip are \u201crelevant considerations in the totality of the circumstances analysis,\u201d and \u201ca deficiency in one may be compensated for ... by a strong showing as to the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1352-53. Further, \u201csome other indicia of reliability\u201d may make up for a deficiency in an informant\u2019s veracity or basis of knowledge, \u201csuch as corroborating evidence gathered by law enforcement.\u201d <em>United States v. Foree, </em>43 F.3d 1572, 1576 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Search warrant affidavits are presumptively valid. <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 171, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 2684, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). A search warrant must be voided and the fruits of the search excluded, however, if the affidavit supporting the search warrant contains a false statement made knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth. <em>Id. </em>at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. at 2676. Nevertheless, a warrant is valid \u201cwhen material that is the subject of the alleged falsity or reckless disregard is set to one side, [and] there remains sufficient content in the warrant affidavit to support a finding of probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171-72, 98 S.Ct. at 2684. Thus, a defendant must show (1) \u201cthat the alleged misrepresentations or omissions were knowingly or recklessly made\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the result of excluding the alleged misrepresentations and including the alleged omissions would have been a lack of probable cause for issuance of the warrants.\u201d <em>United States v. Novaton, </em>271 F.3d 968, 986-87 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">The district court did not err in denying Grice\u2019s motion to suppress evidence. The was no clear error in the court\u2019s adoption of the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>affidavit underpinning the warrant, which established probable cause, was not the product of knowingly or recklessly made false information.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Grice argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized as a result of a warrantless stop of his vehicle. He submits that the stop of his vehicle, his arrest, and the seizure of his keys was unlawful \u2014 conducted solely for investigative purposes. He had not violated traffic laws, and they had no reason to believe that he was connected to the Holcombe Street residence, or that he possessed illegal drugs or contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">\u201cA traffic stop is a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Purcell, </em>236 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cA traffic stop ... is constitutional if it is either based upon probable cause to believe a traffic violation has occurred or justified by reasonable suspicion in accordance with <em>[Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) ],\u201d which requires that the officers \u201chave a reasonable, articulable suspicion based on objective facts that an individual is engaged in criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>526 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir.) (quotation omitted), <em>petition for </em>cert. <em>filed, </em>(U.S. Aug. 6, 2008) (No. 08-6074). \u201cA determination of reasonable suspicion is based on the totality of the circumstances, and [i]t does not require officers to catch the suspect in a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cInstead, [a] reasonable suspicion of criminal activity may be formed by observing exclusively legal activity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">\u201cProbable cause to arrest exists where the facts and circumstances within the officers\u2019 knowledge, of which they had reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient to cause a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Ollet, </em>848 F.2d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir.1988). \u201c[C]ircumstanees unique to the vehicle context justify a search incident to a lawful arrest when it is reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>556 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 1719, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009) (quotation omitted). In such a case, \u201cthe offense of arrest will supply a basis for searching the passenger compartment of an arrestee\u2019s vehicle and any containers therein.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">The district court did not err in denying Grice\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized as a result of the traffic stop because the police had reasonable suspicion to believe that he was engaged in criminal activity, had probable cause for his arrest after discovering that he was the driver of the vehicle, and were entitled to search the vehicle incident to his lawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">Grice argues that the district court erred in denying his challenge to the Government\u2019s peremptory strike of a juror under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). Citing <em>Miller-El v. Dretke, </em>545 U.S. 231, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196 (2005), he maintains that the Government\u2019s reason for striking the juror was insufficient and the court erred in failing to conduct a meaningful <em>voir dire </em>regarding the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding jury selection under <em>Batson de novo </em>and the court\u2019s underlying factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 992 (11th Cir.2008), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Jan. 30, 2009) (No. 08-987). When reviewing the district court\u2019s resolution of a <em>Batson </em>challenge, we give \u201cgreat deference to a district court\u2019s finding as to the existence of a <em>prima facie </em>case.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen-Brown, </em>243 F.3d 1293, 1296 (11th Cir.2001). The Constitution forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race. <em>Campa, </em>529 F.3d at 997. Our analysis of a <em>Batson </em>challenge involves three steps:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-4\">(1) the objector must make a <em>prima fa-cie </em>showing that the peremptory challenge is exercised on the basis of race; (2) the burden then shifts to the challenger to articulate a race-neutral explanation for striking the jurors in question; and (3) the trial court must determine whether the objector has carried its burden of proving purposeful discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 998 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination, the defendant must show: (1) that \u201che is a member of a cognizable racial group\u201d and that \u201cthe prosecutor ... exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venue members of [his] race\u201d; and (2) that \u201cthese facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used that practice to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury on account of their race.\u201d <em>United States v. Dennis, </em>804 F.2d 1208, 1210 (11th Cir.1986). In determining whether the defendant has established a <em>prima fa-cie </em>case, we consider \u201call relevant circumstances,\u201d including \u201ca \u2018pattern\u2019 of strikes against black jurors included in the particular venire.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">We consider several factors in determining whether the totality of the circumstances shows a \u201cpattern\u201d that creates an inference of discrimination, including (1) \u201cwhether members of the relevant racial or ethnic group served unchallenged on the jury\u201d; (2) \u201cwhether the striker struck all of the relevant racial or ethnic group from the venire, or at least as many as the striker had strikes\u201d; (3) \u201cwhether there is a substantial disparity between the percentage of jurors of a particular race or ethnicity struck and the percentage of their representation on the venire\u201d; and (4) \u201cwhether there is a substantial disparity between the percentage of jurors of one race [or ethnicity] struck and the percentage of their representation on the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Ochoa-Vasquez, </em>428 F.3d 1015, 1044-45 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">Once the defendant makes a <em>prima facie </em>showing, the burden shifts to the prosecution to explain, in clearly and reasonably specific terms, the legitimate race-neutral reason for striking the juror. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 97, 98 n. 20, 106 S.Ct. at 1723, 1724 n. 20. \u201cAfter the government articulates such reasons, the court must evaluate the credibility of the stated justifications based on the evidence placed before it.\u201d <em>United States v. Houston, </em>456 F.3d 1328, 1335 (11th Cir.2006). Nevertheless, the defendant retains the ultimate burden of proving intentional discrimination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">In evaluating the credibility of the prosecution's proffered race-neutral reasons for a strike, we consider whether the \u201cproffered reason for striking a black panelist applies just as well to an otherwise-similar nonblack who is permitted to serve.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>545 U.S. at 241, 125 S.Ct. at 2325. Other considerations include a prosecutor\u2019s mischaracterization of <em>voir dire </em>testimony, substitution of additional reasons for a strike when confronted with a defendant\u2019s rebuttal, or failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>conduct a meaningful <em>voir dire </em>examination on the subject of the prosecutor\u2019s concern regarding the panelist. <em>Id. </em>at 244-46, 125 S.Ct. at 2327-28. Additionally, any \u201cbroader patterns of practice during the jury selection\u201d should be considered, such as evidence of the government\u2019s general practice of excluding black venire members from juries, use of arbitrary \u201cjury shuffl[ing],\u201d or use of contrasting <em>voir dire </em>questions to black and nonblack panel members. <em>Id. </em>at 253-55, 125 S.Ct. at 2332-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Grice\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge because the Government provided a genuine race-neutral reason for striking the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-8\">.
