This court has jurisdiction to review Yang\u2019s petition because it seeks relief based on alleged changed circumstances in China. <em>See Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cThe BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is reviewed for abuse of discretion and its factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That discretion will not be disturbed unless the decision is \u201ccapricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so aberrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Pritchett v. INS, </em>993 F.2d 80, 83 (5th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Whether Yang made a prima facie case for the relief he seeks is not relevant to whether the BIA abused its discretion when it denied his motion. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Yang was required to show changed country conditions in China to overcome the 90-day time limit on his motion to reopen. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1003.2(c)(2)\u2014 (3)(ii). Yang did not show that his fear of persecution for practicing Falun Gong and fathering two children in this country was based on changed conditions in China, as opposed to self-induced changes in his personal circumstances. He has not shown that the BIA\u2019s determination lacked an evidentiary foundation. <em>See Pritchett, </em>993 F.2d at 83. Therefore, the BIA\u2019s denial of Yang\u2019s motion to reopen based on the motion\u2019s untimeliness was not an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b477-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
