The Uniform Stock Transfer act, a section of which it is desired to attack, was relied on by that court, and was not challenged as to its validity in any way. That being the case, the question should not be argued here for the first time. <em>Borough of Park Ridge </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>74 <em>N. J.
