The premises in question had thereon a dwelling built a year before the date of the contract, which stood about twenty-six feet and eleven inches from the road, and to which no objection had ever been made because of its propinquity to the road. The title had been transferred four or five times since 1882 by deeds which contained none of the restrictive covenants of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Bettmen deed. The house on the adjoining lot included in the Bettmen deed was located slightly less' than thirty feet from the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">There was evidence that the buildings on the same block were located thirty feet or more back from the road, but there was no proof of a common agreement, covenant or scheme to establish such line as a <em>modus vibendi. </em>The defendants contend that the situation thus existing does not show a defective title.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The plaintiff gave in part payment of the deposit money a note for $400, which fell due about two weeks before the date fixed for the closing of the title, and which plaintiff neglected to pay because of his knowledge of the alleged defect in the title, and defendants\u2019 refusal to rectify the same. The plaintiff made no tender of the purchase price. The defendants contend the situation thus outlined shows a default in plaintiff, notwithstanding plaintiff\u2019s repeated professed willingness to accept title, provided it were made marketable.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The trial court found that the plaintiff under this agreement was entitled to receive from defendants a deed of conveyance free and clear of the \u25a0 restrictions mentioned, and that, as defendants made no effort .to convey such title, tender of the consideration by plaintiff was unnecessary. In that conclusion we concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
