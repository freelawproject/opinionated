The relator wishes to erect several stores on his property on the northwest comer of Scotland road and Argyle avenue, in the city of Orange, and a building permit was denied on the sole ground that the locality is zoned by the ordinance exclusively for single-family dwellings.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">Eelator relies on <em>Ignaciunas </em>v. <em>Risley, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>712, and in reply it is urged that that case is not controlling for two <em>reasons\u2014first, </em>that another statute now applied, viz., chapter 146 of the laws of 1924 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>324) ; <em>secondly, </em>that the character of building now desired is different from that considered in the Ignaeiunas case.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">We are unable to perceive any substantial difference in the character of building which should lead us to a different determination, and so far as relates to the act of 1924, the case of <em>Krumgold </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>3 <em>N. J. Adv. R. </em>1546; 130 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>635, cited for respondent, seems to us in point as requiring that the present mle should be made absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">A peremptory writ is therefore awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
