On this property he wishes to erect a row of three retail stores. The relator duly made application to the building inspector of the town, submitting an application, in writing, with plans and specifications, and tendered the legal fee required. The matter was then referred to the township committee, which refused to grant the permission, and the building inspector then returned the plans, specifications, application and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">The reason for the refusal was that the zoning ordinance in force forbids the erection of retail stores on the premises in question, the.property being located in what is known as a \u201csingle family residence district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A8-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>We think this case falls directly within the rule laid down in <em>Ignaciunas </em>v. <em>Risley, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. 712; affirmed, 125 Atl. Rep. 121.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">We think the relator is entitled to judgment, and that a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>should be awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
