L. </em>1919, <em>ch. </em>168), and the supplements and amendments thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">This is fully answered against the contention of the appellants in <em>General Motors Acceptance Corp. </em>v. Smith, 3 <em>N. J. Adv. R. </em>204.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">The second reason is that the title to the motor truck was in the Belmont Motors Corporation and the Nonpariel Motors Corporation, from which Giardina purchased, had no title it could convey.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">This we find to be not borne out by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">The judgment below is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
