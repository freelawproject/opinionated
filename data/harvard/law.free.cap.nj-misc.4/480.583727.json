Thus, the ground upon which the superintendent of buildings refused the permit, in the first instance, was insufficient. <em>Ignaciunas </em>v. <em>Risley, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>712; <em>affirmed, </em>99 <em>Id. </em>389. The several grounds upon which, apparently, the board of adjustment refused to act, and upon which the building superintendent later again refused the permit, were not well taken, because the provisions of the ordinance respecting the height of buildings, the limit of coverage of area by buildings, and the provision for set-back at the point in question, bore no relation to public health, safety and the general welfare in the particular circumstances of the present case. <em>Scola </em>v. <em>Senior, </em>3 <em>N. J. Adv. R. </em>1800; <em>Plymouth Co. </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>129 <em>Id. </em>203.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">A peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>will be awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
