The only reason advanced by the plaintiff in support of the rule is that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-12\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence was that he was standing on the side of the road, off the amicite, when he saw the defendant\u2019s approaching car four hundred feet away; that he was looking in the opposite direction for a trolley car, and that without warning he was hit in the back by the defendant\u2019s auto, causing the injuries complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-13\">The defendant\u2019s evidence was that he was proceeding with his car at ten miles an hour on the right side of the road; that he saw the plaintiff when five hundred feet away, and blew his horn when one hundred feet away; that he again blew his horn when fifty feet away, and that when he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>about to pass, the plaintiff suddenly stepped to the left and into the mud guard of the defendant\u2019s car, thereby sustaining the injuries alleged. That situation, manifestly, presented a question of fact, and under the well-settled rule was for the jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">The rule will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
