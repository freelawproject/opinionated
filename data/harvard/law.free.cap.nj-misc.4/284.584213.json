The sections, as delivered, were placed in the basement of the building on an uneven floor, by piling one on top of the other. On Monday morning following, the section next to the ground was found to be broken. The defendant counter-claimed for $381.53 damages, alleged to have been caused by negligence in hauling and delivering the boiler parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The defendant contends that the plaintiff is a common carrier, liable as an insurer, and that the court therefore erred in overruling the counter-claim. The -court found: \u201cWhen the sections were delivered, unloaded, placed and left by the plaintiff they were all in good condition. * * * The break was occasioned because the lowest section was lying on uneven ground, and the weight superimposed had been too much for the lowest section to sustain on the uneven ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AKfU\">The evidence did not show the extent of the unevenness of the ground, but there was enough in the case to enable the court, sitting as a jury, to reasonably infer it. The court found no negligence upon the plaintiff\u2019s part, and since the situation presented a question of fact, we are not inclined to disturb the finding of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u25a0 The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
