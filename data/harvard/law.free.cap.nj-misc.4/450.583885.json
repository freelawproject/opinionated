The court found that the bill of sale as agreed was never tendered or delivered. As we read the record the questions in dispute were questions of fact for the trial court to determine. That court found for the plaintiff and we find no reversible error in the record. The case is clearly distinguished from that of <em>Asotzky </em>v. <em>Kropnitzky, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>344. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
