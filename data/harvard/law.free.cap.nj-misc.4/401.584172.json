As no brief has been filed with us by counsel for the defendant, it is probable that the prosecution of such rule has been abandoned. We have, however, examined the proofs, and conclude that the verdicts should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">The rule to show cause is therefore discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
