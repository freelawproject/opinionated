JOHN FRANK, DEFENDANT.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b999-6\">Decided November 24, 1926.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b999-9\">Before Gummere, Chief Justice, and Justices Kalisch and Campbell.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b999-10\">Eor the rule, <em>Frank Q.

The liability of the defendant to respond to the plaintiffs in damages is not denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">From the testimony it appears that though the plaintiff, prior to the accident, was suffering from nervous condition, she was in other respects in the enjoyment of good health; that she was able and did perform her household duties. She is forty-two years of age. At the time of the accident she was <em>enceinte. </em>As a result of the collision she had a severe hemorrhage and a miscarriage; she was in bed six weeks and was kept indoors in the neighborhood of two months; she suffered a falling of the stomach, which ailment requires the constant wearing of an abdominal support; that she has been, and still was, incapacitated from performing her household duties, and that her nervous condition has been greatly augmented. We are not prepared to say that taking into consideration the altered physical condition and the pain and suffering she had endured that the award of the jury is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">We are also of the view that the verdict in favor of the husband is not excessive. He paid $100 for medical attendance upon his wife; $40 for medicines and $145 for repairs to the automobile. In addition to these expenditures the jury could properly take into consideration the additional outlays that the husband would probably be put to by reason of the continued ailments of his wife, and, moreover, to compensate him for the loss of the society, comfort and assistance of his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">The rule to show cause is discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
