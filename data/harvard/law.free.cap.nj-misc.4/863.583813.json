Trevor Dunham, Incorporated, of certain moneys amounting to $1,536.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">This particular attack upon the indictment is that while charging a conspiracy it does not allege or charge any overt act in the execution of such agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">In this particular we think the indictment is defective. So, it was held in <em>Wood </em>v. <em>State, </em>47 <em>N. J. L. </em>180, when the provision of the Crimes act were similar unto section 37 of the present act. 2 <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>1757.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>A stipulation has been entered into by counsel that this court shall, on passing upon this application for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>decide the meritorious question as to the validity of the indictment, and should the court decide that the indictment be quashed a writ of <em>certiorari </em>shall issue $,nd judgment shall be 'entered quashing the indictment immediately upon making return to said writ, without further argument or consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Our conclusion being that the indictment must be quashed, the proceedings as provided for the foregoing stipulation will be taken.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
