On this property he wishes to erect a row of five retail stores. He made application to the building inspector of the township, submitting an application, in writing, plans and specifications, and tendering the legal fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>required. The matter was then referred to the township committee, which refused to grant permission, and the building inspector thereupon returned the plans, specifications, application and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The reason for this refusal was that a <em>zoning </em>ordinance in force forbids the erection of retail stores on the premises in question, the property being located in what is known as a \u201csingle family residence district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">We think this case falls directly under the case\u2019 of <em>Ignaciunas </em>v. <em>Risley, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>712; <em>affirmed, </em>125 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>121.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We think the relator is entitled to judgment, and that a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>should be issued.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
