Whether under such circumstances the defendant was guilty of negligence presented a jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">A case presenting a situation to some extent similar, but probably presenting \u00e1 more aggravated and excusable status, owing to the presence of a violent snowstorm which obscured the entire environment, was held by the Court of Errors and Appeals to present a question of fact for the jury. <em>Seibert </em>v. <em>Goldstein Co., </em>99 <em>N. J. L. </em>200.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The case at bar for that reason must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
