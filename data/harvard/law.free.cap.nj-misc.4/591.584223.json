Plaintiff reached' his home in Passaic at ten-thirty Saturday night, and immediately retired. At eleven-thirty he was awakened from his sleep and found a man in his room, who advised the plaintiff to \u201cshut up,\u201d and who thereupon backed out of the, room with the- plaintiff\u2019s trousers, in the pockets of which were $532 in cash and some checks, representing the plaintiff\u2019s business receipts for the day, together with some rent collections.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s wife would hot permit him to leave the house that night. The next morning (Sunday), at five o\u2019clock, he notified the police department over a neighbor\u2019s \u2019phone of the theft, and at nine o\u2019clock he personally notified police headquarters. He also attempted, without success, to telephone notice of the theft to his insurance broker, and to the defendant company. On Monday morning, at eight o\u2019clock, the plaintiff attempted to notify his broker of the theft, and, after several efforts, succeeded in doing so- at eight forty-five o\u2019clock. The broker immediately notified the agent \u201cwho wrote the policy for him,\u201d and the latter, in turn, telephoned notice to defendant company. The defendant admits receiving notice at four-thirty u. m. on Monday.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The defendant\u2019s manager testified that the reason the loss was not paid was because it was considered a loss by burglary and not a loss by robbery. The defendant contends there was error in the refusal of the court to grant motions of nonsuit, and a direction on the following grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\"><em>First. </em>That plaintiff failed to notify defendant of loss by \u201ctelegram.\u201d We consider that the notice- by telephone was a substantial compliance with that requirement of the policy. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>New Amsterdam Casualty Co., </em>94 <em>N. J. L. </em>508.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\"><em>Second. </em>That notice given was not \u201cimmediate notice.\u201d It was reasonable notice, and as \u201cimmediate\u201d apparently as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the circumstances permitted. The law does not require impossibilities where the intent and effort of the party concerned have been exerted in a <em>bona fide </em>endeavor to comply with the terms of the contract, and it is not apparent that the defendant suffered loss thereby. <em>Lex non cogit ad impossibilia. Hope Spoke Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., </em>102 <em>Ark. </em>1; <em>Ann. Cas. </em>1914a, 268; 14 <em>R. C. L. </em>1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">We think the case presented a question of fact, and that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
