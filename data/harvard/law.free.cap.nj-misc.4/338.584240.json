Plaintiff, a man of fifty-five years of age, was severely injured. He underwent two operations upon his head resulting in the removal of a portion of his scalp, and he is left with facial disfigurements. His expenses in effecting a cure were large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>and lie lost considerable sums of money because of his inability to carry on his business.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">We do not find the verdict excessive to an extent permitting us to set it aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The rule to show cause will therefore be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
