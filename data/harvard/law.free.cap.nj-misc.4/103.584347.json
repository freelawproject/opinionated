J. L. </em>712; <em>affirmed, </em>99 <em>Id. </em>389. <em>Mandamus </em>against the building inspector was his proper remedy, but the board of adjustment, to whom it was unnecessary for him to appeal, had no jurisdiction to deprive the prosecutor of his constitutional right, and the refusal of the board of adjustment brought up by <em>certiorari </em>will be set aside. <em>Steinberg </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>131 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>114. The testimony relating to the alleged increased fire hazard and alleged danger from increased traffic on the highway we think does not take this case out of the rules declared in <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>South Orange, </em>128 <em>Id. </em>393; <em>affirmed, </em>130 <em>Id. </em>721, and in <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>South Oranqe, </em>3 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>957.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The order brought up will be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
