One may not review by <em>certiorari </em>proceedings of municipal officers where not shown to have suffered a special injury. Erom an examination of the depositions it is observed that the prosecutor has given no testimony as to how he will suffer any special injury, or any other injury for that matter, nor has any testimony been given by anyone tending to show that the prosecutor will suffer any special injury peculiar to himself. The mere fact, if it be a fact, that the common council, in the passage of the ordinance and the acts of the mayor and clerk under color thereof, have exceeded their power, gives no right of action to the prosecutor until he sustains some special injury. <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Trenton, </em>36 <em>N. J. L. </em>79; <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>63 <em>Id. </em>96; <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Perth Amboy, </em>116 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>22.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The writ will be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
