Such, we think, is the undoubted effect of the case of <em>Ignaciunas </em>v. <em>Risley, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>712; <em>affirmed, </em>99 <em>Id. </em>389, there being no relation at all between the provisions in question and public health, safety and general welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">A peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>will be awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
