The sole ground upon which the inspector refused to issue the permit was that the lot was located in what had been designated by the municipal authorities as a residential district, and that the zoning ordinance of the town prohibited the erection of - such a building in that district. As this is the only ground upon which the permit was refused, it is evident, under the rule laid down in the case of <em>Ignaciunas </em>v. <em>Nutley, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>712, and subsequent decisions, that this refusal was without legal warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">I conclude, therefore, that the relator is entitled to a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>directed to the inspector, commanding him to issue the permit applied for.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
