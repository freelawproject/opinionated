GEORGE STASAK, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b143-5\">Decided February 17, 1926.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b143-8\">Before Gummere, Chief Justice, and Justices Kalisch and Campbell.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-9\">Por the plaintiff in error, <em>William A. Btrylcer.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-10\">Por the defendant in error, <em>Sylvester C. Smith, Jr., </em>prosecutor of the pleas.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b143-11\">Pee Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">The plaintiff in error was convicted in the Warren County Quarter Sessions Court on an indictment containing two counts, the first of which charged him with a second offense of unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor, and the second charged him with unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor a\u00e1 a second offense, contrary to section 10 of an act of the legislature entitled \u201cAn act concerning intoxicating liquor used, or to be used, for beverage purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">There was a trial, a verdict and judgment. The assignments of errors relate solely to the refusal of the trial judge to quash the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">A motion to quash an indictment is a motion addressed to the discretion of the court and not <em>ex debite justitae. State </em>v. <em>Hageman, </em>1 <em>Gr. </em>314; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dayton, </em>3 <em>Zab. </em>49; <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>State, </em>55 <em>N. J. L. </em>472; <em>Parks </em>v. <em>State, </em>62 <em>Id. </em>664. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>order for a defendant to avail himself of a defect in the indictment a motion to quash must be made before the jury is sworn. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>53 <em>Id. </em>601. It was there held that if no objection has been made to an indictment before the trial jury is sworn, the indictment cannot be questioned upon a motion in arrest of judgment. In the present case there was a motion to quash .the indictment before the trial jury was sworn, but the matter was pursued no further. There was no motion made in arrest of judgment or for a direction of a verdict upon the ground that the indictment was defective, in that it failed to charge a crime. It is firmly settled by the decisions in this state that the motion to quash is one addressed to the discretion of'the court, and, therefore, the denial of such a motion, <em>ipso facto, </em>furnishes no legal basis for the support of an assignment of error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pisaniello, </em>88 <em>Id. </em>262; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>91 <em>Id. </em>368; <em>State </em>v. Rosenberg, 92 <em>Id. </em>525; <em>State </em>v. Riggs, 92 <em>Id. </em>575; <em>State </em>v. Fisher, 94 <em>Id. </em>12; <em>State </em>v. Grossman, 94 <em>Id. </em>303.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
