Fair-view avenue. The property has a frontage on South Orange avenue of one hundred feet and on Fairview avenue of one hundred and twenty-five feet. Fairview avenue joins South Orange avenue at* the corner upon which relator\u2019s property is situated, at an acute angle.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">We think that this ease is controlled by the principles laid down in <em>Ignaciunas </em>v. <em>Risley, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>712; <em>affirmed, </em>99 <em>Id. </em>389.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The \u201cset back\u201d provision of the zoning ordinance is ineffective and constitutes no reason for denjdng the permit. <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>South Orange, </em>3 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>957, 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">The contention made in the defendants\u2019 brief, that the permit was properly refused because of the testimony as to the increased traffic, is also answered by the last-mentioned case.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">A peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>will be awarded. In ease an appeal is desired, an application will be entertained for an order for the moulding of the pleadings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
