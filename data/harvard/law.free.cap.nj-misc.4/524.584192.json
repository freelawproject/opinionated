An agreed state of facts is submitted in writing duly signed by the respective attorneys and filed, from which it appears the refusal to issue such permit is based solely on the ground that the territory in which the building proposed to be erected' is' within a zoning district.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">After considering the facts, we think a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>should issue directing a building permit to be issued in accordance with the facts, and such will be the order of the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
