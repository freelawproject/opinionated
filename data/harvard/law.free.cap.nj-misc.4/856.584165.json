The same condition exists on North Munn avenue. On the southerly side of relator\u2019s property, on North Parkway, is an armory building occupied by the State of New Jersey and used by it for drilling purposes. Adjoining relator\u2019s property is a group of individual garages, occupied mostly by privately owned automobiles. Directly in front of relator\u2019s property on Munn avenue is a large apartment-house in the course of construction, and directly opposite, on O rat\u00f3n Parkway (formerly Thompson street), is a public park or plaza, one hundred feet in width and running parallel with Thompson street.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The permit was refused upon the ground that the use to which the proposed structure was intended to be put would be in violation of the zoning ordinance of the city of East Orange. !</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">This building, if erected, will in part be used as a public garage, and we are of the opinion that the provisions of the . ordinance restricting the locality in question against a building to be used for such purposes are not unreasonable. <em>Hench </em>v. <em>East Orange, </em>2 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>510; <em>Portnoff </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>4 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>539; <em>Long </em>v. <em>Scott, Id. </em>767.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">The rule to show cause will be therefore discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
