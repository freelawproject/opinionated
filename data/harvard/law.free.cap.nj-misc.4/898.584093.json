L. </em>1913, <em>ch. </em>57), after notice and hearing in which the representatives of the city of Perth Amboy participated, and acquiesced and approved of, and consented to, the plans upon which, and according to which, the bridge was constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Aside from every other reason that might be advanced against the allowance of the writ in question, we find that the evidence before the board amply and completely justified its conclusion, as expressed in its judgment sought to be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">The rule to show cause is therefore dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
