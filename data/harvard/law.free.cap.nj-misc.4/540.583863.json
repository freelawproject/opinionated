The main building will be eight stories in height with a tower extending two stories higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Application for the permit was made December 2d, 1925, and the permit refused December 21st, 1925, upon the ground that the plans did not comply with chapter 16, section 1 of \u201cAn ordinance to supplement an ordinance entitled \u2018An ordinance to regulate and control the inspection, construction, alteration and repair of buildings in the town of Montclair,\u2019 \u201d adopted December 27th, 1921, which supplemental ordinance was adopted June 10th, 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">This section of the ordinance referred to provides that every building to be used as an apartment-house designed to house more than six families shall not exceed three living stories in height and shall he fireproof construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">We feel that it is not necessary for us to pass upon the questions raised under this rule to show cause further than to say that the case presented is such as canses us to conclude that an alternative writ of <em>mandamus </em>he awarded and may issue upon a proper rule being entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
