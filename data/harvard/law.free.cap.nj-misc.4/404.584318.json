The trial of the cause resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for $4,273.56.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">Both parties to the action have rules to show cause why this verdict should not be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">The plaintiffs under their rule urge that the jury improperly assessed their damages and that the verdict is inadequate and should be set aside and a new trial had as to damages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-15\">On the other hand, the defendants contend that the verdict in fixing liability upon them for the fire which destroyed plaintiffs\u2019 property is against the weight of the evidence, and should therefore be set aside and a new trial had as to all the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Both parties agreeing that the verdict reflects the unfitness of the jury to pass properly upon the issues strengthens our conclusions, reached after an examination of the proofs, that the verdict must be set aside and a new trial had as to all the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Both rules are therefore made absolute, and a <em>venire de novo </em>will issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
