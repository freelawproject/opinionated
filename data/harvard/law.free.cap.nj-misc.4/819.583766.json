Special regulations relative to garages and service stations: Under no circumstances shall a permit be issued for the erection or enlargement of a public or commercial garage, as defined in the fire prevention code of the city of Newark, or for a motor vehicle service station or for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>the conversion of any premises not so used, to be used for such purposes, in any district, whether it be a business district or an industrial district, if any part of the lot or plot in question is situated within a radius of two hundred feet of\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"><em>\u201c1. </em>A public school;</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">\u201c2. A duly-organized school giving regular instruction at least five days a week for eight or more months a year;</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\"><em>\u201c3. </em>A hospital;</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">\u201c'4. A church;</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">\u201c5. A theatre or opera house or other building used or intended to be used for theatrical or operatic purposes or for public entertainment;</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">\u201c6. A public library; or</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\"><em>\u201c7. </em>A public art museum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">It is now urged that a writ should go, commanding the allowance of the permit for two <em>reasons\u2014first, </em>that the provisions quoted axe an unreasonable, and, therefore, unconstitutional, exercise of the police power; and, <em>secondly, </em>if this court holds otherwise, yet the present case is not within the terms of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">The first point presents no difficulty, especially in view of recent decisions. In <em>Schait </em>v. <em>Senior, </em>97 <em>N. J. L. </em>390, an ordinance almost in the exact language of that under examination was considered by this couid and held entirely reasonable. The cases of <em>Wittkop </em>v. <em>Garner, </em>132 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>339; 4 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>234, and <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Paterson, </em>132 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>515; 4 <em>N. J. Adv. R. </em>561, likewise in this court, presented a similar situation on the facts, and the ruling in Schait <em>v. </em>Senior was cited and followed. So far as concerns this court, the law is settled that such an ordinance is a reasonable exercise of the police power and will be enforced in the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">The other point is more substantial, and raises the question whether the language, \u201csituated within a radius of two hundred feet of [1] a public school,\u201d &amp;c., means within a radius of two hundred feet of the building in question, or of the nearest point of the curtilage on which it is erected, whatever the dimensions of such curtilage. Diagonally op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>posite the rear corner of the lot proposed to be utilized for a gasoline station are the grounds and buildings of a church orphan asylum. The tract of land is about seven hundred and thirty feet in front on.Lyons avenue, and about seven hundred and eighty feet deep, and all the buildings are set well back from the street and toward the middle of the tract. The nearest comer of the land is one hundred and five and six-tenths feet from the nearest corner of relator\u2019s premises; the nearest comer of the nearest building (marked \u201cchapel and home\u201d) is two hundred and sixty-six feet; of an outlying chapel, three hundred and twelve feet; of the \u201cschool building,\u201d about three hundred and eighty-five feet. The cases just cited give no help on this point, except that in each of them the measurement was to the building, school, church, &amp;c. The \u201cWerts act,\u201d relating to sale of intoxicating liquor <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1889, <em>p. 77; Comp. Stat., p. </em>2903, <em>et seq.), </em>had a similar prohibition, but the language was unmistakable. By section 11 <em>(Comp. Stat., p. </em>2908), \u201cno license shall be granted * * * in any new place within two hundred feet of the <em>curtilage </em>of a church edifice, school house or armory, measured between the nearest point of the <em>same, </em>and nearest point of the <em>building </em>wherein liquors are intended to be sold.\u201d That language excludes the outlying curtilage of the liquor shop, and includes that of the church or school.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">We incline to think that the present case is not within the ordinance; if not, relators are entitled to their writ; but as the case is not free from doubt, and respondents should have an opportunity of review, an alternative writ will be awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
