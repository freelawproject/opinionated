The case was tried by the court without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">\u00b0 The testimony shows that the plaintiff, on May \u00a35th, 19\u00a35, was driving his horse and wagon loaded with barrels in a southerly direction on Grand street, Jersey City, near Summit avenue, when the defendant\u2019s trolley ear came up back of the plaintiff with a trailer. The two cars were connected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>by a tow bar eight feet long. The gong was sounded by the first car; the plaintiff turned his horse toward the west, which was to his right, to get out of the trolley tracks; that he was continuing on and had not stopped. He had not completely gotten out of the tracks when he was struck from the rear; the first car proceeded safely past the load of barrels. His wagon was struck by the second car, or trailer. The trial judge gave judgment' for the plaintiff for $250 under the evidence. We think there was evidence from which the court could render such a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The judgment of the First District Court of Jersey City is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
