The permit was refused because the land in question was zoned as a \u201cmedium volume residence district\u201d in which commercial store buildings were prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">We think this case is controlled by the decision n <em>Ignaciunas </em>v. <em>Risley, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>712; <em>affirmed, </em>99 <em>Id. </em>389. The relator is entitled to judgment, and a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>will issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
