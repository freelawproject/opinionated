The plaintiff was struck on September 33d, 1934, by defendant\u2019s automobile, by reason of which his left leg was injured\u2014a compound fracture. He was in the hospital four months, the last two weeks he went about on crutches. He was taken to his home and started to walk about the room first, and started to go out about March or April, six or seven months after he received the injury. There.is a permanent shortening of one and three-quarter inches of the leg. He earned $110 a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Whether the plaintiff\u2019s expectancy of life, which, according to the testimony of the actuary of the Prudential Insurance Company, is four years, or six and sixty-eight hundredths years, according to the mortality table, as is stated in the brief of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, it seems to us that even accepting six and sixty-eight hundredths years as the expectancy of the plaintiff\u2019s life, the sum of $15,000 awarded him by the jury is grossly excessive. Taking into consideration the age of the plaintiff, the character of his employment, the nature of his injury, his expectancy of life, the natural waning of one\u2019s physical forces and capacity for work-in the advance of years, and that he was receiving $110 a month as gatekeeper and that such service depended upon continued capacity to per1 form the work, the verdict of the jury far exceeded reasonable and fair compensation to which the plaintiff was entitled for his injury and for his present and prospective loss of earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">If the plaintiff will consent to accept the sum of $8,000 the rule will be discharged, with costs, otherwise the rule will be made absolute, costs to abide the event.
