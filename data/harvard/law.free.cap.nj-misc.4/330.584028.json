Tail-man, recovered by her in-an action against the appellant for alleged unlawful ejection from one of its vehicles used in the transportation of passengers for hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">There are three grounds of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">The first and second are that the trial court was in error in refusing to nonsuit and direct a Verdict in favor of appellant. '</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">These motions were made upon the ground that the evidence did not show that the respondent had paid the correct and lawful fare.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">The proofs, however, left this question to be settled as one 'f fact. The respondent testified that she had paid her fare and that the operator of the bus demanded of her the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ment of a fare which he insisted she had failed to pay him on a previous trip. The operator of the vehicle testified that respondent paid him ten cents as her fare, while the correct amount was twenty cents, and she refused to pay the balance and became abusive and disorderly.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">We conclude that it was not error, therefore, to refuse to nonsuit or direct a verdict because there was testimony requiring a submission to the jury to ascertain the truth as to the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The third ground of appeal is directed to&gt; the alleged erroneous rulings of the trial court in permitting answers to the following questions upon the direct examination of the respondent :</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">(a) \u201cDid you walk that entire distance?\u201d This related to the fact that after the occurrences complained of respondent ceased using the vehicles of appellant and walked from her home to her place of business. This question was objected to by appellant and the objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">(b) \u201cDid you lose any days with Eisner?\u201d This question was not objected to nor was the following one, although an objection came immediately after answer thereto, and after argument counsel for respondent stated \u201cI will not press it. 1 will withdraw it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">(c) \u201cWas it one of those cold or warm January days?\u201d This was objected to and an objection made to entire line of testimony of this character.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">(d) \u201cGan you tell how many times you did walk?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">(e) \u201cDid you procure the services of a. doctor?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\"><em>We </em>find nothing in the case warranting testimony upon these lines. There is nothing showing that respondent, by the payment of the proper and legal fare, could not have continued to be transported by the buses of appellant to and from her place of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">The proofs show that she made no such effort. Testimony that she lost time from her work, that she suffered physical discomfort and that she became ill because of exposure and exertion in walking this distance to and from her place of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>employment was therefore irrelevant and harmful, and prejudicial to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Eor this trial error the judgment below must be reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
