The clerk having on the seventh of April, 1926, decided that the petition presented for that purpose was insufficient. Our consideration of the ease leads us to the conclusion that the rule must be discharged and the writ refused. The case of <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Standoven, </em>91 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>804, is directly in point, and that ease is controlling. This court said, in that case: \u201cThe clerk may have committed errors either in the method of investigation pursued by him or in the conclusions reached by him, but such errors cannot be reviewed or corrected by the writ of <em>mandamus.\u201d </em>Tf the clerk failed or refused to perform the duties required of him by statute, then, in such a case, this court has said, <em>\u201cmandamus </em>is the proper remedy to enforce obedience.\u201d <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>89 <em>N. J. L. </em>482, 486. The rule to show cause is therefore discharged and the writ of <em>mandamus </em>refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
