The sole ground upon which the inspector based his refusal to isst\u00ede such permit was that the tract was located in a por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>lion of the city that is restricted by a zoning ordinance of the municipality to the erection of private residences only, it being conceded that the relator has in all other respects complied with the requirements of the said building inspector.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The present case is identical, in its fundamental facts, with that of <em>Ignaciunas </em>v. <em>Risley, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>712; <em>affirmed, </em>125 <em>Atl.
