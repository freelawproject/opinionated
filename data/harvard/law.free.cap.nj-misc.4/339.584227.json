Hewitt, has a verdict of $2,000 to compensate him for his loss by way of loss of services and society of his wife and cost of effecting a cure of injuries sustained by her in being thrown by a sudden jerk of a trolley ear of defendant upon which she was a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">Two reasons are urged why this verdict should be set <em>aside\u2014first, </em>because it is excessive. We think it is not. <em>Second, </em>the refusal of the learned trial judge to charge the following request:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>\u201cIf the jerk or stop of a car when drifting back, and the drifting back at that point was usual and not unusual, there can be no recovery.\u201d Upon that point the trial court charged: \u201cI am inclined to charge you, not as I have been requested, but that if in the stopping of this trolley car there was nothing unusual to the stopping of a trolley \u2019car, and that the stop itself was in no respect negligence, then the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">We find that the .instruction requested was erroneous, and that the instruction as given to the jury by the learned trial judge was a correct statement of the legal principle applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">There was no error, therefore, in refusing to charge as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The rule to show cause is discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
