It should appear that the service performed was for the benefit of both the master and the servant, if the master is to be held liable. <em>Depue </em>v. <em>Salmon Co., </em>92 <em>Id. </em>550; so, in <em>Cronecker </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>92 <em>Id. </em>450.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">The rule to show cause is made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
