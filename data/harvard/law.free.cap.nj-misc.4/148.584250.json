The permit already granted was still existent and was either valid or invalid. If valid the commission could not revoke it after acceptance and the expenditure of money upon it; and even if invalid by reason of anything but fraud in its procuring or of statutory prohibition, the commission was not the tribunal to pass upon such invalidity. <em>Montefiori Cemetery Co. </em>v. <em>Newark, </em>3 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>1104, and cases there cited. The excepted grounds are not here invoked. For these reasons <em>mandamus </em>is not the proper remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The rule to show cause is discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
