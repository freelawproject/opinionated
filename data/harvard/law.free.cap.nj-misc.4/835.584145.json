Nor do we think the ordinance is an abuse of discretion vested in the council of the city. By the statute and by the very nature of the business conducted by the prosecutor, the city council must have a large discretion in controlling and regulating the business of auto buses, operating on the public streets of the city, for the safety and convenience of the traveling public. Our discussion of the reasonableness of an ordinance in case No. 271 of the present May term, 1926, is pertinent, although the case is not directly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">We are unable to see wherein the ordinance is illegal. The writ of <em>certiorari </em>is therefore dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
