GREEN CAB COMPANY.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b645-7\">Argued January term, 1926</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AAh\">Decided June 24, 1926.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b645-9\">Before Justices Parker, Mintubn and Black.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b645-10\">Eor the appellants, <em>James A.

The collision took place with a truck which had been standing at the side of the street, and which had started to make a U turn into the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The first point urged for reversal is the refusal to nonsuit on the grounds that there was no proof of negligence, ownership or operation of the cab by defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence was that she engaged a Green cab, and that defendant\u2019s name appeared thereon. There was evidence, also, that defendant\u2019s cab was \u201cspeeding,\u201d \u201cgoing very fast,\u201d and that plaintiff knocked on the window to caution the driver to' reduce his speed, and that the taxicab skidded thirty feet after the collision before coming to a stop. That situation presented a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The other remaining reasons urged for reversal are so general, vague and indefinite as to come under the condemnation of the rule that, to be noticed and considered by the court upon appeal, the reasons must be direct, compre'hensive .and specific, indicating the exact error or alleged legal defect, so that the appellate court may not be obliged, as in a cross-word puzzle, to search the record for esoteric errors and metaphysical intricacies to sustain the appeal. <em>Valenti </em>v. Blessington, 96 <em>N. J. L. </em>498; 10 <em>N. J. Dig. (Court of Errors and Appeals), </em>\u00a7 268, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Thus, under reasons\u2014(4) that the court permitted immaterial and irrelevant testimony; (5) that the court refused to admit relevant testimony; (6) that the charge mis-stated the law; (7) divers other errors made in the course of the trial; we are asked to scrutinize the record and conjure up from any conceivable concatenation of language and law some legal basis upon which the appeal may be reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>supported. This, under any proper theory of judicial procedure, we conceive to be the province of the advocate, and not that of the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">\n<em>Jus dicere non jus dare.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
