The plaintiff paid the amount demanded under protest, however, and brought this action to recover the amount paid in excess of the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">The defendant\u2019s contentions are that the payment by the plaintiff was voluntary, and that plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law, and hence there was neither duress nor extortion, and that, therefore, plaintiff could not recover. The rule is settled otherwise. It has been declared quite generally that \u201cmoney paid by one to get possession of Ins property held by another claiming a lien on the same, may be recovered where the lien claim is without merit.\u201d <em>Anno. Cas. </em>(1913A) 1356.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">In pursuance of that rule, it has been held that \u201cmoney paid to a common carrier to obtain possession of one\u2019s goods, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>beyond the amount to which the carrier is entitled, may be recovered.\u201d <em>E. D. Clough </em>v. <em>Boston and Maine </em>Railroad, 90 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>863.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The judgment will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
