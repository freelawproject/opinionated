The accident occurred on December 17th, 1924. The prosecutor\u2019s point in the case is that the decedent, Frederick Buehl, was not injured in an accident arising in and out of the course of his employment. The testimony taken'before Charles E. Corbin, the deupty commissioner in the workmen\u2019s compensation bureau, is quite voluminous. Our reading of the testimony satisfies us that the conclusion reached by him was correct, and that it was not error for the Hudson County Court of Common Pleas to affirm the judgment. The judgment of that court is affirmed, and the writ of <em>certiorari </em>is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
