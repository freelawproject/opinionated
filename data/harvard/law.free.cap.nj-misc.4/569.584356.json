In the petition for compensation the petitioner states: \u201cI was assisted in loading an automobile truck with crates of live poultry, when I slipped from the truck to the ground, injuring the right side of my body and leg.\u201d On March 12th, 1925, the workmen\u2019s compensation bureau found that the petitioner \u201cis not suffering from injury and that he suffered no permanent injury in said accident. He has been fully paid and compensated for all temporary disabilities growing out of said accident. He now suffers, and since August 4th, 1925, has suffered from disease.\u201d The petition was therefore dismissed. This judgment was reversed by the Hudson County Court of Common Pleas on the ground that the petitioner suffered injuries \u201cpartial in character, permanent in quality, amounting to fifteen per cent. (15%) of total and permanent disability.\u201d The court cites no evidence on which this judgment is based and we are unable to find any such evidence in the record. The most we can find is, the petitioner testified: \u201cI feel pain in my veins and my hip and thigh. I feel pain. I can hardly walk.\u201d Dr. John Boti testified, the. accident probably precipitated some rheumatic condition, a toxic condition. Dr. Joseph M. Rector testified: <em>\u201cA. </em>The man has a previous gonorrhea and it hhs not been completely cured, and the man is .being infected both from the condition of his inguinal glands and also from his mouth.\u201d The <em>certiorari </em>prayed for in the rule to show cause will be allowed dir\u00e9eted to the Court of Common Pleas of Hudson county.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
