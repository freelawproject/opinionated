The Secretary ordered that federal financial support for the affected Arizona public-assistance programs be discontinued for the duration of the non-conformities. In No. 71-1177, Arizona' petitions this court for review of the Secretary\u2019s final decision, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(a). Several organizations representing welfare recipients had participated in the hearing as intervenors. Those organizations seek to intervene as respondents in No. 71-1177. In addition, in No. 71-1250 intervenors <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> petition this court for review of a procedural ruling made during the conformity hearing and affirmed by the Secretary. We affirm the Secretary\u2019s determinations in No. 71-1177; we dismiss No. 71-1250 for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">A. <em>The Statutory Scheme.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-15\">Pursuant to the Social Security Act (the Act), the federal government provides grants-in-aid to states that administer programs for supplying assistance to specified categories of needy individuals and families. Four such programs are involved here: (1) Old-Age Assistance (OAA) under Title I of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301-306; (2) Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Child Welfare Services (CWS) under Title IV, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-610, 620-626; (3) Aid to the Blind (AB) under Title X, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1201-1206; and (4) Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled (APTD) under Title XIV, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1351-1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-16\">States choosing to receive these grants-in-aid are required to formulate plans for administering the assistance programs. The states have free rein in designing many aspects of the plans, such as establishing criteria for need and setting the level of benefits to be paid. The Act, however, prescribes certain requirements with which all state plans must comply. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 302(a), 602(a), 1202(a), 1352(a). State plans must be approved by the Secretary before they can be implemented. The Secretary cannot approve any plan unless it meets the specified requirements and, in addition, does not impose as a condition of eligibility for assistance under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the plan certain proscribed types of residence or citizenship requirements. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 302(b), 602(b), 1202(b), 1352 (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If a plan fulfills the specified requirements <em>and </em>is free from the proscribed conditions, the Secretary must approve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Once approved, a state\u2019s plan is subject to continuing scrutiny by the Secretary to ensure its continuing conformity to the federally imposed requirements and its continuing freedom from the federally proscribed conditions, both on the face of the plan and in its administration. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 304, 604(a), 1204, 1354. Should the Secretary call into question the continuing conformity of the plan or of its administration to federal requirements, he must provide reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the state agency administering the plan. If, following a conformity hearing, the Secretary determines that the plan or its administration no longer meets federal requirements, he must terminate further federal payments to the state program until the non-compliance is cured.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Finally, if a state is dissatisfied with the Secretary\u2019s final decision, it may file a petition for review of the decision in the appropriate court of appeals. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">B. <em>The Background of This Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">1. <em>Administrative proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">On July 8, 1970, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, acting through the Administrator, notified the Commissioner of the Arizona State Department of Public Welfare that a hearing would be held on August 18, 1970, to determine whether four of Arizona\u2019s public assistance plans (OAA; AFDC and CWS; AB; and APTD) were in conformity with federal requirements and, if not, whether federal grants-in-aid to those programs should be terminated. The Administrator\u2019s notice specified ' four issues to be considered at the hearing, and noted that HEW and Arizona officials had been unable to reach agreement on those issues after extensive negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">The conformity hearing was governed by HEW regulations promulgated on July 29, 1970. 45 C.F.R. Part 213 (originally promulgated in 35 Fed.Reg. 12180).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Administrator delegated the conduct of the hearing to a hearing examiner. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.21(a). Pursuant to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.15, the hearing examiner granted the petitions of the intervenors to participate in the conformity hearing. In their petitions, the intervenors listed 11 issues, in addition to the four specified in the Administrator\u2019s notice, which they sought to have considered at the conformity hearing. The conformity hearing was held on August 18 and 19, 1970. On August 18, the hearing examiner denied intervenors\u2019 request to expand the scope of the hearing to include the 11 additional issues, basing his denial on 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.14 (d). In his Recommended Findings and Proposed Decision, submitted November 27, 1970, the hearing examiner concluded that the Arizona plans were out of conformity in three of the four disputed respects, but that as to the fourth, HEW had not \u201csustained its burden of proof.\u201d Following additional briefing and oral argument, the Administrator determined, on January 26, 1971, that the Arizona plans did not conform with federal requirements with respect to all four issues. He therefore ordered discontinuance, effective April 1, 1971, of federal grants-in-aid to those four programs for the duration of the noncon-formities. The Administrator also approved the hearing examiner\u2019s denial of intervenors\u2019 motion to introduce addi- ' tional issues. The Administrator\u2019s de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>cisi\u00f3n automatically became the final decision of the Secretary. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.32(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">2. <em>Proceedings before this court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">On February 8, 1971, Arizona filed with this court its petition in No. 71-1177 to review the Secretary\u2019s final decision, and also a motion to stay enforcement and execution of the Secretary\u2019s termination order pending this court\u2019s decision. On February 18, HEW filed a motion agreeing with Arizona\u2019s request for a stay, provided that this court would order expedited briefing and argument. On February 22, we granted the stay and ordered the case expedited. On March 5, intervenors moved for leave to intervene in No. 71-1177, and this court granted that motion on March 22, \u201cwithout prejudice to the right of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to seek to limit intervenors to the issues presented by the review of the Arizona State Department of Public Welfare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The petition for review in No. 71-1250 was filed by intervenors on February 22, 1971. It requested (1) review of that part of the Secretary\u2019s final decision denying them permission to raise additional issues at the conformity hearing and (2) permission to be heard as respondents on those issues raised by Arizona\u2019s petition for review in No. 71-1177. Arizona moved to dismiss intervenors\u2019 petition, and on March 10 this court ordered that the ruling on Arizona\u2019s motion to dismiss be reserved for the panel hearing the case on the merits. Point (2), however, has already been effectively disposed of by this court\u2019s order of March 22 in No. 71-1177, permitting interve-nors to respond in that case. Accordingly, the only question left open under Arizona\u2019s motion to dismiss relates to point (1) of intervenors\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"AdT\">The waters were subsequently and unfortunately muddied when, on April 9, Arizona filed a second motion to dismiss intervenors\u2019 petition in No. 71-1250<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On April 26, this court ordered that that motion to dismiss be denied as to point (1) of intervenors\u2019 petition, and granted as to point (2). HEW then moved to vacate the April 26 order, requesting us to reserve our ruling on Arizona\u2019s second motion to dismiss until after oral argument. Oral argument has since been held, and we have not yet ruled on HEW\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">The flurry of motions in these expedited cases has produced an unfortunate amount of confusion and an apparent contradiction between our March 22 order in No. 71-1177 and our April 26 order in No. 71-1250. To alleviate the confusion, we now grant HEW\u2019s motion to vacate our April 26 order in No. 71-1250. To remove any lingering doubts, we affirm our order of March 22, permitting intervention in No. 71-1177. Consequently, we need only dispose of Arizona\u2019s motion to dismiss intervenors\u2019 petition in No. 71-1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">C. <em>This Court\u2019s jurisdiction to Entertain the Petition for Review in No. 71-1250.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">Intervenors\u2019 petition for review of that part of the Secretary\u2019s final decision denying their request to raise additional issues at the conformity hearing. Arizona\u2019s second motion to dismiss asserts that we lack jurisdiction to entertain the petition under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316 (a). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">Section 1316(a) states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-13\">\u201c(3) Any State which is dissatisfied with * * * a final determination of the Secretary under section 304, 604, 1204, [or] 1354 * * * of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>title may, within 60 days after it has been notified of such determination, file with the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such State is located a petition for review of such determination. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">(5) The court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Secretary or to set it aside, in whole or in part. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Thus Congress has conferred on this court jurisdiction to entertain petitions for review of the Secretary\u2019s decisions following conformity hearings under the Social Security Act. The express grant of jurisdiction is made in section 1316 (a) (5), which does not expressly limit our jurisdiction to petitions filed by certain parties. However, subsection (5) is a part of \u00a7 1316, and subsection (3) supplies the context for subsection (5), and subsection (3) provides only for states <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to file petitions for review. Considered in isolation, the grant of jurisdiction in subsection (5) is unqualified; so to read it, however, is to ignore subsection (3), a part of the same statute. We must and do read subsections (3) and (5) together, as by their express terms conferring jurisdiction on this court to entertain only petitions for review filed by <em>states </em>dissatisfied with a final decision of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The legislative history of section 1316 shows that Congress intended to confer jurisdiction only where the petition for review is filed by the state. The purpose of the section was to permit aggrieved states, for the first time, \u201cto receive a judicial determination of their disagreement with the Department [of HEW]\u201d on the issue of nonconformity. Ill Cong.Rec. 2714 (1965) (remarks of Representative Curtis). <em>See also </em>Hearings on H.R. 6675, Before the Senate Finance Comm., 89th Cong., 1st Sess., Part I, at 215 (1965) (statement of the Secretary of HEW); H.R.Rep.No.213, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., at p. 131 (1965); 111 Cong.Rec. 3066 (1965) (remarks of Senator Javits).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">The courts of appeal are not courts of general jurisdiction; they have only the jurisdiction specifically conferred upon them by acts of Congress. American Federation of Labor v. N. L. R. B., 1940, 308 U.S. 401, 404, 60 S.Ct. 300, 84 L.Ed. 347; Turkel v. F. D. A., 6 Cir., 1964, 334 F.2d 844, 846; 9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice j[ 110.01, at 47 (2d ed. 1970); cf. American Power &amp; Light Co. v. S. E. C., 1945, 325 U.S. 385, 389-390, 65 S.Ct. 1254, 89 L.Ed. 1683. Section 1316(a) confers upon us jurisdiction to entertain only petitions for review of the Secretary\u2019s final decisions that are filed by states. We therefore have no jurisdiction to entertain intervenors\u2019 petition in No. 71-1250, unless intervenors can demonstrate that jurisdiction is conferred on us by another source.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">Intervenors attempt such a demonstration. Asserting that, as organizations of welfare recipients, they have suffered a \u201clegal wrong\u201d by the Administrator\u2019s denial of their request to broaden the scope of the conformity hearing, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, intervenors argue that they have standing to seek judicial review and that they are therefore entitled to review in this court. Their argument is faulty. Admittedly the concept of standing is multifaceted and often ill-defined, <em>see, </em>e. g., Tigar, Judicial Power, the \u201cPolitical Question Doctrine,\u201d and Foreign Relations, 17 U.C. L.A.L.Rev. 1135, 1138-39 n. 11 (1970), but it has never been extended so far as to defeat the jurisdictional limitations placed upon this court by Congress. The elemental distinction between a litigant\u2019s standing and an appellate court\u2019s jurisdictional limitations is fatal to intervenors\u2019 argument. Intervenors rely extensively on National Welfare Rights Organization v. Finch, 1970, 139 U.S. App.D.C. 46, 429 F.2d 725, to buttress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>their theory. That case held that the National Welfare Rights Organization had standing to intervene in an HEW conformity hearing,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a holding reached by analogy to the law of standing to seek judicial review. That case did not involve a petition filed in this court under section 1316(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">At oral argument the question arose whether the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703, taken together with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(a), confers jurisdiction upon this court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Numerous courts have held, as we now hold, that section 703 does not confer upon a court of appeals any additional jurisdiction not expressly authorized by a separate statutory grant of power. State of Wisconsin v. F. P. C., 1961, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 260, 292 F.2d 753, 755; Schwab v. Quesada, 3 Cir,, 1960, 284 F.2d 140, 143; Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. F. P. C., 5 Cir., 1956, 236 F.2d 785, 793; City of Dallas v. Rentzel, 5 Cir., 1949, 172 F.2d 122, 123. And see the dicta in Pan American World Airways, Inc. v. C. A.

We need not decide whether intervenors can, under the Administra-five Procedure Act, obtain review of the Secretary\u2019s denial in the district court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Cf. National Welfare Rights Organization v. Finch, <em>supra, </em>429 F.2d at 736 (quoting Judge Lumbard\u2019s concurring opinion in Rosado v.

In short, intervenor D.N.A. seeks to raise in No. 71-1177 the same points which other intervenors sought to raise in No. 71-1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">The critical portion of D.N.A.\u2019s motion to intervene in No. 71-1177 reads as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">\u201c5. D.N.A. therefore seeks leave to intervene in this proceeding [No. 71-1177] in order to participate as a <em>party-petitioner </em>with respect to those issues on which it seeks reversal of the Administrator\u2019s decision and as a party-respondent with respect to those issues on which it seeks affirmance of that decision. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Were we to grant D.N.A.'s request to intervene as a party <em>-petitioner </em>with respect to that issue, we would be letting in the back door precisely what we have already said should not enter the front door and precisely what Congress has said does not belong in the house at all. Nor would it be proper to permit D.N.A. to introduce its controverted issue in its capacity as party-respondent, a capacity already granted by our March 22 order. Respondents respond; they do not raise issues not raised by the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The Department of HEW has exercised its right \u201cto seek to limit inter-venors to the issues presented by the review of the Arizona State Department of Public Welfare.\u201d We limit intervention in No. 71-1177 to those issues raised by Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">E. <em>Arizona\u2019s Petition for Review in No. 71-1177.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">The Administrator ruled adversely to Arizona with respect to each of the four issues considered at the conformity hearing ; Arizona disputes those rulings. In addition, Arizona claims that it was denied procedural fairness during the conformity hearing in various ways. We treat these points <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">1. <em>Arizona\u2019s Residence Requirements. </em>All public-assistance programs administered by the Arizona State Department of Public Welfare are subject to the provisions of Arizona Rev.Stat. \u00a7 46-209, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-13\">\u201cA. Any recipient of assistance desiring to reside outside the state for a period not to exceed ninety days shall execute a form provided by the state department [of public welfare]. The form shall require the recipient to express his intent as to establishing legal residence outside the state, or his intent to return to the state within ninety days. If it is the intent of recipient to establish legal residence outside the state, he may continue to receive assistance from this state while residing in another for a period not to exceed three months or until he meets the residence eligibility requirements for assistance in that state, whichever is lesser.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-14\">B. A recipient of any assistance granted under this title shall not be continued on assistance after he has been absent from the state for three consecutive months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">These provisions have been incorporated in Arizona\u2019s plans for programs administering OAA, AFDC, AB, and APTD assistance.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If an Arizona recipient of as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>sistance under one of these programs leaves Arizona for longer than 90 days, he automatically loses his entitlement to continued assistance; upon his return to Arizona, he must reapply for assistance as a new resident, even if he intended all along to be absent from Arizona only temporarily. Absence from the state for more than 90 days thus raises, as Arizona insists it should, a conclusive presumption of intent to change residence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">At the time of the conformity hearing, the following interim HEW regulation was in effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">\u201cA State plan which conditions eligibility upon residence in the State may not exclude from eligibility any individual who resides in the State under the following definition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">A resident of a State is one who is living in the State voluntarily and not for a temporary purpose, that is, with no intention of presently removing therefrom. A child is \u2018residing in the State\u2019 if he is making his home in the State. <em>Temporary absence from the State, with subsequent returns to the State, or intent to return when the purposes of the absence have been accomplished, shall not interrupt continuity of residence.\u201d </em>34 Fed.Reg. 8715 (1969), promulgating interim 45 C. F.R. \u00a7 202.3(b). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-J\">The interim regulation applies to State plans for administering OAA, AFDC, AB, and APTD assistance. <em>Id. </em>It has since been replaced by a substantially identical permanent regulation. 45 C.F. R. \u00a7 233.40 (promulgated by 35 Fed.Reg. 17719 (1970)).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The HEW regulation and Arizona\u2019s automatic-termination provision are obviously inconsistent. The regulation states that any recipient must remain eligible for continued assistance despite his temporary absence from the state, so long as he has an \u201cintent to return when the purposes of the absence have been accomplished.\u201d The Arizona requirement states that absence for 90 days by itself terminates eligibility, and that after 90 days any \u201cintent to return\u201d is entirely immaterial to continued eligibility, even though the recipient can prove that he had all along intended to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Arizona does not deny this inconsistency.

See King v. Smith, 1968, 392 U.S. 309, 317, 319 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118; <em>cf. </em>Lewis v. Martin, 1970, 397 U.S. 552, 556, 559, 90 S.Ct. 1282, 25 L.Ed.2d 561. Arizona argues, however, that the Secretary\u2019s rule-making power does not extend to the regulation involved here, because the latter is inconsistent with the Social Security Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In particular, the regulation\u2019s definition of \u201cresidence\u201d is, according to Arizona, inconsistent with the residency provisions contained in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 302(b), 602(b), 1202(b), and 1352(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">We find no inconsistency between these provisions and the regulation. Although sections 302(b), 602(b), 1202(b), and 1352(b) limit the residency requirements that a state plan may permissibly impose,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> neither those sections nor any other section in the Act defines \u201cresidence\u201d or a \u201cresident.\u201d The Secretary has chosen to define those terms in a regulation. His definition has the effect of further limiting the states\u2019 permissible choice of residency requirements. But we cannot find the Secretary\u2019s definition inconsistent with the letter or the spirit of the Act merely because it holds the states to a higher standard.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Compare Lewis v. Martin, <em>supra </em>(upholding an HEW regulation de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>fining \u201cincome and resources,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (7), which places more stringent requirements on state AFDC programs) ; and see United States v.

No such \u201ccompelling indications\u201d are to be found; indeed, the Secretary\u2019s definition of \u201cresidence\u201d wholly comports with the Act\u2019s recognized policy of promoting \u201c[l]iberality of residence requirement.\u201d Shapiro v. Thompson, 1969, 394 U.S. 618, 640, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600, discussing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(b), and quoting H.R.Rep.No.615, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. at 24, and S.Rep.No.628, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. at 35. We find the Secretary\u2019s definition not inconsistent with the Act, and we hold that the interim regulation and its permanent successor fall within the Secretary\u2019s rule-making power under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Arizona\u2019s reliance on the fact that the Secretary promulgated this regulation in response to Shapiro v. Thompson, <em>supra, </em>is misplaced. That the regulation was responsive to <em>Shapiro </em>is correct. See 34 Fed.Reg. 8715 (1969). It is also correct, as Arizona notes, that the regulation is sufficiently broad to invalidate not only state residence requirements of the sort struck down in <em>Shapiro, </em>but also quite distinguishable residence requirements, such as Arizona\u2019s here.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Arizona errs in concluding, however, that because the regulation creates a remedy broader than the problem to which it was responsive, the regulation is invalid either <em>pro tanto </em>or in its entirety. Whatever may have motivated the Secretary to promulgate this regulation, the scope of his rule-making authority under the Social Security Act is limited only by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302 and the Constitution. This regulation is within the scope of that authority. It makes no difference that the regulation was not narrowly tailored to deal only with state residence requirements like that in <em>Shapiro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Arizona cites Wyman v. James, 1971 400 U.S. 309, 91 S.Ct. 381, 27 L.Ed.2d 408, for the proposition that \u201cthe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the permissibility of eligibility requirements not expressly authorized by the Act.\u201d If Arizona means to suggest that <em>some </em>such eligibility requirements are permissible, we agree; if Arizona means that <em>all </em>are permissible then Arizona is wrong. The Supreme Court has never approved state eligibility requirements that conflict with the Act or with valid federal regulations issued pursuant to the Act, nor has any other federal court. The state provisions attacked in Wyman v. James were not alleged to conflict with the Act or with its implementing regulations; a constitutional challenge was made. The Court upheld the state provisions because, <em>as limited by valid HEW regulations, </em>the state provisions did not entail unconstitutional state action. See Wy-man v. James, <em>supra, </em>400 U.S. at 319, n. 6, and 321, 91 S.Ct. 381 (alternative holding).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The Secretary\u2019s determination that the Arizona provisions automatically terminating welfare eligibility following a 90-day absence are not in conformity with valid federal requirements must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>2. <em>Disregard of earned income for AFDC.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Title IV of the Social Security Act governs federal grants-in-aid to state programs for assistance to needy families with children \u2014 the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-610. To obtain federal approval, a state AFDC plan must satisfy an elaborate set of requirements. <em>Inter alia, </em>the state plan must, with specified exceptions,</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u201cProvide that the State agency shall, in determining need, take into consideration any other income and resources of any child or relative claiming aid to families with dependent children, or of any other individual (living in the same home as such child and relative) whose needs the State determines should be considered in determining the need of the child or relative claiming such aid, as well as any expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of any such income * *</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (7). The exceptions require that certain \u201cother income and resources\u201d not be taken into consideration by the <em>state </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>that they be disregarded. In particular, a state plan must provide that the state agency administering the plan</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\u201c(A) shall with respect to any month disregard\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">(ii) in the case of earned income of a dependent child not [a full- or part-time student], a relative receiving such aid, and any other individual (living in the same home as such relative and child) whose needs are taken into account in making such determination, the first $30 of the total of such earned income for such month plus one-third of the remainder of such income for such month. * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (8) (A) .<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">The Secretary has promulgated regulations elaborating on the AFDC income-disregard provision, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.20 (a) (11), as well as on income-disregard provisions of other assistance programs under the Act, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 233.20(a) (4)-(10).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The regulation here in dispute is generally applicable to all income-disregard provisions, although the dispute arises in the context of Arizona\u2019s AFDC plan. The disputed regulation, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.20(a) (7) (i), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5i\">\u201c(a) <em>Requirements for State Plans. </em>A State Plan for OAA, AFDC, AB, APTD or AABD [Aid to the Aged, Blind or Disabled] must, as specified below: * -X- *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">(7) <em>Disregard of earned income; method, </em>(i) Provide that the following method will be used for disregarding earned income: The applicable amounts of earned income to be disregarded will be deducted from the gross amount of \u2018earned income,\u2019 and all work expenses, personal and nonpersonal, will then be deducted. Only the net amount remaining will be applied in determining need and the amount of the assistance payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Arizona\u2019s AFDC plan requires that work-related expenses first be subtracted from the individual\u2019s gross income and that the disregarded income then be subtracted from the difference. Thus Arizona applies the income disregard to <em>net </em>income, while the HEW regulation requires the income disregard to be applied to <em>gross </em>income. The Arizona AFDC plan and the HEW regulation are clearly in conflict. Arizona\u2019s sole contention is that the HEW regulation is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">What we have said already about the Secretary\u2019s broad rulemaking power under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302 applies equally here. The Secretary is beyond any doubt empowered to promulgate uniform regulations governing the complexities of income-disregard accounting. The regulation here in question implements section 402(a) (8) (A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (8) (A)); it is reasonable on its face.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Since we must \u201cgive HEW the deference due the agency charged with the administration of the Act,\u201d Lewis v. Martin, <em>supra, </em>397 U.S. at 559, 90 S.Ct. at 1286, we hold that the disputed regulation is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Arizona suggests that the Secretary\u2019s income-disregard regulation infringes the state\u2019s \u201cundisputed power to set the level of benefits and the standard of need,\u201d King v. Smith, <em>supra, </em>392 U.S. at 334, 88 S.Ct. at 2142, and that it ignores the mandatory \u201crecognition that the federal law gives each State great latitude in dispensing its available funds,\u201d Dandridge v. Williams, 1970, 397 U.S. 471, 478, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1158, 25 L.Ed.2d 491. The \u201cpower\u201d and \u201clatitude\u201d possessed by the state are circumscribed by the scope of valid and applicable federal statutes and regulations. Within that circumscription the states are free to tailor their assistance programs as they deem best. They may not, however, contravene valid federal requirements except at pain of losing their federal grants-in-aid, King v. Smith, <em>supra, </em>392 U.S. at 333 n. 24, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 20 L.Ed. 2d 1118; see Oklahoma v. United States Civil Service Comm\u2019n, 1947, 330 U.S. 127, 143, 144, 67 S.Ct. 544, 91 L.Ed. 794. Moreover, the income-disregard provision here in question does not reduce Arizona\u2019s \u201cgreat latitude in dispensing its available funds.\u201d It merely requires Arizona to make the calculations on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>basis of which it allocates its AFDC funds in a particular way. Compare, <em>e. g., </em>Ramos v. Montgomery, S.D.Cal., 1970, 313 F.Supp. 1179, aff\u2019d mem., 1971, 400 U.S. 1003, 91 S.Ct. 572, 27 L.Ed.2d 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">The Secretary\u2019s determination that the method used by Arizona to calculate AFDC income disregard is not in conformity with valid federal requirements must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">3. <em>State-level advisory committee for AFDC and CWS.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">45 C.F.R. Part 220, Subpart A, requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">\u201cThe State plans for AFDC and CWS pursuant to title IV, parts A [AFDC] and B [CWS] of the Social Security Act must, with respect to the administration of the service programs for families and children,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">(a) Contain provisions committing the State to meet the requirements in this subpart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">* * <em>*\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">45 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.1. One such requirement, and the one disputed by Arizona, is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-11\">\u201cAn advisory committee on AFDC and CWS programs must be established at the State level and at local levels where the programs are locally administered, except that in local jurisdictions with small caseloads alternate procedures for securing similar participation may be established. * * *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-19\">45 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.4(a).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Arizona\u2019s plan for administering AFDC and CWS assistance and services does not provide for an advisory committee, and is therefore in nonconformity with the requirement. As in the case of the preceding two issues, Arizona does not deny the inconsistency between its plan and the regulation, but attacks the regulation as invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-20\">Arizona claims, once again, that the Secretary has exceeded his rule-making authority under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302 in promulgating the regulation requiring an AFDC-CWS advisory council. Arizona\u2019s claim is two-fold: first, that the requirement is \u201cinconsistent with the intended purpose of the Social Security Act,\u201d and second, that it is not \u201cnecessary to the efficient administration of the functions\u201d with which the Secretary is charged under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-21\">Arizona\u2019s initial argument that the requirement is inconsistent with the Act is based upon 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (3), which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-22\">\u201cA State plan for aid and services to needy families with children must * * * either provide for the establishment or designation of a single State agency to administer the plan, or provide for the establishment or designation of a single State agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>to supervise the administration of the plan. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Arizona contends that the advisory committee would be <em>de facto </em>a second agency, in addition to the state\u2019s own properly designated public-assistance agency, resulting in more than \u201ca single State agency\u201d administering the state plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The contention holds no water. As the Administrator\u2019s decision notes, \u201cthe committee\u2019s role is purely advisory and entails none of the administrative functions which fall within the province of the single State agency which is required by Section 402(a) (3) [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (3)].\u201d With or without the advisory committee, the responsibility for making the actual administrative decisions and for implementing them rests in a single set of hands \u2014 those of the state agency. The Secretary\u2019s regulation requires the advisory committee to \u201chave adequate opportunity for meaningful participation in policy development and program administration, including the furtherance of recipient participation in the program of the agency.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.4(a) (1). But this requirement does not relieve the state agency of any of its administrative authority or responsibility; it merely requires the agency to solicit and consider the advisory committee\u2019s views as a part of the agency\u2019s own decision-making process. The decisions themselves remain with the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Arizona argues that the Secretary\u2019s regulation is inconsistent with the Act in another way. Arizona notes that certain provisions of the Act expressly require the creation of various advisory bodies. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 622(a) (1) (C) (ii), 1314(a), 1314(f).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Arizona then reasons that \u201c[t]hese sections express the final will of Congress on the advisory council issue. Applying the rule of statutory construction, <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>it is clear Congress did not intend that the Secretary of HEW force other advisory council requirements upon the states.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">We cannot accept this reasoning. The maxim <em>expressio unius </em>\u201cis a product of \u2018logic and common sense,\u2019 \u201d 2 Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a7 4916, at 415 (3d ed. Horack, 1943), and is properly applied only when the result to which its application leads is itself logical and sensible. K. Llewellyn, The Common Law Tradition: Deciding Appeals, at page 521, (1960); <em>cf. id. </em>at 526 (paired maxims no. 20). Neither logic nor common sense supports applying the maxim here. The Social Security Act comprehends a complex aggregation of enactments, amendments, and repeals ranging over a period of 36 years. More than most statutes, the Act was and is responsive to the changing landscape of American society; its beneficent purposes would be stultified by rigidly attributing to each Congressional attempt to improve the Act\u2019s responsiveness a concomitant Congressional intent not to permit further administrative improvements by those charged with the Act\u2019s implementation. <em>See </em>2 Sutherland on Statutory Construction, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4917, at 421; 3 <em>id. </em>\u00a7 6604, at 287-288. Thus, this is another one of those instances in which \u201ctoo much is claimed for\u201d the maxim, United States v. Barnes, 1912, 222 U.S. 513, 519, 32 S.Ct. 117, 56 L.Ed. 291, and we decline to apply it here. We conclude that the Act\u2019s express provision for the creation of certain other advisory bodies is in no way inconsistent with the creation of the AFDC-CWS advisory committee by administrative regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Arizona\u2019s second contention, that the advisory committee is not \u201cnecessary to the efficient administration of the [Secretary\u2019s] functions\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302, is equally without merit. Congress expressly recognized the importance of adequate administrative methods to the success of AFDC-CWS programs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (5), dealing with those programs, supplements the Secretary\u2019s general rule-making powers under section 1302; it states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">\u201cA State plan for aid and services to needy families with children must * * * provide (A) such methods of administration * * * as are found by the Secretary to be necessary for the proper and efficient operation of the plan * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The advisory-committee requirement provides just such a method. That the Secretary in fact found the advisory committee \u201cto be necessary for the proper and efficient operation of\u201d state AFDC-CWS plans appears from his Interim Policy Statement No. 8, 33 Fed. Reg. 10234-35 (1968). That he was entitled to so find follows from his responsibility for administering the various Social Security programs, and from his reasonable discretion in fulfilling that responsibility under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1302 and 602(a) (5). It also follows from the fact, as pointed out in the Administrator\u2019s decision, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">\"[i]n the past, the welfare system of this country has been subject to the criticism that it is closed and unresponsive to the needs of the very people it is designed to serve. In light of this fact, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.4(a) [the advisory-committee requirement] represents a reasonable minimum requirement designed to open up lines of communication between those who administer the AFDC program and AFDC recipients.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Whether the advisory-committee requirement is in fact \u201cnecessary for the proper and efficient administration of the [state\u2019s] plan\u201d \u2014 and Arizona asserts it is not \u2014 is not the question before us. The question is rather whether the Secretary found that it was necessary, and whether that finding was reasonable. He did, and it was.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">Finally, we note Arizona\u2019s claim that the advisory-committee requirement \u201cmakes a sham of the State\u2019s power to create its own offices in derogation of the Tenth Amendment and violates the spirit of cooperative federalism upon which the entire welfare program is grounded.\u201d The claim is frivolous. On the question of constitutionality, see Oklahoma v. United States Civil Service Commission, <em>supra, </em>330 U.S. at 142-144, 67 S.Ct. 544, which is directly in point. See also Sperry v.

The questions involving this provision to be resolved at the conformity hearing were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-13\">\u201c[1] whether the State plan provision for the AFDC program that the caretaker-relative or the welfare department must have legal custody of a child whose siblings are also receiving AFDC in the home of their natural parent(s) in order for such child to be eligible for AFDC, is in compliance with [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (10)], and [2] whether such exclusion from eligibility for AFDC of similarly situated children on a basis unrelated to need is a reasonable classification consistent with the provisions and purposes of Title IV-A of the Social Security Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">The hearing examiner\u2019s Recommended Findings concerning these two questions are, in their entirety, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-15\">\u201cThe Government, which is the moving party herein, has not sustained its burden of proof that the exclusion provided for in section 3-401.3 of the State Assistance Manual is not in compliance with [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (10)] and is an unreasonable and therefore invalid classification under the provisions and purposes of Title IV-A of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-16\">The Administrator declined to follow the Recommended Finding.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> His conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>sion, based on a review of the entire record, was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\">\u201cthat the Arizona \u2018legal custody\u2019 requirement violates the doctrine of \u2018equitable treatment\u2019 and renders the State\u2019s AFDC plan out of conformity with [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (10)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">It is clear from the Administrator\u2019s analysis and conclusion that he found Arizona\u2019s legal-custody provision out of conformity with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (10) only because he found it in violation of the \u201cdoctrine of equitable treatment.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It is equally clear from HEW\u2019s brief in this case that the gravamen of HEW\u2019s objection to the legal-custody provision is its alleged nonconformity with that doctrine. Thus the questions on appeal, as posed by the briefs and arguments in this case, are (1) whether the \u201cdoctrine of equitable treatment,\u201d through 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (10), imposes a valid federal requirement on state AFDC plans, and (2) if so, whether Arizona\u2019s legal-custody provision contravenes that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">We decline to answer these questions as posed. Instead, we hold that Arizona\u2019s legal-custody provision is in direct conflict with the requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (10), even without the intermediation of the equitable-treatment doctrine. Section 602(a) (10) requires \u201c * * * that aid to families with dependent children shall be furnished * * * to all eligible individuals * *</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">The purposes of AFDC programs are set out in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 601:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-13\">\u201cFor the purpose of encouraging the care of dependent children in their own homes <em>or in the homes of relatives </em>by enabling each State to furnish financial assistance and rehabilitation and other services, as far as practicable under the conditions in such State, to needy dependent children and the parents <em>or relatives with whom they are living </em>to help maintain and strengthen <em>family </em>life and to help such parents <em>or relatives </em>to attain or retain capability for the maximum self-support and personal independence consistent with the maintenance of continuing parental care and protection, there is authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year a sum sufficient to carry out the purposes of this part. The sums made available under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>section shall be used for making payments to States which have submitted, and had approved by the Secretary, State plans for aid and services to needy families with children.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606 defines the terms used in the AFDC provisions of the Act. It contains the following definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">\u201c(a) The term \u2018dependent child\u2019 means a needy child (1) who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent, <em>and who is living with his father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, brother, sister, stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, stepsister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, or niece, </em>in a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his or their own home * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">(b) The term \u2018aid to <em>families </em>with dependent children\u2019 means money payments with respect to * * * a dependent child or dependent children, and includes (1) money payments * * * to meet the needs <em>of the relative with whom any dependent child is living * * </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">(e) The term \u2018relative with whom any dependent child is living\u2019 means the individual who <em>is one of the relatives specified in subsection (a) of this section and with whom such child is living </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">Thus, a \u201cneedy child * * * who has been deprived of parental support or care\u201d is just as much a \u201cdependent child\u201d within the meaning of the Act when he lives with a relative as when he lives with a parent. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606(a). A \u201cfamil[y] with dependent children\u201d is just as much a \u201cfamily\u201d within the meaning of the Act when it consists of the child and a relative other than a parent as when it consists of the child and a parent. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 601, 606(b). And a relative qualifies as a \u201crelative with whom any dependent child is living\u201d within the meaning of the Act whenever his or her relationship to the child is one of those specified and the child is actually living with him or her. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 606(c). A similar symmetry between \u201cparents\u201d and \u201crelatives\u201d inheres in the Act\u2019s purposes. \u201c[T]he care of dependent children\u201d is to be equally encouraged whether the dependent child lives with a parent or a relative. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 601. \u201c[FJamily life\u201d is to be \u201cmaintain [ed] and strengthen [ed]\u201d just as much when a dependent child lives with a relative as when he lives with a parent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">The provisions quoted above thus make it perfectly clear that the Act views the AFDC eligibility of a relative with whom a child is living exactly the same as the eligibility of the child\u2019s parent. If a child is \u201cdependent\u201d and if he lives with either a parent or a relative, then the parent or relative is eligible for AFDC assistance on behalf of the child. The Act no more permits any otherwise eligible category of relatives to be automatically rendered totally ineligible for AFDC assistance, on the basis of conditions not found in the Act, than it permits any category of parents to be. And the Act does not permit the latter. See King v. Smith, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">Although the precise question under discussion is, so far as our research has shown, one of first impression, dicta in other cases support our reading of the Act. Referring to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 606(a) and (b), one court has noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-16\">\u201cthe definitions contain no limitation on eligibility by reason of the fact that one, who is otherwise a \u2018dependent child,\u2019 resides in a household with or without one or more other siblings or other persons. Nor do the definitions or any other portion of the Act vest in any state the authority to embroider upon the definition of \u2018dependent child,\u2019 so as to insert conditions and limitations beyond those imposed by Congress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-17\">Williams v. Dandridge, D.Md., 1969, 297 F.Supp. 450, 455 (footnote omitted), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 1970, 397 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>471, 90 S.Ct. 1158, 25 L.Ed.2d 491. Accord, Dews v. Henry, D.Ariz., 1969, 297 F.Supp. 587, 591. And in King v. Smith, <em>supra, </em>392 U.S. at 330, 88 S.Ct. at 2140, the Supreme Court found it unlikely</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5G1\">\u201cthat Congress, at the same time that it intended to provide programs for the economic security and protection of <em>all </em>children, also intended arbitrarily to leave one class of destitute children entirely without meaningful protection.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7a\">Arizona\u2019s legal-custody requirement therefore, conflicts with the treatment of relatives\u2019 AFDC eligibility required by the Act. It automatically and categorically denies AFDC eligibility to \u201c[a] relative of a natural parent who is an Aid for Dependent Children recipient\u201d unless that relative (or the Arizona State Department of Public Welfare) has legal custody of the child. Thus, suppose a mother has two children, one of whom lives with her, and suppose the mother receives AFDC assistance. If the other child is living with his or her \u201cgrandfather, grandmother, brother, sister, * * * uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, or niece,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606(a), that relative cannot receive AFDC on behalf of the child unless the relative (or the Department of Public Welfare) has legal custody of the child. The Act does not countenance a state\u2019s imposition of such a condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Arizona makes several claims on behalf of its requirement, with none of which we agree. <em>First, </em>Arizona asserts that the requirement is \u201c[i]n strict conformity with the federal Aid to Families with Dependent Children program objectives \u2018to help maintain and strengthen family life,\u2019 \u201d because it discourages the splitting-up of parents and children. As we have pointed out, however, a \u201cfamily\u201d within the meaning of the AFDC provisions of the Act does not comprehend only the child and his parents. A household consisting of the child and his \u201cgrandfather, grandmother,\u201d etc., is as much a \u201cfamily\u201d within the meaning of the Act as is a household consisting of the child and his mother or father. <em>See especially </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601, 606(b), quoted <em>supra. </em>This point is particularly critical in this case, since, as the evidence showed and as the Administrator pointed out, \u201ca common, if not the predominant cultural pattern among Mexi-ean-Americans and Indians in Arizona is the \u2018extended family.\u2019 Under this cultural system, it is common for children to be sent to live for short periods of time with relatives. In order to receive AFDC, however, these relatives would have to undertake the burdensome and costly task of acquiring legal custody, which may invest the resulting situation with a degree of permanence that is unacceptable to everyone concerned.\u201d Thus Arizona\u2019s legal-custody requirement falls especially heavily on Arizona\u2019s Mexican-American and Indian minorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\"><em>Second: </em>Arizona asserts that it has a legitimate interest in conserving its public-assistance funds so that it may assist as many unrelated families to as great an extent as possible. It wishes to encourage dependent children to live in the same household, in order to take advantage of \u201cthe greater ability of large families \u2014 because of the inherent economies of scale \u2014 to accommodate their needs to diminished per capita payments.\u201d Dandridge v. Williams, 1970, 397 U.S. 471, 479-480, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1159. Legitimate though that interest is, it cannot prevail over the requirements of the Act. Arizona\u2019s \u201cinterest in economically allocating its limited AFDC resources may be protected by its undisputed power to set the level of benefits and the standard of need, and by its taking into account in determining whether a child is needy all actual and regular contributions to his support.\u201d King v. Smith, <em>supra, </em>392 U.S. at 334, 88 S.Ct. at 2142. Arizona may also protect that interest by imposing a fixed upper limit on the total amount of money any one family unit may receive, Dandridge v. Williams, <em>supra, </em>or by paying to each AFDC recipient a fixed percentage of his actual needs, Ward v. Winstead, N.D.Miss., 1970, 314 F.Supp. 1225, 1233, appeal dismissed for untimely fil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>ing, 1971, 400 U.S. 1019, 91 S.Ct. 587, 27 L.Ed.2d 630; <em>cf. </em>Rosado v. Wyman, 1970, 397 U.S. 397, 413-414, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 25 L.Ed.2d 442. Arizona may not protect that interest by declaring ineligible for AFDC assistance persons whom Congress has said shall be eligible.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><em>Third: </em>Arizona argues the practical desirability of having children living with adults legally responsible for them, in order \u201cthat in case of medical emergency one capable of consenting to treatment, whether the Welfare Department or a relative, will be available,\u201d and in order to cure \u201cproblems that arise when a child needs permission to marry, authorization to participate in school activities or permission to obtain a [driver\u2019s] license.\u201d These claimed practical advantages are of questionable significance; certainly nothing in the record suggests that they ought to be given great weight. And in any event, weighty or not, they do not justify deviation from the Act\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\"><em>Fourth: </em>Arizona invokes the special interest that a state has in regulating \u201cthe marriage and family relationship.\u201d But such regulation is not in question here. What is in question is whether Arizona can use federally provided funds in a manner at odds with the conditions specified by Congress for their use.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Arizona\u2019s AFDC plan does not fulfill the mandatory condition \u201cthat aid to families with dependent children shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to <em>all </em>eligible individuals.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602 (a) (10) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">5. <em>Arizona\u2019s attack upon the conformity-hearing process.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">Arizona contends that it was denied procedural fairness during the conformity hearing. Recognizing that \u201c[t]he word \u2018person\u2019 in the context of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment cannot, by any reasonable mode of interpretation, be expanded to encompass the States of the Union,\u201d South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 1966, 383 U.S. 301, 323, 86 S.Ct. 803, 816, 15 L.Ed.2d 769, Arizona finds a requirement of procedural fairness in other sources. In particular, Arizona claims that the Tenth Amendment \u201cembodies the State\u2019s constitutionally nonexplicit fundamental rights that are protected by the Federal Constitution.\u201d Arizona also argues that the Ninth Amendment reserves to its citizens \u201cfundamental individual protections not enumerated in\u201d the Constitution, and that Arizona is acting as <em>parens patriae </em>of its citizens in this case; thus, the argument concludes Arizona \u201cis the only one with standing to protect [its citizens\u2019] rights in this unique situation where the damage to individuals arises from unfair treatment of the State as the representative of its people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-14\">Although Arizona may in appropriate situations assert claims as <em>parens patriae </em>on behalf of its citizens, <em>see, e. g., </em>Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>California, 9 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 1282 and cases cited, cert. granted, 1971, 401 U.S. 936, 91 S.Ct. 931, 28 L.Ed.2d 215, the situation here is not an appropriate one. The very basis of this proceeding is HEW\u2019s attempt to assure that Arizona citizens receive benefits conferred upon them by Congress; the federal government, through the Department of HEW, is itself acting as <em>parens patriae </em>in seeking to vindicate individual rights created by federal statute and jeopardized by Arizona. In such a situation, Arizona cannot act as <em>parens patriae </em>against the federal government. See South Carolina v. Katzenbach, <em>supra, </em>383 U.S. at 324, 86 S.Ct. 803 and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">As for Arizona\u2019s Tenth Amendment claim, we find Oklahoma v. United States Civil Service Commission, <em>supra, </em>apposite. That case involved a hearing the purpose of which was, like the conformity hearing here, to determine whether the state had adhered to conditions attached to grants of federal funds. <em>See </em>\u00a7 12 of the Hatch Act, 54 Stat. 767-770 as amended (now codified at 5 U.S.C. Ch. 15). Responding to Oklahoma\u2019s claim that its sovereignty had been violated, the Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">\u201cThe Tenth Amendment has been consistently construed \u2018as not depriving the national government of authority to resort to all means for the exercise of a granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted to the permitted end.\u2019 [quoting United States v. Darby, 1941, 312 U.S. 100, 124, 657, 61 S.Ct. 451, 462, 85 L.Ed. 609.] * * * A hearing was had, <em>conform-ably to </em>\u00a7 <em>12; </em>and the conclusion was reached that Mr. Paris\u2019 active partipation in politics justified his removal from membership on the Highway Commission. Oklahoma chose not to remove him. We do not see any violation of the state\u2019s sovereignty in the <em>hearing </em>or order.\u201d 330 U.S. at 143, 67 S.Ct. at 553 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Like Arizona here, Oklahoma was a party to the administrative hearing; unlike Arizona, Oklahoma did not allege specific procedural shortcomings. Notwithstanding this distinction, we think the <em>Oklahoma </em>case refutes Arizona\u2019s reliance on the Tenth Amendment. To go further and read the Tenth Amendment as incorporating <em>specific </em>guarantees of procedural fairness would exceed even an expansive reading of the Amendment\u2019s proper scope. At very most the Amendment reserves certain powers to the states, <em>cf. </em>Sperry v. Florida, 1963, 373 U.S. 379, 403, 83 S.Ct. 1322, 10 L.Ed.2d 428; it assuredly does not incorporate a Bill of Procedural Rights for the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Since Arizona\u2019s constitutional objections to the hearing procedures are not tenable, the procedures of which Arizona complains must be upheld if they are properly authorized by statute or regulation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We now turn to Arizona\u2019s specific complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\"><em>First: </em>The pre-hearing notice given Arizona specified only the issues to be treated, and did not disclose the nature of the evidence or the identity of the witnesses to be presented. Arizona applied to the Administrator for a continuance in order to be able to discover who and what would be presented by HEW. The application was denied by the hearing examiner. Arizona now contends that only the Administrator is authorized to grant or deny continuances, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.12,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and that the hearing examiner violated that regulation in doing so instead. However, 45 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 213.21(a), 213.22(a) (1), and 213.22 (a) (5) clearly authorize the hearing examiner to grant and deny continuances.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We cannot say, on the basis of the record before us, that the hearing examiner abused his discretion in denying Arizona\u2019s application for a continuance. Nor does it appear that Arizona was seriously prejudiced: At the conclusion of the hearing the examiner asked counsel for Arizona if they needed a continuance in order to respond to evidence adduced at the hearing, and counsel said they did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">(22] <em>Second: </em>The hearing examiner confined himself to taking evidence and ruling on the conformity of Arizona\u2019s plans with the Secretary\u2019s regulations. He declined to rule on Arizona\u2019s contentions that HEW\u2019s policies and regulations contravened the Act. Arizona now claims that \u201c(b]y forcing the State into a limited forum that was unable to consider the merits of its case, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare effectively denied Arizona the opportunity of challenging it, thereby ignoring the fundamental ethic of fair play. * -\u00bb <em>*\u00bb </em>The administrative forum, however, was not limited to the conformity hearing. Before reaching a final decision, the Administrator held a hearing for the sole purpose of permitting Arizona to argue its contentions that the HEW regulations were invalid. Arizona filed extensive briefs in support of those contentions. The Administrator\u2019s final decision expressly treated the question of the regulations\u2019 validity. Arizona was not denied the opportunity to argue all of its contentions during the administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\"><em>Third: </em>Arizona claims that the participation of welfare recipients as intervenors in a conformity hearing is unauthorized by the Act. This amounts to an assertion that 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.15(b) (1) <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> is beyond the Secretary\u2019s broad rule-making power under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302. It is not. See especially National Welfare Rights Organization v. Finch, 1970, 139 U.S.App.D.C. 46, 429 F.2d 725. Arizona\u2019s references to dicta in Rosado v. Wyman, 1970, 397 U.S. 397, 406, 426, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 25 L.Ed.2d 442, are inapposite, since that case antedated the Secretary\u2019s promulgation of 45 C.F.R. Part 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\"><em>Fourth: </em>Arizona seems to argue that because it admitted noncompliance with certain HEW regulations, no evidentiary hearing was necessary, and that holding one denied Arizona procedural fairness. Not only is the argument illogical; its premises are also at odds with Arizona\u2019s insistence that it should have been granted a continuance and with Arizona\u2019s claim that HEW bore \u201cthe burden of showing that [Arizona\u2019s] non-compliance based on residency * * is involved in a substantial number of cases.\u201d Arizona also asserts that wholly irrelevant testimony was continually admitted into evidence, thereby turning the hearing into \u201ca two-day diatribe covering the full spectrum of conceivable social ills. * * Since Arizona does not point to any specific evidence whose improper introduction was prejudicial, we decline to respond to the assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number><em>Fifth: </em>During the conformity hearing the examiner ruled that witnesses testifying adversely to Arizona could \u201cdecline to give the names of the individuals whom they are referring to in their testimony.\u201d The ruling was intended to protect welfare recipients referred to against any possible retaliation by the Arizona State Department of Public Welfare in the form of \u201cextra strict enforcement of legal requirements.\u201d Arizona now argues that the ruling hampered its ability to determine the veracity of the testifying witnesses. We have reviewed the testimony affected by this ruling, and we find no significant prejudice to Arizona. If believed, the testimony tended to show that the various features of the Arizona public-assistance plans here in issue operated so as to make it substantially more difficult for eligible Arizona residents to obtain public assistance. But, as Arizona has recognized, this case presents for decision only the questions whether the disputed provisions of Arizona\u2019s plans are, on their face, in conformity with federal requirements. The Administrator did not, and we do not, examine the actual administration of those plans. Thus the testimony of which Arizona complains is at best irrelevant, and not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\"><em>Sixth: </em>Arizona claims that the HEW regulations governing \u201cPractice and Procedure for Hearings to States on Conformity of Public Assistance Plans to Federal Requirements,\u201d 45 C.F.R. Part 213, were not adopted in accordance with the notice requirements of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553, and that they are therefore invalid. Section 553(b) renders the notice requirements inapplicable \u201cwhen the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued) that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.\u201d In promulgating the conformity-hearing regulations, the Secretary stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">\u201cNotice of proposed rule making has been dispensed with, * * * since notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable. Hearings with respect to the conformity of the plans of a number of States * * * have been scheduled on various days in August and September 1970 and it is urgent that the parties to such hearings know forthwith the rules of procedure and practice that are applicable to the conduct of such hearings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">35 Fed.Reg. 12180 (July 29, 1970). The stated reasons are \u201cgood cause\u201d for foregoing notice. <em>Cf. </em>Buckeye Cablevision, Inc. v. F. C. C., 1967, 128 U.S.App.D.C. 262, 387 F.2d 220, 228 n. 34. Indeed, the Secretary obviously acted with Arizona\u2019s legitimate interests in mind.

Welfare recipients are not ordinarily prone to tour for months. A regulation that attributes to welfare recipients the habits of gypsies is simply a further indication of the bizarre approach to the problems of the poor promulgated by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Poverty severely limits mobility. To suppose that a family living on public assistance could afford to be away from their place of residence for three months is unrealistic in light of their financial condition. An assistance family that has been absent from a state for three (3) months <em>must </em>therefore be concluded to have given up residence there.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Arizona makes no mention of possible motivations other than wanderlust for absences greater than 90 days. In particular, Arizona makes no mention of the plight of migrant farm workers or of Arizona residents caring for sick relatives in other states. We find no basis in the record to support a finding either that all absences over 90 days are motivated solely by wanderlust or that an absence of more than 90 days conclusively evidences an intention to give up Arizona residence. <em>Cf. </em>Shapiro v.

Arizona asserts that the calculational method it favors is the only method that makes \u201ccommon sense.\u201d We find this assertion specious. HEW\u2019s Interim Policy Statement No. 4 of July 17, 1968, specified that the state, \u201cin determining the amount of an individual\u2019s monthly earned income, will deduct all work expenses, personal and nonpersonal, from gross income\u201d <em>before </em>applying the income disregard. Notice of Interim Policies and Requirements, \u00a7 3(D) (4), 33 Fed.Reg. 10231 (1968). That is, the Interim Policy Statement adopted the method that Arizona now espouses. Interim Policy Statement No. 4 became, with certain modifications, 45 C.F.R. Part 233, which incorporates the HEW regulation here in question. The modifications of the provisions of the Interim Policy Statement were made after \u201c[vjiews of interested persons were requested, received, and considered, and in the light thereof. * * *\u201d 34 Fed.Reg. 1394 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"A6yL\">\u201cThe following are the major changes: (1) The method for disregard of earned income has been modified. In arriving at the amount of earned income to be applied against the assistance budget the amount to be disregarded is to be deducted from gross income rather than from net income. Next, the amount allowed for work expenses is to be deducted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\"><em>Id. </em>It is therefore clear that considerable care and reflection, on the part of persons thoroughly experienced in welfare administration, went into designing the method of income disregard, and that as a result the method espoused by Arizona was deliberately abandoned. On that ground alone we would be loath to find the method finally adopted by HEW to be utterly lacking in \u201ccommon sense.\u201d In any event, we think it entirely reasonable for the Secretary to interpret \u201cearned income\u201d in the Acts\u2019 disregard provisions, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (8) (A), as referring to gross earned income.

However, the evidence adduced concerning Arizona\u2019s programs would have been sufficient, as HEW\u2019s brief notes, to support a finding \u201cthat Arizona has failed to provide welfare recipients with an adequate opportunity to participate in the welfare system, and that the isolation of the Arizona state agency has made the system unresponsive to the needs of welfare recipients.\u201d Such a finding was unnecessary, since the only question was Arizona\u2019s literal compliance with the advisory-committee requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b531-13\">.

The HEW brief refers to the equitable-treatment doctrine as \u201ca long-standing construction of the Act by HEW and all predecessor agencies responsible for the administration of the public assistance programs under the Act. Under the \u2018equitable treatment\u2019 doctrine, a state plan for public assistance must contain only those eligibility conditions other than those specified in the Act which result in similar treatment of individuals in similar circumstances; further, the state may not impose exclusions, or differences in treatment, of such individuals if they bear no reasonable relationship to the purposes of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">The doctrine is not expressed in any of the Act\u2019s provisions, nor has it been promulgated by regulation. <em>See </em>Note, Welfare\u2019s \u201cCondition X\u201d, 76 Yale L.J. 1222 (1967).

Williams, <em>supra, </em>for the proposition that its legal-custody requirement is valid, quoting the following language: \u201cWo see nothing in the federal statute that forbids a State to balance the stresses that uniform insufficiency of payments would impose on all families against the greater ability of large families \u2014 because of the inherent economies of scale \u2014 to accommodate their needs to diminished per capita payments. The strong policy of the statute in favor of preserving family units does not prevent a State from sustaining as many families as it can, and providing the largest families somewhat less than their ascertained per capita standard of need.\u201d 397 U.S. at 479-480, 90 S.Ct. at 1159. The Maryland maximum-grant limitation upheld in <em>Dandridge </em>is, however, quite different from the Arizona legal-custody requirement. The Supreme Court found that \u201cthe practical effect of the Maryland regulation is that all children, even in very large families, do receive some aid. We find nothing in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 002(a) (10) (1964 ed., Supp. IV) that requires more than this. So long as some aid is provided to all eligible families and all eligible children, the statute itself is not violated.\u201d 397 U.S. at 481, 90 S.Ct. at 1159.
