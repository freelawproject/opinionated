Buffaloe, on two occasions, purchased pistols stating that he had never been adjudicated a mental defective or committed to a mental institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">The government\u2019s proof established that Buffaloe had been tried in the Circuit Court of Dinwiddie County, Virginia, for maiming, found not guilty by reason of insanity, and \u201ccommitted to Central State Hospital as a criminally insane person.\u201d Approximately 16 months later, he was discharged from the hospital as not then insane or feeble-minded.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">We agree with the district judge that Buffaloe was adjudicated and committed within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(d) (4), which prohibits the sale of firearms to a person who \u201chas been adjudicated a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\"> We also conclude that the statute is not unconstitutional as to Buffaloe because 16 months later he was discharged from the hospital. Finally, there is ample evidence to support the finding that Buffaloe willfully and knowingly made the false statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-15\">Deeming oral argument unnecessary, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
