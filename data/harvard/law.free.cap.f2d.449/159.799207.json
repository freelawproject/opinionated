The car which appellant was driving contained approximately 150 pounds of marihuana, secreted in a hidden compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-23\">Appellant was subsequently convicted on two counts of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a: (1) knowingly smuggling 150 pounds of marihuana into the United States with intent to defraud the United States; (2) knowingly receiving, concealing, and facilitating the transportation and concealment of the same with intent to defraud the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-25\">On appeal, appellant disputes his knowledge of the presence of the marihuana and contests the sufficiency of the evidence in this respect to support conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-26\">This court has consistently held that the question of the occupant\u2019s knowledge is particularly within the jury\u2019s province, and that once this determination is made, the reviewing court should not disturb the finding where there is a substantial basis for the jury\u2019s inference. <em>See </em>United States v. Guzman, 446 F.2d 1137 (9th Cir. 1971). The act of driving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>a car laden with concealed contraband provides such a substantial basis. <em>Id; </em>Eason v. United States, 281 F.2d 818 (9th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
