The issues are whether substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole supports the Board\u2019s findings: (1) that the company interfered with, restrained and coerced its employees in their attempts to obtain union representation in violation of Section 8(a) (1) of the Act; (2) that the company violated Section 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act by discriminatorily discharging employees because of their support and advocacy of the union; and, (3) that the company violated Section 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act by its continued refusal to bargain collectively with the union although requested to do so, and that in the circumstances of this case a bargaining order was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-14\">Invoking the reverse of the \u201cSmall Plant Doctrine,\u201d as applied in many National Labor Relations Board cases (see, e. g., A. J. Krajewski Manufacturing Company v. N.L.R.B., 413 F.2d 673, 676 (1st Cir. 1969); N.L.R.B. v. Joseph Antell, Inc., 358 F.2d 880, 882 (1st Cir. 1966); N.L.R.B. v. Melrose Processing Company, 351 F.2d 693, 697 (8th Cir. 1965); N.L.R.B. v. Falls City Creamery Company, 207 F.2d 820, 829 (8th Cir. 1953); and Angwell Curtain Company v. N.L.R.B., 192 F.2d 899, 903 (7th Cir. 1951)), the company argues that since one of its four employees was informed that the management had no objection to any union activities, the other employees must have learned of this statement and known that the actions claimed to violate the Act were not prompted by union activities. The Board\u2019s position is that the statement to the employee was not a credible reflection of the management\u2019s actual altitude. We agree with the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-15\">Our examination of the record convinces us that the order of the Board is supported by substantial evidence and it will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
