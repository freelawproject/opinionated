K.R.S. \u00a7 435.110. The woman was white.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Newberry did not appeal from his conviction. Subsequently, he filed in the Hickman Circuit Court a motion under Kentucky Criminal Rule 11.42 to vacate sentence, which motion was overruled. On appeal to the Kentucky Court of Appeals the order of the Circuit Court was affirmed. Newberry then instituted the present proceeding in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In his petition for the writ Newberry asserted three grounds for relief, only one of which will be considered, namely, his contention that at his trial in the Circuit Court he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The record shows that when the case was called, Attorney D. L. McNeill came \u201cand stated the defendant had talked to him in the case and was to pay him this morning but that he was not hired or employed.\u201d The Court then appointed McNeill to represent the defendant. McNeill then moved the Court to pass the case to a later day in the term in order to afford him an opportunity to prepare the case for trial. The Commonwealth Attorney objected to the continuance and the Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">We have held that proceeding with the trial of a criminal case immediately after the appointment of counsel for an indigent defendant, and without giving counsel opportunity to prepare for trial, \u201cis so fundamentally unfair that a conviction resulting therefrom cannot be permitted to stand.\u201d United States v. Knight, 443 F.2d 174 (6th Cir. 1971); Townsend v. Bomar, 351 F.2d 499 (6th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">The judgment of the District Court is therefore reversed and the cause is remanded with instructions to grant the writ of habeas corpus unless the Hickman Circuit Court vacates the judgment of conviction and retries the case within a reasonable time.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
