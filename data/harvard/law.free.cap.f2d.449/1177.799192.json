ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">Appellant was convicted by a jury on both counts of an indictment respectively charging assault with a dangerous weapon and robbery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His sentence was a commitment pursuant to provisions of the Federal Youth Corrections Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His sole contention on this appeal is that the conviction was vitiated by a series of trial events, including prominently a version of the <em>Allen </em>charge,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which in his view improperly induced the verdict the jury returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">Upon careful consideration of the record, we conclude that the conviction should be reversed, and that future rendition of <em>Allen-type </em>charges must conform to the standard which has been approved by the American Bar Association and adopted by the Third and Seventh Circuits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our reasons for these conclusions follow a summary of the relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-10\">James C. Drayton, Jr., was the victim of an armed assault and an accompanying robbery - at his apartment in the early hours of a February morning. Shortly after midnight, awakened by the sound of broken glass and footsteps, he went into his kitchen in time to see two men hastily exiting through the back door.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A police investigation of the incident apparently was unfruitful, and Drayton returned to bed about 5:00 a. m. He was again aroused about 6:30 a. m. by a knock on his front door, and in response to his inquiry as to who was there, a male voice answered \u201cAnnette\u2019s brother.\u201d Drayton opened the door because, in his words, \u201cI figured after he said Annette\u2019s brother, I knew Annette.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-20\">Two men entered the apartment, then still unlighted, and one, later identified as appellant, promptly knocked Drayton down with a blow to the head. As Drayton lay face down to the floor with the same man standing over him with a pistol, and later with Drayton\u2019s own shotgun,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the other man<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> gathered money and articles of value in the apartment. While the ransacking was in progress, Drayton attempted to arise, and was again struck in the head, this time with the shotgun. A struggle for the shotgun ensued, and Drayton commenced shouting, whereupon the two men left the apartment with part of their collected loot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-21\">The police were again summoned to Drayton\u2019s apartment. Drayton was taken to a hospital, where cuts about his head were stitched, and on his return he gave the police the relevant details. Accompanied by Drayton, the police went to the apartment of Annette Thomas, whom he knew, but no one was there. Somewhat later the same day, after some sleuthing on his own, Drayton learned that Miss Thomas had a brother, our appellant, whose address Drayton also procured. There appellant was ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>rested, and was identified by Drayton as one of his assailants.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">Such was the case portrayed by the Government\u2019s evidence at trial and, save for appellant\u2019s identity as a participant in the offenses, it was uncontested. Appellant denied his complicity in the affair, asserting that he was at home in bed when the offenses were committed, and in this claim he was partially corroborated by the testimony, of his mother and a cousin. A motion for a judgment of acquittal, made initially on completion of the Government\u2019s case in chief and renewed when all the evidence was in, was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">The trial judge included among his instructions to the jury, before its retirement for deliberations, some of the ingredients of the <em>Allen </em>charge. In that aspect the judge counseled the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">In a large portion of the cases absolute certainty cannot be expected, although the verdict must be the verdict of each individual juror and not a mere acquiescence in the conclusion of your fellow jurors, yet you should examine the question submitted with candor and proper regard and deference for the opinion of each other. It is your duty to decide the case if you can conscientiously do so. You should listen to each other\u2019s arguments with a disposition to be convinced. If much the larger number of jurors are for conviction, a dissenting juror should consider whether his doubt is a reasonable one which makes no impression upon the minds of so many jurors equally honest, equally intelligent with himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-12\">If on the other hand the majority are for acquittal, the minority ought to ask themselves whether they might not reasonably doubt the correctness of a judgment which is not concurred in by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-13\">After the jury had deliberated about an hour, it sent to the judge a note advising that \u201c[w]e, the jury, cannot come to an agreement.\u201d Thereupon, in the jury\u2019s absence, the judge, expressing the view that \u201c [t]his is not a case we should have to retry,\u201d informed counsel of his intention to excuse the jurors for the day <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but to reconvene them on the following day for further deliberations; and this course the judge pursued, over vigorous objection by defense counsel. The jury was returned to the courtroom,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> whereupon the judge announced that he was \u201cnot going to declare a mistrial, and thereby require a retrial of this case before some other jury.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rather, he explained, he was excusing the jurors at that time to \u201ccome back tomorrow morning at 9:30 with a fresh mind and a night\u2019s sleep and seek to reach a verdict about the matter one way or the other.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He added that he was \u201csure you ladies and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>gentlemen know we have a substantial backlog of work, and to spend another day before another jury retrying this case just doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> He again admonished the jurors to \u201c[s]ee if you can\u2019t decide and come to a verdict, think about it overnight individually.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\">The jury reconvened at the appointed time. After about two hours of deliberations, interfused with an in-courtroom rereading of Drayton\u2019s testimony at its request, it returned a verdict finding appellant guilty on both counts of the indictment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\"> Every defendant in a federal criminal case has the right to have his guilt found, if found at all, only by the unanimous verdict of a jury of his peers.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Any undue intrusion by the trial judge into this exclusive province of the jury is error of the first magnitude. When efforts to secure a verdict from the jury reach the point that a single juror may be coerced into surrendering views conscientiously entertained, the jury\u2019s province is invaded and the requirement of unanimity is diluted.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is against these considerations that</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-18\">we must evaluate any judicial effort to avoid or break a deadlocked jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-19\">The trial judge is, of course, under a duty to lend guidance to the jury through instructions as to the governing principles of law, including those which define for the jurors their obligations as jurors. It was quite, obviously, in an attempt to enlighten the jury in the latter regard that the judge embraced some of the <em>Allen </em>admonitions within his charge. But the line separating proper guidance from improper coercion is fine, and its precise location, is not always clear. In the case before us, however, the judge urged a verdict, not only through <em>Allen </em>admonitions, but by other expressions to the jury as well. The issue appellant presents is whether in toto the urging \u2014 the individual elements of which we examine separately \u2014 was so great as possibly to exert a coercive influence upon the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-20\">Just four years ago, in Fulwood v. United States,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> this court upheld an application of the <em>Allen </em>charge against claims that it was coercive, not only per se but also in the form and under the special circumstances given.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, the court indicated the desirability of avoiding variant formulations and urged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>that the trial judges \u201cconsistently use a form of instruction plainly within <em>Allen\u201d.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Besides, we have also acknowledged that the charge, even when unem-bellished by further exhortations, is \u201cpotentially coercive;\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> that \u201cits content and manner of use deserve scrutiny.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We are mindful, too, of \u201cthe widening challenge\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> to the charge, even in its pristine text, by an increasing \u2014 and increasingly concerned \u2014 corps of critics.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">Moreover, we have had occasion to warn that the <em>Allen </em>charge \u201capproaches the limits to which the court should go in suggesting to jurors the desirability of agreement and avoidance of the necessity of a retrial before another jury.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We are aware of holdings that in particular formulations or under particular circumstances the charge may indeed be coercive;<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> in Williams v. United States,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> we ourselves reversed a conviction following an <em>Allen </em>charge importing new ingredients and given after the judge\u2019s inquiry as to whether there was \u201ca clear minority\u201d of jurors.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Where, as here, comments to the jury are both Allen-plus<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and Fulwood-plus,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> the situation demands close examination to determine whether under all circumstances it is likely to have been coercive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-21\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-22\">Improper duress upon a deadlocked jury does not seek its only source in threats of physical abuse.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Communications from judge to jury are unduly constraining whenever they possess a substantial propensity for prying individual jurors loose from beliefs they honestly have.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The jury is coerced, the Supreme Court has held, when it is told that \u201c[y]ou have got to reach a decision in this case,\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and in much the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>same category is the admonition in this case that \u201cyou ought to be able to agree on a verdict.\u201d <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Statements of this sort reflect the judge\u2019s assessment that the factual issues bear relatively easy resolution, and pressure jurors, who in their own endeavors have not found it so, to come to some result at all costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">So also, in somewhat similar fashion, do expressions emphasizing the desirability of achieving a verdict as a means of avoiding the necessity of a retrial.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Equally pressuring are statements susceptible to an interpretation reflecting unwholesomely upon minority jurors simply because they happen to be in the minority.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> \u201cNo juror should be induced to agree to a verdict by a fear that a failure so to agree will be regarded by the public as reflecting upon either his intelligence, or his integrity.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">The record before us portrays the sequence of events which in combination generated, in some measure, each of these undesirable elements. When the jury first announced its inability to agree, the judge had already given a \u201cpotentially coercive\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> <em>Allen </em>instruction, and his further efforts to solicit a verdict entered the realm of <em>Allen- </em>and Fwiwood-plus. The judge\u2019s initial response to the jury\u2019s announcement of a deadlock was a declaration that he was \u201cnot going to declare a mistrial, and thereby require a retrial of this case before some other jury.\u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> He referred, too, to the court\u2019s \u201csubstantial backlog of work,\u201d and voiced the feeling that \u201cto spend another day before another jury retrying this case just doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d <footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-14\">It seems not unlikely that jurors faithful to their oaths might have been troubled in attempting to reach a verdict on the proof introduced at the trial. The crucial issue was the identity of one of Drayton\u2019s attackers, ostensibly the one who said he was \u201cAnnette\u2019s brother\u201d immediately prior to the attack. The Government\u2019s case against appellant rested on Drayton\u2019s identification, but appellant presented a corroborated alibi for the time of the crimes. The jury had to ponder the credibility of the witnesses as well as judge the reliability of the victim\u2019s identification in the face of the suggestive and perhaps improbable self-identification attributed to appellant.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Equivocal evidence can raise problems for conscientious jurors, and increase their susceptibility to judicial prodding for a verdict they seem otherwise unable to reach.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-15\">Particularly in these days of burgeoning litigation, we share the trial judge\u2019s sensitivity to the need for adjustment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>judicial processes to the point of highest efficiency. But while there is need to expedite the work of the courts, this cannot be at the expense of the call of conscience. Indeed, it may well be that a hung jury might lead the prosecutor to reconsider whether the case, particularly a close or weak case, should be presented again to a jury \u2014 so that a mistrial need not necessarily \u201crequire\u201d a retrial, as the trial judge told the jurors.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> We have no doubt whatever that the judge acted out of the best of motives, and that any coercion of the jury was entirely unintended. The events transpiring, however, invoke our responsibility to appraise the activities complained of, not by the good intentions behind them, but in terms of their probable impact upon the jury. All circumstances considered, we think those activities strayed beyond legitimate bounds, with a substantial probability of prejudice to the accused, and with the result that the judgment of appellant\u2019s conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-14\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-15\">Our conclusion that the conviction must be reversed for actual, though undesigned, coercion of the jury is an appraisal we could make only after a very considerable expenditure of judicial time and energy. And even as we view in retrospect the demands of this case, we realize, from the number of <em>AUencharge </em>complaints reaching this court, that they are not unique, but frequently recur. So it is that the drain on appellate resources made by Allen-charge controversies leads us to focus upon means whereby the seemingly inevitable aberrations of the charge can be reduced or eradicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-16\">In our recent <em>Johnson </em>opinion,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> we examined and expressed our approval of the American Bar Association\u2019s standard for treatment of the problem of deadlocked juries<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and a form of instruction it deemed harmonious therewith.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> We need not repeat the compre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>hensive discussion in that opinion; it suffices to remind that we isolated, as \u201c[a] prime consideration motivating the promulgation of the ABA Standard * * * the large amount of litigation which the use of the original <em>Allen </em>charge has engendered.\u201d <footnotemark>47</footnotemark> We pointed out that \u201c[o]ne of the sources of trouble on appeal has been that the language actually used tends to vary from judge to judge, and this lack of uniformity in a delicate context is full of pitfalls.\u201d <footnotemark>48</footnotemark> We took a hard look at \u201cthe majority-minority element of the Allen charge\u201d <footnotemark>49</footnotemark>\u2014 advising that minority jurors owe deference to the majority \u2014 which two sentences of the charge before us featured. We noted that abandonment of this element \u201cmay well be in the interest of the efficient administration of justice\u201d because that \u201cwould avoid recurring controversies, turning upon subtle questions of coercion in the context of each case.\u201d <footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AeB9\">Further use of the <em>Allen </em>charge in usual form has been banned in two federal circuits by exertions of supervisory authority.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> In United States v. Fioravanti,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> the Third Circuit, characterizing use of the charge as \u201can invitation for perennial appellate review,\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> outlawed prospectively the \u201cmajority-minority\u201d instruction partly because of \u201cthe profound difficulty in confining its use within just and equitable bounds,\u201d <footnotemark>54</footnotemark> and recommended a model similar to the ABA-endorsed instruction for use by judges disposed to charge jurors on consultation <em>inter </em>sese.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> In United States v. Brown,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> the ^ Seventh Circuit, influenced by the administrative difficulties associated with Allen-type charges,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> decided that \u201cit would serve the interests of justice to require under our supervisory power that, in the future, district courts within this Circuit when faced with deadlocked juries comply with the\u201d ABA standard.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Two state courts, for substantially similar reasons, have proscribed the <em>Allen </em>charge on supervisory grounds.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-21\">A decade ago, the Supreme Court of Arizona declared \u201cthat the evils [of the <em>Allen </em>charge] far outweigh the benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Our opinion in <em>Johnson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>made it clear that we felt exactly the same way.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> There, we advanced the ABA standard and its implementing instruction as recommendations to trial judges.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Upon further reflection, and in light of the additional circumstances presented by the case at bar, we think it is in furtherance of the interest of justice to take a step which the court was not ready to take in the circumstances of <em>Johnson, </em>and to exercise our supervisory power, with a generally prospective ruling, to require trial judges to comply with the ABA standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">We have already noted that in <em>Ful-wood, </em>Judge (now Chief Justice) Burger urged the trial bench to \u201cconsistently use a form of instruction plainly within <em>Allen.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>63</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Yet, in the course of time, the expressions actually used by trial judges, in this case and others, have added an extra measure of influence in the instructions given to juries. We believe that appellate courts should no longer be burdened with the necessities and niceties \u2014 and the concomitant uncertainties \u2014 of gauging various <em>Allen-type </em>renditions in terms of the coerciveness of their impact. We are persuaded, too, by the volume and complexity of litigation generated by the <em>Allen </em>charge, that its continued unrestricted use is incompatible with sound judicial administration. We have before us today what was not available when <em>Fulwood </em>issued \u2014the standard that was painstakingly reviewed and approved by the designated committee of the American Bar Association\u2019s Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, that was adopted by its House of Delegates, and that was mandated by opinions of the Third and Seventh Circuits. We think the time has come to follow the path they have traveled and lay down the same mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-11\">The case at bar, unlike <em>Johnson, </em>presents the occasion we deem appropriate for doing so. With the court now convened <em>en b&amp;nc, </em>supervisory jurisdiction is clear,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> and the situation before us underscores the impositions which <em>Allen </em>charges in usual script can make for. The contention on this appeal was not, as in <em>Johnson, </em>confined to the content of the trial judge\u2019s <em>Allen </em>instructions, but extended beyond to a close and difficult issue of coercion in fact under the surrounding circumstances. That issue we have resolved, but the process has exacted a heavy toll in terms of judicial time and effort, and even so its contribution to the ultimate disposition of this litigation is uncertain. There remains in the case a serious problem as to whether any new in-court identification of appellant by Drayton could survive a one-man showup at which appellant, without counsel and 24 hours after the offenses were committed, was first identified as a participant.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> While we do not undertake decision of that question,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> the is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>sue will be open in the event of another trial following our remand. Furthermore, the record reveals that appellant was conditionally released from the commitment imposed by his sentence before the briefs on this appeal could be filed.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">While we do not intimate a view as to what more can or should be done in this case, we are permitted the realism of doubting whether further proceedings would actually eventuate, especially if a new trial is required. We conclude that the interest of justice will in the future be better served, not by periodically laboring the refinements of Aiiew-charge language or eoerciveness concepts, but by adherence to the broader and sounder doctrine, which was recommended but left permissive in <em>Johnson </em>for the time being, as a requirement governing instructions given by trial judges to juries subsequent to the date of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">Accordingly, in the exercise of our supervisory power over the administration of the law in this circuit,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> we adopt the ABA standard<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> for the guidelines which future renditions of Alien-type charges must abide, and the ABA approved instruction<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> as the vehicle for informing jurors of their responsibilities in situations wherein judges decide to do so.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> This new rule, \u201c[a]s a prophylactic device to eliminate future vexation,\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> will benefit only those whose jury trials are conducted hereafter,<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> including, of course, any retrial to which appellant may be subjected.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-15\">We do not regard this holding as a reconsideration or overruling of our decision in <em>Fulwood.</em><footnotemark><em>75</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We have not held that the <em>Allen </em>charge is per se coercive; rather, we have predicated our decision on the needs of judicial administration, a ground which, as <em>Johnson </em>points out, <em>Fulwood </em>did not consider, but which commended itself to the American Bar Association.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> What we say, in sum, is that the time has come \u201cto focus [the Allen] charge on its major function of counseling the jury to consult openmindedly with a disposition to hearken to fellow-jurors, and to agree when no violation of conscience is involved.\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> That objective, we are convinced, can become a reality only through the supervisory exercise in which we engage today.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>At oral argument the Government, anticipating that we might modify our rule, proposed that we not adopt the ABA-approved instruction but instead accept a variant wording.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Our initial reaction is that the wording proposed is not a major improvement. Perhaps further study would confirm that initial view. But we are not disposed to open the door to variants in language, having in mind that it was through just such a process that the courts were led into the increasing difficulties we outlined earlier in this opinion. We do not consider the ABA\u2019s standard or its model instruction as graven in stone. The Judicial Conference for this circuit has approved the concept of a committee to implement the ABA\u2019s criminal justice standards,<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> and it may be that in due course some modification will emerge as appropriate, either by virtue of general reconsideration or the need for adaptation to local conditions. But we think if there is to be any change in wording, it should be one that is carefully considered on a broad basis by a broadly representative body, like the ABA committee, that can make a wide-ranging inquiry as to the necessity for and possible consequences of modification. Accordingly, we decline acceptance of the Government\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">The judgment of appellant\u2019s conviction is reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court for such further proceedings, if any, as may be consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1237-11\">.

I am not going to declare a mistrial, and thereby require a retrial of this case before some other jury. What I am going to do is to ask you, members of the jury, to break off your consideration of the case at this time. Don\u2019t discuss the case among yourselves, don\u2019t talk to anybody else about it, and don\u2019t let anybody talk to you about it, but come back tomorrow morning at 9:30 with a fresh mind and a night\u2019s sleep and seek to reach a verdict about the matter one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-15\">I am sure you ladies and gentlemen know we have a substantial backlog of work, and to spend another day before another jury retrying this case just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. See if you can\u2019t decide and come to a verdict, think about it overnight individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-16\">So, ladies and gentlemen, you are excused with that admonition until tomorrow morning at 9:30. Report to [the marshal]. Don\u2019t start your deliberations until all twelve of you are present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1238-17\">.

And since, as we noted in <em>Johnson, </em>139 U.S.App.D.C. at 200, 432 F.2d at 633, many trial judges have long since discarded this element, a uniform ban on its use would not make as much of a change as might be thought.

In Fulwood v.

The cases which have subsequently come before this court attest vividly the fact that this has not been done. And, of course, adherence even precisely to the charge as approved in <em>Allen </em>would not alone solve the problem, for there would continually remain questions as to whether in the particular circumstances involved the giving of an <em>Allen-type </em>charge was legally warranted. See ABA Jury Standards, <em>supra </em>note 45, at 155-156.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"79\">\n<p id=\"b1246-13\">. The proposal is also tantamount to a suggestion that we similarly modify the ABA standard. Comparison of tlie standard and the implementing instruction, notes 45-46, <em>supra, </em>demonstrates their complete congruence, and it is obviously impossible to meaningfully change the language of the instruction without effecting substantive change in the standard itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"80\">\n<p id=\"b1246-14\">.

Having reversed the conviction on this ground the majority then goes further and outlaws the <em>Allen </em>charge, in favor of an instruction recommended by the American Bar Association. I disagree with both conclusions of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-11\">It cannot be said that the giving of the <em>Allen </em>charge, standing alone, was error. That charge was approved by the Supreme Court of the United States in Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896). It was again approved by the Supreme Court in Lias v. United States, 284 U.S. 584, 52 S.Ct. 128, 76 L.Ed. 505 (1931), aff\u2019g 51 F.2d 215 (4th Cir.), and in Kawakita v. United States, 343 U.S. 717, 72 S.Ct. 950, 96 L.Ed. 1249 (1952), aff\u2019g 190 F. 2d 506 (9th Cir. 1951), a capital case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-12\">It was approved by this court in an opinion by Circuit Judge Burger in Fulwood v. United States, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 183, 369 F.2d 960 (1966), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 934, 87 S.Ct. 2058, 18 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>996 (1967), and again in an opinion by Circuit Judge Robinson in Post v. United States, 132 U.S.App.D.C. 189, 190 n. 3, 407 F.2d 319, 320 n. 3 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1092, 89 S.Ct. 863, 21 L.Ed.2d 784 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">In 1970 we three times declined to hold that use of the charge was error and in two of these cases the Supreme Court denied certiorari. United States v. Orsinger, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 403, 428 F.2d 1105, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 831, 91 S.Ct. 62, 27 L.Ed.2d 61 (1970); United States v. Johnson, 139 U.S.App.D.C. 193, 432 F.2d 626, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 949, 91 S.Ct. 257, 27 L.Ed.2d 255 (1970); United States v. Simpson, 144 U.S.App.D.C. 259, 445 F.2d 735, decided November 17, 1970. Moreover, it is agreed by counsel that in the past five years, in more than a score of cases from other circuits, the Supreme Court by denial of certiorari has rejected challenges to the <em>Allen </em>charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since the Supreme Court has not disavowed the charge it is not for us to do so. See Hodges v. United States, 408 F.2d 543, 552 (8th Cir. 1969) (opinion by Blackmun, Circuit Judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">As we observed in United States v. Simpson, No. 23,269, 144 U.S.App.D.C. 259, 445 F.2d 735, decided November 17, 1970, objections to the <em>Allen </em>charge are weakened when the charge is given as part of the court\u2019s original instructions, rather than later after a jury has reported disagreement, (at 736, 445 F. 2d 735). See also Burrup v. United States, 371 F.2d 556, 558 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1034, 87 S.Ct. 1485, 18 L.Ed.2d 596 (1967); United States v. Wynn, 415 F.2d 135, 137 (10th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 994, 90 S.Ct. 1133, 25 L.Ed.2d 402 (1970). That observation is pertinent here where the language of the <em>Allen </em>charge appeared in the middle of the court\u2019s long general instructions. Furthermore, it was prefaced by the statement that \u201csometime in reaching a conclusion, this charge is of assistance to a jury\u201d \u2014 hardly an intimation of coercion. (Tr. 120) Again, the court concluded its instructions with the statement that \u201call twelve of you must agree whichever way you find. In short, your verdict must be unanimous.\u201d (Tr. 131) I cannot agree that when given in this context, before there was any hint of disagreement or deadlock among the jurors \u2014 before there was any minority \u2014 the charge could have a coercive impact on any juror. This view seems to have been shared by counsel for the defendant who at the conclusion of the court\u2019s long charge announced \u201cSatisfied, Your Honor, nothing further.\u201d (Tr. 132)</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-14\">I turn now to the remarks of the court which are alleged to have exerted a coercive influence after the jury reported inability to agree. In substance the district judge told the jury that he was not going to declare a mistrial and thereby require another day of trial before another jury, a course that in view of the court's substantial backlog of work \u201cjust doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d The judge explained that he was excusing the jurors so that they might \u201ccome back tomorrow at 9:30 with a fresh mind and a night\u2019s sleep and seek to reach a verdict about the matter one way or the other. * * * See if you can\u2019t decide and come to a verdict, think about it overnight individually.\u201d (Tr. 135) On the following day, after deliberating for about an hour, the jury asked to have the testimony of the complaining witness read. The foreman explained \u201cit seems as though several of us have gotten different opinions, and we would like to have * * * the testimony.\u201d (Tr. 142) The testimony was then read. Before the jury again retired the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>stated: \u201cThe court reminds you that your verdict must be the verdict of each individual juror and not a mere acquiescence of the opinions of your fellow jurors. The court also reminds you if you can conscientiously decide this case, the court request[s] that you do so.\u201d (Tr. 144)</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">In my judgment the supplemental remarks of the district court were not coercive but were a legitimate attempt to encourage the jury to agree. Agreement on a verdict ought to be encouraged, for the very purpose and function of a jury is to decide issues of fact, not to engage in inconclusive debate. Certainly the jurors should not be encouraged or invited to disagree. United States v. Bowles, 428 F.2d 592 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 928, 91 S.Ct. 193, 27 L.Ed.2d 188 (1970). The remark of the court that it made no sense to retry the case on the same evidence before another jury was a statement of a simple truth which must have been as apparent to the jury as it was to the court. The mention of the court\u2019s backlog of work was no more coercive than references to the expense or difficulty of a retrial, remarks which in other cases have been held to be proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">The absence of coercion becomes even plainer when the nature of the disagreement among the jurors is considered. From their request for a reading of the testimony it is apparent that they disagreed not so much in their conclusions from the evidence as in their recollections of what the evidence had been. Once that difference was settled by reference to the transcript the disagreement was resolved. In short, the deadlock was broken by the stenographer, not by the court. I perceive no element of coercion in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">Many cases have sustained verdicts returned by a jury after remarks by a trial judge similar to those which the majority here finds coercive. I mention a few illustrative cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-8\">Kawakita v. United States, 190 F.2d 506 (9th Cir. 1951), aff\u2019d, 343 U.S. 717, 72 S.Ct. 950, 96 L.Ed. 1249 (1952). After the jury had been out for three days and had reported inability to arrive at a verdict the trial judge gave the <em>Allen </em>charge and added:</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-10\">This is an important case. The trial has been long and expensive. If you should fail to agree on a verdict, the case is left open and undecided. Like all cases, it must be disposed of sometime. There appears no reason to believe that another trial would not be equally long and expensive; nor does there appear any reason to believe that the case can be again tried any more exhaustively than it has been on the part of either side. 190 F.2d at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-11\">Fulwood v. United States, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 183, 369 F.2d 960 (1966), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 934, 87 S.Ct. 2058, 18 L.Ed.2d 996 (1967). The court in giving the <em>Allen </em>charge said:</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-12\">It is your duty to decide the case, if you can conscientiously do so, and you should listen to each other\u2019s arguments with a disposition to be so convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-13\"># * # * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-14\">I want you to go back to the jury room and deliberate, and endeavor to arrive at a verdict and consider the case in the light of these particular instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-15\">Bear in mind, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that some jury some time will have the duty to decide this case, and I hope that you, as the jury in this case, will be able to decide the matter. (Tr. 322-323)</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-16\">Affirming the judgment this court, in an opinion by Circuit Judge Burger, observed :</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-17\">The statement that some other jury would have to decide the case if this one could not was accurate as a generality and, in any event, could have had no coercive impact on the jury. If they already knew what would likely happen if they deadlocked, it was sur-plusage; if they did not know, this information, far from being coercive, would have had the effect of reducing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>the pressure on them to reach a verdict. 125 U.S.App.D.C. at 186, 369 F.2d at 963.</p>\n<p id=\"AcoK\">Hodges v. United States, 408 F.2d 543 (8th Cir. 1969). The court in its supplemental charge said: \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-10\">Gentlemen, I want to talk to you about it a little. You should consider that the case must sometime be decided, and that you are selected in the same manner as other juries. Failure to agree upon a verdict will necessitate another trial equally as long and as expensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-11\">The Court is of the opinion that the case cannot again be tried in a better or more exhaustive manner. It is therefore very desirable that you should return a verdict. The only manner provided by our Constitution and laws for deciding questions of fact is by a verdict of a jury. 408 F.2d at 553 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-12\">United States v. Wynn, 415 F.2d 135 (10th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 994, 90 S.Ct. 1133, 25 L.Ed.2d 402 (1970). The court\u2019s supplemental charge included these remarks:</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-13\">The court would like to advise you that if the jury is unable to reach a verdict in the ease it is necessary then for the judge to declare what is known as a mistrial. This means that the case will have to be tried all over again before another jury. As you can easily see, this involves considerable expense and considerable effort. And it is something that we try to avoid, hope that we can avoid in all cases for the purposes of economy. I don\u2019t think we will get any better jury if we tried the ease again than we have in the box now, nor do I feel that the case will be any better presented to you than it is now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-21\">So, it is \u2014 it is necessary that we do our utmost to avoid the declaration of a mistrial in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-22\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-23\">As you know, it has taken us considerable time to try this case. There has been a great many witnesses come from long distances to be here. We hope we won\u2019t have to do this again. So, the court will ask you gentlemen if you will please, retire again in the custody of the bailiffs and resume the deliberations again and it is hoped that you can reach a verdict in the ease. 415 F.2d at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-24\">See also United States v. Rao, 394 F.2d 354, 355 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 845, 89 S.Ct. 129, 21 L.Ed.2d 116 (1968).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-25\">In summary, I cannot agree that the jury was coerced by the <em>Allen </em>charge, or by the court\u2019s other remarks, or by the combination of the two. I would affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-26\">In my judgment also, the <em>Allen </em>charge should not be outlawed in favor of the instruction recommended by the American Bar Association. I must decline to exalt the recommendation of the Bar Association over the decisions of the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>preme Court of the United States. I suggest in this connection that we may be confronted with a problem in the future if some district judge, following the Supreme Court instead of the Bar Association, gives the <em>Allen </em>charge. Will we then overrule the Supreme Court by holding the charge is erroneous ?</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">We are told that one reason for adopting the Bar Association instruction is that district judges frequently deviate from the approved language of the <em>Allen </em>charge. Yet if in spite of our pleas for conformity district judges have strayed from the litany approved by the Supreme Court I think it reasonable to assume that they may also deviate from the formula prescribed by the Bar Association. If they hear not the Supreme Court and this court neither will they be persuaded by the Bar Association; and, contrary to the hopes of the majority, the \u201caberrations of the charge\u201d which disturb the majority will still occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">An assumption by critics of the <em>Allen </em>charge seems to be that it produces only verdicts of guilty. I am not aware of any statistics that support this theory. <em>See </em>United States v. Sawyers, 423 F.2d 1335 (4th Cir. 1970). Certainly scholars can find no support for it in the reported cases, for judgments of acquittal are not appealed and therefore do not appear in the books. We do not know how many defendants have been spared the ordeal and expense of a retrial because a jury was reminded of its duties by the sound counsel of the <em>Allen </em>charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">On its merits I prefer the <em>Allen </em>charge to the Bar Association language. I adhere to the views expressed in my dissent in United States v. Johnson, 139 U.S.App.D.C. 193, 203-204, 432 F.2d 626, 636-637, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 949, 91 S.Ct. 257, 27 L.Ed.2d 255 (1970) that the <em>Allen </em>charge is sensible advice for any group of men and women sitting around a table to decide a question of fact; and that the diluted version proposed by the Bar Association is an invitation to a stubborn or recalcitrant juror to persist in a blind adherence to his position, thereby producing a hung jury. As Judge Burger put it in Fulwood v. United States, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 183, 185, 369 F.2d 960, 962 (1966), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 934, 87 S.Ct. 2058, 18 L.Ed.2d 996 (1967):</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-8\">[T]he <em>Allen </em>charge is a carefully balanced method of reminding jurors of their elementary obligations, which they can lose sight of during protracted deliberations. It is perfectly valid to remind them that they should give some thought to the views of others and should reconsider their position in light of those views. The charge as given here did not <em>require </em>the jury to reach a verdict but only reminded them of their duty to attempt an accommodation. While it suggests to the minority that they reconsider their position in light of a majority having a different view, it reminds them that they should not acquiesce in a verdict which does not represent their own convictions. (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-9\">I see no reason to abandon or substantially revise the <em>Allen </em>charge. Accordingly, I dissent from the majority\u2019s direction that it not be used in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-10\">Circuit Judges TAMM, MacKINNON and WILKEY concur in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">. One of these cases was United States v. Pioravanti, 412 P.2d 407 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 837, 90 S.Ct. 97, 24 L.Ed.2d 88 (1969), cited by the majority. Although the Circuit Court of Appeals in that case directed that the Bar Association charge be used in the future, it held that the giving of the <em>Allen </em>charge, including the statement that \u201cIt is your duty * * * to agree, if possible\u201d, had not been prejudicial, and the conviction was affirmed. 412 F.2d at 414.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1249-14\">. Similar remarks to deadlocked juries in civil cases have been sustained. Wilson v. Southern Farm Bureau Cas. Co., 275 F.2d 819 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 817, 81 S.Ct. 49, 5 L.Ed.2d 48 (1960) ; Silverman v. Travelers Ins. Co., 277 F.2d 257 (5th Cir. 1960). In both cases the court (Wright, District Judge) told the jury :</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-20\">You must realize that you have heard all of the facts in this particular case. it is a case that must be decided. There is no reason to believe that twelve other jurors will he more successful in reaching a verdict in this matter than you will have been. You must give intelligent and cooperative attention to this consideration in order that there may be a resolution of this conflict which exists between the plaintiff and the defendant in this ease. 275 F.2d at 822 ; 277 F.2d at 264.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
