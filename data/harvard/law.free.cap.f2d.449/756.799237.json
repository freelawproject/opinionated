S.C. \u00a7 1291; thus our Court lacks jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">3) the order appealed from is not an interlocutory order from which an appeal may be taken as of right under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a); and further, a permissive appeal is not allowable under \u00a7 1292(b) because the procedures required by that section have not been followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">The appellants have substantially complied with Rule 7, F.R.A.P. Thus, the appellee\u2019s first contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">As to the second contention, it is clear that the order appealed from is not a final order from which an appeal will lie. Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945); Atlantic Fishermen\u2019s Union v. United States, 195 F.2d 1021 (1st Cir. 1952). See also, Gulf States Paper Corp. v. Johnson, 269 F.2d 835 (6th Cir. 1959); Connell v. Dulien Steel Products, 240 F. 2d 414 (5th Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">Appellants, advisedly, do not contend that the appeal falls within the class of orders from which an appeal is allowed as a matter of right under \u00a7 1292(a). They have not, however, met the requirements for the allowance of permissive appeals set forth in \u00a7 1292(b), in that the District Court did not certify that an immediate appeal was desirable, and in that the appellants did not apply to this Court for permission to appeal. See Hodgson v. United States Slicing Mach. Co., 370 F.2d 565 (3rd Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-15\">The appellants\u2019 sole argument in opposition to the Rule 8 motion to dismiss is that an appellate court always has a duty to determine whether the District Court has jurisdiction. They rely upon Baker v. Riss &amp; Co., 444 F.2d 257 (8th Cir. 1971), which is totally inapplicable to this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-16\">The appeal was docketed in this Court on August 26, 1971. Appellee\u2019s Rule 8 motion to dismiss should have been filed within 15 days thereafter. It was not filed until October 1, 1971. No explanation is offered for this delay. In the meantime, the appellants filed a printed appendix on September 23, 1971. In view of this situation, costs in this Court shall be taxed one-half to each party.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-17\">The Rule 8 motion to dismiss the appeal is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
