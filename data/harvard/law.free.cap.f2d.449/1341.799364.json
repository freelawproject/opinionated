Appellant was sentenced to one year imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-9\">The Government\u2019s proof at the trial showed that appellant\u2019s tax returns for the calendar years 1961-1965 substantially understated his taxable income. Silverman is an attorney, whose income consisted principally of fees for representing personal injury claimants, commissions received as an insurance broker, wages for acting as a claims referee for the New York Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, dividends from corporate stocks, interest on twenty-three savings accounts and capital gains from transactions in securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-11\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is that his conviction was invalid because one of the jurors on the panel which convicted him, a Mrs. Altman, could not read or write English. This fact was first discovered on the day the jury rendered its verdict, when the fore-lady sent a note to the trial judge that read: \u201cWe have a juror who cannot write English. What do we do re her decision?\u201d The judge suggested that Mrs. Altman be permitted to cast her vote orally. The jury thereupon returned the verdict convicting appellant. Six days later defendant moved to dismiss the indictment or for a new trial on the ground that Mrs. Altman was not qualified to serve as a juror. After a hearing at which it was established that Mrs. Altman had no difficulty in speaking and understanding English and that she could read numbers, the judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-15\">Section 1865 of Title 28 U.S.C. (1970) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-16\">(b) * * * [T]he chief judge of the district court * * * shall deem any person qualified to serve on grant [sic] and petit juries in the district court unless he\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-18\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-19\">(2) is unable to read, write, and understand the English language with a degree of proficiency sufficient to fill out satisfactorily the juror qualification form; * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-20\">As the hearing revealed, Mrs. Altman had her lawyer fill out the juror qualification form <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and had in fact answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question \u201cCan you read, write, speak and understand the English language?\u201d She had nevertheless been called to serve, and her inability to read and write English remained unknown to all connected with the trial until the day of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-21\">Section 1867 of Title 28 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-22\">(a) In criminal cases, before the voir dire examination begins, or within seven days after the defendant discovered or could have discovered, by the exercise of diligence, the grounds therefor, <em>whichever is earlier, </em>the defendant may move to dismiss the indictment or stay the proceedings against him on the ground of substantial failure to comply with the provisions of this title in selecting the grand or petit jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-23\">* * -\u00bb -X- -x- *</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-24\">(e) The procedures prescribed by this section shall be the exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>means by which a person accused of a Federal crime * * * may challenge any jury on the ground that such jury was not selected in conformity with the provisions of this title. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-4\">We may assume that there was a \u201csubstantial failure to comply with the\u201d statute in this case. However, the statute clearly requires that a challenge on this ground be made at or before the voir dire. (See H.R.Rep.No.1076, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 15 (1968) [1968 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at p. 1805]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-5\">Since defendant failed to raise any objection to Mrs. Altman\u2019s serving on the jury until after his conviction, his attack on that conviction cannot be founded on Mrs. Altman\u2019s disqualification under the statute. Defendant must establish that there is some basis other than the statutory requirement for invalidating the conviction on the ground of Mrs. Altman's inability to read and write English.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-6\">The inclusion in the panel of a disqualified juror does not require reversal of a conviction unless there is a showing of actual prejudice. See, <em>e. g., </em>United States v. Rosenstein, 34 F.2d 630 (2d Cir. 1929); Jackson v. United States, 408 F.2d 306, 309 (9th Cir. 1969) (\u201cwhere it is discovered, after a trial, that an answer given by a prospective juror was incorrect because of an oversight or failure to understand the question, and no reasonable possibility of prejudice is shown, the question of whether a new trial should be granted rests within the sound discretion of the district court\u201d). In Ford v. United States, 201 F.2d 300, 301 (5th Cir. 1953) the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1402-7\">\u201cWhere the objection to a juror relates, not to actual prejudice or other fundamental incompetence, but to a statutory disqualification only, such disqualification is ordinarily waived by failure to assert it until after verdict, even though the facts which constitute the disqualification were not previously known to the defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1402-8\">We would not hesitate to find prejudice requiring reversal where the claimed disqualification might have adversely affected the challenged juror\u2019s ability to decide a case intelligently. For example, if in the present case Mrs. Altman had been unable to understand English, clearly the verdict could not stand. Appellant urges that Mrs. Altman\u2019s inability to read falls within the area covered by the rule we have just stated, since many schedules, data summaries, cancelled checks, and tax returns were shown to the jury. These exhibits were pertinent only for the numbers that appeared on them, however, and Mrs. Altman testified at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion that she could read numbers. Moreover the Government\u2019s evidence that appellant\u2019s tax returns contained substantial understatements of income was virtually uncontested. The defense was largely based on absence of willfulness. It was claimed that he delegated the handling of his tax matters to his wife. None of the documentary evidence was relevant to this aspect of the case. Mrs. Altman could weigh and consider this evidence quite as well as any other juror. The record shows that she had no difficulty at all in understanding the oral testimony. We conclude that defendant was not prejudiced by reason of Mrs. Altman\u2019s inability to read and write English.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-9\">Appellant\u2019s failure to make prompt objection when the facts of Mrs. Altman\u2019s situation came to light detracts further from the force of his ease since it was still possible, even at that late date, for the judge to take measures to make certain that Mrs. Altman understood all the evidence, such as having read to her any exhibits claimed by defendant to be of critical importance. Also at this point the judge could perhaps have persuaded the parties to accept a verdict of eleven jurors. See United States v. Indiviglio, 352 F.2d 276 (2d Cir. 1965) <em>(en banc), </em>cert. denied, 383 U.S. 907, 86 S.Ct. 887, 15 L.Ed.2d 663 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-5\">Appellant objects to the admission against him of evidence resulting from the inspection by the agents of the Internal Revenue Service of closing statements filed with the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, First Department, and with the Judicial Conference of the State of New York. Attorneys in contingent fee eases are required by court rule to file these statements, McKinney\u2019s New York Court Rules \u00a7 603.4(b) (1970), and the penalty for failure to file is disbarment. Id. \u00a7 603.2; N.Y. Judiciary Law \u00a7 90(2) (McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 30, 1968). The required statements show, <em>inter alia, </em>the amount of compensation received by the attorney. In Silverman\u2019s case, his statements were used by the Government to aid in establishing his gross income. The IRS obtained access to the statements by order of the Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division, First Department, pursuant to McKinney\u2019s New York Court Rules \u00a7 603.4(c) (1) (1970), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1403-6\">\u201cAll statements of retainer or closing statements filed shall be deemed to be confidential and the information therein contained shall not be divulged or made available for inspection or examination except upon written order of the Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1403-7\">Appellant argues that the Government\u2019s use of these statements violated his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. Appellant moved before trial to suppress the statements and all evidence derived from them; this motion was denied by then District Judge Mansfield. United States v. Silverman, 311 F.Supp. 485 (S.D.N.Y.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-8\">Appellant lacks standing under the fourth amendment to object to the seizure of papers filed with and in the possession of the Appellate Division and the Judicial Conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-9\">\u201cThe established principle is that suppression of the product of a Fourth Amendment violation can be successfully urged only by those whose rights were violated by the search itself, not by those who are aggrieved solely by the introduction of damaging evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-10\">Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 171-172, 89 S.Ct. 961, 965, 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969). See also Donaldson v. United States, 400 U.S. 517, 522, 91 S.Ct. 534, 27 L.Ed.2d 580 (1971), citing First Nat\u2019l Bank of Mobile v. United States, 267 U.S. 576, 45 S.Ct. 231, 69 L.Ed. 796 (1925), aff\u2019g 295 F. 142, 143 (S.D.Ala.1924); Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 491-492, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963); United States v. Beigel, 370 F.2d 751, 756 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 930, 87 S.Ct. 2049, 18 L.Ed.2d 989 (1967); Foster v. United States, 265 F.2d 183 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 360 U.S. 912, 79 S.Ct. 1297, 3 L.Ed.2d 1261 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-11\">Appellant\u2019s fifth amendment argument is equally without merit. Records required to be kept pursuant to a reasonable regulatory scheme have \u201cpublic aspects\u201d and may be examined for evidence of criminal conduct. Shapiro v. United States, 335 U.S. 1, 34, 68 S.Ct. 1375, 92 L.Ed. 1787 (1948); Wilson v. United States, 221 U.S. 361, 380-382, 31 S.Ct. 538, 55 L.Ed. 771 (1911); Stillman v. United States, 177 F.2d 607, 617-618 (9th Cir. 1949); Shushan v. United States, 117 F.2d 110, 117 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 313 U.S. 574, 61 S.Ct. 1085, 85 L.Ed. 1531 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-12\">Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 (1968), and Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969) are completely inapposite. They involved statutes that were designed to require the confession of a crime. The documents involved here have no relevance to the revelation of criminal conduct. At the time they were filed they did not in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>criminate; they became harmful only after the filing of tax returns that failed to report certain income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-5\"> Appellant urges that reversal is required here because of a variance between the indictment and a bill of particulars supplied by the Government. Certain figures correctly labeled \u201ctaxable income\u201d in the indictment were incorrectly labeled \u201cgross income\u201d in the bill of particulars. The real issue is whether there was a fatal variance between the bill of particulars and the proof; since the indictment was correct and since appellant does not claim that the proof and the indictment vary, there is no question of an improper amendment of the indictment. The discrepancy between the bill of particulars and the proof is reversible only if appellant was prejudiced by surprise or was hindered in his preparation for trial. See, <em>e. g., </em>United States v. Glaze, 313 F.2d 757 (2d Cir. 1963). Since the indictment contained the correct figures, appellant had more than ample notice of what the Government intended to prove. Furthermore, the Government supplied defendant with detailed and correct schedules after having served the bill of particulars and months before the trial. In the circumstances the obvious error in the bill of particulars can hardly have hindered appellant in preparing his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-7\">Appellant\u2019s remaining contentions on this appeal are frivolous. His claim that summary schedules prepared by a government agent were given to the jury without a proper instruction as to their use is belied by the record. We long ago upheld the use of such summaries to aid the jury, even if they were not competent evidence in themselves. United States v. Kelley, 105 F.2d 912, 918 (2d Cir. 1939). In the case at bar, the trial judge twice gave clear instructions to this effect when the summaries were offered, and again when the jury asked for them during its deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-9\">Appellant claims that the first count of the indictment was barred by the statute of limitations, although since he received concurrent sentences, the success of this contention would have little practical effect. Appellant\u2019s tax return for 1961 was filed on or about March 19, 1962, and the indictment was filed April 10, 1968, slightly more than six years later. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6531(2) (1970) sets a six-year statute of limitations for tax evasion prosecutions, and \u00a7 6531 provides: \u201cFor the purpose of determining the periods of limitation on criminal prosecutions, the rules of section 6513 shall be applicable.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6513(a) (1970) provides that \u201cany return filed <em>before </em>the last day prescribed for the filing thereof shall be considered as filed on such last day\u201d (emphasis added). Thus Silverman\u2019s 1961 tax return was deemed filed on April 15, 1962 (see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6072(a) (1970)) and an indictment filed on April 10, 1968 was timely. United States v. Habig, 390 U.S. 222, 88 S.Ct. 926, 19 L.Ed.2d 1055 (1968), cited by appellant, holds only that where a taxpayer files a return <em>after </em>the due date, the limitations period begins when the return is actually filed. The rule is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-12\">Appellant contends that the trial court committed such \u201cplain error\u201d in charging the jury on the elements of the crime that we should reverse despite appellant\u2019s failure to object at the time (see F.R.Crim.Proc. 52(b)). Our consideration of the charge reveals no such error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-13\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that the Government failed to make out a prima facie case. The record presents ample proof of appellant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1401-13\">. Section 1864 of Title 28 provides that if the person whose name has been drawn to serve as a juror \u201cis unable to fill out the form, another shall do it for him, and shall indicate that he has done so and the reason therefor.\u201d However the form itself does not contain this information.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
