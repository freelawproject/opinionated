The key witness at the trial was Leroy Howard, the defendant\u2019s brother. Over objection, Leroy was allowed to testify that he had told the FBI that the defendant had told him (Leroy) that the defendant knew the vehicle in question to have been stolen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This testimonial evidence was apparently offered to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt,' not to impeach Leroy for any in-court modification of his statement to the FBI. As such, the evidence was hearsay, pure and simple, the value of which \u201crests on the credit of the declar-ant, who was not under oath nor subject to cross-examination when the statement was made\u201d. McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 39. Admission of this testimony was clear error, and leaves us no choice but to overturn Lugene Howard\u2019s conviction. United States v. Johnson, 5 Cir. 1970, 427 F.2d 957; United States v. Hicks, 5 Cir. 1970, 420 F.2d 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-22\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-11\">.
