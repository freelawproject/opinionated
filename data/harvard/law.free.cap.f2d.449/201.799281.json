Noncompliance is denominated as a misdemeanor, punishable by license revocation and a $200.00 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Plaintiffs allege that the ordinance infringes on First Amendment freedoms and is vague and overbroad. They seek a declaration that the ordinance is unconstitutional, along with temporary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the city from enforcing it. The district court denied relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">There is no allegation in the complaint that any plaintiff has been prosecuted, charged or arrested under this ordinance. Plaintiffs allege only that they are \u201cin fear of reprisals\u201d and that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. This falls far short of the showing of irreparable injury required for relief in federal courts, as set forth in Boyle v. Landry, 401 U.S. 77, 91 S.Ct. 758, 27 L.Ed.2d 696 (1971) and Younger v.
