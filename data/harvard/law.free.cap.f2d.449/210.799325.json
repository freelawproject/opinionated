The Army\u2019s Class 1-0 Conscientious Review Board disapproved appellant\u2019s application on the sole ground \u201cthat Kurtz is not opposed to participation in all wars, but is opposed to participation in a particular war.\u201d The District Court denied the writ of habeas corpus on the ground that appellant\u2019s \u201capplication, taken as a whole, could fairly be said to express opposition only to particular wars, and that there existed a basis in fact for the Review Board\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s application.\u201d After carefully reviewing the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Appellant is a physician currently serving in the Army. He joined the service during his internship at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1968 pursuant to the \u201cBerry Plan,\u201d a delayed-entry program, under which he received a commission in the Army Reserve and agreed to serve two years of active duty following his residency.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">After two years of residency, appellant received orders to report for active duty on July 23, 1970. Approximately one week prior to reporting, he submitted an application for discharge under the provisions of Army Regulation 635-20 and Department of Defense Directive 1300.6, which set out the policy and procedure for considering applications of military personnel whose objections develop subsequent to their entry into the military service. See 50 U.S.C.A. App. \u00a7 456(j) (1968); United States ex rel. Brooks v. Clifford, 4 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 700, 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">After reporting for duty as ordered, appellant was interviewed by an Army chaplain and another interviewing officer, both of whom believed that appellant was sincere and recommended that he be discharged. Appellant attached to his application letters from a former school teacher and a long-time friend that attested to his sincerity but said little about the precise nature of his beliefs. He also included a letter from his wife that stated that because of his beliefs, he could not \u201cparticipate in the making of war in any capacity.\u201d Finally, he attached a letter from the national chairman of the Jewish Peace Fellowship, an organization for Jewish conscientious objectors, stating that appellant\u2019s application was completely harmonious with the teachings and traditions of Judaism. Appellant\u2019s Commanding Officer and Commanding General, however, without personally interviewing him, recommended disapproval of his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">An applicant for classification as a conscientious objector must satisfy three basic tests. He must show that he is conscientiously opposed to war in any form, Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 91 S.Ct. 828, 28 L.Ed.2d 168, 1971; that his opposition is based upon religious training and belief, as that term has been construed, Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308, 1970; United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733, 1965; and that his objection is sincere. Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 75 S.Ct. 392, 99 L.Ed. 428, 1955. The Government has conceded that appellant satisfied the latter two tests. Thus the only issue before this Court is whether Kurtz showed that he is conscientiously opposed to war in any form.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">After reading Dr. Kurtz\u2019 conscientious objector application, we are convinced that he is deeply committed to the beliefs that he holds. Nevertheless, we believe that the Congressional definition of the conscientious objector exemption, 50 U.S.C.A. App. \u00a7 456(j) (1968), and the limitations on our reviewing power, Hel-wick v. Laird, 5 Cir. 1971, 438 F.2d 959, require us to affirm the lower court. In <em>Helwick, </em>this Court said</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Federal courts have a narrow range within which to review the conscientious objector claims of active military personnel. * * * [0]ur scope of review is limited to ascertaining whether there is any basis in fact for the Army\u2019s finding that an individual has not presented a valid conscientious objector claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">* * * * * \u2022\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">* * * [T]he Board is not at liberty merely to disbelieve the claimant. There must be some facts in his application \u2014 hard, provable, reliable facts \u2014 that provide a basis for disbelieving the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\"><em>Helwick </em>at 962-963.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>There was, unquestionably a \u201cbasis in fact,\u201d \u201chard, provable, and reliable,\u201d for the Army Review Board\u2019s determination that Dr. Kurtz is not opposed \u201cto war in any form.\u201d The facts on which we rely to uphold the Army Review Board\u2019s decision come from Dr. Kurtz\u2019 conscientious objector application, and are the same facts upon which the Army Review Board relied. We quote from the application:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">[T]o be against the war in Vietnam is really to be against all wars, because the characteristics of this war are a prototype and a model of present and future wars in the world as it exists today. War for the rest of the century appears to be of the guerrilla type with overtones of conventional war supported by the great powers and the threat of thermonuclear destruction always in the background. One cannot oppose the massive violence committed against the Vietnamese and yet feel it possible to participate in any other conceivable war.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">* * * [T]his war is, in capsule, all wars conceivable to me * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">* * * Modern warfare implies unlimited destruction and murder in which I cannot participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">We do not believe that Dr. Kurtz\u2019 beliefs, as he himself defined them, can be said to fit within the definition of \u201copposition to war in any form.\u201d His position is that he is opposed to \u201cwar as we know it today.\u201d We do not believe that opposition to \u201cwar as we know it today\u201d is what Congress meant when it enacted the \u201cwar in any form\u201d standard. Moreover, we agree with the judge below that an examination of Dr. Kurtz\u2019 C-0 application reveals \u201cthat in nearly every case [Dr. Kurtz] conditioned his statements [opposing participation in war] by references either to the Vietnam war directly, or to his own views on the characteristics of that war,\u201d and conclude that one could infer from Dr. Kurtz\u2019 application that he would not object to participation in a war waged with less sophisticated weapons, a war that did not result in the large-scale killing of innocent civilians or a war waged as a matter of national survival rather than as an \u201cinstrument of policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-15\">. Paragraph 3b of Army Regulation 635-20 provides that requests for discharge growing out of experience prior to entering military service, but which did not become fixed until entry into the service, will not be favorably considered when \u201cbased on objection to a particular war.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b270-10\">O\u2019SULLIVAN, Senior Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"av-dedup-0\">(specially concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">I concur in affirmance of the District Court. However, with great respect for my brothers\u2019 views, I feel constrained to separately expose some impressions gained from my study of the record. My brothers\u2019 opinion sets out two essentials to appellant\u2019s right to be discharged. First, that his opposition was based upon \u201creligious training and belief\u201d and, second, \u201cthat his objection is sincere.\u201d The opinion then states that \u201cThe Government has conceded that appellant satisfied the latter two [as above] tests.\u201d I do not read the record as containing a concession by the government that appellant\u2019s \u201cobjection is sincere.\u201d The District Court\u2019s opinion did state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-12\"><em>\u201cMost </em>of the evidence in the record <em>tends </em>to show that petitioner is sincere in his beliefs, and the Court does not understand the Government to be contending otherwise.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">This is true. <em>Most </em>of the evidence did <em>tend </em>to show that appellant was sincere. I do not, however, read the quoted language as a finding by the District Judge that the appellant was sincere or that the government had conceded his sincerity. Appellant\u2019s evidence consisted of the many letters and other representations which he produced to support his claim. The Army Chaplain and the original interviewing officer indicated <em>their </em>belief in appellant\u2019s sincerity. Those documents did indeed constitute <em>most </em>of the evidence presented, and did <em>tend </em>to support his claim of sincerity. The government is not \u201ccontending otherwise.\u201d However, as set out hereinafter, the officials' of the U.S. Army whose function it was to finally pass upon the validity of appellant\u2019s claim of conscientious objector status, did not be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>lieve in his sincerity, and such disbelief had factual foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">In my opinion, those charged with final responsibility refused Captain Robert S. Kurtz\u2019 application for discharge primarily because they just didn\u2019t believe his belated conversion from an opponent to the war in Vietnam to opposition to all wars. In my view, such disbelief and the Army\u2019s opinion that appellant was not opposed to \u201cwar in any form\u201d were justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Appellant, a medical graduate, has at all times been a vigorous and conspicuous opponent of the war in Vietnam, but true conscientious objector status cannot be claimed unless applicant is \u201cconscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form.\u201d Section 6(j) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j). The validity of this statute was sustained in Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 91 S.Ct. 828, 28 L.Ed.2d 168 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In Helwick v. Laird, 438 F.2d 959, 963, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">\u201cTherefore, in this case \u2014 indeed, as in all conscientious objector cases \u2014 the threshold question for. review <em>is the sincerity of the claimant in objecting, on religious grounds, to participation in war in any form. </em>Sincerity is of course a subjective question. Witmer v. United States, 1955, 348 U.S. 375, 381-382, 75 S.Ct. 392, 99 L.Ed. 428, 434; United States v. Gernannt, 5 Cir. 1970, 427 F.2d 1157, 1159; United States v. Evans, 9 Cir. 1970, 425 F.2d 302, 305.\u201d 438 F.2d at 963. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">This Court went on to say, however, that a draft board or involved military authorities are not at liberty to disbelieve an applicant for discharge as a conscientious objector unless there be \u201csome facts in his application \u2014 hard, provable, reliable facts \u2014 that provide a basis for disbelieving the claimant.\u201d 438 F.2d at 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">In Kessler v. United States, 406 F.2d 151 (5th Cir. 1969), this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-13\">\u201c[T]he disbelief of Selective Service officials will not justify the rejection of a claim for conscientious objector status unless there is some affirmative evidence to support the rejection of the claimed exemption or there is something in the record which <em>substantially </em>(emphasis added) <em>blurs the picture painted by the registrant and thus casts doubt on his sincerity. </em>Bat-terton v. United States, 8 Cir., 1958, 260 F.2d 233.\u201d 406 F.2d at 156.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">I believe that the history of appellant\u2019s short lived army career contains \u201chard, provable, reliable facts\u201d and sufficiently \u201cblurs the picture painted by [appellant]\u201d to justify disbelief of appellant\u2019s claims and his sincerity in asserting conscientious objector status. From the moment of his first exposure to likelihood of real military service, Captain Kurtz has sought to avoid it. He first \u201capplied to the National Institutes of Health and the Public Health Service as alternatives to two years service in the military, but not being successful in the application carried through on signing for the Berry Plan.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s own language). Under the Berry Plan, he joined the Army during his internship at Johns Hopkins Hospital in November, 1968. Under this plan he received a commission in the Army Reserve \u2014 the record is unclear whether his first commission gave him the rank of Captain \u2014 and agreed to serve two years of active duty following his internship. He thus avoided the draft and postponed active military service for a period of two years. The District Judge\u2019s statement that,</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">\u201cHe [Kurtz] candidly admits in his application for discharge that he applied for the Berry Plan to avoid being drafted after his internship year.\u201d is not challenged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-16\">It is, of course, obvious that had Kurtz claimed conscientious objector status when he sought the benefits of the Berry Plan, he would not have been accepted. He accepted a commission in the United States Army, wore its uniform with the early obtained bars of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Captain\u2019s rank, and accepted officer's pay until the imminence of the end of the Berry Plan. The record does not tell us whether there are any additional perquisites available under the Berry Plan. His application recited that his opposition to the Vietnam war \u201cremained steadfast through the two years at Johns Hopkins.\u201d He said that in early 1970, he became aware that he would be activated in July, 1970, the time when the benefits of the Berry Plan would terminate and the \u201cquid pro quo\u201d therefor \u2014 two years service in the Army \u2014 would commence. He stated that it was then that \u201cthe immediacy of my relation to the military hit home to me.\u201d Application at that time for discharge as a conscientious objector \u2014 one opposed to participation in \u201cwar in any form\u201d \u2014 if successful, would have terminated continued enjoyment of the perquisites of the Berry Plan. He outlined his feelings about <em>the </em>war in two letters written to his superior officer, stating in substance his continued belief that the Vietnam war was wrong and that his conscience would not permit participation in it, \u201cbut that I could serve elsewhere in the armed forces.\u201d By the latter observation he insured continuance of the benefits of the Berry Plan until he would be ordered to report for active duty in July. He was directed to report on July 23, 1970. His application for discharge was made on or about July 16, 1970. He therein recites that he was examining his thoughts during the five months that intervened between his letters which said he could serve in the armed services and the time at which he would have to begin the service he promised. He concluded that after discussing his thoughts \u201cwith my colleagues and family and considering my own role in Vietnam,\u201d it became clear to him \u201cthat to be against the war in Vietnam <em>is really to be against all wars.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">He provided some letters from friends and relatives which recited the writers\u2019 confidence in the sincerity of appellant\u2019s religious and other beliefs, including his opposition to the Vietnam war. Only a letter from his wife set out his opposition to all wars. His own application contained an extensive dissertation on war and other things. The District Judge characterized \u2014 correctly, I believe \u2014Kurtz\u2019 expressed opposition to <em>all </em>war as <em>ambivalent. </em>Some passages of the application can be read as opposition to all wars. Much of it, however, does no more than give expression to thoughts that are held by all right thinking people \u2014 abhorrence of war as a method of resolving conflicts between the peoples of this earth. If such was the test, all decent people would be classified as conscientious objectors.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In the processing of appellant\u2019s application, reports were made by the hearing officer, Major Conway and the unit\u2019s Chaplain, Major Phillips. Both expressed confidence in appellant\u2019s sincerity. The Chaplain\u2019s report concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">\u201cI would hope * * * that Captain Kurtz would be given the opportunity to discharge his responsibilities to his country by serving in some other capacity not related to the armed forces.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The Hearing Officer\u2019s report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">\u201cIt is my recommendation that this officer\u2019s request for discharge be favorably considered and he be directed to complete his <em>military obligation </em>in some other capacity.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Neither of these reports assert that appellant is opposed to \u201cwar in any form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">The record contains impressions gained by the army officers who joined in denying appellant\u2019s application. Unsure of their chronological order, we set out some of their observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-12\">\u201cAppl * * * by Cpt Robert S. Kurtz, * * * US Ireland Army Hospital, Ft. Knox Ky, is disapproved. \u2018Applicant\u2019s request is based solely upon considerations of policy, pragmatism, or expediency.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">This message came from a Major Rodney E. Hurt, AGC-Chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>In a document identified as \u201cOpinion of the Board in the case of Robert S. Kurtz\u201d I find this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">\u201cGiven this long history of strong opposition to the Vietnam war, together with his effort to renege on his obligation to the Army under the Berry Plan in opposition to the war in Vietnam, and his further denunciation of the present war contained in his application, <em>that his self-serving declaration that he is indeed opposed to all wars does not ring true.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">An excerpt from the recommendation of one Clark B. Williams, Colonel, MC, Commanding, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">\u201cAt the time he signed and made his election to accept the Berry Plan, he was a well educated man in his mid-twenties completing medical school. CPT Kurtz\u2019 service as an anesthesiologist and a part of a medical team effort to save lives is not expected to severely affect his emotional state nor irreparably blunt his conscience. Particularly noteworthy of CPT Kurtz, document and description of his ethical beliefs and tenets of his religion is the omission of any reference to such important qualities as \u2018honor and integrity.\u2019 Reneging on his Berry Plan contract would appear to indicate that CPT Kurtz subjugates word of honor and integrity to a professed antipathy to international conflict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Final denial of appellant\u2019s application appears in a document coming through the Commanding General, Fort Knox, Kentucky. Its finality is evidenced by its designation as an \u201cOrder of the Secretary of the Army.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">\u201cApplicant\u2019s request is based upon objection to a particular war rather than opposition to war in any form.\u201d In summing up these various reports,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af4\">the District Judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">\u201cPetitioner\u2019s Commanding Officer and Commanding General both recommended disapproval of the application, the former because he apparently considered petitioner\u2019s attempt to escape his obligation under the Berry Plan inconsistent with the honor and integrity a sincere conscientious objector would be expected to possess, the latter because he thought petitioner was opposed only to the Vietnam war and not to all wars. There is no indication that either of these officers interviewed petitioner personally. Thereafter, upon consideration of the entire record, the Review Board disapproved petitioner\u2019s application on the ground previously stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">I am satisfied that appellant\u2019s total conduct justified disbelief by the Army authorities both of appellant\u2019s sincerity and his claim of opposition to \u201cwar in any form.\u201d I am satisfied that this disbelief and denial of appellant\u2019s application are supported by \u201chard, provable, reliable facts\u201d clearly emerging from this record; there is ample evidence \u201cwhich substantially blurs the picture painted by the [appellant].\u201d The District Judge acted in obedience to the commands of this Court in Helwick v. Laird, <em>supra, </em>438 F.2d 959, 963, as set out above. His opinion, filed January 8, 1971, well articulates the validity of his reasoning. I quote this much of it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-13\">\u201cWhile disapproval of the war in Vietnam is not itself inconsistent with conscientious objection to participation in armed conflict, Kessler v. United States, 406 F.2d 151 (5th Gir. 1969), and Congress had in mind \u2018actual military conflicts between nations of the earth in our time\u2019 when it enacted Section 6(j) of the Selective Service Act, Sciurella [Sicurella] v. United States, 348 U.S. 385, [75 S.Ct. 403, 99 L.Ed. 436] (1955), it is equally certain that one claiming conscientious objection may not successfully assert beliefs, no matter how sincerely they may be held, that do not amount to the sweeping declaration against war in any form demanded by the statute. This Court is of the opinion that petitioner\u2019s application, taken as a whole, could fairly be said to express opposition only to particular wars, and that there existed a basis in fact for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Review Board\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s application. See Carson v. United States, 411 F.2d 631 (5th Cir. 1969); United States v. Army [Curry], 410 F.2d 1297 (1st Cir. 1969).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">He was the fact finder and his findings are not clearly erroneous. We are not at liberty, therefore, to set them aside. 52 Fed.R.Civ.P. I find no fault in his conclusions of law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
