In August, Judge Mark A. Costantino denied an injunction and dismissed the complaint, holding that under 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 460(b) (3) the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The record reveals the following: In January 1970, responding to plaintiff\u2019s request, the Local Board mailed him a \u201cSpecial Form for Conscientious Objector\u201d (SSS Form 150). He subsequently completed and returned the form, in which, as the district judge found, plaintiff cited \u201cthe principles of the Jewish religion\u201d as the basis for his claim. In May 1970, plaintiff appeared personally before the Local Board to discuss whether he should be classified I-O. The Board denied his request on the grounds that his religious activities were casual and that the lateness of his claim raised doubts as to his sincerity. His I-A classification was continued. Plaintiff appealed this decision to the Eastern District Appeal Board which in July 1970 also rejected his conscientious objector claim and reclassified him I-A. No reasons were given for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">In August 1970, plaintiff wrote to the Local Board stating that the Supreme Court case of Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970), decided after the Local Board\u2019s decision but before the Appeal Board considered his appeal, undercut the reasons given by the Local Board for denying him a 1-0 classification and he requested a new SSS Form 150 in order to present \u201cnew information\u201d to the Board. The Board replied that a SSS Form 150 was not warranted, but that he could update his file by submitting any additional information he wished. The district court found that plaintiff failed to submit any new information.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">At about the same time, the Local Board also denied plaintiff\u2019s request for a III-A hardship deferment. Plaintiff filed a timely request for a personal appearance which was scheduled for October 27, 1970. At that meeting plaintiff again raised the same conscientious objector claim, but the Board refused to reconsider it on the ground that the issue had been previously decided. Only his hardship claim was considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">In May 1971, plaintiff received a notice to report for induction on June 21, 1971. A few days before that date, plaintiff brought this action in the district court and obtained a temporary restraining order enjoining his induction. The motion for a preliminary injunction came on before Judge Costantino who heard the dispute, vacated the temporary restraining order, denied an injunction and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Plaintiff urges us to find that the Local Board denied him his right to a meaningful personal appearance on October 27, 1970 by refusing to consider \u201cnew information\u201d as required by Selective Service Regulation 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1624.2(c). The argument is not persuasive because plaintiff himself failed to submit any \u201cnew information\u201d for the Board to consider with regard to his conscientious objector claim. Plaintiff\u2019s reference to the <em>Welsh </em>decision in his letters to the Local Board was not \u201cnew information\u201d applicable to his classification. In that case the Supreme Court held that a registrant could in some circumstances qualify for a 1-0 classification even if his beliefs were only \u201cpurely ethical or moral in source and content.\u201d 398 U.S. at 340, 90 S.Ct. at 1796. Here, however, plaintiff has consistently advanced only traditional religious grounds as the basis of his beliefs. Plaintiff argues that the Local Board acted in a \u201cblatantly lawless\u201d manner and, therefore, the prohibition of pre-induction judicial review contained in section 460(b) (3) does not apply. See Breen v. Selective Service Board, 396 U.S. 460, 90 S.Ct. 661, 24 L.Ed.2d 653 (1970); Oestereich v. Selective Service Board, 393 U.S. 233, 238, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968). But whatever may be the obligation of a local board to consider inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>vening changes in law between classification and induction of a registrant, the action of this Board was hardly \u201cblatantly lawless,\u201d in view of the inapplicability of <em>Welsh </em>to plaintiff\u2019s factual claim and plaintiff\u2019s failure to furnish any new factual information.</p>\n<p id=\"AHi\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
