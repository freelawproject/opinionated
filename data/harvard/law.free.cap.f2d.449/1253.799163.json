The Trial Examiner and the Board found the Company\u2019s refusal to recognize or bargain collectively with the Union constituted an unfair labor practice in violation of section 8(a) (1) and (5) of the Act. We enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-18\">The facts in this case are largely undisputed. On August 27, 1968, following a Board conducted election in which the Union received a majority of the votes, the Union was certified as exclusive bargaining agent for the Company\u2019s production and maintenance employees. After certification the parties met on 25 occasions between September 26, 1968 and August 19, 1969. During the fall of 1968 through the early spring of 1969 the parties exchanged substantially complete contract proposals and counter-proposals. Thereafter they negotiated and agreed tentatively on a substantial number of contract clauses dealing with a wide variety of topics.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>is some conflict in the evidence it appears that when the next to the last meeting of the parties took place on May-20, 1969, a tentative agreement had been reached on all substantial issues except arbitration, seniority, wages and duration of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">Between May 20 and August 19 there were no negotiations. A meeting scheduled for June 5 was cancelled because Banks, the chief union spokesman, was hospitalized. After he left the hospital, Banks made efforts both directly and through the Federal Mediator to arrange further meetings. Banks wrote the Company\u2019s Secretary-Treasurer, Pettit, on July 21, 22, 28 or 29, and requesting that \u201cthis meeting be for a package of the remaining three items, wages, seniority and insurance.\u201d Pettit\u2019s secretary replied by letter of July 17 that company representatives were not available on the suggested dates because of vacations but could meet on July 23 or 24. Banks did not respond to this suggestion. However, a few days later, with the help of the mediator, arrangements were made for a meeting on August 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">At the time of the scheduled meeting the Union\u2019s bargaining position did not appear particularly strong. A strike called in January 1969 in support of the Union\u2019s bargaining demands had been supported by only 30-35 out of 107 employees then in the bargaining unit. The strike lasted for one week.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">After the strike the Union\u2019s efforts to have the Company replace its chief negotiator, Shawd, had been unsuccessful. At a bargaining session on January 29, 1969, the Union representative threatened action against the Company unless Shawd was replaced. The Company responded by filing an unfair labor practice complaint against the Union, but later withdrew the charge. In June 1969 Banks asked the Company for a meeting without Shawd and was told that the Company would not replace Shawd. After arrangements for the August 19 meeting had been made,' 51 out of approximately 81 employees left in the bargaining unit signed a decertification petition and filed it with the Board\u2019s Regional office on July 29,1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-13\">The Board found that in preparation for the August 19, 1969 meeting the Company representatives, Shawd and Pettit, concluded that in view of circumstances the Company would terminate its bargaining with the Union and cease to recognize the Union. The Union also reviewed its situation and concluded that they would accept the Company\u2019s terms on what they understood were the only three outstanding items, insurance, wages and seniority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-14\">At the August 19 meeting the mediator opened the session noting that three topics remained open: wages, insurance and seniority. The Company representative then handed the Union representative a letter <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> indicating that the Company was withdrawing from the negotiations. \u2022 The Union representative stated that the Union \u201caccepts the Company\u2019s last firm proposal on these three items (still open) for a period of a 1-year contract from this date as discussed previously.\u201d The Company representative said \u201cThe letter shuts off' need for further remarks.\u201d The Company represent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>ative refused to answer any further questions and the meeting ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">The Union brought this unfair labor practice proceeding. After a hearing the Trial Examiner found, and the Board approved, that the events at the August 19 meeting as well as during the earlier negotiations did not result in agreement on seniority, wages or duration of the contract. The Board therefore found that the Company had not violated the Act by refusing to execute a collective-bargaining agreement. However the Trial Examiner found, and the Board approved, that the Company violated section 8(a) (1) and (5) of the Act by refusing since August 19, 1969 to recognize or bargain collectively with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">The Company argues here that under Brooks v. N.L.R.B., 348 U.S. 96, 75 S.Ct. 176, 99 L.Ed. 125 (1954) they have bargained in good faith for a \u201creasonable period \u2014 about one year\u201d \u2014 and further that the \u201cfacts in this ease present unusual circumstances\u201d justifying the Company\u2019s refusal to bargain. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">The Company acknowledges the importance of allowing the Union a reasonable period of time following certification to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with the Company. But the Company argues that the decision in <em>Brooks </em>and the cases following, particularly N.L.R.B. v. Alva Allen Industries, Inc., 396 F.2d 310 (8th Cir. 1966), do not require 365 days in order to be a \u201creasonable period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">We feel that the Company overlooks the importance of providing a union whose representative status has been certified by the Board with not only a \u201creasonable time\u201d to bargain but also a fixed minimum time during which the effort to reach an agreement will not be frustrated by the Company\u2019s refusal to bargain, except in unusual circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-8\">In <em>Brooks </em>the employer had refused to bargain where shortly after certification the union lost, without the employer\u2019s fault, the majority of its membership. The employer there contended that whenever an employer is presented with evidence that his employees have deserted their certified union, he may forthwith refuse to bargain. Speaking for the court, Mr. Justice Frankfurter rejected the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-10\">If the employees are dissatisfied with their chosen union, they may submit their own grievance to the Board. If an employer has doubts about his duty to continue bargaining, it is his responsibility to petition the Board for relief, while continuing to bargain in good faith at least until the Board has given some indication that his claim has merit. Although the Board may, if the facts warrant, revoke a certification or agree not to pursue a charge of an unfair labor practice, these are matters for the Board; they do not justify employer self-help or judicial intervention. The underlying purpose of this statute is industrial peace. To allow employers to rely on employees\u2019 rights in refusing to bargain with the formally designated union is not conducive to that end, it is inimical to it. [footnotes omitted]</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-11\">348 U.S. at 103, 75 S.Ct. at 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-12\">The Court cited with approval the Board\u2019s rule that \u201cA certification, if based on a Board-conducted election, must be honored for a \u2018reasonable\u2019 period, ordinarily \u2018one year,\u2019 in the absence of \u2018unusual circumstances.\u2019 \u201d 348 U.S. at 98, 75 S.Ct. at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-14\">The language used by courts which have considered this problem in recent years indicates a substantial number of courts agree that absent \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d the employer must bargain in good faith for one year after certification, following an election, even though a majority of the employees of the company have repudiated the union. N.L.R.B. v. Holly-General Co., Division of Siegler Corp., 305 F.2d 670, 675 (9th Cir. 1962); N.L.R.B. v. U. S. Sonics Corp., 312 F.2d 610, 616 (1st Cir. 1963) ; N.L.R.B. v. International Shoe Corp. of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>Puerto Rico, 357 F.2d 330, 331 (1st Cir. 1966). Cf. N.L.R.B. v. Sharon Hats, Inc., 289 F.2d 628, 631 (5th Cir. 1961) ; N.L.R.B. v. Satilla Rural Electric Membership Corp., 322 F.2d 251, 253 (5th Cir. 1963); N.L.R.B. v. Certain-Teed Products Corp., 387 F.2d 639 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"afq-dedup-1\">Moreover a number of courts in considering disputes which did not actually arise within the year following certification have approved the one year rule. N.L.R.B. v. Miami Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 382 F.2d 921, 923 (5th Cir. 1967); N.L.R.B. v. Rish Equipment Co., 407 F. 2d 1098, 1100 (4th Cir. 1969); N.L.R.B. v. C &amp; C Plywood Corp., 413 F.2d 112, 115 (9th Cir. 1969). <em>Cf. </em>N.L.R.B. v. Louisiana Bunkers, Inc., 409 F.2d 1295, 1299 (5th Cir. 1969). Some courts have referred to the one year rule as an \u201cir-rebuttable presumption of majority status\u201d e. g., N.L.R.B. v. Gulfmont Hotel Company, 362 F.2d 588, 589 (5th Cir. 1966); Lodges 1746 &amp; 743, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO v. N.L.R.B., 135 U.S.App.D.C. 53, 416 F.2d 809, 811 (1969); Bally Case and Cooler, Inc. of Delaware v. N.L.R.B., 416 F.2d 902, 904-905 (6th Cir. 1969). Other courts have termed the one year rule a \u201cconclusive presumption in the absence of special circumstances.\u201d Ingress-Plastene, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 430 F.2d 542, 546 (7th Cir. 1970); Fremont Newspapers, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 436 F.2d 665, 671 (8th Cir. 1970).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">We are persuaded by the Board\u2019s argument that the fundamental purpose of the certification year rule would be thwarted if the year could be modified or truncated absent a showing of \u201cunusual circumstances.\u201d If employers could determine, based on <em>their </em>assessment of the union\u2019s representative standing and <em>their </em>analysis of the process of negotiations, that employee rights would best be effectuated by a termination of bargaining, the Board would then be required to decide, on a case by case basis, whether the particular employer acted reasonably and in good faith. All the evils which the rule was designed to prevent- \u2014 dilatory challenges to representative status, inhibiting and destructive time pressures, administrative uncertainty \u2014 would be resurrected and encouraged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-10\">We are of the opinion that a year is a reasonable time to permit a newly certified union to reach an agreement with the company whose employees the union represents. But in addition, a firm one year minimum requirement for good faith bargaining, in the absence of unusual circumstances, provides an understandable and easily enforceable standard. Such a standard permits both parties to adjust their bargaining strategies with regard to a day certain when the insulated bargaining period will terminate and protects the last weeks of the certification year, which may well be the most fruitful in producing a collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-11\">The Company here has cited only one case, and the court has been unable to find any other, in which the \u201creasonable period, ordinarily one year\u201d mentioned in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number><em>Brooks </em>has been held to be satisfied by less than one calendar year. In N.L.R. B. v. Alva Allen Industries, Inc., 369 F. 2d 310 (8th Cir. 1966), the court found that having bargained in good faith until only eleven days prior to the end of the certification year, the company had bargained for \u201cabout one year\u201d and under the circumstances of the case, it was held that they had bargained for a \u201creasonable period.\u201d 369 F.2d at 310. However the circumstances in that case were that the union had been lethargic in negotiating for eight months and had failed for three months to resume negotiations. Further all the members in the unit had been replaced as a result of a strike and the union had indicated that it was unwilling to represent the strike breakers. Finally, in an effort to forestall a representation election at the close of the certification year, the union had given the company a \u201cblank check\u201d to write a contract covering employees in the unit over which the union had no interest (since all were strike-breakers) by relinquishing any demand for union security, re-employment of striking workers or even preferential hiring of strikers for future vacancies. The court held that these facts also constituted \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d permitting a shortening of the \u201creasonable period, ordinary one year,\u201d following certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">In the present case the Trial Examiner and the Board found the facts here distinguishable from those in <em>Alva Allen </em>and not comparable to the unusual circumstances referred to by the Supreme Court in <em>Brooks.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accordingly, the Board found that the Company\u2019s refusal to recognize and bargain with the Union during the certification year constituted an unfair labor practice. Upon examination of the record and briefs in this ease we find that the Board\u2019s conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-6\">We agree that the facts as found by the Board do not amount to \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d sufficient to justify a shortening of the good faith bargaining requirement during the year following certification. There is nothing unusual about the fact that only eight days remained in the certification year. At some point in time all union certifications will be 357 days old. The Union here did not abandon the negotiations as in <em>Alva Allen, </em>although they were delayed due to the illness of the Union representative and the Company\u2019s vacation schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-7\">The Union\u2019s threats against the Company in their effort to replace the Company negotiator prompted proper action in the form of a filing of an unfair labor practice charge. However the Company later withdrew the complaint and five months of negotiations had followed. The suggestion by Banks in June that the Company replace its negotiator did not diminish the Company\u2019s willingness to set further dates for negotiations in July.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-8\">Finally the filing of the petition for decertification by the employees did not destroy the bargaining status of the certified Union, nor amount to an \u201cunusual circumstances.\u201d N.L.R.B. v. Holly-General Co., Division of Siegler Corp., <em>supra. </em>The question is not whether the employer in good faith doubts the union\u2019s continued representative status; the employer is not relieved of its duty to bargain during the certification year even when it is shown that a majority of the employees may have defected from the union. Holly-General Co., <em>supra; </em>N.L.R.B. v. Satilla Rural Electric Membership Corp., <em>supra; </em>N.L.R.B. v. Louisiana Bunkers, Inc., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-9\">The Company argues \u201cThis case is all about eight (8) days.\u201d More accurately stated, the case is about the refusal of the Company to bargain for eight (8) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>days. Neither the Board nor this court intimates that the Company was under any duty to execute a contract; but it was under a duty to bargain. The Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole and the Board\u2019s order will therefore be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1312-12\">. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (1) and (5) (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1312-14\">.

In addition a preponderance of the evidence shows that during the first 24 sessions the negotiators also arrived at tentative agreement regarding the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>ing topics: Shop Stewards; Hours of Work; Overtime and Premium Pay; Leave of Absence; Grievance Procedure ; Production Standards; Installation of New Machinery, etc.; and orally, regarding Management Bights including provisions for Check-off.
