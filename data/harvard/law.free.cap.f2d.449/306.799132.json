Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), and Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967) did not shield Time.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, the Supreme Court had held that the freedoms of speech and of the press guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit \u201ca public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with \u2018actual malice\u2019,\u2014 that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d 376 U.S. at 279-280, 84 S.Ct. at 726. And in <em>Curtis Publishing Co., </em>the <em>New York Times </em>rule was extended to \u201cpublic figures\u201d, private citizens who project themselves into important public controversies.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">In United Medical Laboratories, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 404 F.2d 706 (9th Cir. 1969), cert. denied 394 U.S. 921, 89 S.Ct. 1197, 22 L.Ed.2d 454 (1969), that rule was further extended to a prominent mail order laboratory on the ground that public health is a subject of legitimate public interest. Appellant, however, seeks to distinguish <em>United Medical Laboratories </em>contending that involved there was one of the largest mail-order laboratories in the country and thus, a \u201cpublic figures,\u201d whereas appellant is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">During the pendency of this appeal the Supreme Court held in Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc., 403 U.S. 29, 91 S.Ct. 1811, 29 L.Ed.2d 296 (June 7, 1971) that the <em>New York Times </em>rule applies whenever the alleged defamatory statements relate to the plaintiff\u2019s involvement in a matter of public or general concern, regardless of whether the plaintiff is a \u201cpublic official\u201d, a \u201cpublic figure\u201d, or a \u201cprivate individual.\u201d Rosenbloom was a distributor of nudist magazines in Philadelphia and claimed that Metromedia had broadcast defamatory falsehoods concerning his arrest by the police for possession of obscene literature and about a pending injunction action in which plaintiff was labeled as a smut distributor. Rosenbloom was neither a public official nor a public figure, as Cerrito also denies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">In the light of <em>Rosenbloom, </em>it is unnecessary for us to belabor the point whether Cerrito is a \u201cpublic figure\u201d, (although the evidence in the record indicates that he is) since the Life magazine articles on organized crime \u201cis a subject of the utmost importance to the people of this country and that if it is not, it nevertheless should be a subject of great interest to them\u201d as appellant himself acknowledges.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">The record clearly indicates that appellant is unable, as a matter of law, to discharge the burden imposed on him of proving that he was included in one of the Life magazine articles with actual malice or with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">Therefore, the summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-12\">. The District Court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order is reported in 302 P. Supp. 1071 (D.C., N.D.Cal.1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b364-13\">. Although \u201cLife Magazine, X, Y and Z corporation, Doe One through Doe Ten\u201d were also named as defendants, the record indicates that Life Magazine is not a legal person, but just a magazine published by Time, Inc., and that no effort was made by Cerrito to identify any of the fictitious defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
