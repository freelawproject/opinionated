His sole contention on appeal is that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because of his trial counsel\u2019s incorapetency.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-19\">Wilkes contends that his trial counsel might have presented the evidence differently and that he might have called other witnesses. This court has held that such hindsight speculation as to how a case might have been defended differently is not sufficient to show that trial counsel was incompetent. Borchert v. United States, 405 F.2d 735 (9th Cir. 1968), cert. den. 394 U.S. 972, 89 S.Ct. 1466, 22 L.Ed.2d 753 (1969). We have examined the record and conclude that counsel was rendering reasonably effective assistance. Therefore, the conviction must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
