BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">This appeal presents one of the most frequently litigated questions of transportation law \u2014 whether a certain method of transportation is \u201cfor-hire\u201d or \u201cprivate carriage.\u201d The new wrinkle, cf. Mike Hooks, Inc. v. Pena, 5 Cir., 1963, 313 F.2d 696, 1963 A.M.C. 1463, is the employment of a joint venture between an upbound and a downbound shipper through the use of jointly leased vehicles operated by drivers ostensibly under the complete control of the momentary user in order to eliminate the abhorrent and uneconomical deadhead backhaul.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The District Court, after a primary jurisdiction reference<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the ICC, upheld the ICC\u2019s determination that the scheme followed was transportation for compensation and not exempt private carriage. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">I. How It All Came About</p>\n<p id=\"Au0\">This litigation began when the shipper participants in the joint venture sought injunctive relief against the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC), which had been arresting drivers employed by the joint venturers. As in Agricultural Transportation Assn. of Texas v. King, 5 Cir., 1965, 349 F.2d 873, the arrests were for the transporters\u2019 failure to have valid ICC certificates or permits as required by \u00a7\u00a7 323.02 and 323.28 of the Florida Statutes, F.S.A. The District Court granted a preliminary injunction but determined \u2014 quite properly \u2014 that the case was one within the special expertise of the ICC and accordingly referred the ease to that body for initial disposition under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-17\">Keller and the other shippers with whom it had made these agreements then petitioned the Commission to declare that its activities were \u201cprivate carriage\u201d and therefore exempt from ICC and hence Florida certification requirements. The FPSA as well as several motor carrier associations and conferences intervened,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> urging that this transportation arrangement be deemed \u201cfor-hire\u201d carriage and thus subject to certification requirements pertaining to interstate motor operations. After submission under the modified procedure Division 1 of the ICC decided by a 2-1 vote that the operation of the joint venturers constituted \u201cfor-hire\u201d carriage and thus was impermissible without the authorization of the Commission. Keller Industries, Inc., Request for Declaratory Order Regarding Legality of Operations, 1966, 103 M.C.C. 520. Upon request for reconsideration the case was re-heard by the full Commission as a matter of general transportation importance. By an 8-3 vote the ICC upheld the decision of Division 1. Keller Industries, Inc., et al., Request for Declaratory Order Regarding Legality of Operation, 1968, 107 M.C.C. 75. In keeping with the Court\u2019s earlier direction the commission certified its record and decision to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-18\">II. One Judge? Three Judge?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-19\">The shippers filed a new complaint<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> seeking review of the ICC orders and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>requested that it be heard by a three-Judge court under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2325.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A three-Judge court was convened, but it concluded that under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1336(b) and 1398(b) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> jurisdiction was properly before one and not three Judges. Keller Industries, Inc. v. United States, N.D.Fla., 1969, 304 F.Supp. 852. No appeal was taken from this order. The single District Judge then proceeded to-hear the case on the ICC record and to affirm the Commission. Keller Industries, Inc. v. United States, N.D.Fla., 1970, 311 F.Supp. 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The threshold question is a jurisdictional one, since the shippers continue to urge that the orders and reports of the ICC had to be reviewed by a three Judge rather than a one-Judge court in accordance with the dictates of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2325, note 4, <em>supra. </em>We find this contention unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">As the three-Judge Court correctly pointed out, before 1964 the shippers\u2019 proposed procedure was clearly the correct one. \u201cPrior to the enactment of this statute whenever the Court of Claims or District Court referred the issue to the Interstate Commerce Commission for a resolution, the Commission order emanating therefrom was subject to judicial review by a three judge district court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1336, 1398, 2284, 2321-2325, rather than by the referring court. Consequently, the referring court had to await the decision of the three judge court, the Supreme Court, if an appeal was taken, and any other proceedings which might result from such judi-nal decisions, before it could proceed to final judgment. See Pennsylvania R. R. v. United States, 363 U.S. 202, 80 S.Ct. 1131, 4 L.Ed.2d 1165 (1960).\u201d Keller Industries, Inc. v. United States, N.D. Fla.1969, 304 F.Supp. 852, 854. But Congress became aware of this \u201ccumbersome and inefficient\u201d procedure, S.Rep. No. 1394, 88th Cong., 2d Sess.; H.R. Rep. No. 1015, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 1964 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 3235, 3236, observing that one case remained on the docket of the Court of Claims \u201cfor 10 years while full review of the Commission\u2019s order is being effected.\u201d Report, <em>supra </em>at 3237. The remedy devised by Congress was the \u201c1964 amendment to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1336 and 1398, Public Law 88-513, authorizing the referring court to have exclusive jurisdiction to review the Commission\u2019s order resulting from the referral, * * * Thus, since the 1964 amendment, the referring court, rather than a three judge district court, has reviewed the Commission\u2019s order because of its exclusive jurisdiction. See McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, 387 F.2d 657, 659-660, 181 Ct.Cl. 170 (1967) (\u2018The [1964 amendment] was to provide a more streamlined procedure for judicial review of questions that involve the primary jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission and are referred to it for a preliminary determination\u2019); Seaboard Air Line R. R. v. United States, 387 F.2d 651, 654-655, 181 Ct.Cl. 719 (1967).\u201d Keller, <em>supra, </em>304 F.Supp. at 854-855.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>We are aware that isi Agricultural Transportation Association of Texas v. King, <em>supra, </em>349 F.2d 873, 884-885, we adopted a contrary position, but that was prior to the ICC reference and later report. The issue was not then squarely presented, and the opinion of the dissolved three-Judge court persuades us that the initial forecast was mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">We need only add that since \u00a7\u00a7 1336(b) and 1398(b), note 5 <em>supra, </em>parallel the Court of Claims and the District Courts with respect to referrals to the ICC, Congress could not have meant to prescribe a three-Judge review if referred by a single Judge but a Court of Claims review if referred by the Court of Claims. Our reading likewise recognizes the peculiar nature of the role of the administrative agency in a \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d referral. Agency determinations are sought as an aid in judicial determinations, not as a complete substitute for them.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since the judicial remedy sought is the granting of an injunction against allegedly unauthorized acts of State officers \u2014 ordinarily a matter for a single Judge \u2014 the single Judge Court must employ the agency\u2019s determination and hence may properly review it for acceptability.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">We hold that 1336(b) and 1398(b) mean in effect that Congress has created an exception to \u00a7 2325 and has declared that a referral case is not one for three Judges. Thus the review of the ICC orders was properly for the referring Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">III. The Joint Venture Cook and Keller Get Together</p>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">Keller Industries, a large integrated company with activities in a number of different states,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is located primarily in Miami and is essentially a northward bound shipper of finished aluminum products. See Scroll, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir., 1971, 447 F.2d 612. But Keller always has had the problem of an empty backhaul from Northern cities to Miami. Then E. N. Cook (since deceased) entered the scene. Cook was an old hand at figuring up schemes \u2014 commercially successful but almost invariably held to be illegal <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 by which upbound and down-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>bound shippers of their own goods were brought together to keep the trucks full both ways. Cook proposed to coordinate Keller\u2019s shipping with that of companies in Florida who imported their material from the North. Basically his idea was to permit other companies, unrelated to Keller, to ship to Florida using the same truck and driver that Keller had used to ship from Florida. To carry out the scheme Keller employed Cook as Traffic Coordinator. He was to solicit the down-bound participants for the operation, to arrange for truck leasing, and to hire drivers. A typical example of the arrangement would run like this: Keller enters a joint venture agreement<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>one of the southbound shippers<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> whose origin shipping point was close to Keller\u2019s destination. Keller through Cook arranges a joint lease of a truck from a truck rental agency. The first agency sought is Control Systems, Inc. which was formed and is still financed by Keller. If no truck is available there, Keller contacts a second agency, Beacon, Inc., a company that had formerly been associated with Cook. Then Keller and the other joint venturer sign a joint lease. Each party bears the cost of moving his own goods from origin to destination. By mutual agreement, respecting the particular trip, the cost of moving the empty truck from Keller\u2019s destination to the origin point of the returning shipper\u2019s goods is allocated between the two. The lease is based on a daily rate plus mileage without regard to the transported goods. In case a driver has road trouble, he calls the shipper whose goods he is then transporting. Each shipper must insure his own goods, and each helps defray the collision coverage insurance of the leasing company. Each shipper is billed directly by the lessor for its share of the rental and expenses, and each is solely responsible for damages or losses to his own cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">From a so-called drivers\u2019 association, Keller also arranges to obtain a driver for the round trip, and both shippers must approve the driver. Although in the papers before the ICC this practice is characterized as jointly employing the driver, under the terms of the employment contract the driver becomes the employee of each shipper during the part of the trip allocated to that shipper. For their respective parts of the trip, Keller and the other joint venturer pay the driver\u2019s wages and tolls, and each deducts withholding taxes and social security from the driver\u2019s pay. The shippers pay the driver by two separate payroll checks and pay their portions of social security and workmen\u2019s compensation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Each shipper has sole control over the equipment and the driver for his part of the haul (or that \u201cattributed to\u201d him by contemporary agreement). See par. 4, note 10, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">IV. To ICC The Venture Illegal</p>\n<p id=\"ap-dedup-0\">On such facts, the ICC found that shippers were jointly operating as interstate motor carriers for compensation without possessing the necessary licenses. 103M.C.C. 18; 107 M.C.C. 76-78. Considered together, the findings of the Division and the entire Commission establish that shippers were not merely carrying their own goods but rather were jointly providing \u201ccompensation\u201d for each other \u2014in the sense that term is used in the statutory definition of a \u201ccommon carrier by motor vehicle,\u201d 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 303(a) (14), or \u201ccontract carrier by motor vehicle,\u201d 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 303(a) (15) \u2014 particularly by relieving each other of the cost of returning an empty truck to the point where their respective goods originated for shipment. By thus avoiding or reducing their individual transportation expenses through the joint arrangements, the shipper groups were in effect performing for-hire motor carriage \u201cfor each other, with the reimbursement of expense constituting \u2018compensation\u2019.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The Commission, after pointing out that its decision fully comported with earlier ICC decisions reaching the same result, 103 M.C.C. 530, also declared that the solicitation by Keller of the other shippers in the scheme was \u201ccompletely irreconcilable with the private carriage concept envisioned by the statutory scheme of regulation,\u201d and that if these joint motor activities were not regulated, they would inevitably be detrimental to the public interest, 107 M.C.C. 78.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">V. The Statutory Structure</p>\n<p id=\"AORj\">The statutes dealing with \u201cfor-hire\u201d Versus \u201cprivate carriage\u201d transportation are the source of both controlling principles and problems of application. Our function must be to determine \u201cthe applicability to a narrow fact situation of imprecise definitional language which delineates the coverage of the measure.\u201d United States v. Drum, 1962, 368 U.S. 370, 376, 82 S.Ct. 408, 411, 7 L.Ed.2d 360, 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">The Motor Carrier Act of 1935 requires an ICC certificate or permit for transportation operations of common carriers <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and contract carriers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Though regulation of these carriers was extensive, Congress recognized that there was still a place in the transportation picture for the carriage of one\u2019s own goods in equipment operated by a shipper. Specific recognition was therefore given to a third category of \u201cprivate carrier of property by motor vehicle.\u201d Part of the problem is that this category was defined negatively in terms of what it was not\u2014 not a common, not a contract, carrier.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Under the Act, a private carrier is exempt from economic (but not safety) regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">This reverse negative definition brought about administrative and enforcement difficulties. The \u201cICC believed * * * that \u00a7 203(a) (17) [49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 303(a) (17)]. was not sufficiently explicit, particularly since decisions of some lower courts * * * raised doubts whether a truck operator could be found to be an unauthorized \u2018for-hire\u2019 carrier in the absence of some affirmative showing that his operations brought him within the definitions of common or contract carriage. Consequently the Commission sought additional legislation.\u201d Red Ball Motor Freight Inc. v. Shannon, 1964, 377 U.S. 311, 315, 84 S.Ct. 1260, 1263, 12 L.Ed.2d 341, 344 (footnote omitted). The new legislation,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> enacted in 1958, was designed to clarify the meaning of \u201cprivate carriage\u201d so that the ICC could root out all \u201csubterfuges which might be employed to engage in unauthorized for-hire transportation.\u201d Red Ball, <em>supra, </em>377 U.S. at 316, 84 S.Ct. at 1263, 12 L.Ed.2d at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">VI. Is Transporter A Carrier In Substance?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Are Carrier Burdens Borne ?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">But with the private carrier \u201cdefined simply as transporters of property who are neither common nor contract carriers * * * the statute will yield up no better verbal guide to the reach of its licensing provisions than transportation \u2018for compensation\u2019 or \u2018for-hire\u2019.\u201d <em>Drum, supra, </em>368 U.S. at 376, 82 S.Ct. at 411, 7 L.Ed.2d at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-18\">Of major importance here, these considerations led the Supreme Court to declare this pervasive theme: \u201cBecause the definitions must, if they are to serve their purpose, impose practical limitations upon unregulated competition in a regulated industry, they are to be interpreted in a manner which <em>transcends the merely formal </em>(emphasis added).\u201d <em>Drum, supra, </em>368 U.S. at 375, 82 S.Ct. at 411, 7 L.Ed.2d at 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-20\">In <em>Drum </em>the Court had to determine the applicability of the Motor Carrier Act to a transportation scheme devised by Oklahoma Furniture Manufacturing Company for the transportation of its own manufactured furniture. The system was for the lease of tractors from owner-operators and the payment to such lessor-owner-operators of a specified mileage rental and of a mileage fee as compensation for the driver. Tracing the development by the ICC of the two \u201ccontrol\u201d and \u201csubstance\u201d tests, and after assuming the record showed requisite controls by the shipper over the physical operations of the transportation, the Court held that in substance the shipper was really a for-hire carrier. In reaching this conclusion the Court tested the facts against the standard of whether the transporter had been willing to \u201cassume in significant measure the characteristic burdens of the transportation business,\u201d 368 U.S. at 376, 82 S.Ct. at 411, 7 L.Ed.2d at 365, or alternatively, whether the transporter \u201chad so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>far emancipated itself from the burdens of transportation that to permit it, on such terms, to secure a transportation service from these unlicensed owner-operators would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme.\u201d 368 U.S. at 380, 82 S.Ct. at 413, 7 L.Ed.2d at 367. On this approach the Court specifically upheld the ICC delineation of the significant burdens which the shipper did not bear because, through the scheme, they had been shifted to the lessor-owner-operator.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accordingly the Court referred with approval to one of our very early cases which, with others, developed the \u201csubstance\u201d test.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">VII. No Deadhead Risk</p>\n<p id=\"ar-dedup-0\">Joint Venture A Formalism It is perfectly evident that if the joint venture structure fills the bill, the Keller scheme eliminates almost<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> altogether one of the awful burdens of a carrier\u2014 that of the deadhead backhaul. Indeed, this was the genesis of the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">At this point, form is altogether controlling. For the shippers have to recognize that in the \u201cbeaten track of administrative decision,\u201d <em>Drum, supra, </em>368 U.S. at 384, 82 S.Ct. at 415, 7 L.Ed.2d at 369, the scheme would fail were the lessee entity a corporation owned jointly by them <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> or if separate leases with the upbound and downbound shippers were executed by the lessor agency,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or if a third party, not just an employee of one of the two shippers (Keller), were acting as an independent traffic advisor,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or if the trucks were leased jointly to the two without a joint venture,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or if the trucks were not jointly leased but were jointly owned,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> or if the shippers had formed one of the popular co-ops.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">There is no real difference in the substance of these agreements because the joint venture structure \u2014 whatever its status as a distinctive legal entity \u2014 is nothing more than the momentary pairing on the vaguest of terms (see note 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>supra) of two unrelated businesses for the sole purpose of procuring transportation through precise prearrangement without incurring the cost either of getting the vehicle to its destination or returning it empty. The Act<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> does not confine regulation to specific legal entities. To allow two unrelated shippers somehow to be engaged in their respective primary businesses because the device nominally makes the lease a joint one would be to interpret the Act, not \u201cin a manner which transcends the merely formal,\u201d United States v. Drum, <em>supra, </em>368 U.S. at 375, 82 S.Ct. at 411, 7 L.Ed. 2d at 364, but in a manner which magnifies form.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In reaching this conclusion we need not disparage either the moral or legal purity of the arrangement. Indeed, we can credit all, and in so doing we really credit nothing, for that is what the \u201cagreement\u201d adds up to. At the outset, the joint venture agreement (note 10, <em>supra) </em>is but an outline of things on which the parties are subsequently to negotiate and agree upon \u2014 if they can. But more important, crediting it as a covenant hammered out after the most contentious negotiations as though each party were an independent free agent, and assuming that it committed them to significant obligations, the joint agreement really was joint only in the paper and the signature. It did call for a joint lease \u2014 but nothing more. Under the project and the agreement, only the lease was precise in spelling out what each was to do. Except for the tag end back-haul (see note 20, <em>supra) </em>the agreement simply outlined how each of the supposed joint venturers were to go their separate ways. Thus, as to each leg the upbound or downbound shipper \u2014 not the joint venturers \u2014 was to be the \u201cemployer\u201d of the driver, responsible for direction, control and compensation. Indeed, this was indispensable to even an arguably valid arrangement.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> All it amounted to, in effect, was a device which brought the parties together for the barest fraction of an indefinable moment, only for each to go his own way with absolutely \u2014 the word has to be absolutely \u2014 no interference, either actual, legal, or possible, by the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">To be sure, <em>Red Ball, supra, </em>does recognize that there may be ways to eliminate the backhaul burden without violating the Act. But this scheme is not one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">VIII. The Coordinator A Solicitor Added to this, the device to eliminate the deadhead backhaul had another characteristic so typical of today\u2019s highly competitive, intermodal transportation complex. The whole arrangement depended on successful initial solicitation in Keller\u2019s behalf by Cook or his successor. The melding of the upbound and downbound could not be left to chance from some highway corner stand. Keller\u2019s scheme \u2014 and it was born there\u2014 called for pairing. To pair, one had to find an opposite. Here it was solicitation of downbound shipments. Whether upbound or downbound, the very essence of transportation is the effective solicitation of cargo. If it was not \u201ctransportation\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> as such, it was not less than the activity of a broker.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">IX. Piedmont No Obstacle</p>\n<p id=\"b231-16\"> Finally, shippers assert that, until released by an en banc decision, we</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>are bound by ICC v. Piedmont Sales Co., N.D.Ga., 1963, 16 Fed.Car. Cases No. 81623, aff\u2019d, 5 Cir., 1964, 330 F.2d 351. There is, to be sure a remarkable similarity but it is outweighed by the dissimilarities. Of greatest significance, <em>Piedmont </em>was tried on the facts in and by the District Court. Our per curiam affirmance merely put the imprimatur of F.R.Civ.P. 52(a) on the fact-legal conclusions. On the other hand, what we really review here is not a District Judge\u2019s conclusion but more properly those of the ICC. The standard of review is quite different, and should be. The ICC\u2019s determinations should not be set aside \u201cif they are based upon adequate findings, and if they are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Allen v. United States, S.D.Fla., 1960, 187 F.Supp. 625, 627 (3-Judge Court). The judicial function is exhausted when there is found to be warrant in the law and a rational basis for the conclusions reached by the Commission. Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co. v. United States, 1934, 292 U.S. 282, 286-287, 54 S.Ct. 692, 693-694, 78 L.Ed. 1260, 1264-1265, and resort to the doctrine of primary jurisdiction does not change the fact that an ICC order is under review.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">In addition in <em>Piedmont </em>there was no question of blending an upbound and a downbound shipment together. The up-bound was clearly exempt because of the exempt (agricultural) nature of the cargoes. The only question was whether there was a genuine lease for the down-bound trip. The Court held that there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">The upshot is that the District Court correctly upheld the ICC order and with that decision falls the injunction and complaint against the Florida Public <em>Service </em>Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">X. Looking Back To Look Ahead</p>\n<p id=\"AMB\">Without casting blame on parties, counsel, Commission or Court, but accepting responsibility for that attributable to us,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the time table in this case is not a happy picture in terms of discontinuance of operations held consistently to be illegal<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> For six years these shippers have engaged in unlawful transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">With the presumption against the validity of these lease-rentals with drivers obtained from outside sources <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and the almost invariable determination of illegality by the ICC and Courts,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> we are convinced the shoe should be on the other foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">District Courts should therefore be cautious in granting temporary or interim injunctive relief against enforcement actions by public officers, Federal or State. Probability of ultimate success as a factor justifying interim relief<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> has too often gone unconsidered. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Such an approach would fit in with the structure of regulation, which puts upon the transporter the duty to obtain a certificate or permit and, pending the determination of the application, the obligation to obtain a temporary authorization based upon a showing of \u201cimmediate and urgent need,\u201d 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 310a.

Cook, as president of an organization known as traffic Advisory Service, Inc., there arranged to have individual business concerns jointly lease trucks and hire drivers, and transport inbound to Florida the respective goods of the one concern, and outbound from Florida the goods of the other concern, and prorate the transportation expenses among themselves (71 M.C.C. at 312-14).
