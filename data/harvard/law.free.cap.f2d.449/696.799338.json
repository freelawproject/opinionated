Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1941); United States v. Halperin, 5th Cir. 1971, 441 F.2d 612; United States v. Robertson, 2d Cir. 1962, 298 F.2d 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-25\">In his brief defendant\u2019s counsel has forcefully and effectively pointed out inconsistencies in the testimony of some of the government\u2019s witnesses and other evidence which would tend to throw some doubt on their credibility. These arguments should have been, and were, presented to the jury in counsel\u2019s closing statement. They have little merit under the test set out above. After considering the entire record with a view most favorable to the government, we find sufficient evidence to establish all elements of the crime beyond any reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-26\">Defendant also contends that the trial court should not have admitted cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>examination on and evidence of a law suit between defendant and an insurance company which tended to indicate that defendant had defrauded the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Upon cross-examination of the defendant, the following colloquy took place between defendant and counsel for the government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">Q Have you ever been arrested lately?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">A I have never been arrested in my life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">Q How about making insurance claims as to the loss of a welding machine that you reported stolen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">MR. KAPLAN:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-9\">Your Honor, I let counsel go a long way. I fail to see any relevancy to this line of questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-12\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-13\">Objection overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-14\">THE WITNESS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-15\">Ask me the question again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-16\">BY MR. PERKINS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-17\">Q Have you ever filed any insurance claim as to the theft of a welding machine reported by you to be stolen ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-18\">A That\u2019s right. Mr. Kaplan handled it for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-19\">Q You filed that claim through James D. Smith, an insurance representative?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-20\">A I don\u2019t know who filed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-21\">Q That welding machine belonged to Mr. Hutchinson ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-22\">A If it belonged to Mr. Hutchinson I couldn\u2019t file a claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-23\">Q It belonged to Mr. George Hutchinson when you first got it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-24\">A I got a lot of things from him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-25\">Q That is the welding machine you filed an insurance claim on as being stolen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-26\">A I don\u2019t know. I said Mr. Kaplan handled the whole thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-27\">Q Did you get paid some money for that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-28\">A I think it was prorated. I did get some and I owed him some.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-29\">Q You got a little money out of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-30\">A I got a little bit, yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-31\">Q Didn\u2019t you go out to the Pelican Yard with Halverson and tell Hal-verson to drive it over in Texas ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-32\">A No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-33\">Q You deny giving Halverson your automobile to drive that machine over to Texas and filed a theft claim and collected on it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-34\">A I certainly did not do any such thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-35\">Q Didn\u2019t Mr. Hutchinson accuse you of stealing it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-36\">A. Not that I know of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-37\">Appendix pp. 198-99. The government later recalled its witness Howard Halver-son, who testified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-38\">Q I refer you to a welding machine and ask you do you recall an instance where the defendant asked you to do something with the welding machine and what did he ask you to do with the welding machine ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-39\">MR. KAPLAN:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-40\">Your Honor, this has no bearing on this case. There is testimony to the effect that there was a civil law suit and it was settled and it has no bearing on the theft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-41\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-42\">I don\u2019t know until he gives an answer. It is something the defendant said to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-43\">THE WITNESS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-44\">Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-45\">BY MR. PERKINS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-46\">Q Where did he tell you to take it ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-47\">A It was on the trip back he told me to leave a space on the truck because he had it sold in Texas and for me to leave a space on the back of my truck for the machine on my trip back from Yazoo, Mississippi. He drew a seven foot space <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>on the truck and he said, \u201cI have a welding machine sold and I want to take it to Texas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-4\">Q Where did you pick up the machine ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">A At Caddo Machinery Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">Q How was that done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">A We towed it out to Pelican Trucking Place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">Q How was it towed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-9\">A Behind an old Chevrolet Station Wagon Mr. Davenport had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-10\">Q What happened at Pelican?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-11\">A He had Pelican\u2019s men load it with a gin truck on the float in this space.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-12\">Q Where did you take it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-13\">A To Donna, Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-14\">Q Is that the machine he reported stolen ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-15\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-16\">Q That is what he got some money on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-17\">A As far as I know, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-18\">Q What did Mr. George Hutchinson have to do with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-19\">A He got the machine from Mr. Hutchinson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-20\">MR. PERKINS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-21\">That\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-22\">MR. KAPLAN:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-23\">If it please the Court, I ask the jury to be instructed to disregard this entire line of testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-24\">MR. PERKINS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-25\">It is prior similar instances of conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-26\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-27\">You raised the question. You raised it on good conduct in your evidence. It is up to the jury to decide what they believe. He is not charged in this case with defrauding an insurance company. The jury may give whatever weight they may see fit to this testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-32\">Defendant contends that his cross-examination was improper because the circumstances surrounding the civil suit were irrelevant to the issue of defendant\u2019s guilt and tended to prejudice the jury against him. The rebuttal evidence of Halverson was, therefore, likewise irrelevant and even more prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-33\">The government argues that the questions asked on cross-examination were admissible as tending to show defendant\u2019s lack of credibility and to rebut evidence of defendant\u2019s good character. The rebuttal testimony of Halverson was likewise admissible to impeach the credibility of defendant\u2019s previous testimony concerning the circumstances surrounding the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-34\"> The only type of evidence admissible to show defendant\u2019s character is proof of his reputation in the community. Steinberg v. United States, 5th Cir. 1947, 162 F.2d 120. Specific acts of misconduct cannot be shown. Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948); French v. United States, 5th Cir. 1956, 232 F.2d 736. If the defendant offers evidence of his reputation for good character, the government may rebut by evidence that his reputation is bad. Michelson v. United States, <em>supra. </em>This evidence, however, is limited to testimony concerning reputation only. Proof of specific acts of misconduct is still not admissible. Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 5th Cir. 1965, 351 F.2d 702; United States v. Beno, 2d Cir. 1963, 324 F.2d 582; McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 158, at 337 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-35\">The questions and evidence in issue cannot, therefore, be allowed to rebut defendant\u2019s good character evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-36\"> Although there is some controversy on this point,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in this Circuit a witness may not be impeached by inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>about specific acts of misconduct not resulting in a conviction. Hudson v. United States, 5th Cir. 1967, 387 F.2d 331; Leary v. United States, 5th Cir. 1967, 383 F.2d 851; Roberson v. United States, 5th Cir. 1957, 249 F.2d 737. A defendant who elects to take the stand in his own defense is subject to cross-examination and rebuttal to the same extent as any other witness. United States v. Dillon, 5th Cir. 1971, 436 F.2d 1093; Sharp v. United States, 5th Cir. 1969, 410 F.2d 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">The questions concerning the civil suit and the alleged insurance fraud were, therefore, improper. Such evidence could admittedly have no bearing on defendant\u2019s guilt and was inadmissible for impeachment purposes under this Circuit\u2019s rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The government earnestly contends that the defendant waived any objection to the cross-examination by failing to contend that the questions were prejudicial. Defendant\u2019s attorney did, however, object on grounds of relevancy \u2014the only grounds open to him at the time of the original question. The question in this regard and defendant\u2019s denial in response did prove to be quite prejudicial when Halverson was later called to testify as to the alleged insurance fraud.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *****8 We have no doubt that such evidence of past criminal conduct closely akin to the conduct for which defendant was being tried in the instant case, inquiry into which was opened by the government\u2019s previous cross-examination of defendant, was highly prejudicial to the defendant. Assuming that the word \u201cprejudice\u201d was required in defendant\u2019s objection, we can see no waiver from defendant\u2019s failure to object at a time when no prejudice had become apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">The judgment of conviction will, therefore, be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-28\">. <em>Compare </em>cases cited in Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 <em>410, at 190-91 </em>(1969) <em>with </em>McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 42 (1954) <em>and </em>3 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 983 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b758-6\">. Even in those jurisdictions allowing inquiry into prior specific acts of misconduct to impeach credibility, such inquiry is limited to the cross-examination itself. Thus if a witness, or the defendant, denies the alleged misconduct, the examiner may not call other witnesses to prove the discrediting acts except where a judgment of conviction can be shown. Simon v. United States, 4th Cir. 1941, 123 F.2d 80; Pullman Co. v. Hall, 4th Cir. 1932, 55 F. 2d 139; United States v. Sager, 2d Cir. 1931, 49 F.2d 725; Coulston v. United States, 10th Cir. 1931, 51 F.2d 178; McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 42 (1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
