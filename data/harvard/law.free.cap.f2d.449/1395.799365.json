The article includes a switch which is selectively operative to provide the 4-way flashing action, an indicator light, a capacitor connected across the switch terminal, and a fuse in series circuit with the switch. These elements are disposed in a housing which is adapted for mounting on the dashboard. The indicator light is made up of a red jeweled lens on the housing cooperating with a lamp bulb in a socket disposed within the housing. The socket of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>indicator light is so wired that, when the 4-way switch is on, the light flashes simultaneously with the front and back signal lamps. When the 4-way switch is off, the indicator light is in circuit through the brake light switch of the automobile so as to indicate when that switch is closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-5\">The Customs Court rejected the importer\u2019s claim that the merchandise is \u201cmore than\u201d a switch. The Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-6\">It is apparent from the record that [the merchandise] was designed to function primarily as a switch. Indeed, [it] is even described as a \u201cFlasher switch\u201d on the installation and operation instruction card which accompanied it. * * * The fact that [it] monitors the brake light switch and has other features and functions is, in the court\u2019s opinion, merely incidental to the primary function of the electrical switch. It is, therefore, not more than a switch.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-8\">We disagree with the court that the function of the indicator light, in particular the function of monitoring the operation of the brake light switch, is merely incidental to the switching function of the merchandise. The indicating light structure and its circuitry take no part in the switching function. These elements were specifically designed to add additional functions to the merchandise which are significantly different from the switching function. Thus, the merchandise is more than an apparatus for making or breaking electrical circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-9\">The Customs Court also held that the merchandise is not per <em>se </em>signalling apparatus, and we agree, albeit for different reasons. The court based its conclusion on the premise that the indicating light itself is not a signalling apparatus, because it is not used by one person to communicate with or signal to another. We find the court\u2019s definition of signal-ling apparatus to be unduly restrictive. It would exclude articles such as traffic signals, automatic fire alarms, and other warning devices which are commonly thought of as signalling apparatus even though they are not used by one <em>person </em>to communicate with or signal to another.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court cited S. Hiller &amp; Co. v. United States,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but neither that case nor the definitions of \u201csignal\u201d quoted therein supports the restricted meaning attributed below to the word \u201csignalling.\u201d Thus the <em>Hiller </em>court cited the following definitions from Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition, 1958:</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-11\">signal, n. ... A sign made to give notice of something, as of a command or danger; as a signal to fire ....</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-12\">signal, v. 1. To communicate by signals; ... 2. To notify by a signal or signals; .</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-14\">To these, appellant adds from the same authority:</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-15\">signal, n. 4b. An object placed to convey notice or warning; as, a traffic signal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-17\">The indicator light in the present article meets those definitions by notifying the driver by means of a signal of the proper operation of the 4-way flasher circuit or of the brake light switch.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1455-18\">While the indicator light is thus a sig-nalling apparatus, we are not here dealing with the indicator light by itself. In our opinion, the merchandise at bar is more than a signalling apparatus <em>per se. </em>It contains both the indicator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>light and a switch, and the switching function cannot be said to be merely incidental to the indicating function. The same considerations which make the merchandise more than a switch make it more than a signalling device <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">The merchandise at bar forms a part of the circuitry which allows simultaneous flashing of the external signal lamps of an automobile. This emergency flasher system is \u201csignalling apparatus\u201d under even the most restrictive definition. We therefore hold that the merchandise at bar is properly classifiable under item 685.70, TSUS, as parts of signalling apparatus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-5\">The judgment of the Customs Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1454-16\">. 64 Cust.Ct. 323, C.D. 3998 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1455-19\">. We note that item 685.70 itself specifies \u201cburglar and fire alarms\u201d along with \u201cother * * * signalling apparatus.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1455-21\">. 59 Cust.Ct. 79, C.D. 3082 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1455-22\">. Appellee\u2019s witness, an engineer with a manufacturer of automobile accessories, did offer the opinion that indicator lights which only \u201cindicate to one person and not to other vehicles around\u201d are not normally called visual signalling devices in the trade. We do not find his testimony at all persuasive that the term \u201csignalling apparatus\u201d has a commercial meaning contrary to the clear import of the dictionary definitions. See Passaic Worsted Co. v. United States, 17 CCPA 459, T.D. 43916 (1930).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
