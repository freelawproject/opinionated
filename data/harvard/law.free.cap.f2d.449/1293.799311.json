The claim was denied by the Hearing Examiner based on a finding that appellant was not disabled on or before August 9, 1962. The Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision was affirmed by the Secretary and a review of the decision was not sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-19\">Appellant filed his present claim in 1964 alleging an inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity because of his physical and mental ailments. The second claim was denied by the Hearing Examiner and the Secretary on the grounds (1) that no new and material evidence had been presented to warrant a reopening of the adverse determination of appellant\u2019s first claim, and (2) that appellant had not shown in his second application that he had become sufficiently disabled between the denial of his first application and March 31, 1964, when his disability insured status expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-20\">Judicial review of this matter is limited by \u00a7 205(g) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g)] to a deter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>initiation of whether the findings of the Secretary are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d.
