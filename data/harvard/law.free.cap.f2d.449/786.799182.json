He was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal is from a denial by the District Court of appellant\u2019s motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-17\">Appellant contends that the search warrant issued in this case by the United States Commissioner violated constitutional due process, was not issued upon sufficient evidence to create probable cause, and that his conviction was based on evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-18\">The District Court held an evidentiary hearing at which it fully considered appellant\u2019s contentions and denied the relief sought. An examination of the record convinces us that the District Court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
