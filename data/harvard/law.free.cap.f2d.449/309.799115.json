The trial court in a general opening statement to the jury panel outlined the usual procedure to be followed in all criminal cases to be tried during the week. The panel was told that the Government\u2019s case in each instance is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>presented first and that \u201cWhen the Government has completed its case, it then becomes the defendant's turn and the defendant calls his witnesses and when he has examined his witnesses, the Government will thereupon cross-examine his witnesses.\u201d The trial judge was careful to point out that a defendant is not obliged to take the stand, that his failure to do so should not prejudice the jury against him, that the burden is on the Government to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and \u201cuntil the Government has done that, the defendant doesn\u2019t have to prove anything.\u201d Later, defense counsel, in his opening statement to the jury, reiterated in essence the court\u2019s instructions on the Government\u2019s burden, in the following language: \u201cThere is not any obligation under our law for a defendant who is accused of a crime to bring any evidence to you, to take the stand and testify in his own defense or to do anything other than to come to court. The burden remains on the Government to prove his guilt, and he doesn\u2019t have to prove anything. Under the law, if the Government doesn\u2019t carry their burden, he must go free.\u201d He then added, moreover, \u201cIn this case, we will bring you evidence, because we think it\u2019s important that you see both sides of the coin, hear both sides of the story.\u201d Appellant's contention that the court\u2019s comments were prejudicial is patently devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Appellant further contends that his right to remain mute was violated by a comment of the trial court during the trial. The court refused to allow certain testimony, offered for the purpose of impeaching a Government witness, relating to what a defense witness heard defendant say in a telephone conversation allegedly between the defendant and the Government witness. The testifying witness admitted that he did not know to whom appellant was talking and that he overheard only appellant\u2019s end of the conversation. The Government objected to the testimony and the court sustained the objection, remarking that the evidence could properly be admitted by putting defendant on the stand. No objection was made to the suggestion. To the contrary, defense counsel immediately said that that was what he intended to do. Defendant did in fact testify. We also note that defendant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal n. o. v. and for a new trial are silent as to any allegation or self-incrimination. Where there are no objections at the trial level, only plain error will be noted on appeal, Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P., and the rule is to be invoked only in exceptional circumstances to avoid a miscarriage of justice. Sykes v. United States, 5 Cir., 1966, 373 F.2d 607; Eaton v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 398 F.2d 485; Rivers v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 400 F.2d 935. Under the circumstances of the instant case, the application of the plain error rule is clearly not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Our decision in Davis v. United States, 5 Cir., 1966, 357 F.2d 438, relied on by appellant in contending that his privilege against self-incrimination was violated, is factually distinguishable. The trial judge in <em>Davis </em>was persistent in his admonitions to defense counsel to discontinue, by cross-examination of Government witnesses, an attempt to introduce evidence which the court considered to be outside of the record. On at least four occasions the court told counsel to introduce the evidence by placing his own witnesses on the stand. Appellants in <em>Davis </em>did not take the witness stand. In reversing the convictions, we found that the effect of the trial judge\u2019s comments was to invite the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that appellants had not taken and did not take the stand. We were careful to point out, however, in <em>Davis </em>that \u201cThe facts and circumstances of each ease must be carefully analyzed to determine \u2018whether the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\u2019 \u201d 357 F.2d at 441. Under the facts of the instant case we find no prejudice to defendant by the trial court\u2019s remark. Cf. Jordan v. United States, 5 Cir., 1963, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>324 F.2d 178; Garcia v. United States, 5 Cir., 1963, 315 F.2d 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Appellant further charges as error that the court improperly instructed the jury on the issues of defendant\u2019s good character and of the weight to be given an informer\u2019s testimony. We have carefully examined the charge in this respect and find no error. Nor do we feel, as appellant contends, that the trial judge abused his discretion in allowing Government counsel to substantiate the credibility of one of its witnesses through testimony of other witnesses, especially when it appears from the record that the issue was first raised by appellant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">A jury verdict is not to be overturned unless, taking the view most favorable to the Government, there is an absence of substantial evidence to support it. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); Moorman v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 389 F.2d 27; Weaver v. United States, 5 Cir., 1967, 374 F.2d 878. There was abundant evidence upon which the jury could have based their verdict of guilt, and we perceive no error by the court which requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
