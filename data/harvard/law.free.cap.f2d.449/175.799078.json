These convictions were affirmed by the Missouri Supreme Court in State v. Matha, 446 S.W.2d 829 (Mo.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-27\"> Matha\u2019s counsel raises two issues: 1) that the state court erred in admitting evidence tending to show that the defendant had participated in another burglary which occurred shortly before the burglary for which Matha was convicted; and 2) that the identification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>procedures of the line-up in which Ma-tha appeared following his arrest violated due process. Judge Harper determined both contentions to be devoid of merit. He observed that the admission of the testimony pertaining to petitioner\u2019s commission of the earlier burglary presented no constitutional overtones, and therefore was not cognizable by a federal court through habeas corpus proceedings. Judge Harper also found that the record failed to demonstrate that the line-up procedures violated the petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">We agree with Judge Harper\u2019s rulings on these issues and affirm for the reasons stated in his unreported opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-13\">. Petitioner lias filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he charges that he has had inadequate assistance of counsel since none of his attorneys have raised a double jeopardy defense. Petitioner\u2019s double jeopardy contention rests on the fact that he was retried for his offenses after the jury failed to reach a verdict at his first trial. This contention lacks merit. In 1824, the Supreme Court determined in United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 22 U.S. 579, 6 L.Ed. 165, that a mistrial caused by a jury\u2019s inability to agree did not place a second trial under the ban of the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Court has consistently reaffirmed the validity of the <em>Peres </em>decision. <em>E. g., </em>Downum v. United States, 372 U.S. 734, 735-36, 83 S.Ct. 1033, 10 L.Ed.2d 100 (1963) ; Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 188, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957) ; <em>see </em>Houp v. State, 427 F.2d 254 (8th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
