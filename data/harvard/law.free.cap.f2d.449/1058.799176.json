After determining that the Company\u2019s plant in Elwood, Indiana was an appropriate unit for collective bargaining purposes, the Board conducted an election in 1964; the Union won the election; in 1965, after administrative processes including a full hearing, the Board certified the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for most of the plant\u2019s employees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Company declined to bargain with the Union in order to obtain a judicial test of the validity of the Board\u2019s certification,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which the Company still con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>tended was erroneous because the Union had engaged in activity that rendered the holding of a fair election impossible. In 1970, the Board found that the Company\u2019s refusal to bargain violated \u00a7\u00a7 8 (a) (1) &amp; (5) of the National Labor Relations Act;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Board ordered the Company to bargain with the Union on request.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">In No. 24,577, the Union petitioned for review of that part of the Board\u2019s order which denied special compensation for employees\u2019 losses for the period during which the Company refused to bargain with the Union after it had been certified. On March 19, 1971, we entered an order granting the Union\u2019s motion for summary reversal of the Board\u2019s denial of special relief to the extent of ordering a remand.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We will revert to that order subsequently. In No. 24,715, the Company petitioned for review of the order to bargain, and the Board cross-applied for enforcement of its order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">I. <em>No. 2b,715 </em>\u2014 The <em>Order To Bargain</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">The disposition of this case turns on the validity of the Board\u2019s certification of the Union as collective bargaining representative for the Company\u2019s Elwood plant, and on the propriety of enforcing the employer\u2019s obligation to bargain despite the long delay between the initial refusal to bargain and the Board\u2019s decision. We uphold the certification and the Board\u2019s decision that the Company violated the Act, and we enforce the Board\u2019s order directing the Company to bargain with the Union on request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-18\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-19\"> The Company\u2019s primary claim is that a newsletter mailed to the employees by the Union\u2019s International Representative on October 19, 1964, three days before the election, contained substantial misrepresentations which undermined the fairness of the election, and hence the propriety of the Board\u2019s certification of the Union on the basis of the election. In balancing \u201cthe right of the employees to an untrammeled choice, and the right of the parties to wage a free and vigorous campaign,\u201d the Board sets aside an election only if a misrepresentation \u201cinvolves a substantial departure from the truth, at a time which prevents the other party or parties from making an effective reply, so that the misrepresentation, whether deliberate or not, may reasonably be expected to have a substantial impact on the election;\u201d in addition, the Board will consider whether \u201cthe party making the statement possesses intimate knowledge of the subject matter,\u201d and whether the employees themselves \u201cpossessed independent knowledge with which to evaluate the statements.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Hearing Officer, whose decision was affirmed by the Board, concluded that there was no such substantial misrepresentation about material facts and that insofar as there were questionable statements, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>were within the rule of <em>Hollywood Ceramics, supra </em>note 7, that the permissible latitude of election campaigning does not require absolute precision in statements, and that ambiguous or inarticulate messages which may be subject to different interpretation, \u201clike extravagant promises, derogatory statements about the other party, and minor distortions of some facts\u201d such as \u201cfrequently occur in communication between persons,\u201d do not constitute the kind of misrepresentation that leads the Board to set aside an election.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude that insofar as this determination rests on a factual predicate there is support in substantial evidence, and insofar as it represents a determination as to the order that is appropriate in the light of this factual predicate there is no showing of abuse of the Board\u2019s discretion in determining whether to certify the representative chosen in the election.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">1. Our ultimate conclusion is that we affirm the Board\u2019s determination that the statements in the newsletter to which the Company takes exception are not the kind of substantial, material misrepresentation which invalidates an election. The newsletter is slanted rather than spurious or fraudulent, and for the most part there is some basis in fact for the statements made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">2. The newsletter said the Company discontinued cost of living wage increases and manipulated the annual improvement factor (AIF) for wage increases. The Company concededly did discontinue a separate review of cost of living allowance, and while it says to the court that these were not terminated but were rather integrated as part of a larger perspective for annual wage review, there is at least a legitimate question whether this change may not have smothered the quality and extent of the cost of living adjustment. The ultimate point is that the Union is stressing that there are shortcomings in the Company\u2019s handling of these matters, and that it can do better for the workers. This is the very stuff of electioneering, and hyperbole is tolerated unless wholly spurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-10\">3. As to the newsletter\u2019s claim that as a result of Ex-Cell-O\u2019s unilateral changes its workers suffered a loss of 14 cents per hour, the arithmetic does show \u2014 as Company counsel conceded\u2014 that the average annual amount of increase was 6-8 cents per hour during 1956-1959, whereas the data for later years show in years of: 1960: nil; 1961: 4 cents; 1962: 4-6 cents; 1963: 5-7 cents; 1964: 5 cents. Again there is a basis in fact for an assertion of a cumulative 14 cent discrepancy. And this 'cannot be condemned as the kind of fraudulent misrepresentation that vitiates an election, even though the Company has some explanations and qualifications that might well be more impressive to someone conducting an auditing function.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>4. The newsletter asks the question whether it is the Company\u2019s plan to replace women with men in the performance of certain tasks. The same question was posed two months earlier in a newsletter that pointed out that men on layoff had been recalled, while over 40 female employees on the seniority list had not been recalled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">So far as assertions are concerned, the newsletter says that some of the jobs filled by new male hires were formerly performed by women. The Board found a basis in fact, sufficient to avoid a misrepresentation so substantial as to undercut the election, in the fact that all hires for September 1963-Oetober 22, 1964, were males, that one of these men was hired as a floor inspector, and that in the past at least some duties of a floor inspector had been performed by a woman.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are satisfied that the evidence in support of the factual predicate (see note 10) is sufficient to avoid any conclusion that the Board\u2019s order is invalid in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-9\">While the Company has explanations as to why it changed its processes so that some vapor blast and belt-packing jobs formerly handled by women came to be performed by men, it was not improper for the Board to conclude that the Union was within legitimate campaigning in stressing the result \u2014 that women were not rehired \u2014 without pursuing the detailed explanations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>5. We further note that while the Company\u2019s time to reply to the newsletter might not have been sufficient if there had been gross and fraudulent misrepresentations, in the absence of such material the Board was within its discretion in taking into account that the Union had two months earlier identified the broad issues it intended to pursue, and that the Company had ample time to develop the factual data concerning its programs and policies for presentation to the employees. And the Company did have more than one full day after it became aware of the newsletter to prepare last minute material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">6. We are not to be taken as supporting each and every statement in the Union newsletter. We merely say the Board was well within its discretion in concluding that the newsletter was not the kind of outright, material misrepresentation which warrants overturning an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">A major contention of the Company relates to the exclusion of evidence proffered that particular employees cast their ballots under the influence of newsletter representations. We agree with the Board that the inquiries as to whether union (or employer) conduct vitiates an election are properly conducted on an objective standard, without probing the mental processes and understandings of the voters, except perhaps in special circumstances such as where employees have been subjected to physical force or threats of force.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-12\">Finally, the Company contends that a bargaining order is not appropriate when the Union involved was selected in an election held almost six years before, and there has been a substantial turnover in employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-13\">The time delay is unusual and vexing \u2014reflecting principally three years in which the Board considered the Union\u2019s request for additional relief. In hindsight, the Board should have promptly ordered the bargaining as at least partial relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-14\">However, the critical fact is not the time delay, but the turnover.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As to the propriety of a bargaining order in the face of employee turnover, the authorities establish that all the courses available entail substantial disadvantages, and the Board\u2019s order lies within the zone of its discretion, with the employees able to avoid any continuing prejudice through the subsequent filing of a de-certification petition.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-15\">II. <em>No. 2k,577 </em>\u2014 Affirmative <em>Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-16\">In this case, the Union petitioned for review of the Board\u2019s decision not to grant special compensatory benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>as a \u201cmake-whole\u201d remedy for the period when the Company refused to bargain with the Union after it was certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">Previously, in <em>Tiidee </em>Products-I,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> this court held that when the Company\u2019s objections to the election were patently frivolous and its refusal to bargain with the Union when certified was a clear and flagrant violation of law, the Board had authority to grant affirmative relief in addition to a cease and desist order and was required, in consequence of the mandate of \u00a7 10(c) that the Board take such affirmative action as will effectuate the policies of the Act, to explain on what basis it justified the issuance of a cease and desist order without \u201cmake-whole\u201d or other affirmative relief as a permissible exercise of its remedial function.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">On March 19, 1971, we granted the Union\u2019s motion for summary reversal in the case at bar,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> concluding that the Board's order denying relief was in conflict with <em>Tiidee Products-I, </em>for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">(1) The Board, explicitly refusing to adhere to <em>Tiidee Products-I, </em>erroneously concluded that it had no statutory authority to award \u201cmake-whole\u201d compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">(2) This court took account of the rule that denial of affirmative relief is appropriate where there is a debatable question. United Steelworkers v. NLRB <em>[Quality Rubber Mfg. Co.], </em>139 U.S.App. D.C. 146, 148-149, 430 F.2d 519, 521-522 (1970). And we were aware that the Board indicated as an alternative ruling that Ex-Cell-O\u2019s violation was not flagrant. However, as we analyzed the Board\u2019s decision under review, this ruling was apparently based on the assumption that an employer seeking judicial review of an election could never be charged with a flagrant violation, in the absence of a discriminatory discharge or disregard of employees\u2019 rights other than failure to bargain with their representative. Neither the Board\u2019s Decision and Order nor the Trial Examiner\u2019s Initial Decision contained any analysis of the objections of the Company to the Union\u2019s certification. The Board stated that it could not undertake an inquiry into the issue whether the Company\u2019s objections to the election were frivolous or debatable. We disagreed and held that under <em>Tiidee Products-I </em>the Board had discretion to grant supplementary relief if the Company\u2019s objections to the election and certification were frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-11\">When we were considering the motion for summary reversal and remand of this case, the Board had presented a motion for temporary relief requiring bargaining <em>pendente lite, </em>but the record of the certification proceedings had not been filed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> At that stage we deemed it appropriate that the Board, which had already considered and rejected the Company\u2019s objections to the Union\u2019s certification, determine whether those objections were of a frivolous or debatable nature. We therefore remanded for further proceedings, including determinations whether Ex-Cell-O\u2019s objections to the certification were frivolous or fairly debatable, and whether \u201cmake-whole\u201d compensation or some other affirmative remedy is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-12\">With our arranging for expedition of consideration of the appeal by this court, the sequence of events has brought before us at an early juncture the full record of both the certification and unfair labor practice proceedings. From our study of the certification record it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>now plain that the Company\u2019s objections to the certification fall in the \u201cfairly debatable\u201d rather than the \u201cfrivolous\u201d or \u201cbad faith\u201d category. Even \u201ctalcing into account the limited ability of a court to assume as a judicial function * * * the distinctive discretion assigned to the agency,\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we think it manifest that any proceedings by the Board on remand would result in a denial of affirmative relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">Accordingly, while the majority of this court believes the Board erred in its analysis of the applicable legal rules, it would be a futile act to insist on a remand which could not meaningfully change the result. In this case the Board\u2019s legal error resulted in no prejudice to the Union. Braniff Airways, Inc. v. CAB, 126 U.S.App.D.C. 399, 411-412, 379 F.2d 453, 465-466 (1967). While we adhere to the principles set forth in our March 19, 1971 opinion, we conclude that these principles, as applied to the record in this case, \u00bfrequire vacating the March 19, 1971 order of remand. That order is vacated and the decision of the Board denying affirmative compensation is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">III. <em>Delay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">One final note. In <em>Tiidee-I </em>a majority of this court was particularly concerned with the need for an effective remedy, at least in the ease of an employer who fails to bargain notwithstanding an election and certification. That opinion stressed the need for a procedure and approach to remedy that obviated success for the frivolous objector, \u2014 the kind of consideration invoked by the Supreme Court in California Department of Human Resources Development v. Java, 402 U.S. 121, 91 S.Ct. 1347, 28 L.Ed.2d 666 (1971). The question of how and to what extent the principles of <em>Tiidee </em>may be implemented is under consideration by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-12\">But without regard to <em>Tiidee, </em>all members of this court agree that expedition in Board determinations is desirable, especially in regard to elections. The decision to hold an election is not immediately reviewable at the instance of the employer, and while withholding of review at this stage may have some disadvantages its wisdom is attested by the consideration that in a substantial number of cases the Union loses the election, thus mooting any employer need for review. But it would be appropriate for the Board to review its procedures for those cases when the Union wins the election and the Company does not acquiesce, toward the objective of moving with expedition to identify those cases that raise no substantial problem and to enter a bargaining order, even in advance of its decision on other matters that may require further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-13\">\u2022X* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-14\">The petitions for review filed by the Union (No. 24,577) and the Company (No. 24,715) are denied. The Board\u2019s cross-application for enforcement of its order in No. 24,715 is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-15\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1117-12\">. On August 11, 1964, the Union filed a petition under \u00a7 9 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159 (1964), for designation as the exclusive bargaining representative of the Company\u2019s production and maintenance employees at its Elwood, Indiana plant. After a hearing, the Board\u2019s Regional Director issued an order on September 30, 1964, directing that an election be held at the plant under the Board\u2019s supervision on October 22, 1964. The Union won, 102 to 93, with one ballot challenged. On October 29, 1964, the Company protested the election, alleging that, the Union had mailed to the employees a letter containing material misrepresentations of fact, so timed as to deny the Company an opportunity to reply effectively. The Company\u2019s objections were overruled by the Regional Director on December 29, 1964. On April 23, 1965, the Board granted the Company\u2019s request for review of that decision and directed a hearing, which was held in May, 1965. On July 15, 1965, the Hearing Officer entered a report recommending that the Company\u2019s objections be overruled. After consideration of the Company\u2019s exceptions, the Board affirmed the Hearing-Officer and certified the Union on October 18, 1965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1117-18\">. Since there is no judicial review of certification proceedings as such, Ex-Cell-0 had to refuse to bargain, be charged with violating the Act, and eventually, be ordered to cease and desist from the violation and to bargain with the Union.

In a sense, all these determinations are inter-related. Thus the relative lack of intimate knowledge by the Union of the subject matter is inter-related with the conclusion that to the extent that the Union has deviated from the facts as they might be found by an impartial tribunal, the deviation falls within the zone of tolerable electioneering.

Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 shows that Juanita Powers was a female operator-inspector assigned to the supervision of the floor inspection supervisor sometime in 1960. That supervisor, Victor Whitenaek, testified that this assignment lasted about nine months. I am unable to comprehend why an employee with the job classification of operator inspector who works full time on the floor inspection operation under the supervision of the floor inspection supervisor doing work which that supervisor admits is not the final inspection of <em>finished </em>blades done in the final inspection operation but the inspection of <em>unfinished </em>blades out on the floor close by the machines performing the separate steps of the manufacturing process, is not a floor inspector. She is not a final inspector, because she is not inspecting finished blades. And the classification of \u201coperator inspector\u201d does not remove her from the floor inspector job area absent some showing, not made here, that other inspectors are not similarly classified as operator-inspectors.

The result was close. A switch of five votes would have changed the result. At the time of the 1964 election there were 208 employees in the bargaining unit whereas in 1970 when the Board issued its decision there were 530 employees in the unit of whom only 134 had been eligible to vote in the 1964 election. That election thus related to personnel that are no longer present and to outdated issues and a controlling majority of new employees who had no opportunity to vote will be be affected by the stale vote of a small minority. Because of the delay of the case in reaching us and the prejudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>consequences referred to, my first preference would be to order a new election.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, since my colleagues do not agree, I come to consider the company\u2019s challenge to the election. It is my view that the electioneering by the union was very close to the borderline of being prejudicial in a material degree. Some of the statements by the union were tricky distortions and overstatements of the truth and were aimed at the ignorance and gullibility of the workers and their natural desire for higher wages but they were not complete misrepresentations. The impropriety of the charges was also compounded by the timing of their release \u2014 the day before the election. I do not agree that the company had sufficient time to answer the charge and to properly disseminate their answer. However the contents of the release related to an issue which was not completely new to the pre-election campaign. Thus while I consider it particularly unworthy for one seeking to represent workers in a fiduciary capacity to indulge in such questionable tactics to secure their acquiescence, I cannot say there was not some basis in fact for the Board\u2019s determination that the statements were not such a substantial departure from the truth, or that they did not have such a substantial impact on the election, as to justify setting it aside. With these qualifications I concur in Part I of the opinion and in the result announced in Part II. I also concur in the suggestion that the extraordinarily long delay which preceded the Board\u2019s disposition of this case should call for some review by the Board of the procedures which caused it in an attempt to determine whether the consequences of delay which are here present might be alleviated in the future.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">. <em>See </em>Clark\u2019s Gamble Corporation v.
