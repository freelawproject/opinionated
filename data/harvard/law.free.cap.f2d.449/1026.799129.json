ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">The sole issue on this appeal, from convictions of robbery<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and simple assault,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is whether a near-the-scene identification confrontation between a suspect without a lawyer and the victim, within an hour to an hour and a half after commission of the offenses,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> violated the suspect\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or his Fifth Amendment right to due process of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The District Judge, after a hearing, held that no such violation was established, and permitted an in-court identification of the suspect, our appellant, and testimony as to the out-of-court identification at the trial. After careful study of the problem \u2014 one residing in a difficult and gray area of the law \u2014 we reach the same conclusion, and accordingly affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-18\">The offenses in suit occurred on a Sunday morning between 11:30 o\u2019clock and 12:00 noon as William Cook was returning home from a grocery store.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Two men approached him from behind; one man put his arm around Cook\u2019s neck, and the other came around in front to face him with a knife. The first, whom Cook later identified as appellant,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> then threw Cook to the ground and the other rifled his pockets, removing approximately three dollars. At this point, a car stopped nearby and an occupant inquired as to whether a robbery was in progress, whereupon the two men fled. Cook then returned home and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-19\">In reporting the robbery, Cook gave full descriptions of both men, including such details as ages, heights, weights and the fact that one wore a blue zippered waist-length jacket and blue trousers. The descriptions were flashed over the police radio network, and about 12:20 p. m. were noted by Officer Willie L. Polk while on duty in the robbery area. Officer Polk recalled that earlier that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>day he had seen a man \u2014 appellant, as it turned out \u2014 matching one of the descriptions. The officer then began a cruise of the area, and shortly thereafter spotted appellant and another man fitting the other description standing among a group only a half-block from the robbery scene. Appellant was wearing a blue jacket and blue trousers, and his physical features approximate those of the man described in the broadcast as having been so attired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">Officer Polk took the two men into custody <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> about 12:45 p. m. and immediately transported them to Cook\u2019s house, a distance of about four blocks. Cook was asked to look at the men, the officer stating that they matched the descriptions Cook had given; aside from this statement, there was no suggestion to Cook that the police suspected either man. Cook came outside, viewed both men, and identified appellant as one of the robbers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It was then about 1:00 p. m., no lawyer was present, and the record is fuzzy as to the extent to which appellant may have been advised of a right to counsel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A4k\">It is this confrontation that appellant attacks and, since it occurred after the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Wade-Gilbert-Stovall </em>pronouncements,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the principles delineated in those decisions were fully operative.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Upon a defense motion to suppress, the District Judge conducted a hearing, at which Cook and Officer Polk both testified, and thereafter rejected appellant\u2019s <em>Wade-Gilbert </em>and <em>Stovall </em>approaches.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This ruling opened the door to Cook\u2019s in-trial identification of appellant as one of the robbers, and testimony by Cook and Officer Polk as to the identification at Cook\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-15\">Appellant\u2019s defense rested on his testimony that, while walking along the street, he came upon Cook arising from the ground, a bag of groceries lying nearby. Cook, appellant testified, then said \u201c[y]ou are the one\u201d and admonished appellant to \u201cwait until I get back.\u201d Appellant testified further that he continued to walk on for another half-block to a corner where he stayed until he was arrested, and denied any connection whatever with the robbery. As we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>mentioned, however, the jury thought otherwise and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">The <em>Wade-Gilbert-Stovall </em>trilogy articulated constitutional standards governing identification procedures by which the criminally suspect may become the criminally accused. <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>established the suspect\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel at an identification confrontation;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Stovall </em>established his right to freedom from a confrontation \u201cso unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification\u201d as to amount to a deprivation of Fifth Amendment due process of law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nonsatisfaction of these standards bars implicated witnesses from subsequent in-court identifications not flowing from independent sources,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and from testimonial reference to prior illegal identifications.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">As we have indicated, appellant weaves a thesis for reversal from strands of all of these constitutional doctrines. He was without the benefit of counsel, he points out, when he was identified by Cook at the latter\u2019s home; that identification, he argues, occurred under circumstances so highly suggestive of his complicity in the robbery as to impinge upon due process. Therefore, so the argument runs, Cook\u2019s in-eourt identification, and Cook\u2019s and Officer Polk\u2019s testimony as to Cook\u2019s out-of-court identification, were improperly received at his trial, with the result that his conviction cannot stand. We first take up appellant\u2019s right-to-counsel contention, and then his due process claim.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-16\">In Russell v. United States,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we sustained, against a <em>Wade-Gilbert </em>argument, an on-the-seene identification confrontation between the victim and a singly-presented suspect transpiring quite shortly after the crime. We noted that \u201cprompt on-the-scene identifications\u201d were not precisely covered by the <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>holdings,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> which involved post-indictment lineups; <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we observed that in <em>Wade </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>\u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>Court was evidently focusing primarily on the routine lineup and show-up procedure employed by the police to obtain evidence for use at trial.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cIn these typical cases,\u201d we continued, \u201cwhere counsel has been retained and time is not a factor, [the Court] could find \u2018no substantial countervailing policy considerations * * * against the requirement of the presence of counsel.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We found that in the circumstances of the case then before us \u201cthere would necessarily be a long delay in summoning appellant\u2019s counsel or a substitute counsel to observe the formal lineup; \u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u201c[s]ueh delay,\u201d we said, \u201cmay not only cause the detention of an innocent suspect ; it may also diminish the reliability of any identification obtained, thus defeating a principal purpose of the counsel requirement.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">Balancing all the doubts left by the mysteries of human perception and recognition, it appears that prompt confrontations in circumstances like those of this ease will \u201cif anything promote fairness, by assuring reliability * * This probability, together with the desirability of expeditious release of innocent suspects, presents \u201csubstantial countervailing policy considerations,\u201d which we are reluctant to assume the Supreme Court would reject. We therefore conclude, with some hesitation, that <em>Wade </em>does not require exclusion of [the appellant\u2019s] identification.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-20\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-21\">On the right-to-counsel issue, <em>Russell </em>differs essentially from the instant case only with respect to the length of the time interval between the offenses and the identification confrontation.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In <em>Russell, </em>it was a matter of about 30 minutes;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> here it was a period of an hour to an hour and \u00e1 half.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The problem at hand, then, is to determine which <em>ambit </em>\u2014 Wade\u2019s or <em>Russell\u2019s </em>\u2014 the present case falls within. The Government urges us to define the scope of the <em>Russell </em>holding in terms of a \u201creasonableness\u201d test involving the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>surrounding such a confrontation.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Appellant, on the other hand, would have us confine <em>Russell </em>within the narrowest limits of the situation there presented'\u2014 a confrontation \u201cwithin minutes\u201d after the observed offense.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">While a fixed time limit would reduce, for police and courts alike, uncertainties in <em>Russell </em>implementations,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the legal test must surely be more flexible. As <em>Russell </em>instructs, the redeeming virtue in on- or near-the-scene identifications is their freshness \u2014 as a factor promoting their reliability, and consequently their fairness.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Time is, of course, of the essence, for the trustworthiness of an eyewitness identification, dependent as it is on sharpness of memory, is apt to lessen with the passage of time.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> But the pace of memory-dimming may be reflected by other circumstances \u2014 those which may either strengthen or weaken an ensuing identification <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> \u2014 and those circumstances vary from case to case. We can no more say that every identification within any particular fixed period is assuredly reliable than we can say that every identification beyond that period is assuredly unreliable. We reject, then, a purely artificial time approach to confrontations of the type under review, and favor instead a standard which gives other factors bearing upon the fidelity of the identification their just due.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-9\"> We have recognized three distinct interests toward which prompt on- or near-the-scene identifications may wholesomely contribute. The first, and dominant, is that identifications occurring shortly after the observations made when the crime was committed possess a greater likelihood of accuracy because of their freshness, while a postponed identification could be detrimental to that end. This consideration contributed significantly to our holdings in <em>Russell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>and other similar cases,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> as it has to a number of <em>^re-Wade </em>confrontations in which a degree of suggestivity was questioned on due process grounds.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Time may warp the memory,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and there is no way of telling at what point or to what extent this disintegration takes place in particular humans.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Delay incidental to the arrangement of a formal lineup in the presence of counsel thus becomes important in assessing whether an earlier identification procedure, though without counsel, is constitutionally justified.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">Once the time factor, in the surrounding circumstances, enhances the trustworthiness of a near-the-scene identification, two other interests also come to the fore. These are the combined needs for fast and effective police action in apprehending criminals, and the avoidance of unnecessary inconvenience and embarrassment to innocent citizens incidental thereto.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> By such confrontations, a suspect not identified as the perpetrator of the crime is exonerated forthwith without being hauled to a. police facility for a lineup, and possibly without suffering an arrest. Simultaneously, the police can quickly ascertain the necessity for any further investigation and search for the real culprit. Such confrontations, then, serve also to protect the innocent, and to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>mote efficiency in the deployment of limited police resources.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">We do not, however, in summarizing the interplay of the two last-mentioned interests, intimate that apart from the freshness of an identification they are constitutional justifications for confrontations which omit the procedure prescribed by <em>Wade. </em>The foundation of our <em>Russell </em>decision was an early confrontation aiding fairness by improving the reliability of the identification; the \u201cexpeditious release of innocent suspects\u201d then became an additional reason for dispensing with the necessity for counsel upon an identification quite independently deemed reliable because it was fresh.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> We find the elements of the <em>Russell </em>foundation present in the case at bar, and thereon we rest our decision.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> It is in the process of doing so that other interests to which we have given recognition are also subserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">The one circumstance differing here from <em>Russell, </em>we repeat, is the time lapse \u2014 about 30 minutes, as against an hour to an hour and a half \u2014 between the identifying witness\u2019 initial confrontation with his assailants and the confrontation at which appellant was identified as one of them. In all other material respects the cases are alike; only the longer time interval here could upset the result which <em>Russell </em>held to be proper. In our view, that single difference is not enough to produce a different outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-10\">The truth of the matter is that we have not limited <em>Russell </em>to confrontations occurring within moments of the criminal episode. Rather, we have imparted to the time factor a modest degree of elasticity, thus accommodating the flux of ever-changing surrounding circumstances. In both <em>Wade- </em>and <em>Sto-vall-type </em>situations, we have recognized that confrontations delayed somewhat more than momentarily may still meet constitutional requirements although some amount of delay was inevitable.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In some instances, of both types, where the duration of the delay approximated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>that here, we have nonetheless found the confrontation justified.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> As we look to the events transpiring in the instant case, we find the justification satisfying.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">The assault and robbery were committed in broad daylight. The episode, by Cook\u2019s estimate, occupied a space of about two minutes. Cook was able to observe his assailants while the robbery was in progress and upon his release at its conclusion. Cook\u2019s encounter with the one later identified as appellant was not the first; just minutes before, on his way to the grocery store, Cook had seen him standing on a street corner.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Cook went home right away and reported the affair to the police. The report\u2014 made no later than about 12:00 noon\u2014 does not seem to have been unduly delayed, despite the uncertainty in the record as to exactly when it and the reported incidents respectively occurred.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Cook, very properly, took time to supply descriptions of his assailants in substantial detail.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The descriptions were disseminated by police radio, as they had to be; this must have been done promptly, since Officer Polk heard the broadcast at 12:20 p. m. Then, recalling his observation earlier that day of a man in the offense area fitting one of the descriptions \u2014 appellant, as it later turned out<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> \u2014 the officer dutifully embarked upon a search for him. Appellant and a man fitting the second description were sighted, and the officer had to radio for help and await its arrival. When, at about 1:45, the men were taken into custody, the officer faced a choice be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>tween taking them to Cook\u2019s house for a viewing or transporting them to a police facility for a lineup. The officer elected the first alternative, and followed through on it immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">We recount these unfolding events because for us they reveal a societally indispensable endeavor \u2014 -to capture two criminals at large \u2014 which from beginning to end occupied but a relatively brief time span. They reveal, too, efforts in that direction \u2014 by police and victim alike \u2014 pressed with as much diligence as can reasonably be expected, followed quickly by an effort to ascertain the accuracy of the results.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The victim\u2019s prompt report to the police set in motion an equally prompt search for his assailants, an activity continuing aggressively and without pause until two suspects were apprehended. With the chances of intercepting two robbers on foot dwindling rapidly as time passed, the need to know whether the suspects were the culprits was urgent. Delay for a formal lineup with counsel, under the circumstances here, could easily have meant that unless the search was already successful, its resumption was doomed to almost certain failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">We realize, of course, that the interest in reliable-because-fresh identifications was not assisted in this case quite as well as it was by the 30-minutes-later identification confrontation in <em>Russell. </em>Yet we cannot believe that so small a time difference \u2014 a half hour to an hour \u2014could seriously depreciate Cook\u2019s at-home identification in terms of freshness, the value of which <em>Russell </em>extolled.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> And certainly the public interest in efficient police operations with a minimum of incommodity to the citizenry<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> weighs just as heavily here as it has in other cases.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-13\">In our view, the confrontation we now scrutinize served the end that any ensuing identification might be much fresher, any innocent arrestee might be released much sooner, and any further police work might resume much faster than would have been possible if the delay incidental to arrangement of an orthodox lineup had been suffered. In this case, then, no less than in <em>Russell, </em>we are presented with \u201c \u2018substantial countervailing policy considerations\u2019 which we are reluctant to assume the Supreme Court would reject.\u201d <footnotemark>56</footnotemark> In the circumstances here, as in <em>Russell, </em>we are led to the conclusion that Cook\u2019s near-the-seene identification of appellant should stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-14\">We realize that \u201c[a]t some point the nexus of time and place between offense and identification must become too attenuated to outweigh the admitted dangers of presenting suspects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>singly to witnesses,\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> We recognize the importance of confining identification presentations \u2014 even those manageable freshly after criminal episodes\u2014 \u201cto situations in which possible doubts as to identification need[ ] to be resolved promptly.\u201d <footnotemark>58</footnotemark> We agree \u2014 and reaffirm \u2014 that such presentations must be restricted to situations where \u201cthe interest in speedy identification * * * justifies the failure to arrange a formal lineup * * * [and thus] the failure to provide the suspect with counsel.\u201d <footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Our holding is limited strictly to such situations and we caution, as we have before, that \u201cabsent such need the conventional line-up is the appropriate procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> In the case at bar, we find ample justification for the questioned confrontation in the combination of the necessity appearing, the relatively short time interval, and the potentially reliable identification. We also note that, after this case arose, the Metropolitan Police Department put into operation a regulation restricting on- and near-the-seene identification confrontations to suspects arrested within 60 minutes after the alleged offense and in close proximity to the scene.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> We see in this regulation a careful and commendable administrative effort to balance the freshness of such a confrontation against its inherent suggestiveness, and to balance both factors against the need to pick up the trail while fresh if the suspect is not the offender.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> We see no need for interposing at this time any more rigid time standard by judicial declaration. Our conclusion is fortified by the consideration that the absence of counsel, though lawful, is one of the circumstances that may be taken into account by a court, along with the ability of the witness to observe the offender in the first instance, in determining the fairness of the confrontation. The court\u2019s review of the situation must consider whether there was a sufficient likelihood that the witness was making an identification that was his own, rather than one thrust upon him, and that in turn requires a consideration of the likelihood that the witness was capable of making an accurate identification, or whether the identification was inherently unreliable.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-14\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-15\">There remains only appellant\u2019s contention that the District Judge erred in ruling that the confrontation at Cook\u2019s house did not impinge on due process. We think, however, that the ruling must be sustained. While we have no doubt that some suggestiveness unavoidably inheres in every showup<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> the factors already discussed<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> countervail to insulate the confrontation against the ignominy of a constitutional viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> And by a process of balancing the competing considerations, we have consistently held that \u201cabsent special elements of unfairness,\u201d <footnotemark>67</footnotemark> a showup close in time and place to the crime does not encroach on due process.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">We find nothing in the circumstances to remove the case at bar from the purview of our previous holdings on this score. Both Cook and Officer Polk testified that no suggestion was made to Cook that appellant was believed to be one of the two robbers, but only that Cook was asked to view two men because they seemed to fit the descriptions Cook had furnished the police. It is doubtful, too, that the suggestivity inherent in the situation went beyond that present in other showups since Cook demonstrated a power of discrimination by identifying only one of the two men.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Moreover, the District Judge heard the witnesses, weighed the testimony, and by a fully correct application of the governing legal principles concluded that the test of a due process violation was not met. Giving the judge\u2019s conclusion the deference<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> due on a record providing ample support, we find no error in his due process ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">The judgment of conviction appealed from is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1086-8\">.

The proposition that reliability-in-fact so largely shapes the judicial ruling as to on- or near-the-seene identifications without counsel is the pervasive theme of the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-8\">As we read <em>Russell, </em>the decision hinged upon the <em>probability </em>of enhanced reliability of identification at an early confrontation \u2014 in other words, the essential fairness of the identification procedure\u2014 and not upon a judge\u2019s attempt to assess its <em>actual </em>reliability, which is the traditional function of the jury. Indeed, it could hardly be said that the identification in <em>Russell </em>was \u201can unusually reliable one,\u201d for it was based upon the identifying witness\u2019 observation of the offender as he passed along the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street at 4:30 in the morning. As the <em>Russell </em>opinion explicates, the court\u2019s \u201cconclusion does not rest on a determination that [the witness\u2019] identification was <em>in fact </em>especially reliable. It rests instead on a general rule that it is not improper for the police immediately to return a freshly apprehended suspect to the scene of the crime for identification by one who has seen the culprit minutes before.\u201d 133 U.S.App.D.C. at 81, 408 F.2d at 1284 (emphasis supplied).

Surely no basis for distinguishing <em>Russell </em>can be found in the mere fact that the confrontation took place, not on the sidewalk where Cook was robbed, but at bis house, to which he had repaired immediately thereafter to report the crime to the police. United States v. Miller, <em>supra </em>note 27, at 976, expands the <em>Russell </em>doctrine to other than strictly on-the-scene confrontations where a valid reason appears for an identification effort at a location near in time and place to the point at which the offense was committed, and our <em>Stovall-type </em>decisions have established a similar principle.

These are the combined needs for fast and effective police action in apprehending criminals, and the avoidance of unnecessary inconvenience and embarrassment to innocent citizens incidental thereto. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-18\">We do not, however, in summarizing the interplay of the two last-mentioned interests, intimate that apart from the freshness of an identification they are constitutional justifications for confrontations which omit the procedure prescribed by <em>Wade. </em>The foundation of our <em>Russell </em>decision was an early confrontation aiding fairness by improving the reliability of the identification. The \u201cexpeditious release of innocent suspects\u201d then became an additional reason for dispensing with the necessity for counsel upon an identification quite independently deemed reliable because it was fresh.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-19\">If the needs for \u201cfast and effective police action in apprehending criminals\u201d and the \u201cexpeditious release of innocent suspects\u201d are viewed as additional reasons for the <em>Russell </em>rule, it is vital to recognize, as I am sure the court does, that these reasons are strictly <em>dependent </em>upon the reliability of the identification. Police action, in the long run, is not made more efficient if the police are likely to be misled into thinking that they have apprehended the criminal when in fact they have not; similarly, innocent suspects are not protected if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>there is a strong likelihood that they will be misidentified as criminals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In short, the additional interests allegedly served by the <em>Russell </em>rule are served only to the extent that we are confident that prompt near-the-scene identifications are reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">I set forth this reminder of the importance of the reliability of the identification because it seems to me that the court may have lost sight of that importance in Part IV of its opinion, where it turns to applying <em>Russell </em>to this case. Part IV summarizes the circumstances of the identification at issue here and then states:</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">We recount these unfolding events because for us they reveal a societally indispensable endeavor \u2014 to capture two criminals at large \u2014 which from the beginning to end occupied but a relatively brief time span. They reveal, too, efforts in that direction\u2014 by police and victim alike \u2014 pressed with as much diligence as can reasonably be expected, followed quickly by an effort to ascertain the accuracy of the results. * * * With the chances of intercepting two robbers on foot dwindling rapidly as time passed, the need to know whether the suspects were the culprits was urgent. * * * <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-9\">I am as delighted as any citizen to learn that the police have been diligent, and I am sympathetic to the cry of urgent need. What troubles me is that diligence and urgency may both continue for many hours after a crime, so I cannot say that these are the critical considerations in applying or extending the <em>Russell </em>rule. The court goes on to say:</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-13\">We realize, of course, that the interest in reliable-beeause-fresh identifications was not assisted in this case quite as well as it was by the 30-min-utes-later identification confrontation in <em>Russell. </em>Yet we cannot believe that so small a time difference \u2014 a half hour to an hour \u2014 could seriously depreciate Cook\u2019s at-home identification in terms of freshness, the value of which <em>Russell </em>extolled.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-14\">Here, then, is the crux of the difference between us: the court thinks that an identification made an hour to an hour and a half after the crime is roughly as reliable as one made 30 minutes after, while I cannot be so confident. We deal here in a misty area of intuitive psychological judgments. If the Government had brought to our attention psychological studies showing that mental images of the sort at issue do not fade for several hours, I might feel compelled to push the <em>Russell </em>exception farther. But since they have not, I feel bound to be exceedingly careful about extending an exception which threatens to undermine the principles of fair identification procedures set down by the Supreme Court in <em>Wade.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-15\">Caution about extending <em>Russell </em>requires careful attention to factors which contribute to the reliability of the identification. In United States v. Cunningham<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I concurred in affirming a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>conviction involving an on-the-seene identification 45 minutes after the offense, but there all that was being identified were clothes and appellant\u2019s general appearance. The court\u2019s opinion in this case suggests other factors that will be relevant: \u201cthe quality of the witness\u2019 opportunity to observe when the offense was committed, and the caliber of the description of the perpetrator he furnished the police.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> I am not convinced that the caliber of the description is a useful guide to reliability since, as we said in <em>Russell:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">[T]he conscious attempt to separate the ensemble impression into particular verbalized features, in order to preserve some recollection, may well distort the original accurate image so that it is the verbalized characteristics which are remembered and not the face or the man.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Afq\">But what particularly troubles me about Part IV of the court's opinion is the inadequacy of its focus on the factors it admits are relevant to credibility. Granted that Cook, the victim, described the clothes and general appearance of his assailants to the police, his identification was not, as in <em>Cunningham, </em>so limited. More important, I cannot believe that the court is particularly impressed by Cook\u2019s opportunity to observe. Of the two robbers, appellant is said to be the one who grabbed Cook from <em>behind </em>and held him on the ground while the other went through Cook\u2019s pockets. Cook testified that he was able to observe appellant\u2019s face \u201cduring and after\u201d the robbery. But he admitted that the entire incident took no longer than one or two minutes, and from his description of the events, it could well have taken considerably less than that. We are left with the very real possibility that he got no more than a fleeting look at his assailant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-9\">I conclude that this identification was not an unusually reliable one. Given the length of time between the crime and the identification, therefore, I cannot agree that this case falls within the <em>Russell </em>rule as it has been applied. Since, in addition, the court has not persuaded me that we should expand the <em>Russell </em>rule, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1096-23\">. Pp. 1033-1034 <em>supra, </em>footnotes omitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1097-10\">. It is perhaps worth noting, as I have before, that \u201cthe argument from reducing unnecessary detention of innocent suspects is very weak. First, I believe that an innocent man, were he as aware of the dangers of misidentification as lawyers and judges are, would generally prefer to have the necessary time taken for a fairly conducted line-up. The logic of protecting the innocent forces one to the position that the supposedly innocent man should have some voice in the decision to return to the complaining witness. \u2018Protecting the innocent\u2019 by giving them no choice at all has a very hollow ring to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-11\">\u201cSecond, it seems to me that innocent men are adequately protected by the requirement that the police have probable cause before they arrest a suspect. * * * \u201d United States v. Evans, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 321, 331, 438 F.2d 162, 172 (1971) (Baze-lon, C. J., dissenting). Police effectiveness, therefore, is the critical \u201ccountervailing policy consideration\u201d underlying the <em>Russell </em>rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1097-17\">.

Cook testified that on his way to the grocery, just before the crime, he noticed appellant standing on the corner nearby, in a small group. While this evidence may be appropriate for the jury to consider, I do not find that it materially strengthens the reliability of Cook\u2019s identification for the purposes of <em>Russell. </em>In the first place, a glance at a stranger on the street is not so likely to make a vivid impression on one\u2019s mind as we have assumed that a criminal assault is. In the second place, we have no independent evidence tending to confirm that the man Cook saw on the street corner was the man who assaulted him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
