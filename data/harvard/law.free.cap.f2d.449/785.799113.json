Wheeler, was convicted of unlawful entry into a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We affirmed his conviction in Golliher v. United States, 362 F. 2d 594 (8th Cir. 1966). Wheeler then sought post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court, Judge Van Pelt, denied Wheeler\u2019s motion to vacate his conviction and ten-year sentence. In this appeal, Wheeler argues that his conviction cannot stand because at the trial the government introduced an extra-judicial confession of his co-defendant Holmes contrary to the rule of Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-O\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-20\">At Wheeler\u2019s trial, two FBI agents recounted a conversation they had with one of Wheeler\u2019s co-defendants, Holmes. The testimony pertaining to this conversation served to implicate Wheeler in the crime by name. Holmes did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-21\">In denying relief under \u00a7 2255, Judge Van Pelt noted that he had presided at Wheeler\u2019s first trial, which was declared a mistrial because of prejudicial publicity, and at his second trial, in which the guilty verdict was returned. Judge Van Pelt again reviewed the evidence and concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b843-22\">[T]he admission of the confession did constitute a violation of Wheeler\u2019s sixth amendment right of confrontation under the <em>Bruton </em>rule, but -\u00bb * * the case against Wheeler was so overwhelming that this violation of <em>Bruton </em>was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-24\">We have reviewed the evidence presented at Wheeler\u2019s trial. Our review convinces us that the <em>Bruton </em>error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See </em>Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969). Accordingly, we affirm for reasons enunciated by Judge Van Pelt in his unreported opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-26\">. The <em>Bruton </em>rule applies retroactively. Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
