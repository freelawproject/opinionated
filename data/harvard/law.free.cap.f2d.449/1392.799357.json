Since the record fully supports appellant\u2019s assertion of prior rights in the trademark FASHION TAN, the only issue here is that of likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-22\">Our review of the record and consideration of the briefs and arguments of counsel do not convince us of reversible error in the decision of the board holding that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-23\">The marks \u201cFASHION TWO TWENTY\u201d and \u201cFASHION TAN\u201d are alike primarily in that each contains the term \u201cFASHION\u201d. Considering the suggestive character of this common feature, indicating stylish or fashionable, and the fact that others in the cosmetic and toiletry field have adopted the term \u201cFASHION\u201d as the mark or a portion of a mark for their goods, the presence of this term in each of the marks is not as significant a factor in determining the confusingly similar character of these marks as petitioner urges. In fact, under the circumstances disclosed herein, it is our opinion that the readily apparent differences between the terms \u201cTWO TWENTY\u201d and \u201cTAN\u201d are sufficient to render the marks \u201cFASHION TWO TWENTY\u201d and \u201cFASHION TAN\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number>a whole registrably distinguishable and to obviate any possibility that purchasers encountering the products of the parties under these marks will mistakenly believe that they emanate from the same source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-6\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"avw-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1450-18\">.
