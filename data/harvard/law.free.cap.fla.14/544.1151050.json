Payne gave his note, payable in two years, with eight per cent, interest, secured by mortgage upon said lots.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-14\">The bill alleges the non-payment of the note and interest, and that John M.

H. Cole. That by the failure of title to these six lots, the remaining lots and property (a hotel and appurtenances,) were greatly reduced in value, and they have suffered great damage-thereby; that the lots had been sold for the U. S. direct taxes, and at the time of conveyance and-mortgage were in the possession of the tax purchasers, and defendant Payne lost the use of the premises some six months before he could obtain possession, to his damage $3,000; that the consideration of the note had wholly failed; that the said damages should be set off against the <em>note; </em>that A.

Payne lots 8, 9,10, 11, 12, 13,14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, in block 15, in the city of Fernandina, for ten thousand dollars, executing and delivering a usual warranty deed for the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-8\">The negotiations of this sale, the delivery of the papers and the receiving of the purchase money were made by Joseph Finegan, who had an interest in the property by way of a mortgage from Amaziah Coy. As such Finegan acted under a verbal special authority to negotiate the sale. This special authority to negotiate a sale does not extend to contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-9\">Payne paid $5,510 down at the delivery of the deed on the 21st of February, 1866, and gave his note of $4,490 for the balance, payable in two years, and secured the payment thereof by the mortgage in controversy. This note and mortgage was made to Joseph Finegan, instead of to the grantors of said deed, but was assigned to the plaintiff before due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-10\">Under the covenant of the deed to make such other and further deeds as may be found to be necessary, the plaintiff, as guardian of the minor .heirs, (the Mattair children,) obtained an order of the Circuit Court to approve of the sale of the Coy property to Payne in behalf of said minor children, and made a guardian deed for said property to Payne.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-11\">The delivery of this deed by the guardian to Joseph Finegan, and the recording thereof, is a good delivery. 4 Kent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Com., 454. On the execution and delivery of fhe deed to Payne on the 21st February, 1866, the following additional papers were delivered to John M. Payne, viz : the original lease from Trustees of the Florida Railroad Company to Francis L. Dancy for lots 15, 16, 17 and 18, duly assigned to A. Coy, Sr., and Payne had it recorded while in his possession. At the same time the original deed from the Trustees of the Florida Railroad Company for lots 10, 11, 12,13 and 14 to Amaziah Coy, in fee simple, was also delivered to Payne, and at the same time the redemption certificates for lots 8 to 18 inclusive were also delivered to Payne; all of which clearly showed to John M. Payne what kind of title he had received, viz:</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-5\">1. A fee simple title for lots S, 9, 10, 11,12, 13 and 14.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-6\">2. - A possessory title, or 99 years leasehold, with a eov\u00e9nant to purchase the fee, of lots 15, 16, 17 and 18.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-7\">3. The redemption of all and singular the premises from the forfeiture and sale of the property by the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-8\">\u2022John M. Payne paid part of the purchase money and fetuses to pay the balance of $4,490. Suit was brought to recover this amount, and this suit is against several defendants, viz: Against John M. Payne as the mortgagor, and Mark W. Downie and wife, Celia B. and Susan L. Payne as the present owners and holders of the property under John M. Payne.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-9\">A. H.

Dickerson claims lease lots 15, 16, 17 and 18 as assignee of the Trustees of the Florida Railroad Company and the rent under the lease, and against Samuel T.. Riddell as tenant. Mr. Riddell does not answer ; his rights are therefore admitted to be subservient to the plaintiff\u2019s; mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-11\">The testimony showeth no <em>duress </em>\u2014 no imposition or destruction of Payne\u2019s free agency \u2014 -no <em>fraud, </em>whether by misrepresentation, concealment or trick, employed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>plaintiff towards Payne to lead Mm into error or to make an agreement contrary to Ms interest \u2014 no <em>cheat, </em>no malicious contrivance nor false suggestion, not even to impair \u2022the true value or price of the property; not even a hard contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-5\">The testimony of Mr. Koerner, the land agent in Fernandina, who has charge of the lease lots and sells property, shows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-6\">The value of lots 8 and 9, without improvements, $1,000</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-7\">Lots 10, 11, 12, 18 and 14, with improvements, 9,000</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-8\">\u00a1Lots 15, 16, 17 and 18, 2,400</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-9\">In all, $12,400</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-10\">In 1866, these premises were valued about the same.

Payne, entered into at Jacksonville under date of January 25, 1866, is not an agreement between the grantors and Payne. It does not stipulate any particular property, except the Coy hotel; and all the relation it has to the case at bar is that nothing else was expected than the interest of Mrs; Coy and her children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-12\">Finegan had no authorized agency, and certainly there is no evidence as to prior authority given on subsequent assent or approval by the grantors. See 2 Kent\u2019s Com., 614 or 815, new ed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-13\">Even if there would have been some binding force in the original memorandum, as a contract, it became waived, annulled, dissolved and given up by the new contract made and consummated on the 21st February, 1866. See Chitty on Con., 115.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-14\">Under the new contract, not only the Coy hotel property, standing on lots 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, but lots 8 and <em>9', </em>\u25a0joining the hotel property south, and lease lots 15, 16, 17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>and 18, joining east, were added ; the redemption, furth'\u00e9r and more tim\u00e9 was given; in short, a new solemn contract was made by deeds and covenants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-5\">The mortgagor, John M.

Payne received the property as such with his knowledge and consent as a part of the bargain. A deed thus made and delivered is a good deed and the endorsoment is a part thereof. 1 Starkie, 130; Jacob\u2019s Law Dic. Title Deed; 3 ib., Title End.; Stewart vs. Preston, 1 Fla.; 1 Bouv.

(12 Pet., 264; 7 How., 284; 5 Cr. C. C. 485; or see Brightly\u2019s Fed. Dig., Dec., page 742, notes 1 and 2, title sale.) A. H. Cole, however, is in court, admitting the sale of the property to the grantors of John M. Payne, (see sec. 753, 2 Story Eq. Com., n. 2,) and only seeks the protection of the court in the payment of the purchase money, $1000, which the plaintiff claims to be only $300 a lot, viz : $600 for the two, with interest at the rate of six per cent, since 1860, deducting therefrom the interest abated during the late war. Cole\u2019s interest therefore in said lots is $600, and ten year\u2019s interests $360 \u2014 total $960.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-5\">. If Payne or his sisters had paid this to Cole, they might claim it as a proper set off on the mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-6\">As to forfeiture of the lease lots 15, 16, 17 and 18, there could be no forfeiture without judicial proceedings and office found (see 9 Wall. 426,) besides courts of equity never enforce forfeiture, but relieve against it, (see 1 Story Eq. Com., sec. 891; 2 ib., sec. 775 and 1,315.) The true condition of these lots between the plaintiff and the defendants in this action is as follows: They are 99 years leasehold, created November 7, 1856, at an annual rent of $16 each, or $64 for the four lots, with a covenant to purchase the fee at pleasure at $200 a lot. The ground rent was paid to November, 1860, that is up to the time Coy got them. From November, 1860, -to November, 1866, six years,the plaintiff has \"to pay the ground rent, amounting to $384, abating 4 years war time, $254, leaving a balancp for the plaintiff to pay of $128. If Payne had paid this, he might have a just set-off on the mortgage; as he has not paid it, it goes to E. N. Dickerson.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-7\">Since 1866, John M. Payne and his vendees, sisters, must pay the ground rent, viz : 8 years, amouning to $512 ; besides this there appears to be due defendant, Dickerson, for taxes and redemption money, $?49.75, makihg an amount to be decreed to E. N. Dickerson from Payne, of $561.65.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The defendant\u2019s counter claim, therefore, on account of de&gt;duction for the failure of title to six lots/alls to the ground', and more so since the said defendants have' been in the undisturbed enjoyment of said lots ever since 1866. The testimony of all the witnesses for the plaintiff and defendants shows that the defendants Payne have had the undisturbed possession and enjoyment of said premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-5\">As to the purported damage in obtaining possession, the evidence does not warrant and the law does not allow such claims. A legal point is that the purported counter claim was not in existence at the time the note and mortgage was given. Besides by the redemption of the property the possession became and was legally vested in the redemptor. (See act of Congress, June 6, 1862, see. 7, 12 stat., 122; do. 13 stat. page 502, sec. 7,) and when the property was conveyed to John M. Payne in February, 1866, he did not take immediate possession, but allowed the property to be occupied, not by the plaintiff and co-heirs of A. Coy, but by other parties who held them tortiously. This tortious ] &gt;ossession is no eviction, either actual or constructive; no action therefore will lie or does exist upon the covenant in the title. 2 Black, 500 and 50Y.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-6\">Payne knew of the condition of the property and the occupancy thereof; he left it until about the first of April and obtained possession in May by legal process against the parties whom he left in possession at the time of the purchase. And in June, 1866, he obtained full and complete possession . and that Payne soon opened the hotel business after he got in possession appears from his own testimony. Fie received guests during the summer of 1866, and had his hotel in full operation on the first of January, 186Y.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-7\">The claim for insurance is not well taken. Fie insured for his own benefit, and if he had burned out would have received the insurance money; and if it had enured to the plaintiff\u2019s benefit it was a matter of agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-8\">In short, every item of counter claim interposed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>defendants falls to the ground from want of evidence to sustain them. The plaintiff, therefore, is entitled to the relief prayed for in the complaint, viz : the recovery of the whole amount of the martgage note, to-wit: $1,190, with eight per cent, interest thereon from February 21,1866, amounting- to date of decree, $2,875 \u2014 total, $7,365.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-6\">From this amount the plaintiff has has to pay A. H. Cole, amount of purchase money for lots S and 9, $960, and E. N. Dickerson, ground rent, $128.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-7\">Besides this, E. N. Dickerson is entitled to recover from the defendants John M. Payne, or M. W. Downie and wife, and Celia B. and Susaq L. Payne, the amount of ground rent due since 1866, viz : $512, and for taxes paid, $19.75 ; total, $561.75.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-8\">And the decree of the court ought to have been that the said John M. Payne or Mark <em>W. </em>Downie and wife, and Celia B. and Susan L. Payne pay the said several sums of money, with costs of these proceedings under the statutes, and that in default of payment the mortgage premises be sold to pay the same, and that if any balance remain unpaid that execution issue against the said John M.

Contracts, p. 356.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-5\">If, therefore, <em>any </em>of the lots embraced in said deed were not in fee simple, the grantors cannot enforce their part of the contract until they are in ,a condition to convey fee simple titles to the grantee in each and every lot included in the contract, and tender to do so. It is admitted that A. II.

But the facts and circumstances of this case, in that connection, raised a strong presumption'to the contrary. AmoDg the irregularities is the want of advertisement prior to obtaining the order to sell. Thomp. Dig., 225; Act approved January 23, 1851, chap. 381, p. 129. The order or decree of court produced in evidence by the plaintiff is simply to confirm a sale <em>already made., </em>and was obtained a short time after the conveyance to Payne by the older heirs of Coy and long before the alleged execution of the deed by the guardian in behalf of the minors. Hence its reference must have been to <em>that </em>deed, and not to the subsequent alleged conveyance by the guardian. No recital appears in it that it had been made to appear to the court that proper advertisement had been made, &amp;c. It is all totally irregular, and leaves the alleged grantee unsafe and unprotected as against the minors. 11 Fla., 71-2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-5\">It purports to have been signed in the presence of J.

The testimony of Mrs. Coy, the plaintiff herself, is that they were all in Jacksonville, <em>Duval </em>county, that day, when all of ihe papers of that date -were fixed up in the office of' J. P. Sanderson, with Long and Finegan present.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Arn\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">If the decree in this case should be allowed to stand, it is evident that both parties must suffer, and it is for this reason, mainly, that we must reverse it upon grounds other than those urged by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">1. <em>We </em>agree with the Circuit Court that the title to lots eight and nine was, the date of the deed to John M. Payne, and still remains, in A. II. Cole. The grantors had only a naked possession under some agreement to purchase which had not been complied with by them. There was no evidence in the case showing what amount is due him for purchase money.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">2. The title to lots 15, 16,17 and 18, was not in the grantors, but the lots were held under a lease for 99 years, upon which the rent appears to be unpaid from 1859 or 1860. The lease stands assigned to Amaziak Coy, now deceased, and the grantors, Mrs. Coy, administratrix, and her two daughters, conveyed in terms the fee, but in fact and in law only their interest in the leasehold, with a covenant to make the title to the grantee. The interest of the minor heirs was not conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">3. The court found that the title to lots 10,11,12,13 and 14, was in the grantors, but to this we cannot agree. The infant heirs were seized of an undivided interest in the right of their mother, who was a daughter of Amaziah Coy, deceased, and this interest seems to- be one-tliird of the estate, subject to the right of dower of the plaintiff, Emeline Coy, the widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">It is assumed by the appellant that the guardian\u2019s deed under the order of the Judge of Suwannee Circuit, dated March' 6, 1867, carries the interest of the infants. Upon examination of that order it does not appear that proper proceedings were had to authorize the making of any order for the sale of their interest, nor does the order in its terms authorize a conveyance. So far as the record discloses the matter, the guar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>dian\u2019s deed is of no effect. The record should show that in the proceedings for the sale of the interest of infants in real property, the statutes were complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">4. The mortgage covers all the interest which the mortgagee- had acquired in all the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">5. The court found that the damages sustained by reason of the failure of the title to lots 8, 9, 15, 16, 17 and 18 was $2,400. \"We think the evidence is not sufficiently clear as to the value of those lots, in connection with the whole as a hotel property, and the rents in arrear upon the leased lots at the time of the conveyance to Payne, to warrant the finding of this precise amount. Further proof should be taken on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">6. The court found that Payne sustained damages, including expenses necessarily incurred, to the amount of $1,050 in consequence of his being unable to obtain 'possession of the property after his purchase. The proofs appear to sustain this finding, and it was proper to allow such damages for a breach of the covenants in the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">7. As to the finding of the court that there is $1,040 and interest due to the plaintiff, when we take into account that a proportion, (say one fourth,) of the property of the value of $10,000 belongs to the infant heirs, and that the mortgage was given upon the premise and hypothesis that the interest of the infant heirs was to be obtained and conveyed to the .mortgagor, and this not appearing to have been accomplished so far as the record shows, there was absolutely nothing duo upon the note and mortgage. The replication of the plaintiff to the answer of Payne, moreover, expressly states that the note and mortgage were executed to Joseph Finegan to be held by him until a deed could be obtained of the interest of the minor heirs of Amaziah Ooy, and that this was agreed to by all parties and that they were assigned by Finegan to the plaintiff upon the making of the order by the judge of the Suwannee circuit, and the execution of the guardian\u2019s deed; but as it does not appear by the proofs con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>tained in the record that the guardian\u2019s deed conveyed the interest of the infants, the right to enforce the mortgage by a decree does not seem to have accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The right of the defendant Payne and his grantees to resist the collection o\u00ed a part or the whole of the purchase money of the. premises, under the broken covenants in the-deed, cannot be questioned, whatever appropriate offsets by way of recoupment o\u00ed* otherwise may exist in consequence of the failure of title to or possession of the whole or any part of the property, and under the express covenants of seisin of 'title in fee simple, of possession and quiet enjoyment, and against defects and incumbrances, they may be set up against and in bar of a suit to recover the purchase money, or they' may be recovered by direct action upon the covenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The grantors are liable for any breach of their covenants,, and as this mortgage was given to secure them, the recoupment or offsets may be made against the claim of the present plaintiff, who was one of them and who represents them in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">8. The decree directs the sheriff to pay out of the \u00a1proceeds of the sale the rent due on the lease, excepting the rent which may have accrued during the time the property could not be enjoyed by Coy and his heirs by reason of the military disturbance. This is not correct. There docs not appear to be-any reservation in the lease as to any interruption of the occupancy by reason of the disturbance, and it has been held by this court (in Robinson vs. L\u2019Engle, 13 Fla.,) that where there is an express covenant to pay rent, the loss of the use of' the premises on account of the casualties of war, is no lawful excuse for the non-payment of rent. And moreover, there was no proper issue before the court upon which to decide that question between the lessor and the lessee of these premises, nor in any event could the sheriff properly determine the amount to be paid out of the proceeds. If the px\u2019oceeds are to be distributed among adverse claimants, they should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>paid into court and distributed under ' its order after a full' hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">9. It does not appear to this court that the defendants, Edward N. Dickerson and A. H. dole, are necegsary or proper parties to this action. Their rights appear to be antagonistic as well as superior to those of the plaintiffs and the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The decree of the Circuit Court in this cause is reversed, and the cause remanded with directions that such further proofs be taken by the parties as may be deemed necessary, and that the parties may amend their pleadings in such respect as may be deemed advisable, and that such other proceedings be had as may be according to law and the practice of the court. The clerk will transmit to the Circuit Court for Nassau county a \u2019copy of the opinion herein, together with the judgment of this court. It is further ordered that the appellant pay the disbursements in and about her appeal, but that the respondent recover no costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
