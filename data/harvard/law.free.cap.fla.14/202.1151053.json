Tbe allegation of misrepresentation in tbe answer is no defence as pleaded, because it does not state that tbe mis-. representation was made by tbe plaintiff, and even if it did, there was no attempt made to sustain tbe allegation by-proof. See evidence in the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-7\">2. Darby was a joint and several maker of tbe note sued on, and nothing appears on its face to show that be signed it as surety.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-8\">In a joint and several note, all tbe makers are principals, and as against tbe creditor, evidence is not admissible to-show that some are sureties. Byles on Bills, marg. p. 192. and note (i); 2 Kent. Com., 556.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-9\">A joint and several maker of a note, where bis character as surety does not appear on tbe face of tbe instrument, will not, in an action by the bolder, be allowed to prove that he is a surety merely. 2 Kent. Com., 556; 2 Phill. Ev., 350; 12 Wend., 573; Byles on Bills, marg. p. 192 and note, (i.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-10\">Tbe general rule is, that parol evidence is not admissible to contradict or vary tbe terms of a written contract which is intelligible in its terms, nor to impose upon it a sense which its terms do not imply. 2 Kent. Com. 556, (marg.;) 9 Fla., 503; 2 Abbott\u2019s Nat. Dig., 339, No. 593, and the cases there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-11\">By tbe terms of tbe note upon which tbe action is founded, tbe defendant is a maker and not a surety, and if parol evidence should be admitted to show that be was in fact a mere surety, would be to impose upon tbe note, which is a written contract, a sense which its terms do not imply; and would be a clear violation of the rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-12\">It is therefore contended, that the court below did not err, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>in refusing to allow the'defendant to prove by parol that he was a mere surety and not a maker of the note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-5\">If I am correct in this, and the defendant is not allowed to show that he is a surety and not a maker, it will be unnecessary to consider the question as to wliat indulgence will Iiave the effect to discharge a surety or endorser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-6\">Rut as the question is raised by the counsel for defendant, I submit to the consideration of the court the following propositions and authorities:</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-7\">1. It is a settled rule of law that extending to principals further time for payment will not discharge the surety. Brightley\u2019s Fed. Dig., 824, Sec. 72.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-8\">2. Even a local statute authorizing a surety to require the creditor to sue, &amp;c., does not apply to a case in which the principal and surety unite in a joint and several bond. Brightley\u2019s Fed. Dig., 825, Sec. 97, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-9\">But a surety whose character appears on the face of the instrument, may call upon the creditor to proceed. Brightley\u2019s Fed. Dig., 823, Sec. 35 and cases there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-10\">InEngland it is held that the <em>bona fide </em>holder of a bill or note cannot be prejudiced in his right, according to the terms of the instrument, by the knowledge that the acceptor or maker is surety, without a specific agreement to treat the acceptor or maker as surety. 3 Kent Com., 115, note 2; 18 Eng. L. and Eq., 351.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-11\">3. The indulgence which will discharge an indorser or surety, must not only be on a good consideration, but it must also be for a limited and definite period. Brightley\u2019s Fed. Dig., 824, Sec. 61.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-12\">In order to discharge the surety, the agreement of the holder must be to destroy or suspend, or else a contract to destroy or suspend his right of action against the maker. Byles on Bills, 193.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-13\">Mere indulgence or delay will not 'have the effect to discharge a surety. Byles on Bills, 193, and note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-14\">But an agreement on good consideration not to sue the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>maker at all, or not to sue within a specified time, will discharge an endorser or security. Ryles on Bills, 191.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-5\">Now the proof in the record not only shows that'the plaintiff made no agreement with Dickinson to destroy or suspend his right of action on the note against any or either of the makers thereof, but on the contrary establishes the fact in the most direct and positive terms, that the plaintiff \u25a0did not at any time make any agreement with any one, by which he would be prevented from suing any or all of the makers of the said note for even a moment of time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-6\">And hence it is argued that even if it were competent for. the defendant to show (which we deny) that he is only a surety on the note, he has signally failed to prove upon the trial that the plaintiff ever gave such indulgence to Dickinson as would have the effect to discharge him. It is there-ford contended that even if the court below erred in ruling' -out evidence to show that defendant was a surety, still this court will not reverse the judgment if the verdict is sustained, by the evidence. 6 Fla., 182; ib. 516.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-7\">\u25a0 But it is contended by the counsel for defendant, that the court below erred in instructing the jury that in the event they should find in favor of the plaintiff, they should allow him the difference between gold coin and currency at th\u00e9 time the note became due, and the gold became payable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-8\">The plain and settled rule of law which governs in all such cases is, that the engagement of the maker of a note is that it shall be paid at the time, and if it be not, the holder is' entitled to indemnity for the loss arising from this breach of contract. 3 Kent\u2019s Com., marg. p. 115.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-9\">This general principle is the foundation of all claims for damages for breach of contract. And so if a n\u00f3te (like this) be made payable in gold coin at a given time, and it be not paid at that time, the holder of the note will be entitled to indemnity for the loss arising to him from the breach of contract, and the difference between gold coin and cnn-en.cy at that time will clearly be the correct measure of damages.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>J.

Munroe, 382.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-7\">When1 the creditor does any act impairing the rights of a surety, or vai\u2019ies the tex\u2019ms of the contract, or enlarges the time of performance, without consulting surety, the surety may set up and plead the same in discharge, either in law or equity. 13 John., 173-4; 17 ib., 390; 2 John.

Rep., 567; 3 Kernan, 341.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahu\">i The first point made by the appellant\u2019s counsel is that the court erred in rejecting testimony offered by\u2019def\u00e9ridant to prove that the defendant was a surety of Dickinson, and in charging the jury th\u00e1t such testimony was not to be received to prove such\u2019 fact, and that no agreement to extend the time of payment will release or exonerate any of the'p'arties to this note.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">It is the settled law that where a payee or holder of a note or obligation, by a valid agreement, binding as between him and a principal debtor, agrees to give time for' payment beyond the time stipulated in'the original contract, without the consent of a surety of fhe principal, such agreement will release the surety. ' And a court of law as well as equity gives fhe same effect to the extension of \"time by the creditor to fhe principal, and holds the surety discharged. This principle is not controverted'by counsel in this cas\u00e9. To enable a surety to avail himself of this defence at law,J the instrument must on the face of it show that he is such surety; if he is bound as principal, he cannot <em>at law </em>aver by pleading that he he is bound as surety, though <em>in equity </em>parol evidence is admissible to show who is principal and who surety. Burge on Suretyship, 211; Rees vs. Berrington, 2 Ves., Jr., 540; 14 Ves., 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The case of Sprigg vs. the Bank of Mount Pleasant, in the Supreme Court of the United States, (10 Peters, 257,) was a suit upon a bond executed by several persons, in\" which they were all expressly named as principals. The action was at law. The court (Thompson, J.,) says : \u201c If the defendant can be (et in to set up that he was surety only, the matter alleged is sufficient to exonerate him from liability in the present suit. It falls within the settled\" rule of law in rela. tion to sureties, that extending t\u00f3 the principal further time of payment by a new agreement, will discharge fhe surety. It has been contended that it' appearing ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>pressly on the face of the bond that the-defendant acknowledged himself as principal, did not vary the question; for that all joint and several obligors in a bond are in judgment of law considered principal. This is true as a <em>prima facie </em>presumption of law; but is not conclusive upon, a party when drawn in question before a proper tribunal: But as matter of estoppel at law, it may stand on a different footing, and is, at all events, as matter of fact more conclusive. * * That a party has, by his own voluntary act, placed himself in a situation, as to mere matter of fact, that he is-precluded from denying it; * and it is a salutary- practical rule that a man shall not be permitted to deny what he has .solemnly acknowledged. In oi\u2019dinary cases, when sureties .sign an instrument without any designation of the character in which they become bound, it may be reasonable to conclude that they undex'stood 'their liability was conditional, and attached only in default of payment by the principal. And hence the reasonableness of the xuxle of law which requires of the creditor that his conduct, with x\u2019espect to his debtor, should be such- as not to enlarge the liability of the surety and make him responsible beyond what he understood he had bound himself. * * But admitting that, although the defendant has upon face of the obligation become bound as principal, yet a court of equity might allow him to set up that he was sxxrety only, and let him in to all the protections that are usually extended to sxxreties, the present case is to be governed by rules applicable to proceedings in courts of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">It thus appears by the very -highest authorities in this country and in England, that the defence referred to may be made in, an action at law, where the fact that the defendant was a surety is' admitted or appears upon the face of the contract ; but where the contx\u2019act discloses the fact that all the makers are principals, the defence can only be.made, or the. relief had in a court of eqxxity, wherever the distinction be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>tween the-proceedings in courts of law and those in courts of equity exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">But the Code of Procedure of this State lias abolished all distinctions in the forms of action between legal and equitable remedies-, and section 101 of the'Code allows the defendant to set forth by answer as many defences and counter claims as he may have, whether they be such as have been heretofore denominated legal or equitable, or both. So that it was competent for the defendant to avail himself of the defence that he was a surety in fact, and that he had been discharged by the happening of any circumstance which would have availed him in a court of equity under the for-former practice. The court therefore erred in excluding the evidence sought to be given by. the defendant, and in instructing the jury that such defence would not avail him.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The remaining question in this ease is whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover the <em>\u201c </em>currency\u201d value of the gold coin, the value to be ascertained at the time the note became due, with interest. The note in suit became due November 1,1867, and the proof shows that the difference in the value of gold and \u201c currency\u201d was about forty cents on the dollar. A computation of the amount due, upon this basis, allowing credit for the various payments shown by the receipts, demonstrates that the jury ascertained the amount by this rule, and found their verdict, accordingly, being about forty per cent, more than the amount actually due in coin.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">It has been suggested that gold coin is a merchantable commodity and that the standard of value now in this country is United States currency or <em>\u201c </em>greenbacks,\u201d and whereas $100 in gold coin was in 1867 \u201c worth\u201d $140 in currency,, and the difference now being 10 or 12 only, that therefore gold has fallen or depreciated. We think this is a mistake. Gold coin represents value as a standard; <em>\u201c </em>currency\u201d represents credit or confidence. The paper promises of a government or an individual are the representatives of the credit of the government or person. The ability and disposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>to pay fixes the value to be estimated iu money. It would be absurd to say that the paper promises issued by a person or a bank formed the basis of the value of gold, and it is equally absurd to apply the doctrine to the paper of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In the present case, had the maker of .this note tendered, at the last moment, the amount due oil its face in gold coin with interest, it would have been a satisfaction, because it would have been a compliance with the promise just as fully as a tender of currency after the time of payment had arrived would be a compliance with a promise to pay currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The judgment to be rendered should be a judgment enforcing the contract. The summons in this case notifies the defendant that the plaintiff', on failure to answer, will take judgment for $3,000 in gold coin, with interest. The complaint demands judgment for \u201c $3,000 in gold coin, with interest.\u201d Thus the summons and complaint demand a specific fulfilment with the terms of the note, and this is perfectly legitimate. The judgment is for an amount in dollars forty per cent, greater than the amount demanded in dollars by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The Supreme Court of the United States, in three late-cases, has indicated the proper judgment to be given upon such contracts. In Bronson vs. Rhodes, 7 Wallace, 254, the court says: \u201c When contracts made payable in coin are sued upon, judgments may be entered for coined dollars and parts of'dollars; and when contracts have been made payable in dollars generally, without specifying in what description of currency payment is to be made, judgment may be entered generally without such specification. We have already adopted this rule as to judgments for duties, by affirming a. judgment of the Circuit Court for the District of California in favor of the United States for $1,388.10, payable in gold and silver coin, and judgment for express contracts between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>individuals for the payment of coin may be entered in like manner.\u201d This is the judgment of the same court in 3 Wallace, 320; Butler vs. Horwitz, 7 Wallace, 258; Dewry vs. Sears, 11 Wallace, 379. While this is the rule in the courts of the United States in common law actions, there is perhaps less doubt as to the propriety of entering a specific judgment following the terms of the contract, under our present Code of Procedure. We are therefore of the opinion that the ruling of the court in admitting testimony to show the <em>\u201c </em>value of gold \u201d at the time the note became due, and in directing the jury to compute the amount due in <em>\u201c </em>currency \u201d upon that basis, was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The judgment must, for the reasons herein stated, be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs against the respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
