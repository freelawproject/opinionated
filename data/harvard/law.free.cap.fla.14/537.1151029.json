In the absence of special equities, the County and Circuit Courts have concurrent jurisdiction in the matter of the settlement of administra! tions. Where there has been a suggestion of insolvency under the, statute in the County Court, and creditors have filed their claims, the Circuit Court should not take jurisdiction at the suit of such creditors, in the absence of circumstances calling for the exercise of its chancery powers, as distinct from probate or surrogate powers, or unless for some special reason it is made to appear that the County Court cannot administer adequate and complete relief between the parties.

To sustain, the demurrer, it is incumbent on the administrator to show that the county court, sitting as of probate, has jurisdiction to hear and determine the matters of complaint set up by the plaintiffs. Thomp. Dig., 57, 58, 195, 203, 207; Constitution of 1868, Art. VI, s. 11; Bush\u2019s Dig., 416-17, sec. 17.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-16\">It would be a denial of justice to send the plaintiffs to a tribunal that can give no relief. The probate court cannot upen a stated account, nor order the foreclosure of a mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>gage, nor try an issue as to the insolvency of an estate, nor (Compel the administrator to make good any loss in consequence of acts amounting to a <em>devastavit. </em>Its jurisdiction is limited and restricted by express statutes. In the matter \u2022of insolvent estates, its powers are strictly defined, and the act under which the administrator is proceeding, according to its title, is only <em>\u201c </em>to provide for the payment pro rata of the debts of insolvent estates.\u201d Act approved Jan. 8, 1853, chap. 527, p. 105.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-5\">2. Chancery gives aid to the jurisdiction of inferior courts. 1 Sto. Eq., s. 33, 598-99; 1 Fonbl. Eq., b. 1, c. 1, s. 3., p. 9; Francis\u2019 Maxims, 31.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWZ\">If the county court, sitting as of probate, finds itself unable to give full relief, the parties in interest can properly resort to this tribunal, and if the aid of this court becomes necessary for any reason, the jurisdiction of the probate court is not necessarily ousted. It can still dispose 'of the assets in its keeping, and if the chancery court recovers or brings to light new assets, such order can be made for the disposition of the same as is just and right. 22 Vt., 58-9; 9 R. I., 275; 64 N. C., 176, 180.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-7\">3. The purposes of the two causes or actions are different. The administrator is in the probate office, with his suggestion of insolvency, to pay the debts pro rata; the creditor\u2019s are in the court of chancery to foreclose their mortgages, to surcharge and falsify or to open and revise the administrator\u2019s accounts, to effect the sale of the lands, to establish a balance as due the estate by the administrator for further action, and to establish the solvency of the estate upon a proper settlement of the administrator\u2019s accounts. But one matter is common to both the application to the court to take the assets into its own jurisdiction and make distribution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-8\">4. The demurrer, if bad in part, is bad altogether. (Voorhies\u2019 Code, 206, a.) The demurrer is to the whole complaint, and if any part of the matters complained of is with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>in the jurisdiction of this court, after the suggestion of insolvency, the action must be sustained. There surely can be no question about the right of foreclosure, and two of the parties plaintiff invoke the aid of the court for that purpose. 11 Fla., 123.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-5\">The statute does not recognize the rights of mortgagees, but this court has held that it has not extinguished those rights. If the mortgagees are properly here, all the other parties are, for all have an interest in the subject matter, and no more convenient way can- be found to bring all the parties before the court than by filing a complaint in the nature of a creditor\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-6\">5. It would be an encouragement to fraud if an administrator could shelter himself behind a suggestion of insolvency, whenever an action against him was imminent in conse-. quence of acts of <em>devastavit </em>or .maladministration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-7\">In the present case,' it is charged (and admitted by the demurrer) that the alleged insolvency has been caused by the improper acts of the administrator, and he simply pleads the insolvency as a reason why he should not answer the charges against him. Surely this is claiming advantage of his own wrong.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-8\">6. The remedy here sought is full, complete and ample, and the court should take jurisdiction of the whole matter to save multiplicity of suits and settle the rights and equities of all the parties. The doctrine as laid down by Story in regard to the concurrent jurisdiction of the \u2018courts of chanceiy and the spiritual courts in like' cases, would seem to conclude the matter. The spiritual court, he says, in the language of Lord Chancellor Nottingham, has but a lame jurisdiction. \u201c And although, ordinarily, in cases of concurrent jurisdiction, the decree of the court first having possession of the case is held conclusive, yet courts of chancery have not held themselves bound by decrees of the spiritual courts in cases of distribution, from their supposed inability to do entire justice.\u201d 1 Sto.

It is instituted 'in behalf of themselves and all other creditors who may come in and contribute. It is a general creditor\u2019s bill, accompanied by a charge of waste of assets, and negligent management by the administrator. The complaint describes the mortgages of the several creditors; alleges that before the institution of the suit a written suggestion of insolvency of the estate was filed in the county court of Jefferson county; that an order was made by said court requiring presentation to be made <em>of </em>all claims to the judge of said court, and that the claims of the creditors instituting this action have been proved and filed in the county court. It alleges waste and neglect upon the part of the administrator in the management of the assets, and affirms that upon a fair and just accounting, making all proper charges against the administrator, it will \u2018 be found that the estate is solvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Plaintiffs pray for an account; that the administration and settlement of the estate may be transferred to the Circuit Court; that the administrator may be charged for his alleged waste and mismanagement; that the several mortgaged premises may be sold and the proceeds applied to the mortgage debts, and for the application of the assets to the payment of the debts, and for a general settlement of the estate. To the complaint the defendant interposed a demurrer upon the ground that <em>\u201c </em>the matters therein complained of are now being examined into by a court of concurrent jurisdiction with the Circuit Court, to wit: the county court of Jefferson county, acting in its capacity as a court of probate.\u201d The demurrer was sustained and the bill dismissed. From this order this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Upon an examination of the constitutional grant of jurisdiction to the county court in the matter of the settlement \u00aef estates, it will be- found that its authority is confined to surrogate or probate powers, and that it is expressly provided that in no case shall it have jurisdiction where the jurisdiction will conflict with that of the several courts of record. The circuit court having been previously invested with full original chancery jurisdiction, it is clear that the county court cannot exercise any chancery power, unless the power is of such nature that it may be called as well a probate or surrogate power as a chancery power. Wherever, therefore, a surrogate or probate power is at the same time a chancery power, there is unquestionably concurrent jurisdiction in the two- courts, and wherever it is a purely chancery power, as contradistinguished from a surrogate or probate power, then the jurisdiction becomes exclusive. When we recollect that the settlement of estates is the fruitful source of accident, mistake, trust and fraud, and that the jurisdiction of the county court in this matter is for the most part limited to powers granted by statute, it must be clear as a general proposition that a court of equity cannot be limited in its jurisdiction, or prevented from its exercise in such matters, simply because an administrator has qualified and is 2n process of settlement of the estate in the county court. An account having been presented to an administrator and filed in the county court by a creditor, it certainly could not be insisted that such creditor could not bring a creditor\u2019s bill for that reason, nor could it be insisted that this credit- or, in case the debt was disputed, could not bring his action at law against the administrator, It must be conceded, however, that in the absence of special equities, the county and circuit courts have concurrent jurisdiction in the matter \u00aef the settlement of administrations, and that in such cases the tribunal which first takes cognizance of the matter in controversy will retain it to the exclusion of the other, unless for some special reason it is made to appear that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>probate conrrt cannot administer adequate and complete relief between tbe parties. 17 Ala., 794; 9 ib., 479; 13 ib., 144; 2 Stock. Chy., 287; 1 Green C. R., 239; 4 John. Ch., 410; 33 Ala., 241; Story\u2019s Eq., secs. 532, 541-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In this complaint creditors seek to surcharge and falsify the accounts of the administrator'. They charge him with delinquences and seek to recover for alleged waste and conversion of assets. These are unquestionably the proper subj ectsmatter of equity jurisdiction. 8 Port., 400; 2 Wms. Ex\u2019trs, 1104; 4 Cond. Eng. Ch., 94; 9 Port., 704; 15 Ala., 269; 3 Fla., 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Several of these creditors hold mortgages upon the real estate o\u00ed the deceased intestate, and it must be apparent that a court of equity is the proper tribunal to decree a strict foreclosure and sale. We are not prepared to say that if a sale of this property was directed by the county court, and the proceeds applied to the respective liens, that such pro-needing would be <em>coram nonjudioe. </em>On the contrary, after \u2022careful examination of the authorities, we incline to the opinion that such proceeding would be sustained, as it pertains to the settlement of the estate and is in one sense but the \u25a0sinjple payment of a debt. At the same time, it cannot be \u2022denied that the foreclosure of a mortgage is a matter which \u25a0does not belong to the jurisdiction of the county court. It is very difficult to define accurately the point from which Uie court of equity has exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Again, it is a reasonable inference from the allegations of the bill, that the defenses of the administrator to the charge \u2022of improper management and waste of assets are of an equitable character.</p>\n<p id=\"AqG\">Under all the circumstances, it seems clear that there are special reasons in this case why a court of chancery should take jurisdiction, and that the powers of the county'court are not adequate or sufficiently comprehensive and flexible to gender complete justice. 17 Ala., 795-6; 31 ib.. 213; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>4 John. Chy., 410; Story\u2019s Eq., sec. 543; 8 Port., 396;<em> 13 </em>Ala., 140; 2 Stock. Ch\u2019y, 287; 1 Green C. R., 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">These features of the case give the court of chancery jurisdiction, and having jurisdiction for one purpose, this will draw to it the right to' adjust the entire administration. 31 Ala., 213. The remarks of Mr. Justice Ormond, in Blakely, adm\u2019r et al. vs. the heirs of Blakely, we think cover this case entirely. Speaking for the court he says : \u201c Conceding that the jurisdiction of chancery is concurrent in testamentary matters \u25a0 with the orphan\u2019s court, and that the court which first obtains jurisdiction will be entitled to keep it, there are many \u25a0 cases in which the court of chancery may take jurisdiction after the proceedings have been commenced in the orphan\u2019s court, and having obtained jurisdiction for one purpose, retain it for all purposes and make final settlement.\u201d 9 Ala., 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">What should be the precise form of the decree or order here is a question which can best be determined after answer. We only decide that there are circumstances demanding the action of a court of equity, and that the demurrer should have been overruled. The judgment dismissing the bill and sustaining the demurrer\"is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
