Memorandum: The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the People <em>(see, People v Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620), was sufficient to support the conviction and the verdict was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>not contrary to the weight of the evidence <em>(see, People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 495).</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-3\">However, the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on reasonable doubt effectively reduced the People\u2019s burden of proof and thereby deprived defendant of a fair trial <em>(see, People v Freeman, </em>193 AD2d 1117 [decided herewith]; <em>People v Payne, </em>192 AD2d 1117; <em>People v Frank, </em>186 AD2d 977). Therefore, we reverse the judgment of conviction as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.15 [6]; <em>People v Freeman, supra; People v Payne, supra; People v Frank, supra). </em>Inasmuch as defendant was convicted of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree, the indictment must be dismissed without prejudice to the People to re-present any appropriate charge to another Grand Jury <em>(see, People v Gonzalez, </em>61 NY2d 633, 635).</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">In view of our determination, we do not address defendant\u2019s remaining contentions.
