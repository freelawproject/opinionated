Hamilton, the lessee of a gasoline filling station property, to recover by way of sub-rogation the amount which it paid its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>insured, E. P. Woods, the owner-lessor of the property, for the loss he sustained on account of the destruction of his filling station building and equipment by an explosion and fire due to the negligence of employees of defendant, Joel M. Hamilton.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The District Judge granted a partial summary judgment in favor of the insurance company, on the issues of negligence and proximate cause, but held that the issue as to whether the employees of defendant, Joel M. Hamilton, were acting in his behalf or in behalf of the owner-lessor, E. P. Woods, at the time of the fire, was not resolved by the record, and therefore he overruled the motion for summary judgment on the issue of agency. D.C., 253 F.Supp. 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The case was tried before a jury solely on the issue of whether Hamilton\u2019s manager Stipes was acting for his employer or for the lessor Woods at the time of the fire. At the close of all of the evidence, plaintiff\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was denied. The court submitted a single interrogatory to the jury requiring a special finding on this issue. The jury, in answer to the interrogatory, found that Stipes was acting for the lessor Woods, and the Court then dismissed the complaint and later denied a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">We hold that there is no evidence in the record to support the finding of the jury that Stipes was acting for Woods at the time of the fire, and that it was error to submit the issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Woods, the insured owner of the filling station property, leased it for a period of one year to Hamilton, by written lease a copy of which is appended to this opinion. Hamilton operated the filling station through his manager Stipes, who was paid a salary of fifty dollars per week and fifty per cent of the profits. Hamilton, in his testimony, referred to their arrangement as a partnership. In any event, Stipes had full authority to operate the filling station, which was open for business twenty-four hours a day, to hire and discharge employees, and to purchase and pay for supplies. Hamilton's wife kept the books and wrote checks in payment of bills. She was at the station frequently. Stipes hired three employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">On two or three occasions before the fire, the \u201cboys\u201d at the filling station asked Woods for his consent to remove some asphalt tile from the cement floor in a small area of the building. Water had seeped from the toilet and penetrated underneath the tile and an odor was emanating therefrom. Woods told them that he preferred to leave the tile here.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">On the day of the fire, manager Stipes again contacted Woods by telephone to ask his consent to remove the tile, and told him it would not cost him anything. Stipes said: \u201cIt would make it nicer.\u201d Woods told him: \u201cIf it would make you guys happier, take if off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">Stipes and the other employees proceeded to remove the tile. In order to loosen the tar adhesive, they applied gasoline. An explosion and fire resulted, which destroyed the building and equipment. Hamilton disclaimed all knowledge that the tile was being removed by his manager and other employees. It was stipulated that the insurance company paid the owner-lessor for the loss in the entire amount of fifteen thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">In the absence of an agreement, there was no obligation on the part of the landlord to keep the demised premises in repair or to make any changes or alterations. King &amp; Metzger v. Cassell, 150 Ky. 537, 150 S.W. 682, 42 L.R.A.,N.S., 774 (1912). The law imposes a duty on the tenant to take ordinary care of the premises. Campbell v. W. M. Ritter Lumber Co., 140 Ky. 312, 131 S.W. 20 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">In the present case, the lease specifically imposed an obligation on the part of the tenant to keep the premises, the buildings and equipment, in good condition and repair. It further provided that no changes or alterations could be made without the written con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>sent of the lessor. Evidently, because he may have believed that consent was necessary, manager Stipes asked the lessor for permission to remove the tile. All the lessor did in this case was to give his consent. The lessor, by merely giving his consent, did not constitute the lessee\u2019s manager and all of the lessee\u2019s other employees as agents of lessor to make the repairs. The lease expressly provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\">\u201c* * * [N] either the Lessee nor any other persons employed by him shall be deemed or considered employees or agents of the Lessor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The premises were in the exclusive possession and control of the lessee at the time of the explosion and fire and the manager and other employees of lessee were under his control. In removing the tile, they were not doing anything that they had been requested to do by the lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\"> It was not competent to vary or change the written lease by parol evidence, although appellee attempted to do so. The fact that the owner-lessor had on occasion made some repairs on the pumps and had donated paint to lessee did not change or modify the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The lease further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">\u201cUpon termination of this lease, Lessee shall deliver immediate possession of said premises, equipment and fixtures in the same good condition as when received, ordinary wear and tear and unavoidable damage by fire or elements excepted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">This contractual obligation was in conformity with the common law of Kentucky. Campbell v. W. M. Ritter Lumber Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">The fire was not unavoidable, but was caused by the negligence of the lessee\u2019s employees, as the District Court found. 253 F.Supp. 752. In our opinion, they were acting for their employer, the lessee, at the time of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded for entry of judgment against the appellee in the amount of fifteen thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"AiR\">E. P. WOODS</p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">Service Station Lease Agreement [GULF]</p>\n<p id=\"b158-15\">THIS LEASE made this 1st day of January, 1960 between E. P.
