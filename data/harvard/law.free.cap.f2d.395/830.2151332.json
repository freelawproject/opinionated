The two entities will hereinafter be called the employer and the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">We narrate the events which led up to the instant appeal to this court. The union filed a petition with the Board pursuant to \u00a7 159 of Title 29, United States Code, requesting the Board to certify the union as the sole collective bargaining agent for a certain unit of the company\u2019s employees. As not infrequently occurs, the parties entered into a written agreement for a \u201cconsent election,\u201d instead of going through what is sometimes a rather ponderous hearing at which evidence is taken concerning the jurisdiction of the Board, the appropriate unit of employees to be included in the election if an election is ordered by the Board, and perhaps other pertinent matters. In this case there were no such unresolved problems and the parties, as we have said, agreed that the sentiment of the employees as to whether or not they desired to be represented by the petitioning union might be determined in an election to be conducted by the Board\u2019s Regional Director, under the Board\u2019s rules applicable to consent elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The election agreement, signed by the employer and the union and approved by the Regional Director, was a stereotyped document, the language of which had frequently been used by the Board in similar circumstances. We quote the pertinent parts of the agreement, italicizing some of its language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-6\">1. SECRET BALLOT * * * Said election shall be held in accordance with the National Labor Relations Act, the Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations, and the applicable procedures and policies of the Board, provided that the determinations of the Regional Director shall be final and binding <em>wpon any question, </em>including questions as to the eligibility of voters, raised by any party hereto relating <em>in any manner to the election </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-7\">6. OBJECTIONS, CHALLENGES, REPORTS THEREON</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax3\">Objections to the conduct of the election or conduct affecting the results of the election, or to a determination based on the results thereof, may be filed with the Regional Director within 5 days after the issuance of the Tally of Ballots * * * The Regional Director shall investigate the matters contained in the objections and issue a report thereon. * * * The method of investigation of objections and challenges, including the question whether a hearing should be held in connection therewith, shall be determined by the Regional Director, whose decision shall be final and binding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">The election took place on October 28, 1966. The union and the employer, both of which had had observers present at the election, signed certificates that the election had been fairly conducted. The votes were counted and there were 90 votes for the union and 73 against it, and two challenged ballots. On November 4 the company filed an objection to the election as the election agreement authorized it to do. The stated ground for the objection was that the union had promised numerous employees that initiation fees would be waived if the union won the election. The Regional Director made a full investigation and, on December 1, 1966, a report, as the election agreement required. He overruled the employer\u2019s objection and stated in his report that the union had told employees that initiation fees for all employees would be reduced if the union won the election, and had told them that the union, in the past, had reduced initiation fees when a large group of employees had joined the union at the same time. He stated in his report that the union\u2019s promises were not objectionable because the employees understood that any reduction in the initiation fee would apply to all employees who joined the union, rgardless of how any individual employee voted in the election. Having overruled the company\u2019s objection, the Regional Director <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>certified the union as the sole collective bargaining agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">On December 19, 1966, the union requested the employer to meet with it for the purpose of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement. The employer by letter dated December 28, 1966, refused to enter into collective bargaining negotiations, for the stated reason that it did not believe that the election reflected the free choice of its employees and that the Regional Director\u2019s certification was therefore invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The union thereupon filed a \u201ccharge\u201d with the Board, which is the proper move on the part of a union which seeks to initiate an unfair labor practice proceeding. It charged that the employer had refused to bargain with it, although it was the certified collective bargaining-agent of the employees, and had thereby violated \u00a7 8(a) (5) of the Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S. Code \u00a7 158(a) (5), which makes an unjustified refusal to bargain an unfair labor practice, and had also, by its refusal to bargain, violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act, 29 U.S. Code \u00a7 158(a) (1), which makes interference, restraint or coercion of employees in the exercise of their rights under the Act an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The Regional Director issued a \u201ccomplaint\u201d upon the union\u2019s charge, which is the proper next step if the Regional Director regards the charge as well founded. The employer filed its answer to the complaint, denying that it had committed the alleged unfair labor practice, and giving the reason which we have stated hereinbefore for refusing to bargain with the union. The General Counsel made a motion requesting the Board to issue a summary judgment holding that the employer had violated its duty to bargain collectively with the union, and ordering it to bargain. The Board served a notice on the employer to show cause why a summary judgment should not be rendered. The employer responded to this notice, giving the same reason that it had given before for refusing to bargain with the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">The Board refused to pass upon the merits of the Regional Director\u2019s decision, that decision, as we have seen, being that the union\u2019s pre-election statements to the employees about a reduction of initiation fees was not, in the circumstances, a valid basis for an objection by the employer to the election. The Board noted that the employer had agreed in the consent election agreement to be bound by the findings and conclusions of the Regional Director on objections to the election. We have quoted the text of the consent election agreement hereinbefore. The Board recognized that an implied exception to the finalty provisions of the agreement would be applicable if the objector alleged and proved that the Regional Director\u2019s determinations were arbitrary or capricious. The employer in the instant case did not assert before the Board, nor does it assert here, that the Regional Director in making his determination was arbitrary or capricious or that his determination was not in conformity with the Board policies or the provisions of the Act. In N.L.R.B. v. Hood Corporation, 346 F.2d 1020, 1022-1023, this court held that in such circumstances the Regional Director\u2019s determination, made pursuant to a consent election agreement comparable to the one involved in the instant case, cannot be overturned by a court. See also N.L.R.B. v. Cadillac Steel Products Corp., 355 F.2d 191, 192 (CA 9) ; N.L.R.B. v. Sumner Sand and Gravel Co., 293 F.2d 754, 755 (CA 9); N.L.R.B. v. Carlton Wood Products Co., 201 F.2d 863, 867, 36 A.L.R. 2d 1170 (CA 9). The purpose of the courts in refraining from reviewing determinations made by Regional Directors on objections to Labor Board elections is discussed in N.L.R.B. v. J. W. Rex Co., 243 F.2d 356, 358 (CA 3). That purpose is, of course, to provide for the final settlement without delay of disputes concerning objections to such elections. When the parties have, as in the instant case, entered into a consent election agreement, they have done so for the purpose expressed by the court in the Rex case.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>The language of the consent election agreement, quoted supra herein, is comprehensive. It gives to the Regional Director the power to make a final and binding determination \u201cupon any question * * * raised by any party hereto relating in any manner to the election.\u201d The employer, seeking to narrow the powers of the Regional Director, quotes language of this court in the case of N.L.R.B. v. Hood Corporation, 346 F.2d 1020, 1022, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-4\">It is well settled that where a consent agreement is entered into providing that the determination of the Regional Director on any question shall be final and binding, the procedural and substantive determinations thereafter made by the Regional Director can be successfully challenged only by a showing that they are arbitrary or capricious or not in conformity with the National Labor Relations Board policies or the provisions of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The employer would read the words \u201cprocedural and substantive\u201d as a commendable example of meticulous care by this court to refrain from saying more than it intended to say. It would read the words \u201cprocedural and substantive\u201d as words of limitation, rather than words of grant. Its theory is that its objection is based upon a question of fact decided erroneously by the Regional Director and that questions of fact are not included within this court\u2019s language, \u201cprocedural and substantive,\u201d used in the Hood case. This proposed reading is a notable example of looking at the bright side of the subject under scrutiny. But the words will not bear the suggested interpretation. When a tribunal has the power to finally decide the procedural and substantive questions involved in a case, it has the power to decide the case, or, as the consent election agreement said, \u201cany question * * * relating in any manner\u201d to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">That the employer had refused to bargain was undisputed. Its asserted justification for the refusal was without merit. Its refusal interfered with, re-strained, and coerced the union in the exercise of its rights under the Act. The employer thus violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act. Full enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
