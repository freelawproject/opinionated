We are satisfied, however, that plaintiff was not prejudiced thereby; and in oral argument, plaintiff stated his willingness to have us proceed to the merits of the appeal, rather than to decide it on procedural grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-27\">Proceeding, therefore, to the merits, we conclude from our study of the record that the district judge correctly determined that in its publication \u201cdefendant merely carried an accurate account of a matter of public interest and concern\u201d and that \u201c[djefendant report<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>ed what had actually taken place.\u201d For this reason, the entry of judgment for defendant was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
