The trial court, of course, charged the jury that this evidence could be considered only \u201cin determining the credibility of [Robinson\u2019s] testimony when he took the stand and testified in the trial of the case today; then it has that limited function only\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">We do not need to decide whether the evidence of this previous conviction dealt with a matter so remote as to render it inadmissible if standing alone, because there was further evidence of a conviction in 1960 for a liquor violation, which the jury could consider in conjunction with the earlier conviction as bearing on the credibility of Robinson as a witness in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
