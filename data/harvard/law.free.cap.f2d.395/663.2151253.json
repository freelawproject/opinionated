First, the \u201cno action\u201d (unless a request by 25% of the bondholders) clause of the Indenture applies as a bar to the action. Sutter v. Hudson Coal Co., 259 App.Div. 1053, 21 N.Y.S.2d 40 (2d Dept. 1940); Relmar Holding Co. v. Paramount Publix Corp., 147 Misc. 824, 263 N.Y.S. 776 (Sup.Ct.1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Second, there is no issue of fact as to a merger. The ICC\u2019s approval of the use of joint facilities<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was not approval of a merger as prescribed by law, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5(2) (a), (4), or of the assumption by C &amp; O of B &amp; O\u2019s obligations. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 20a(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">The motion to amend the complaint was properly denied. See opinion below. 261 F.Supp. 728 (S.D.N.Y.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">In addition, appellants have conceded that on May 1, 1968 all accumulated interest from 1961 to 1967 inclusive was paid, thus removing any factual foundation for the first cause of action and rendering their claims to such interest moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b712-21\"><em>. </em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co.
