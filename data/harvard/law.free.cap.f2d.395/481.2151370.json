On May 16, 1966, the Board filed a petition for adjudication in civil contempt, alleging violations of the 1959 and 1964 decrees. A special master was appointed to hear evidence and make findings as to whether the Company acted in contempt of this Court\u2019s decrees during a 1965 union drive. After exhaustive hearings, findings by the special master, the filing of exceptions to these findings, and the filing of full briefs by the parties, the case comes to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\"> Alamo is an express company in Texas, having terminals in Galveston, Houston, San Antonio, Laredo, Harlingen, Brownsville, Corpus Christi, and Sinton. The master found that Donald Aldrete, terminal manager in Laredo, committed serious violations of Fifth Circuit decrees and that Alamo should be held in contempt insofar as his actions were concerned. Because of Aldrete\u2019s discriminatory conduct, the master recommended reinstatement with backpay for employee Santiago Ancira. On the other hand, he dismissed most of the charges filed by the Board as having no merit. Before the master, the Board was required to establish civil contempt by clear and convincing evidence. NLRB v. Standard Trouser Co., 4th Cir. 1947, 162 F.2d 1012. The master\u2019s findings of fact are binding on this Court unless clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P., Rule 53 (e) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\"> We agree with the master that there was clear and convincing evidence of flagrant labor violations by Donald Aldrete. The record strongly suggests that just before the 1965 Teamsters election he hired Santiago Ancira and some other temporary employees in order to build antiunion voting strength. He told these men they would be able to keep their temporary jobs longer if the union lost. After the union won and Ancira had given testimony against Aldrete in a Labor Board proceeding, the former was discharged. The alleged reason for discharge was that he drove a truck without company authorization and had a wreck. The master was unable to believe this was the sole reason for Ancira\u2019s being fired because there was testimony that a man would not ordinarily be fired for that kind of thing and also because an employee named Velazquez, who unaccountably told Ancira to drive the truck, was not fired. We agree with the master that Ancira was the victim of a discriminatory discharge, that he should be reinstated with backpay,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Alamo should be held in civil contempt because of Aldrete\u2019s conduct. The company argues that his conduct was too isolated to serve as a basis for adjudication in civil contempt, but we are unable to dismiss his actions so lightly. They represent flagrant transgressions of previous Fifth Circuit decrees by a significant company official.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Even though the master recommended adjudication in civil contempt, the Board urges us to override his dismissal of numerous allegations. These allegations concerned the campaign tactics of the terminal managers and anti-union campaign speeches delivered by Alamo\u2019s President, Mrs. J. L. Walker, and its Vice Presidents, H. O. Walker and L. W. Stephens. As to some of these charges, the master simply made credibility determinations adverse to the Board\u2019s position. In other instances, he found that remarks or speeches by company officials did not go beyond the pale of free speech as protected by section 8 (c) of the Act. No useful purpose would be served by a detailed analysis of each of these charges. Suffice it to say that we do not think the master\u2019s fact findings are clearly erroneous and are not persuaded of the necessity to override his dismissal of numerous allegations. The Board and this Court have an adequate remedy in the Order to be entered pursuant to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The findings and conclusions of the master are AFFIRMED in all respects.Respondents are adjudged in civil contempt of this Court\u2019s previous decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">ORDERED, that the Report of the Special Master appointed herein, recommending that the respondents be adjudged in civil contempt, is hereby ap-. proved and adopted by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">ORDERED, that respondents, Alamo Express, Inc., and Alamo Cartage Company, are accordingly hereby adjudged in civil contempt of the decrees of this \u2022 Court entered June 22, 1959 and July 10, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED, that said respondents Alamo Express, Inc., and Alamo Cartage Company, as said companies, and as acting through their officers, agents, successors, and assigns, shall forthwith purge themselves of such contempt by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-11\">1.

As an alternative to reinstatement with backpay, the master suggested that Alamo might be required to pay Ancira $1,000. We have elected the traditional remedy\u2014 reinstatement with backpay.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
