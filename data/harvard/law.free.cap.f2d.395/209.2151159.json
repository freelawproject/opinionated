Viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the appellee, as we must, we cannot say that there was insufficient evidence to warrant submission of the case to the jury on the issue of discovered peril, as contended by the appellant. There is no merit in the appellant\u2019s criticism of the trial court\u2019s supplemental charge which appellant likens to the \u201cAllen or dynamite\u201d charge in criminal cases. Reading the charge as a whole, as we must, we find no reversible errors in the manner in which the case was submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-22\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
