KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">The determination of guilt or innocence without trial has received increasing attention in recent years. . This appeal raises yet another question of the circumstances in which a defendant will be bound by his plea of guilty in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Appellant Adrian Rosa is now serving a sentence of imprisonment of from 7y2 to 10 years under a judgment of conviction entered in Supreme Court, Bronx County, Gellinoff, J., on his plea of guilty to robbery in the second degree. Having exhausted available state remedies, he applied for a writ of habeas corpus which was denied by Chief Judge Sugarman without a hearing. Appellant now advances two grounds why the writ should have issued: he contends that his plea was not \u201cvoluntary\u201d because induced by the promise of the trial judge to impose a particular sentence and that he should have been permitted to withdraw his guilty plea and reinstate his earlier plea of not guilty of first degree robbery. Our review of the record convinces us that Rosa was not deprived of any right cognizable on federal habeas corpus and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The basic facts can be briefly stated. In 1960 Rosa and two others were convicted after a trial by jury of robbery in the first degree. Rosa was sentenced to from 15 to 22 years\u2019 imprisonment but his conviction, along with that of one of his co-defendants, Colon, was reversed by the Appellate Division because of prejudicial remarks made by the prosecutor during his summation. People v. Rosa, 14 A.D.2d 741, 220 N.Y.S.2d 138, 139 (1st Dept. 1961) (court specifically noting that proof of guilt was \u201cpersuasive\u201d). Accordingly, Rosa and Colon were scheduled to be retried under the original indictment before Judge Gellinoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Represented by able counsel and undoubtedly aware of the probable result if they again went before a jury, both men entered into plea negotiations with the prosecution. These ended in the apparent satisfaction \u2014 at least at the time \u2014 of all concerned and on September 28, 1962, Rosa and Colon moved, through their respective counsel, to change their pleas from not guilty of robbery in the first degree to guilty of robbery in the second degree. Judge Gellinoff, obviously aware of the need for \u201ca penetrating and comprehensive examination of the circumstances under which [a guilty] plea is tendered,\u201d Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 323, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948), stated that he would accept the pleas only if the defendants were in fact guilty and that he would \u201cput on the record the sentence that [he was] going to impose.\u201d The prosecutor then described the prior proceedings in the case, the details of the alleged robbery, and what had transpired during the negotiations:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-11\">The Assistant District Attorney: I have been in consultation with Mr. Guff of the Legal Aid Society on behalf of Colon, and with Mrs. Steinbock, on behalf of Rosa, and I have made an offer to those defendants to which they have just pleaded. [Sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-12\">I further told Mrs. Steinbock that I would recommend to the Court the sentences of seven and a half to ten years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-13\">The Court: Seven and a half for each?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-14\">The Assistant District Attorney: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-15\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-16\">The Court: Is robbery in the second degree the kind of conviction where I can sentence for so little, seven and a half to ten?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-17\">The Assistant District Attorney: Yes, Judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-18\">Rosa and Colon confirmed the prosecutor\u2019s account and admitted their participation in the crime as charged. Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>this record, Judge Gellinoff proceeded to inform both men that he would accept the prosecutor\u2019s recommendations \u2014 he would sentence them to imprisonment of from <em>7y2 </em>to 10 years on their pleas of guilty to the lesser offense of second degree robbery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, after the trial judge was satisfied that both men were acting voluntarily, the formal pleas were taken, the defendants sworn and their pedigrees recorded. Sentencing was set for October 5, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Given a full week to contemplate his fate, Rosa lost the enthusiasm for a plea of guilty he had so clearly shown earlier and accordingly asked his attorney to withdraw his plea of guilty. In accordance with Rosa\u2019s instructions, when the ease was called for sentencing his attorney told the court that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">The defendant advises me that when he pleaded guilty the last time we appeared in this court after consulting with me and after being informed by me of the recommendation that would be made by the District Attorney as to the sentence, and the Court having said that it would follow the District Attorney\u2019s recommendation, the defendant feels that after thinking it over after that last appearance in Court, that he was acting hastily on the basis of trying to help his co-defendant Colon by permitting him to get the lesser sentence in view of Colon\u2019s proved participation in the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-18\">But, believing this maneuver by Rosa a deliberate one so that the state would be prevented from presenting its ease against both defendants as it had contemplated before the pleas were changed to guilty, the prosecutor refused to consent to the change of plea, unless Colon also withdrew his plea to the lesser offense and agreed to stand trial with Rosa for robbery in the first degree. Colon, however, apparently quite content with his comparatively short sentence, was disinclined to join Rosa\u2019s maneuvers. Faced with the different desires of the two defendants and the certainty that Rosa\u2019s plea was voluntary in every respect, Judge Gellinoff refused to permit Rosa to reinstate his plea of not guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>and sentenced both men to state prison for <em>7Y2 </em>to 10 years \u2014 as he had stated clearly he would the previous week.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"> It is fundamental that when a defendant enters a plea of guilty he waives the most important right known to our system of criminal law \u2014 the right to be adjudged innocent or guilty by his peers upon the evidence presented in open court. The effect of a plea of guilty that meets constitutional standards is determinative: \u201cit is itself a conviction. Like a verdict of a jury it is conclusive. More is not required; the court has nothing to do but give judgment and sentence.\u201d Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 223, 47 S.Ct. 582, 583, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1926). To insure that the right to a trial is not undermined by mechanical and ritualistic acceptances of guilty pleas, the Supreme Court has emphasized that a valid plea cannot be \u201cinduced by promises or threats which deprive it of the character of a voluntary act,\u201d Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 493, 82 S.Ct. 510, 513, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962), and must be made only \u201cafter proper advice and with full understanding of the consequences,\u201d Kercheval v. United States, supra, 274 U.S. at 223, 47 S.Ct. at 583. The lower courts have therefore been enjoined to examine with a most critical eye the circumstances surrounding a plea of guilty. See Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948). Moreover, in recent years there has been a growing awareness of the practical importance of plea discussions and arrangements to the administration of justice. Inquiries by scholars have shown that approximately 90 per cent of all convictions are the result of guilty</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">pleas, see, e. g., Newman, Conviction: The Determination of Guilt or Innocence Without Trial 3 (1966), and detailed studies have suggested rules and procedures governing the acceptance of such pleas, e. g., American Bar Association Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Pleas of Guilty (Tent. Draft 1967). Accordingly, this court has gone to great lengths to protect against convictions based upon guilty pleas due to coercion, misunderstanding or general confusion. See, e. g., United States ex rel. McGrath v. LaVallee, 319 F.2d 308 (2d Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">Even under the close scrutiny afforded guilty pleas, the instant appeal would present nothing more than a typical and obviously fair example of a voluntary and knowing plea were it not for Judge Gellinoff\u2019s action in informing Rosa of the specific sentence he would impose. Rosa does not maintain that his conviction must be reversed merely because of his agreement with the prosecutor. Such a contention would lack all merit for, as the Fifth Circuit recently has noted, \u201cno federal court has held that a guilty plea induced by a <em>prosecutor\u2019s </em>promise for that reason alone is involuntary.\u201d Brown v. Beto, 377 F.2d 950, 953 (1967) (emphasis in original). Indeed, if attended by proper safeguards and subjected to comprehensive examination, this court has perceived no bar \u2014 either in the words of the Constitution or in notions of fundamental fairness \u2014 to convictions based upon plea arrangements with the prosecutor. See, e. g., United States v. Hughes, 223 F.Supp. 477 (S.D. N.Y.1963), aff\u2019d, 325 F.2d 789 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 907, 84 S.Ct. 1167, 12 L.Ed.2d 178 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Instead, Rosa contends that his plea of guilty was involuntary because induced by Judge Gellinoff\u2019s alleged participation in the plea bargaining and promise to sentence him to a specific term of imprisonment. As we read the record, however, it is clear that the plea discussions were between the prosecutor and Rosa and his counsel. In no meaningful sense can Judge Gellinoff be said to have participated in the negotiations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the contrary, the trial judge had to be informed of what had transpired and the record suggests that he was surprised by the prosecutor\u2019s recommended sentence. Since Rosa had already moved to withdraw his not guilty plea and to plead guilty when Judge Gellinoff told him of the precise sentence he would receive, we conclude, as did the District Court, that knowledge of what the sentence would be did not induce the plea. We need not search far for an adequate explanation of Rosa\u2019s decision to plead guilty: in light of the result of his previous trial and the Appellate Division\u2019s characterization of the evidence against him, he undoubtedly concluded that \u201cit was to his own best interest not to stand trial.\u201d United States v. Hughes, supra, 223 F.Supp. at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In any event, we would be hesitant to hold that the mere participation of the trial judge in any aspect of plea negotiations \u2014 no matter how tangential and unlikely to be coercive \u2014 necessarily renders a plea of guilty involuntary. True, as has frequently been noted, the trial judge is in a paramount position vis-a-vis the accused ; unlike the prosecutor, he has substantial control over the trial and can (generally) impose sentence within a broad discretionary range. See, e. g., Pleas of Guilty, supra, at 72-74; Comment, 32 U.Chi.L.Rev. 167, 180-83 (1964). See also United States ex rel. Elksnis v. Gilligan, 256 F.Supp. 244, 254 (S.D.N.Y.1966) (dictum).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Also, the judge must always remain impartial and capable of objectively determining the voluntariness of the plea. Cf. Von Moltke v. Gillies, supra. The issue ultimately to be resolved is not so much who participated in the plea discussions but whether the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty was coerced or otherwise invalid. And, that determination can be made only after a careful examination of the facts in each particular ease. While we certainly adhere to the proposition that a trial judge must always act with full awareness of the awesome power of his office, this court has held that the participation of the trial judge in plea discussions does not <em>in itself </em>render the plea involuntary. See United States ex rel. McGrath v. LaVallee, 348 F.2d 373 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 952, 86 S.Ct. 1214, 16 L.Ed.2d 214 (1966). Compare Pleas of Guilty, supra, at 74 (trial judge may indicate his concurrence in the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation prior to the time the defendant enters his plea where, as here, the plea would be to a lesser included offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">Moreover, we fail to perceive in what respect Rosa was coerced, prejudiced or unfairly treated by being told what sentence would be imposed. We cannot blind ourselves to the fact that \u201cit is not at all unusual for the prosecutor to predict the sentence with a high degree of accuracy and to communicate this prediction to the defendant.\u201d Newman, Conviction, supra, at 48. Compare Dewey v. United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>268 F.2d 124 (8th Cir. 1959). And, every defense attorney plays the prophet as best he can. In the instant case, Rosa was fortunate in being given the security of the Judge\u2019s beneficence by learning immediately what most defendants are tortured over, can only hope for and anticipate \u2014 that the trial judge will follow the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation. Indeed, there is not a scintilla of evidence that suggests that Judge Gellinoff pressured or coerced Rosa to plead guilty or did anything more than inform him of the sentence that would be imposed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rosa\u2019s real complaint against Judge Gel-linoff is that he took more seriously than some commentators feel appropriate the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that a plea must be made only \u201cafter proper advice and with full understanding of the consequences,\u201d Kercheval v. United States, supra, 274 U.S. at 223, 47 S.Ct. at 583. See Pleas of Guilty, supra, 73-74. Cf. United States ex rel. McGrath v. LaVal-lee, supra, 348 F.2d at 376 (judge\u2019s remarks not \u201can enticement or threat by means of a prior commitment by the judge to the prisoner\u2019s sentence, but * * * merely a fair description of the consequences attendant upon the prisoner\u2019s choice of plea, a description that was manifestly essential to an informed decision on [his] part\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The record affords additional support for our conclusion that Rosa\u2019s plea was not improperly induced by any action or word of Judge Gellinoff. When, at the sentencing hearing, Rosa moved to reinstate his plea of not guilty to first degree robbery, his stated reason was that \u201che was acting hastily on the basis of trying to help his co-defendant Colon by permitting him to get the lesser sentence in view of Colon\u2019s proved participation in the crime.\u201d Although advised by able and experienced counsel, it is noteworthy that Rosa did not maintain that Judge Gellinoff had coerced or otherwise improperly induced his plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In sum, Judge Sugarman found that Rosa\u2019s plea stemmed from his own free choice, uninfluenced by threat or promise. We hold that this conclusion is amply supported by the evidence and in no event is \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d See United States ex rel. McGrath v. LaVallee, 348 F.2d at 376, and at 319 F.2d 315 (concurring opinion); United States ex rel. Crump v. Sain, 295 F.2d 699 (7th Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 830, 82 S.Ct. 845, 7 L.Ed.2d 794 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\"> Finally, Rosa\u2019s contention that he should have been permitted to withdraw his guilty plea at sentencing requires little comment. Even in federal trials, if a plea of guilty has been knowingly and voluntarily made, \u201cpermission to withdraw the plea may be granted at the discretion of the trial court and a denial thereof is reversible only if it appears that there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d United States v. Lester, 247 F.2d 496, 500 (2d Cir. 1957). See also Kercheval v. United States, supra, 274 U.S. at 224, 47 S.Ct. 582; United States v. Hughes, 325 F.2d 789, 792 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 907, 84 S.Ct. 1167, 12 L.Ed.2d 178 (1964). A <em>fortiori, </em>on an application for habeas corpus by a state prisoner, our review is premised on the fact that the motion for withdrawal of the plea rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge. United States ex rel. Best v. Fay, 239 F.Supp. 632, 634 (S.D. N.Y.1965), aff\u2019d, 365 F.2d 832 (2d Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 998, 87 S.Ct. 1319, 18 L.Ed.2d 347 (1967). In the instant case, no valid ground was presented for Rosa\u2019s requested change of plea, see Pleas of Guilty, supra, \u00a7 2.1, and there is no reason to believe that any injustice has been done. See and compare Jones v. Eyman, 353 F.2d 528 (9th Cir. 1966); United States ex rel. Elksnis v. Gilligan, supra. Under the circumstances, whether to permit withdrawal of the plea was within the state trial judge\u2019s discretion which clearly was not abused. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>ingly, we refuse to upset his decision on federal habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The court wishes to express its appreciation to Gerald W. Griffin, Esq., for his capable representation of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\">. The prosecutor indicated that he would file with the court the necessary statement explaining his reasons for recommending that the court accept the plea of guilty to the lesser offense, see N.Y.Code Crim.Proc. \u00a7 342-a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\">. The following discussion illustrates the painstaking care taken by the trial judge to insure that the pleas of guilty conformed to constitutional standards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\">The Court: All right. Now, look, Mr. Rosa and Mr. Colon. Everything is going to be put on the record. I\u2019m even going to put on the record the sentence that I am going to impose, because this is not a new case and the Court knows about this, and the Court is going to accept the plea, but with one condition, that you\u2019re guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-9\">If you still maintain your innocence, I\u2019m not going to take the plea. I don\u2019t want any questions later on. I don\u2019t want any questions about promises or about coercion, that you were sold a bill of goods or that you were talked into it. Do we understand each other? I\u2019m going to tell you the sentence you\u2019re going to get, because I know. Now, is that agreeable to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-12\">Defendant Rosa: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-13\">Defendant Colon: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-14\">The Court: Now, first let me hear something from the District Attorney. The District Attorney is going to tell me about the case for the record. Then I\u2019m going to ask you, and don\u2019t lie to me \u2014 if you\u2019re not guilty, say you\u2019re not guilty; if you\u2019re guilty, say you\u2019re guilty, and we will get rid of this case and start you on the road to rehabilitation. You will do certain time and then maybe you can become useful citizens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-20\">* * * * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-21\">The Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-22\">Well, now, Rosa and Colon, each of you\u2019ve heard what the District Attorney has said; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-23\">Defendant Rosa: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-24\">Defendant Colon: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-25\">The Court: I mean you participated in this crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-26\">Defendant Rosa: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-27\">The Court: How about you, Colon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-28\">Defendant Colon: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-29\">The Court: You did participate in this crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-30\">Defendant Colon: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-31\">The Court: The Court is going to accept the District Attorney\u2019s recommendation. The Court is going to sentence each one of you to seven and a half minimum and ten years m\u00e1ximum. That will be done on the day of sentence. We have certain formalities.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b772-5\">. In explaining his decision, Judge Gellinoff stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">* * * Counsel insisted on certain commitments from the Court before counsel would advise you [Rosa] to take the plea. The Court was unwilling to give any commitments, but after a great deal of consideration, and after investigating the record and acquainting himself with the facts * * * the Court decided to accept this lesser plea * * * and did do that which the Court has never done before, and that in open Court say to you on the record that it was the Court\u2019s intention to sentence you to seven and one half to ten years, and the Court questioned you in open Court as to whether or not you were taking the plea of your own free will. 9fv</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b773-6\">. There is some indication that Judge Gel-linoff was aware of the content of the plea negotiations before Rosa moved to plead guilty, see note 3, supra, but he specifically stated that he was \u201cunwilling to give any commitments\u201d and it is obvious that he informed Rosa of the sentence he would impose only after the motion was made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\">. AAHiile some of the dicta in <em>Elksnis </em>lends support of Rosa\u2019s position, that case was correctly decided on its facts. Two essential elements present in <em>Elksnis </em>are missing hero: the trial court conferred informally with Elksnis and promised a specific term <em>if </em>he would change his plea from not guilty of murder in the second degree to guilty of manslaughter in the first degree; and, the court imposed a longer imprisonment than had been promised because after the plea was changed the court learned that Elksnis was a second felony offender.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b774-7\">.
