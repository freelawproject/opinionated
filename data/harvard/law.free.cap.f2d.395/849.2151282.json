A motion for a stay was heard and denied. Appellant then undertook an appeal to this Court without a certificate of the District Judge under the provisions of 28 U.S.C.A., \u00a7 1292(b) and without applying to this Court within ten days of the order for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-23\">We view this order as being, to all intents and purposes, no more than a subpoena duces tecum. The documents have been sent for in sealed form and ordered to be held that way. This was \u201conly a step in the orderly procedure of the case\u201d, it was not an injunction, and the order is therefore not appealable, O\u2019Malley v. Chrysler Corp., 7 Cir., 1947, 160 F.2d 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-24\">Appellant\u2019s motion for mandamus relief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-25\">Appeal dismissed and writ of mandamus denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
