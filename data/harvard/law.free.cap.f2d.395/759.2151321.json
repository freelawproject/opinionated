Texas and New Orleans Railroad Co., La.App., 169 So. 254. In that case, in discussing old Section 691 of the Revised Statutes of 1870, which now appears as 45 Revised Statutes, \u00a7 324,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">\u201cAct No. 157 of 1910, amending Section 691 of the Revised Statutes, requires railroads to <em>keep </em>the crossings over public highways in such condition as not to hinder, impede, or obstruct its safe and convenient use of such highways. A failure on the part of a railroad to <em>keep </em>such crossing in repair thereby causing injury to a traveler on such road, renders the railroad liable in damages. Darby v. New Orleans, T. &amp; M. R. Co., 139 La. 213, 71 So. 490; Jones v. Tremont Lumber Co., 139 La. 616, 71 So. 862; Vandevender v. New Iberia &amp; N. R. Co., La.App., 162 So. 601. The duty <em>to keep the crossing in repair is a continuing duty </em>on the railroad to be discharged whenever the condition of the crossing is in need of repair in order for it to be safe and convenient to the traveling public. Darby v. New Orleans, T. &amp; M. R.R. Co., supra; Corpus Juris, Vol. 52, par. 1778, p. 182.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">It is thus clear that where a railroad such as that involved here constructs a track across a state highway, over which it retains the sole right of operation of its trains, it has a continuing \u201cduty to keep the crossing in repair * * * to be discharged whenever the condition of the crossing is in need of repair in order for it to be safe and convenient to the traveling public.\u201d Brandon v. Texas and New Orleans R.R. Co., 169 So. 254, 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">We are not concerned here with the ultimate obligation to pay for the cost of this repair work, if proof should establish the fact that repair work was necessary to keep the crossing in safe condition. It appears from the contract that the cost of such maintenance may be cast on the industry involved, but that is a different matter. The plaintiff in this action is not relegated to his suit against the industry rather than against the railway under the statutory obligation to keep the crossing in repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">It was error for the trial court to grant the motion for summary judgment. The case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\">. \u00a7 324.
