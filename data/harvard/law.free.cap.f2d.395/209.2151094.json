In its order, the district court indicated that prior to accepting the guilty plea it determined that the plea was freely, knowingly, and voluntarily given. This finding has not been attacked in this appeal. It is well settled that a plea of guilty entered voluntarily and with the consent of counsel constitutes a waiver as to all non-jurisdictional defects in the prior proceedings. Busby v. Holman, 356 F.2d 75 (5th Cir. 1966); Cooper v. Holman, 356 F.2d 82 (5th Cir. 1966); Phillips v. United States, 318 F.2d 17 (5th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-16\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b258-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
