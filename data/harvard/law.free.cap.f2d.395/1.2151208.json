BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b49-19\">This is a sort of man-bites-dog situation. Instead of the usual situation in which the author, confector and instigator of a boiler plate adhesion-type contract seeks to hold the weaker, pliant, submissive, unequal acceptor to the literal pound of flesh, the reverse is here claimed. Asserting with dead earnestness that its own form contract, filled in by its own responsible and presumably articulate representative of considerable responsibility, is ambiguous in its reference to the identity of all the parties to be bound by it, the contention is made that the Trial Court erroneously granted summary judgment since a question of fact existed as to the intention of the parties on which extrinsic evidence was admissible. In this setting in which there is not a single identifiable new question of law, or for that matter, much of a dispute as to what the law is, we agree with the Trial Court and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-20\">What is specifically at issue is the convenant not to compete contained in a buy-out contract between the acquirer, Northern,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Economy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the local deal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>er being bought out. More specifically the question is whether in addition to binding Economy, the corporation, the covenant also bound Mike Cole, its President and <em>99i4/ioo% </em>sole stock holder. What launched the controversy was the unabashed re-entrance into the LP-gas business in the trade territory prescribed by Mike Cole within a couple of months after the execution of the contract, triggered presumably because Northern decided to terminate the employment of Mike Cole\u2019s wife. To make an ambiguity takes a lot of doing in this simple contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In its formidable undertaking Northern insists that there was a genuine material issue of fact as to the intention of the parties concerning whether Mike Cole intended to bind himself in his individual capacity as well as in his capacity as agent (President) for the corporate transferor. Its attack is anchored on Cavaness v. General Corp., 1955, 155 Tex. 69, 283 S.W.2d 33, principally because the Supreme Court there approved \u00a7 323 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>the Restatement of the Law of Agency. Subdivision (1) of that section provides in substance that if it appears <em>unambiguously </em>in a contract that a party who executes a contract as an agent is or is not a party to the contract, extrinsic evidence is not admissible to show a contrary intent, except for the purpose of reforming the contract. On the other hand, subdivision (2) permits extrinsic evidence where \u201cthere is no unambiguous expression of an intention.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These not surprising principles find general acceptance in Texas and elsewhere.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These principles, Northern asserts, have been given application by the Texas Courts in cases <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which call for a reversal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">The problem under this boiler plate contract boils down to the simple question of whether there is really any doubt on the face of this contract that the party sought to be bound by the covenant not to compete (paragraph 4) was other than the admitted corporate transferor. To overcome the surface tension against extrinsic evidence stress is laid, not on the obligation in dispute (paragraph 4), but rather it is directed toward paragraph 3 covering a matter nowhere in dispute. Thus Northern insists that where, in the warranty of title and ownership, paragraph 3 speaks in terms of \u201cSeller, for himself and for his heirs, successors and assigns, * * * \u201d this indicates either as a matter of law that it was the purpose of the corporate agent to bind himself in his individual capacity or at least to raise a substantial question of fact on which extrinsic evidence would be admissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>But <em>to </em>us this asserted ambiguity of paragraph 3 is but a ripple, considering that it is uncontradicted that Northern knew the business being acquired was conducted in the form of a corporation, which the formal contract (note 3 supra) very precisely reflected. The contract gave its own definition of \u201cSeller.\u201d Typed into the form contract was the corporate name \u201cEconomy Gas &amp; Supply Co.\u201d It was this concern, and no other that the contract declared was \u201c(hereinafter referred to as \u2018Seller\u2019).\u201d That this was no inadvertent slip of the typist\u2019s finger is reflected further by the repetition of the corporate title \u201cEconomy Gas &amp; Supply Co.\u201d immediately below the contract term \u201cSeller\u201d in the signature clause. And to cap it all there was typed in under the line for signature the significant corporate title, \u201cPresident.\u201d Moreover, although one can imagine that this was wholly accidental and just one of the perils that comes from form agreements that reflect the likelihood that the first and only time the writing came close to a lawyer was in the litigation seeking to enforce or defend it, when Northern intended to depart from the structured definition of \u201cSeller\u201d it did so in precise terms by adding, for example, \u201cfor himself and for his heirs, successors and assigns\u201d in paragraph 3. Elsewhere, in paragraph 1, paragraph 2, and paragraph 4 the contract definition of \u201cSeller\u201d was thought to be adequate. Structured as the contract was with the purposeful tyepwritten insertion of the corporate name and the corporate title of the signatory agent<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> there is no basis whatsoever for holding that there was either an intention to hold Mike Cole personally responsible or any basis for any genuine doubt thereon. This makes it unnecessary for us to discuss in detail the cases stressed by Northern, none of which require a different result here.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Only a tag end remains, Langford v. Shamburger, 5 Cir., 1968, 392 F.2d 939 (1968). Northern insists that Mike Cole is bound personally because he is the alter ego of the wholly-owned corporation which may be disregarded. No possible showing of a question of fact under accepted Texas principles appears in this record to rescue Northern from its undeniable knowledge that the enterprise was in a corporate form being transferred to it in the corporate name through a corporate officer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-13\">.

Section 323, Restatement of the Law of Agencies, Subdivision (2) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">\u201cIf the fact of agency appears in an integrated contract * * *, and there is no unambiguous expression of an intention either to make the agent a party thereto or not to make him a party thereto, extrinsic evidence can be introduced to show the intention of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b51-9\">.

Moreover, where the promise is of such a character that only one legal inference can be drawn therefrom, it is also a question of law for the court. In many instances, however, there is a conflict in the evidence as to the nature and meaning of the conduct or terminology of the parties, a question of fact for the jury arises. Such a question, of course, must be determined from a consideration of all of the circumstances of the case. In any event, the purpose of the law is to ascertain the intent of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">See also 14 Tex.Jur.2d Corporations \u00a7 366 (1960) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-14\">\u201cAny agent, including an officer of a corporation, may assume personal responsibility for a corporate transaction,, either by adding his responsibility to that of his corporate principal or by tendering his own responsibility for that of the principal. * * * The assumption of liability may be either express or inferred from the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b51-19\">.

Smith, Tex.Civ.App., 1911, 141 S.W. 185, error denied; First State Bank v. Power, Tex.Civ.App., 1914, 166 S.W. 382, no writ hist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b51-20\">. Once sufficient uncertainty on the face of the contract is established Northern urges two principal pieces of extrinsic evidence pointing toward assumption of personal liability by Mike Cole. The first is the letter proposal July 24, 1964, on the stationery of Economy Gas &amp; Supply signed by Mike Cole, President, addressed to Northern in which the first person is repeatedly used (e. g., \u201cI will sell * * * \u201d and \u201cI will sign a non-competitive agreement\u201d and \u201cI will furnish a resolution from my Board of Directors authorizing me to sell * * * \u201d). Second, Stafford\u2019s pre-trial deposition quoting Cole as saying \u201cI will sign any kind of non-competitive agreement, I have no intention of going back in business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-23\">Opposing the latter the transferor emphasizes these critical admissions by Stafford :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-24\">\u201cQ. And Mike Cole signed in his capacity as President of Economy Gas &amp; Supply Co.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-25\">\u201cA. I assume so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-26\">\u201cQ.

No I did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b52-6\">. The transferor emphasizes such cases as: Bartlett &amp; Co., Grain v.
