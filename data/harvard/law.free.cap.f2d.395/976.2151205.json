DAWKINS, Jr., District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1025-27\">This appeal is from a conviction for willful income tax evasion. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons hereinafter indicated, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-28\">Appellant, Bursten, a non-Florida lawyer, but who engaged, in legal and financial activities there, and was ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>parently quite a \u201cwheeler-and-dealer,\u201d was indicted for evading federal income taxes for 1957. Specifically, the indictment charged him with reporting he had no taxable income in 1957, when in fact he knew that his income for that year was $152,767.14. Income tax which would have been due on this amount would have been $93,093.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">After a one-week trial, defendant was found guilty as charged. He was sentenced to eighteen months (fifteen months of which was suspended) and fined $5,000. In this appeal Bursten complains of various errors, said to have been committed by the trial court, which will be discussed hereinafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Appellant\u2019s financial transactions, as detailed in the record, were somewhat complicated. Consequently, we set forth here only the salient facts necessary for clear understanding of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">A. <em>The \u25a0 Kadison Corporation. </em>In 1950, three people, appellant, Walter Sawyer (his uncle), and Milton Kadison formed the Kadison Corporation. Each party owned a one-third interest in the stock of that company. Bursten performed necessary legal work for organizing and operating the corporation and also secured its financing. The bulk of its capital was obtained through a $7,000 bank loan upon endorsements of appellant and Sawyer; and also through loans totaling $88,000 from Sawyer\u2019s Downtown Motors, a corporation owned by Sawyer. Initially, the purpose of Kadi-son Corporation was to engage in manufacturing products for the Korean War effort. It was planned that ultimately Kadison was to go into manufacturing non-defense materials. To this end, Kad-ison secured a contract from the Navy for manufacture of a five-inch rocket motor igniter ring. Profits expected to materialize from this contract did not accrue and the corporation soon went into receivership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">Subsequently, during 1952, 1953, and 1954, Bursten claimed various losses in connection with Kadison\u2019s failure. During those years the Internal Revenue Service allowed appellant various amounts of actual losses. After filing his 1954 income tax return, he was left with $5,084.40 in losses which could be deducted in future years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">B. <em>The East Corporation. </em>In 1950, East Corporation was formed to take title to Bon-Air Apartment Buildings, then under construction. Appellant and his wife, Lucile Bursten, held 16 of the 80 shares of stock issued by this corporation, for which appellant paid the nominal sum of $300.00. Sawyer was also a stockholder therein, as well as other persons whose interests are not pertinent to this prosecution. In 1951 appellant borrowed some $10,000 from Sawyer and gave a note secured by pledge of the 16 shares of East Corporation stock owned by appellant and his wife to Sawyer as collateral for the loan. When the note was not paid timely, Sawyer had these 16 shares transferred to his [Sawyer\u2019s] name on the books of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">C. <em>The Boca Ciega Land Contract. </em>January 25, 1955, appellant entered into a contract with Hyman Green, of Irving Green &amp; Associates, whereby the Greens were to purchase certain tracts of land in Florida and appellant was to perform legal services connected with development of that real estate. Both parties were entitled to a fifty per cent interest in the land to be acquired, contingent upon repayment of all funds advanced by the Greens. (Government Exhibit No. 1). August 26, 1957, appellant assigned all of his interest in this contract to the Greens for $160,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">D. <em>The 1957 Tax Return. </em>May 9, 1960, I.R.S. received an income tax return from appellant marked \u201cAmended\u201d [1957] Return. This return was dated November, 1959. The Service had no record of any prior return from him for the year 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-12\">In filing this return, appellant reported a capital gain of $156,000 ($160,-000 less certain sales expenses) on disposition of his interest in the Boca Ciega Land Contract. As an offset against this gain he claimed a carry-over capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>loss of $140,000, described in the following manner (Government Exhibit No. 8):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-5\">\u201cCarry-over Loss from previous returns of Kadison Corp. Loss, which was determined in Internal Revenue Service audit of 1959 to be a Capital Loss \u2014 Fair market value of property in excess of $140,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Appellant also claimed a $14,000 \u201closs\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on his 1957 return resulting from his legal practice. Thus he reported no taxable income on his return for 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">Upon receipt of this 1957 income tax return, I.R.S. conducted a thorough investigation in an attempt to find the basis for the $140,000 capital loss. When their investigation failed to substantiate appellant\u2019s claim of that loss, this prosecution ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">At trial, the Government offered testimony from Special Agent George Vilas which tended to show that his investigation of the $140,000 loss revealed that this loss could not be substantiated in any manner. Moreover, the Government presented the testimony of Michael Zier, who was accepted as an expert in the field of income tax declarations. Zier reiterated the Government\u2019s contention that there was no basis for the $140,000 loss carry-over. He also testified that, under the law and regulations, the $160,-000 treated as capital gain from the Boca Ciega Land Contract should have been treated as ordinary income instead of capita] gain. He based his analysis on the fact appellant received these monies for <em>legal services </em>performed by him in consummation of that land contract. Zier concluded that a complete analysis of appellant\u2019s return showed that he should have reported a net income of $145,497.-96. The tax due on this amount would have been $87,871.85. <em>En passant, </em>we must note that Zier\u2019s computations were not in exact accord with the charges in the indictment, although they were not materially different.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">Bursten defended by seeking to show that the $160,000 reported as capital gain resulted from his alienation of an interest in immovable property. When questioned about the $140,000 capital loss carry-over, Bursten attempted to explain that loss in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">He asserted that the $140,000 loss claimed for 1957 was not actually a carry-over loss from Kadison Corporation. Instead he testified that in 1957 his wife threatened to sue both him and Sawyer for the sixteen shares of stock which had been transferred to Sawyer as a result of his prior loan to appellant. In order to pay his wife for her stock, appellant transferred to her a two-thirds interest in certain Florida real estate which he had acquired. Further testimony revealed that appellant acquired this property from one Wells, after assuming the debt Wells owed upon it. Bursten then testified that he borrowed money from two banks to pay off the indebtedness on the property and thus acquired title thereto from the actual owners, whose names were Lightsey. He testified that he paid some $220,000 for this property and that a two-thirds interest therein, which he transferred to his wife, would have a value of approximately $140,000. According to appellant, this was the basis of the capital loss carry-over which he reported on his 1957 tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-11\">Bursten further stated that he claimed this loss in 1957 because he was specifically advised to do so by his tax counsel, William J. Goldworn. Goldworn, accepted by the Court as an expert in income tax matters, testified that he had represented both Mr. and Mrs. Bursten in their tax affairs through 1957, and in some instances thereafter. He further declared that Mrs. Bursten initially came to him because she was unhappy with what had happened to the East Corporation stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-12\">Concerning the 1957 return, Goldworn testified that Bursten brought to him several contracts dealing with his vari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>ous land transactions. They then discussed the propriety of appellant\u2019s reporting certain of these transactions as gains and losses on his 1957 income tax return. Goldworn said that, since the purchase price of the land from the Lightseys was $220,000, and \u201csince his [Bursten\u2019s] wife had a two-thirds interest in it which had been \u2014 he had purchased certain stock from her for that interest \u2014 then the value of the stock would be what he [Bursten] paid her for it if it was an arm\u2019s length transaction and that, therefore, two-thirds of $220,000 was approximately $140,000.\u201d (Tr. 676) Goldworn then stated that, in his opinion, the transaction <em>was </em>indeed an arm\u2019s length transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">The Government countered by asking Goldworn whether he knew such losses were not deductible under Section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Gold-worn replied that in his opinion such an \u201carm\u2019s length transaction\u201d as the one he had described was not within the reach of Section 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">As noted, at the close of the evidence and after the jury was charged by the Court as to the law, appellant was convicted of willful evasion of income tax due in 1957. We now proceed to consideration of the specific issues presented by this appeal. While appellant has set forth a nine-point argument in brief, we find it necessary to rule upon only three of these, which are definitely dis-positive of the appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">The first question presented is whether this prosecution was barred by the expiration of the applicable six-year statute of limitations (IRC of 1954, \u00a7 6531). In this and the following remarks, we naturally intimate no opinion as to appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">Appellant\u2019s 1957 tax return, actually due April 15, 1958, due to extensions granted for filing time, was not submitted until May 9, 1960. The indictment was returned October 12,1965, some five years and five months after the <em>filing </em>of the 1957 return. Since the applicable period of limitation under Section 6531, as interpreted by appellant, would have run from the initial due date for the filing of the return, prosecution would be barred if the statute began to run when the return became due; but it would have been timely instituted if the statute ran only from the date the return was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-10\">In Hull v. United States, 356 F.2d 919 (5 Cir. 1966), we held that the statute began running from the date the return was due. Appellant contends that our decision in <em>Hull </em>is controlling and, therefore, that institution of prosecution in this case has come too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-11\">When the case was argued, United States v. Habig, D.C., 270 F.Supp. 929, was pending in the Supreme Court. The Limitations issue presented in that case was identical to this one, and we, therefore, withheld judgment on this case until the Supreme Court acted definitively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-12\">Habig was indicted August 12, 1966. The income tax returns involved there were filed August 12 and 15, 1960. Ha-big contended that the critical date was not when the returns actually were filed, but that when they were due to be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-13\">In a thoroughly documented opinion which traces the full legislative history of I.R.C. Sections 6513 and 6531, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Mr. Justice For tas, and in effect overruling <em>Hull, </em>held that where the return was filed <em>after </em>the due date, the Statute of Limitations did not begin to run until the <em>date of filing. </em>(That is the date when the alleged crime was committed.) The Court said that when the return is filed <em>prior </em>to the due date, the statute begins to run on the due date. United States v. Habig, 390 U.S. 222, 88 S.Ct 926, 19 L.Ed.2d 1055, decided March 5, 1968, (mandate issued April 1, 1968). The decision in <em>Habig </em>is now binding upon us and therefore appellant\u2019s argument that this action was instituted too late has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">Appellant further contends that the trial judge committed reversible error in refusing to give to the jury the following specially requested instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aho-dedup-1\">\u201cIf you find that the defendant had discussed this matter with competent tax counsel and that the tax return herein was prepared pursuant to that advice, then you must find that the defendant did not willfully file a false return or make a false statement, and you should bring in a verdict of not guilty.\u201d (Tr. 859)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">We agree that there is substantial merit in this contention for the following reasons :</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">In Perez v. United States, 297 F.2d 12 (5 Cir. 1961), we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-8\">\u201cIt is elementary law that the defendant in a criminal case is entitled to have presented instructions relating to a theory of defense for which there is any foundation in the evidence. * * A charge is erroneous which ignores a claimed defense with such a foundation. * * * The charge to which he is entitled, upon proper request, in such circumstances is one which precisely and specifically, rather than merely generally or abstractly, points to his theory of defense, * * * and one which does not unduly emphasize the theory of the prosecution, thereby de-emphasizing proportionally the defendant\u2019s theory.\u201d (Citations omitted) (297 F.2d at 12, 15, 16)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">Our recent ruling in Strauss v. United States, 376 F.2d 416 (5 Cir. 1967) also involved an appeal from a conviction of willful tax evasion. Coincidentally, that case also was tried before the same District Court in Florida. In reversing the conviction and sentence for failure of the Trial Court properly to instruct the jury, we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-10\">\u201c * * * If the trial judge evaluates or screens the evidence supporting a proposed defense, and upon such evaluation declines to charge on that defense, he dilutes the defendant\u2019s jury trial by removing the issue from the jury\u2019s consideration. In effect, the trial judge directs a verdict on that issue against the defendant. This is impermissible. Bryan v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 373 F.2d 403.\u201d (376 F.2d 416, 419)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">Review of the record here leaves little or no doubt as to why appellant requested the quoted instruction. One of the essential elements to be proved by the Government here was that he, appellant, <em>willfully </em>evaded the federal income tax laws. To have been successful, the Government must have proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant willfully filed a false income tax return with intent to defraud the Government. Thus, if the jury believed that appellant honestly relied on the advice of his tax counsel, Goldworn, it might have found that the element of willfulness was lacking and have acquitted. Moreover, there is no doubt that there was adequate basis in the record for this requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-13\">Careful review of this quite lengthy record reveals why this instruction was refused by the District Judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-14\">\u201cMr. Booth: Which one are you refusing ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-15\">The Court: <em>Well, that \u2018advice\u2019; that\u2019s no excuse at all for a lawyer, particularly. It\u2019s no excuse at all. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-16\">[We must note here, as a matter of judicial knowledge, that most lawyers have only scant knowledge of the tax laws.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-17\">Mr. Osman: I give this to the Court and ask him if he is going to have a charge on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-18\">The Court: If this were the law, then I could get advice from anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-19\">Mr. Soltz: Well, it says, \u2018competent\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-20\">The Court: Well, that\u2019s silly. You can always find a crook that will give you any advice that you don\u2019t owe any tax.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-21\">(Tr. 725, 726)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>Moreover, we note from the Charge Conference, this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-4\">\u201cMr. Booth: Your Honor, it certainly goes on the question of what the intent was from what he was advised and what he believed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-5\">The Court: Well, I\u2019m not saying intent\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-6\">Mr. Booth: Whether it\u2019s the law or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-7\">The Court: That\u2019s a matter of argument. I agree with you that he may have been foolish enough to believe that so-called professor we had here</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-8\">Mr. Booth: He teaches at the graduate school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-9\">The Court: I don\u2019t care what school he teaches in, <em>he is not a good tax man. </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-10\">Mr. Booth: Well, on the question of intent, that really doesn\u2019t make much difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-11\">The Court: No, he may have given that advice. I don\u2019t say he didn\u2019t; and if he did, I don\u2019t say that this man is guilty in this case if he believed him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-12\">Mr. Booth: That\u2019s what the testimony shows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-13\">The Court: That\u2019s up to the jury. I\u2019m not going to decide that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-14\">(Tr. 729, 730)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-15\">This clearly establishes that this instruction was refused because the trial judge thought \u201che [Goldwom] [was] not a good tax man.\u201d In the very same colloquy with defense counsel, the trial judge also noted that whether appellant relied upon advice given by Goldwom was up to the jury. As was stated in Strauss v. United States, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-16\">\u201c * * * We agree that the substance (though not necessarily the wording) of these charges should have been given. Defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction here is not pettifoggery over nuances of words. His objections go to the refusal to submit substantive defenses.\u201d (376 F.2d 416, 418-419)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-20\">While the record reveals (Tr. 795-798) that the trial judge gave a <em>general </em>instruction to the jury on the element of intent, the authorities cited and quoted from conclusively hold that appellant was entitled to a more specific charge in light of his contention that he relied on advice of his tax counsel. This failure to give such a specific charge, even though it should have been reworded, so as to indicate that, to rely on this defense, appellant should have been found to have given <em>all </em>the facts to his .advisor, was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-21\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-22\">Finally, we consider appellant\u2019s last major contention that on many, many occasions the trial judge over-stepped the bounds of judicial propriety by repeatedly injecting himself into the trial, in questioning of witnesses and wrongly expressing his personal opinions. The thrust of this contention is that he (the judge) intervened to such an extent (on an average of at least once in each three pages of the Transcript) that appellant was denied the right to a fair trial guaranteed to him by the Constitution. In considering this contention, we advert to the following basic principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-23\"> It is well settled that a federal district judge is not relegated to complete silence and inaction during the course of a criminal jury trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He must, however, be most careful that his interventions are proper, timely, made in a fair effort to clear unanswered issues, and are not prejudicial to defendant. Many federal decisions recognize the power of the judge, within reasonable limits, to comment on the evidence and to express fair opinions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This privilege, however, has been limited to the point where the trial judge is under a strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>duty to direct the jury clearly that they are the sole judges of the facts and are not bound by the judge\u2019s questions or comments. Matters of fact unmistakably must be left to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">It is well known, as a matter of judicial notice, that juries are highly sensitive to every utterance by the trial judge, the trial arbiter, and that some comments may be so highly prejudicial that even a strong admonition by the judge to the jury, that they are not bound by the judge\u2019s views, will not cure the error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">To be sure, admonition of counsel in hotly contested cases, such as this one, sometimes becomes requisite, even essential. Cf. United States v. Sacher, 182 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1950). It is preferable, of course, that such corrections be made outside of hearing of the jury, but, for such conduct to constitute ground for reversal, it must appear that in some way the judge\u2019s conduct operated to deprive the defendant of his right to an impartial trial, such as to deprive him of effective assistance of counsel, or adversely influencing and prejudicing the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If a trial court continually intervenes so as to unnerve defense counsel and throw him off balance, in a supposedly fair trial, and causes him not to devote his best talents to the defense of his client, then this is ground for reversal, no matter what counsel\u2019s experience and equipoise may be. Even if there is a basis for some criticism of overpartisanship, of defense counsel, this does not justify unwonted and unecessary continuous interruption.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A trial judge must strive for total neutrality and complete circumspection, in the eyes and minds of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">Upon careful scrutinization of the record here, it is abundantly clear that the many and manifest interventions by the trial judge deprived appellant of a fair trial. While it would be impracticable, if not impossible, for us to set forth all instances of undue interruptions, and a total taking over of the trial by the District Judge, the following examples clearly illustrate that he manifestly overstepped the bounds of judicial trial propriety in commenting upon the evidence and lengthily and partisanly interrogated witnesses in the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">During cross examination of Government\u2019s witness, Sawyer, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-10\">\u201cBy Mr. Booth [Defense . counsel]: Have you ever threatened to put Mr. Bursten in jail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-11\">Mr. Murphy [Government counsel] : I will object, your Honor. Now, Mr. Booth knows better than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-12\">Mr. Booth: That is perfectly proper, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-13\">The Court: If he [Mr. Booth] doesn\u2019t prove it, <em>I hope the jury will hold it against him, </em>because he shouldn\u2019t make that statement unless he has some proof.\u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-14\">(Tr. 209)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-15\">The following dialogue occurred upon cross examination of the same witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-16\">\u201cMr. Booth: In the south corridor that goes right past this Courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-17\">Mr. Sawyer: I am a little mixed up, I may have been in the other corridor. I was in this building. I don\u2019t know which corridor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-18\">Mr. Murphy: Your Honor, this is wide of the scope of the direct examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-19\">The Court: Yes, Mr. Booth, now get back to your own case, <em>if you have a case. </em>[Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-20\">Proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-21\">Mr. Booth: Your Honor, I am trying to lay a foundation for a statement he has made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-22\">The Court: I know.
