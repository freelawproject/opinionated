Therefore, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-21\">At the same time we observe that there is substantial evidence in the record which indicates strongly that the appellant has been rehabilitated. He seems to be legitimately employed and to be supporting his wife, their several children and his widowed mother. Therefore, we think it would be appropriate for the Department to make further inquiry to the end that, if justified, appellant\u2019s deportation at least be stayed during his good behavior.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
