The only question is whether appellant has the ability \u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 223(d) (1) (A) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-25\">Appellant filed an application with the Secretary in 1960, alleging disability from May 1, 1958. The hearing examiner found that, although appellant could not return to strenuous labor, his impairments were not so severe as to render him unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity and denied the application for benefits. Appellant\u2019s request for review of the hearing examiner\u2019s decision was denied by the Appeals Council. Review was obtained in the District Court and the case was remanded to the Secretary with directions that findings be made as to \u201cwhat plaintiff can do, and what employment opportunities are there for a man who can do only what plaintiff can do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>A hearing was held following remand and the appellant gave further testimony; a vocational consultant also testified. The consultant listed several jobs available which he believed appellant could perform and for which he could meet employment requirements. He based his statements on appellant\u2019s age, work experience, impairments, and limited education. The hearing examiner found that appellant had been unable to engage in substantial gainful activity with any degree of regularity since May, 1958. It was his recommended decision that appellant be found-by the Appeals Council to have established that he is entitled to a period of disability and to disability insurance benefits. The recommended decision of the hearing examiner was rejected by the Appeals Council. The decision of the Appeals Council that appellant did not qualify for benefits was reviewed by the District Court and approved. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The Appeals Council\u2019s decision cited 20 CFR \u00a7 404.1502(h), which provides that work activity may be \u201csubstantial\u201d though it is on a part-time basis and is less responsible or gainful than that in which the claimant was engaged before the onset of his impairment. Appellant does not contest the validity of the regulation. The Council made the following finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">\u201cThe claimant had the remaining functional capacity to perform * * * many light jobs enumerated by the vocational consultant * * * and a reasonable number of such jobs were available, not only nationally but in claimant\u2019s geographical area, throughout such period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Courts are bound by the findings of the Secretary if they are supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Appellant\u2019s only meritorious argument against the vocational consultant\u2019s suggestions as to work activity which he can perform is that, while the jobs may be available nationally, there is no evidence they are available in the vicinity of appellant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">During the pendency of this action, \u00a7 223 of the Social Security Act was amended in 1967 to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">\u201c[A]n individual * * * shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy regardless of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which he lives, or whether a specific job vacancy exists for him, or whether he would be hired if he applied for work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">The amendment applies to this action. Public Law 90-248, 81 Stat. 821, \u00a7 223 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">There is substantial evidence to support the findings of the Appeals Council regardless of this amendment to the Act. In any event, the amendment has nullified appellant\u2019s argument that there is no evidence of gainful work opportunities for him in the area in which he lives. The test under the 1967 amendment is whether such work exists in the national economy and \u201cwork which exists in the national economy\u201d is defined in the amendment to mean \u201cwork which exists in significant numbers either in the region where such individual lives or in several regions of the country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">The Secretary\u2019s decision being supported by substantial evidence, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
