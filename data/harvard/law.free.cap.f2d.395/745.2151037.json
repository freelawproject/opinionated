The Board\u2019s decision and order are reported at 162 NLRB No. 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">The Board adopted the Trial Examiner\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law to the effect that Respondent violated Section 8(a) (3) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act by imposing more arduous working conditions on employee Ervin Davis, and by subsequently discharging him because of his union activities. The sole question for decision is whether the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">After careful analysis of all of the evidence, we conclude that the petition of the Board should be granted. The order will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
