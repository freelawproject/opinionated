She is a single woman, under 65, who has never married.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-21\">The departmental rulings on her decisions and exemption are clearly correct under existing federal income tax statutes, and the tax court has so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-22\">The classifications of the law that adversely affect petitioner are within the range of classifications that traditionally have been held constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-23\">As the tax court said, and we must say, this unfortunate woman can only hope for relief from the legislative branch of the government. And, on her facts, it may be a slim hope, given today the government\u2019s ever increasing need for money.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-24\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
