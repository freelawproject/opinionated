The testimony of three witnesses tends to establish identification. Efforts of defense counsel to cast doubt upon the accuracy of identification presented, of course, a question for the jury, but no question of law is presented for our decision. It is not suggested that the use of photographs was so \u201cimpermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 971, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247, 1253 (1968). Nor could it be on the facts of this case. We think the appeal is frivolous and accordingly dismiss without allowing oral argument. Fed.R.Cr.P. 39(a). See United States v. Gregg, 393 F.2d 722 (4th Cir., April 2, 1968); Maryland Petition Committee v. Johnson, 391 F.2d 933 (4th Cir., March 21, 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-23\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
