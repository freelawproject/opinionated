B. Martin Company. 164 NLRB No. 73. It is a Delaware corporation manufacturing and selling ribbons, velvet and narrow fabrics at Leesville, South Carolina. Countering, the company seeks vacation of'the order as un-accreditable by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">The Board convicts the company of several unfair labor practices. First, it had affronted Section 8(a) (1) of the Act by eyeing union organizing gatherings, and threatening not only to cancel employee privileges but to close the plant upon entry of the union. Again, the Board determined that the company had offended Section 8(a) (3) and (1) in discharging employee Fox for his preachment of unionism. The company laid the discharge to his leaving work to shoot wild dogs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The company was also put in violation of Section 8(a) (1) for firing Foreman Ricard for permitting Fox to go after the dogs. Ricard\u2019s termination was purposed, the Board concluded, to offer some legitimation of Fox\u2019s release.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-14\">The company must cease and desist from further unfair labor practices, said the Board. Affirmatively, the order directed the company to offer reinstatement to Fox and Ricard, to reimburse them for earnings lost because of the unfair treatment, and to post appropriate notices of this decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-15\">As we can not say it was not substantially underpinned by evidence, we will effectuate the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-16\">Order enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-17\">. Apparently packs of wild dogs menacingly abound in the general vicinity of the plant, not infrequently attacking livestock and pet dogs such as hounds, \u201ctrigs\u201d and oecasionally fice. It is customary for the residents to seek and slay these undesired creatures.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
