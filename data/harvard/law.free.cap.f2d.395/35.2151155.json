The judgment of conviction was affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-18\">shown in the opinion of that court, the sale of the narcotic drug was alleged to have been made to John William Gober, an ex-convict. That opinion details how Gober was the principal witness for the State and his testimony as to effecting the sale was corroborated by officers Hightower and McMannes, who observed him from a distance with field glasses. Luna\u2019s application for habeas corpus to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals was denied without opinion on November 9, 1965. On February 9, 1966 Luna filed his application for habeas corpus in the federal district court. The principal grounds for his application are: (1) The State knowingly permitted the witness Gober to testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>falsely. (2) The State knowingly suppressed evidence beneficial to the defendant Luna. (3) The State Court at the instance of the prosecuting attorney denied the defendant Luna his right adequately to cross-examine the witness Gober. After a full hearing, the district court entered an able opinion and denied the application for ha-beas corpus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">* * \u00edt * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">All three of the grounds for the application are based upon the following parts of the cross-examination of the witness Gober:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">\u201cQ.

For several months he assisted the police by purchasing narcotics from peddlers. The appellee admits that at times officers advanced to Gober small sums of money.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The majority of the panel which originally heard this case on appeal, relying on Barbee v. Warden, Maryland Penitentiary, 4 Cir. 1964, 331 F.2d 842, was of the opinion that a writ should be granted because the State knowingly allowed Go-ber to testify falsely and knowingly suppressed evidence favorable to Luna. A majority of that panel also held that there was no merit in Luna\u2019s contention that the State court had denied him the right to an adequate cross-examination of Gober. Upon rehearing en banc, we are of the opinion that the District Court\u2019s denial of a writ of habeas corpus should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Perjury is \u201cThe willful assertion as to a matter of fact, opinion, belief, or knowledge, made by a witness in a judicial proceeding * * * upon oath * * * such assertion being material to the issue or point of inquiry and known to such witness to be false.\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accord, Blackmon v. United States, 5 Cir. 1940, 108 F.2d 572. Viewed in this light we are convinced that there is no merit in appellant's contention that \u201cthe State knowingly used perjured testimony to deprive Appellant of a fair trial.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Witness Gober was asked <em>\u201cAre </em>you paid by them? \u201d (Emphasis added.) He answered, \u201cNo sir.\u201d This answer was true since Gober had not, as he testified, worked with the police for several months before the trial. Gober was later asked \u201cHow many cases have they filed on you \u2014 do they have over you right now ? \u201d He answered that he had no \u201cpending cases,\u201d In fact, a complaint had been made against him for possession of narcotics. However, in determining whether this answer constitutes perjury as appellant urges, the materiality of the answer and Gober\u2019s knowledge that the answer was false must be considered. \u201cMateriality is determined by whether the false testimony was capable of influencing the tribunal on the issue before it.\u201d Blackmon v. United States, supra at 573. Under the circumstances of this case, it is clear that the false answer was not material. In the context in which the question was asked, i. e., a direct attack on Gober\u2019s credibility, the answer was not admissible in evidence. Under Texas law in effect at the time of appellant\u2019s trial, only convictions could be used to impeach a witness in a criminal ease.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Evidence of pending charges is admissible in Texas for the limited purpose of showing bias, prejudice and motive of a witness. E. g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Blake v. Texas, Ct.Crim.App.1963, 365 S.W.2d 795; Kissinger v. Texas, Ct. Crim.App.1934, 70 S.W.2d 740. However, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant made no attempt to inform the court that the testimony was sought to show bias or motive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt, Chapman v. State of California, 1967, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 that this testimony would not have influenced the jury on the issue of appellant\u2019s guilt <em>vel non. </em>Gober admitted both on direct and on cross-examination that he had been <em>convicted </em>for murder without malice, for burglary and for felony theft. Thus the evidence that Gober had been <em>charged </em>with the less serious offense of possession of narcotics was merely cumulative on the issue of his credibility. It did not go to the heart of the offense, as was the situation in Barbee v. State of Maryland, supra, or in our recent case of Jackson v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1968, 390 F.2d 288 (slip opinion February 26, 1968). We are convinced that no jury would disbelieve a witness who admitted to being a burglar, a thief and a murderer simply because he had also been charged with possessing narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"> When Gober was charged with violating the State narcotics laws, he was released on bond. No hearing was ever held \u2014 the police having twice requested and received a postponement. Gober was never made to appear before any court in connection with the charge. Under Texas law, the failure to present an indictment or information during the term of court next after a defendant has been released on bail relieves him and his sureties from all liability on the bond.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The crucial term of court had ended before Gober testified at appellant\u2019s trial, and he had thus been released from liability on the bond. This, we think, negates any inference of willful falsity by Gober and suggests that as a man \u201cversed\u201d in the \u201cpracticalities\u201d of criminal law, he may well have considered that the charges had in fact been dropped. Therefore, it cannot be said that either answer constituted perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">Appellant next urges that a writ must be granted because in his case, as in Barbee v. Maryland, supra, the State \u201cwilfully suppressed evidence that was favorable to Appellant.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s argument here is closely related to the point previously discussed. However, even accepting <em>arguendo </em>appellant\u2019s contention that the pending charge against Gober for possession of narcotics was \u201csuppressed evidence,\u201d we are convinced that <em>Barbee, </em>although having surface appeal, is upon close analysis inapposite to the situation before us because, as discussed below, the suppressed evidence in <em>Barbee </em>differs from that in this case. In <em>Barbee </em>the evidence was of such a nature that its suppression amounted to an unconstitutional denial of due process. The suppressed evidence there was clearly exculpatory in that it consisted of a fingerprint test which showed that Bar-bee\u2019s fingerprints did <em>not </em>match those found in the car driven by the assailants, and of a ballistics test which showed that Barbee\u2019s gun, exhibited to witnesses at trial, had <em>not </em>fired the shot that wounded the police officer. The Court found that this evidence had \u201csubstantial evidentiary significance.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As previously demonstrated, the evidence in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>volved in the instant case was merely cumulative on impeachment and had no direct relation to appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence. In <em>Barbee </em>the Court attached no significance to counsel\u2019s failure to request the reports because this was \u201cnot a ease where defense counsel merely made a wrong tactical calculation; it is a case where the inference strongly projected by the state\u2019s evidence might have been destroyed by other evidence in its possession but which the police concealed * * * \u201d Id. at 846. Here the evidence was merely cumulative in nature. It would not have destroyed any inference raised by the state\u2019s evidence, for it would be ludicrous to suggest that a charge of possessing narcotics would impair the image of an admitted murderer, burglar and thief. Here, as in <em>Barbee, </em>there is no evidence that the prosecutor knew that evidence was being suppressed. The Fourth Circuit imputed the knowledge held by the police to the prosecutor because \u201cthe police allow [ed] the State\u2019s Attorney to produce evidence pointing to guilt without informing him of other evidence in their possession which contradict [ed] this inference * * Id. at 846. Our situation is vastly different. The evidence was not elicited by the prosecutor but by appellant\u2019s counsel. The police were not in the courtroom when Gober testified (the Rule had been invoked) so they had no way to know of or to correct Gober\u2019s statements. Furthermore, in <em>Barbee </em>the court stated that it could not \u201ccondone the attempt to connect the defendant with the crime by \u25a0questionable inferences which might be refuted * * Id. Here, the undisclosed evidence did nothing to connect .appellant with or absolve him from the crime. Finally, the <em>Barbee </em>court considered the matter of prejudice. It refused to consider that the reports might not have influenced the jury because this was a case \u201cwhere evidence was withheld by the police which had a direct bearing upon and could reasonably have weakened or overcome testimony adverse to the defendant. * * * \u201d Id. at 847. Here the evidence had no such direct bearing, and as discussed supra we are firmly convinced that the evidence, in any event, would not have affected the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Appellant\u2019s conviction is not constitutionally infirm.

BROWN, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AUz\">with whom Circuit Judges GEWIN, BELL, THORNBERRY, COLEMAN, AINS-WORTH, SIMPSON, and CLAYTON join, concurring specially:</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">I concur fully in the Court\u2019s opinion and the result. Some comments in the dissenting opinion warrant some emphasis.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">The dissenting opinion deplores what it senses is undue emphasis by the Court on the so-called technicalities of perjury, presumably Texas peculiarities, even though its concepts seem to be those everywhere held. But for an otherwise valid state conviction to be upset years later on federal habeas, surely something more than an evidentiary <em>'mistake </em>must be shown. If <em>mistake </em>is enough, then never, simply never, will the process of repeated, prolonged, postconvietion review cease. For in every trial, or at least nearly every trial, there will be, there are bound to be, some mistakes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>What elevates the \u201cmistake\u201d to a constitutional plane is at least twofold. First, the mistake must be material in the sense of a crucial, critical, highly significant factor. Second, it must have some State complicity in it. As to this, I do not for a moment think innocence of the prosecutor is an assured out. For <em>Barbee </em>properly teaches that the police are very much a part of the State and its prosecutorial machinery. But someone in the state machinery must have some awareness that testimony being palmed off as the gospel is something else indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">On these scores there is nothing to the assertion of \u201cperjury\u201d or \u201cfalsity.\u201d First, the interrogator chose to east his questions in conclusory terms. Phrasing the question first, \u201cQ. How many cases have they <em>filed </em>on you * * *?\u201d, the examiner almost instantaneously pinpointed it to the instant present\u2014 \u201c* * * do they have <em>over you right now?\u201d </em>To this conglomerate of conclusions, the witness answered in like terms: \u201cA. I don\u2019t have any <em>pending </em>cases against me.\u201d It turns out, of course, that under Texas law, for all practical purposes Gober had no \u201cpending\u201d eases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> So far as this formal charge was concerned, Gober was as free as the birds. While it may be true that new charges could be filed, or an indictment returned within the statute of limitations period, none had been, and to this date, none ever has been. One simply cannot make this negative reply a <em>falsity </em>merely because, had the questions been framed differently or the matter pursued to an obvious end for a counsel bent on questioning or hopefully destroying credibility, the witness would have had to state that new charges could be filed or an indictment returned. By the dissent perjury is first watered down to falsity, and then both are brushed aside by a statement of what all of us as Judges know concerning the possibility of new charges or indictments but as to which the witness was never interrogated. Worse, the only way to reach the conclusion that the witness was being interrogated along these shadowy, vague, unidentifiable lines is to make the triple assumption that (1) the interrogator had that in mind, (2) the witness knew the interrogator had that in mind, and (3) the witness by no inadvertent slip gave a known wrong answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">Second, there is nothing to implicate the State in this in any way. The prosecutor in the courtroom was ignorant of the original charges. The police officers who would have had knowledge were out of the courtroom under the Buie.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">On a like approach the charge that the \u201cState knowingly suppressed evidence beneficial to the defendant Luna\u201d or, stated more advantageously to the petitioner, the State failed to furnish information helpful to the defendent, turns out equally to be lacking in constitutional substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">The assertion here is that in the testimony of Gober, the State misled the defendant because the testimony did not reflect the connection between Gober, as an informant, and the State. Emphasis is placed on his negative answer to the question \u201cAre you paid by them [the Houston Police Department] ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">Here again the answers stated in terms of the present were literally true. He had no \u201cofficial capacity with the Houston Police Department,\u201d he was not \u201ca police officer\u201d, and he was not \u201cpaid by them\u201d in the sense of being a salaried employee. On the other hand, it was perfectly clear that he had been \u201cworking with or for the Houston Police De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>partment.\u201d Indeed, Gober went further and pinpointed the time by stating that he had not worked with the Houston Police Department \u201csince some time in July, the middle of July.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">From the circumstances of the sale of narcotics by Luna to Gober, Gober\u2019s familiar role in the \u201cmaking\u201d of the sale and purchase and Gober\u2019s accurate answers to the questions as put to him, it was perfectly evident to anyone having any experience that Gober obviously was being used by narcotics officers <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the enforcement of these important laws. No matter how much one might deplore the necessity for the use of informants and who up the limits of entrapment \u201cstage\u201d cases for a successful prosecution, this is both a well known and judicially acceptable phenomenon. And except for those possible and rare instances in which the detested role of informer is taken on out of a penitent conversion, the practice rests upon the advantages which the informer gets, or thinks he gets, at the hands of the sovereign. It may be, and often is, money \u2014 not only little handouts, but, as this Court has expressly approved, a contingent fee arrangement in which even the National sovereign is allowed to pay bounty on a sliding scale depending on the number of convictions the \u201cspecial employee\u201d brings about.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In others, the advantage can be an indulgence either by police officers or, for that matter, persons as elevated in the hierarchy as the Attorney General of the United States<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> toward the prosecution or even the commencement of criminal proceedings against the informant for his known criminal actions. In others it takes a middle course in which on arraignment and acceptance of a co-defendant\u2019s plea of guilty the Court acquiesces in the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation for a dismissal of most charges, reduction in the offense, and postponement of sentence with its telltale message that punishment may well depend on how well the penitent performs and the prosecution succeeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">In the light of this record, there was a vivid revelation of Gober\u2019s relation to the State in the prosecution and trial of this case (see note 3 supra). Once we assume that <em>Gideon\u2019s </em><footnotemark>6</footnotemark> trumpet heralds the importance of counsel because of professional knowledge and skill beyond the experience of the non-lawyer, no one worthy of the Bar could have claimed even remotely any surprise as to Gober's connection with the case, the role he was playing and the whole gamut of influences \u2014 monetary, physical, emotional, or psychological \u2014 which might be at work , in his helping, if not instigating, the efforts of the police. Spread out over the whole record for all to see and the skilled lawyer to pursue was Gober\u2019s relationship. Unless, even though counsel is present and performing, the Federal habeas later look-back has to assume professional ignorance bordering on incompetence and an unawareness of what is going on bordering on mental unconsciousness, the defendant through his counsel knew all that the dissenters insist the State should have revealed. Perhaps it was a <em>mistake </em>for counsel not to have pursued it. But the <em>mistake </em>was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>due to being mislead by appearances or ignorance of the real situation. The mistake \u2014 and as a tactical judgment of counsel in the heat of trial it may well not have been a mistake at all \u2014 was in counsel not following up the obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The opportunity for full exploration was there. The certainty that Gober was acting out of supposed self-interest was patent. The failure to press on, the failure to pursue relentlessly was not from a State sponsored, State instigated or State permitted deficiency. Rather it was from a decision \u2014 deliberate or unconscious \u2014 by counsel. But that cannot make the trial unfair or afford to this defendant release in the high name of the constitution.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-7\">. Consider, for example, a defense of alibi refuted factually by a witness positively identifying the defendant and then rejected by the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty. Five years later post-eonvietion proof demonstrates conclusively that the identification was erroneous although maintained by the witness, the police, and the prosecution in all good faith as the truth. This would, of course demonstrate that the result was wrong. But it would not demonstrate that the trial was unfair. The Federal Constitution could not correct that mistake.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-15\">.

Beto, 5th Cir. 1967, 391 F.2d 329. The central connection of Gober with Luna\u2019s conviction is of such importance that I now quote the facts as succinctly stated by the Texas Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">\u201cThe offense is the sale of heroin; the punishment, 25 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-11\">\u201cThe count of the indictment upon which the case was submitted to the jury alleged the sale of a narcotic drug, to-wit, heroin, to William Gober.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-12\">\u201cGober, an ex-convict, testified that on August 30, 1963, the date alleged in the indictment, he was at an Ice-house-Beer Parlor drinking beer. About 1 o\u2019clock P.M. the appellant and one Robert or Bobby Ortega drove up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-14\">\u201cIn a conversation between them appellant asked Gober if he \u2018wanted to score\u2019 and Gober said he probably would in a little while.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-15\">\u201cAppellant said he would have \u2018some stuff\u2019 ready shortly, and left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-16\">\u201cGober finished his beer and called Police Officer Hightower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-17\">\u201cAbout 3 P.M. appellant again came to the beer parlor and told Gober that he had \u2018some stuff\u2019 over on James Street under a house, and asked Gober if he was ready to buy. Gober replied that he had to go around the corner and would be back and appellant said he would wait in Ortega\u2019s car, \u2018and he asked me how long it would be before I would be back and be ready to buy this heroin,\u2019 and Gober replied that it would just be a few minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-18\">\u201cGober then went to a Pig Stand on North Main where he met Police Officer Hightower and McMannes who, after searching him and the front part of his car, gave him $21.00. Gober then drove back to the Icehouse where appellant and Ortega were sitting in Ortega\u2019s tan Chevrolet car. Upon signal from appellant, Gober followed the Chevrolet driven by Ortega to a place in the 400 block of James Street where the Chevrolet car stopped and Gober drove up directly behind it and got out of his car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-19\">\u201cAppellant went across the street and crawled under a house. In a matter of seconds he came out and walked up to Gober and said \u2018Where\u2019s the money?\u2019 Gober got the $21.00 out of his pocket and gave it to appellant in exchange for three capsules which appellant took from a package.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-20\">\u201cGober further testified that Officers Hightower and McMannes, in an unmarked ear, followed him from the time they gave him the $21.00, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>that after appellant received the money and drove away Officer Hightower followed as he drove to a secluded area near some warehouses where he gave the capsules he had bought from appellant to Officer McMannes and they again searched him and searched his automobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">\u201cOfficer Hightower, assigned to the Narcotics Division of the Houston Police Department, testified that he received a call from Gober, went with his partner, McMannes, to the Pig Stand dressed in plain clothes, where they had a conversation with Gober; searched him and his car and advanced him $21.00 \u2018of official city funds\u2019 with instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">\u201cOfficer Hightower further testified that he and his partner followed Gober to the icehouse, where he saw appellant with his arm out the window of the car driven by Ortega, and continued following both cars to the 400 block of James Street. He testified that from a distance of a block and a half, using field glasses, he saw appellant go to the house at 411 James and return to where Gober was standing; saw Gober hand appellant some money and appellant, in return, hand Gober something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">\u201cAlso he testified that he and his partner followed Gober to the prearranged meeting place where Gober gave Officer McMannes three capsules and they again searched him and his car, and returned the money they had found in his pocket when they first searched him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">\u201cFloyd E. McDonald testified that he ran an analysis on the contents of the three capsules identified as State\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 which revealed that each contained about one gram of 26.4 percent pure heroin, a narcotic drug.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Luna v. State of Texas, supra note 1, 387 S.W.2d at 896, 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">Gober was the only witness as to what occurred between him and Luna, except for the rather meagre corroboration from Officer Hightower. There was no circumstantial corroboration, such as the finding of marked money in Luna\u2019s possession. We can only speculate as to how thorough a search of Gober\u2019s car was made. Gober\u2019s testimony was that they searched \u201cthe front part of his car.\u201d Nor can we be certain as to how much occurred outside of the officers\u2019 observation \u201cfrom a distance of a block and a half, using field glasses.\u201d Very clearly Luna\u2019s conviction would not have been possible without Gober\u2019s testimony. To find Luna guilty, the jury must have believed Gober beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">On en banc rehearing, however, the majority find that the test of Chapman v. State of California, 1967, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 has been met, and that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that if Gober had truthfully answered the questions propounded to him or if the State had made full disclosure of the facts, Gober\u2019s credibility would not have been further impaired in the minds of the jurors. That conclusion the majority reach by the strange process of reasoning that Gober had already been shown to be unworthy of belief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">The conclusive answer, I submit, is that the jury did believe Gober\u2019s testimony beyond any reasonable doubt as evidenced by their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">Has then the requirement of <em>Chapman </em>been met? Is it clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury\u2019s verdict would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>have been the same if the jury had known the facts and circumstances which so seriously affect Gober\u2019s credibility, viz: that the police were holding over Gober charges of narcotics\u2019 law violations, and that they had promised Go-ber whatever help they could give him with his case in return for his cooperation in obtaining evidence against narcotics\u2019 peddlers? To me that is not clear. Juries reason differently from judges, and, with deference to my brothers, the jury\u2019s reasoning is sometimes the better. Obviously the jury believed Gober despite his record as an admitted murderer, burglar and thief. The jury doubtless recognized the hard fact that witnesses of excellent repute can rarely be produced to prove narcotics\u2019 violations. If the jury had been furnished the evidence to which it was denied access, its reasoning as to the effect of that evidence may have differed from the reasoning of the present majority in this case. Perhaps the jury would have reasoned that while a person of good character would not furnish false testimony to better himself, an admitted murderer, burglar and thief might do so. That process of reasoning is not so contrary to common sense that we can say beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have been uninfluenced if Gober had answered truthfully or if the State had disclosed the facts known to its police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">My brother Wisdom\u2019s scholarly opinion for the Court in Jackson v. Wainwright, 5th Cir. 1968, 390 F.2d 288, traces the development of the prosecutor\u2019s constitutional duty to disclose evidence favorable to the defendant. I shall do no more than touch on the milestones. The first case clearly to enunciate such a doctrine was Mooney v. Holohan, 1935, 294 U.S. 103, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791 where the state prosecutor\u2019s knowing use of perjured testimony to procure the defendant\u2019s conviction was held to be a denial of due process of law. With deference to the majority in the present case, I submit that a careful reading of their opinion will disclose that they have stopped at this milestone and are not keeping pace with the developments of the doctrine in the more than thirty years since that ease was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Mooney v. Holohan was followed some seven years later in Pyle v. State of Kansas, 1942, 317 U.S. 213, 216, 63 S.Ct. 177, 87 L.Ed. 214, but the next milestone decision was Napue v. State of Illinois, 1959, 360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217. That case marks at least two important advances: first, the Court substitutes the term \u201cfalse evidence\u201d for \u201cperjured testimony,\u201d and, second, the Court places evidence affecting the credibility of a witness on a parity with evidence as to the commission of the crime. Speaking for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice Warren stated the doctrine as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">&lt;&lt;* * * it is established that a conviction obtained through use of false evidence, known to be such by representatives of the State, must fall under the Fourteenth Amendment * * *. The same result obtains when the State, although not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-12\">\u201cThe principle that a State may not knowingly use false evidence, including false testimony, to obtain a tainted conviction, implicit in any concept of ordered liberty, does not cease to apply merely because the false testimony goes only to the credibility of the witness. The jury\u2019s estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence, and it is upon such subtle factors as the possible interest of the witness in testifying falsely that a defendant\u2019s life or liberty may depend.\u201d (360 U.S. at 269, 79 S.Ct. at 1177)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The next important development came in Brady v. Maryland, 1963, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 where the Court\u2019s holding was thus stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">\u201cWe now hold that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">As so well said by Judge Wisdom in Jackson v. Wainwright, supra, 390 F.2d at 295:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\u201cIn Brady v. Maryland, 1963, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, the Court made it clear that its primary interest was not to punish misconduct by the prosecutor, but to insure a fair trial to the defendant, and particularly to insure that the trial would bring out, not hide, the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The doctrine has been further developed in Miller v. Pate, 1967, 386 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 785, 17 L.Ed.2d 690 and in Giles v. State of Maryland, 1967, 386 U.S. 66, 87 S.Ct. 793, 17 L.Ed.2d 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">In the light of the law as now developed, I submit, with deference, that the majority\u2019s labored consideration of whether the exact wording of the questions and of Gober\u2019s answers were such that Gober committed the state crime of perjury is not at all decisive. The majority takes pains to explain when the term of court ended and whether Gober committed perjury when he testified: \u201cI don\u2019t have any pending cases against me.\u201d That statement was made in answer to the question: \u201cQ. How many cases have they filed on you \u2014 do they have over you right now?\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In that context, it is immaterial, insofar as Luna is concerned, whether the cases were technically \u201cpending,\u201d when it is without dispute that Gober was still subject to prosecution. The matters seriously affecting Gober\u2019s credibility were the cases which the police \u201chave over you right now,\u201d and the promise of the police officers to give Gober \u201cwhatever help they could with his case\u201d in return for his cooperation in obtaining evidence against narcotic peddlers. These matters, though fully known to the police, were never revealed to Luna.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">With deference, I submit that the present majority has based its opinion and decision largely on the technicalities of the state law of evidence, and the strict requirements necessary to convict Gober of perjury. In the present state of the law, such technicalities and requirements peculiar to the laws of any one state have little or nothing to do with the application of the federal constitutional doctrine which prohibits the knowing use of false testimony and requires fair disclosure of facts and circumstances within the peculiar knowledge of the state which may be favorable to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">For the foregoing reasons, in addition to those stated in the majority opinion on original hearing and in Judge Wisdom\u2019s opinion for this Court in Jackson v. Wainwright, supra, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-21\">. Luna v.
