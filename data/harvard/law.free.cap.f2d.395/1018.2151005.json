The goods of the parties, although specifically different in certain physical characteristics, are nevertheless electric typewriters which have been advertised in the same media for substantially similar purposes and which have been sold in many instances through the same retail outlets. Under these circumstances, the marketing of these goods under the same or similar marks is reasonably likely to lead to confusion in trade. Accordingly, this case turns on whether or not \u201cELECTRESS\u201d is confusingly similar to \u201cELECTRA\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1067-17\">We have found nothing from our review of the record in conflict with that resum\u00e9. However, we are not persuaded that the board correctly concluded that the opposition should be dismissed. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-18\">These marks are alike primarily in that each contains the designation \u201cELECTR\u201d as the initial portion. This designation was obviously adopted by the parties to suggest that their respective typewriters are electrically actuated. In this regard, \u201cELECTR\u201d is listed in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged, 1961) as a combining form denoting electric or electricity. In fact, the dictionary lists more than two hundred words incorporating the letters \u201celeetr\u201d to suggest or describe something that possesses an electrical characteristic or feature. Accordingly, it is believed that the differences between the marks \u201cELECTRESS\u201d and \u201cELECTRA\u201d are sufficient to obviate any likelihood of confusion as to the source of the goods sold thereunder. This conclusion is bolstered by the testimony by one of opposer\u2019s area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>sales managers, referred to above, to the effect that notwithstanding that at least eight dealers within his area have been selling both \u201cELECTRA\u201d and \u201cELECTRESS\u201d typewriters, not one of them ever indicated that any person has confused applicant\u2019s machine with that of opposer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Granted that the marks suggest the electrical features of the competing products; that Webster lists more than two hundred words incorporating \u201celectr;\u201d and the testimony of one witness regarding alleged<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> lack of actual confusion, the issue nevertheless is whether Royal\u2019s mark \u201cELECTRESS\u201d \u201cso resembles\u201d SCM\u2019s mark \u201cELECTRA,\u201d when both are viewed in their entirety in the market place, \u201cas to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">It seems clear to us that when \u201cELEC-TRESS\u201d and \u201cELECTRA\u201d are used on the same goods,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> advertised and sold to the public through the same channels of trade, there would be a likelihood of purchaser confusion within the meaning of \u00a7 2(d) of the Trademark Act of 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1067-19\">. 149 USPQ 904.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">. The witness testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-11\">XQ4. Have any of these dealers ever suggested to you that anyone has confused your machine with the Eleetress?</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-12\">A. No, sir, they haven\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-13\">As appellant points out, the record does not show that any of those dealers were ever asked to relate instances of existence of \u201cconfusion.\u201d The dealers\u2019 failure to volunteer such information can hardly be construed as evidence of the presence or absence of actual confusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1068-14\">. Lanham Act, Section 2(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1068-15\">. Certain exhibits reflect the parties\u2019 <em>current </em>practice of associating their house marks \u201cSCM\u201d and \u201cRoyal\u201d with \u201cELECTRA\u201d and \u201cELECTRESS\u201d, respectively. However, our concern here, of course, is whether \u201cELECTRA,\u201d the mark actually registered, and \u201cELECTRESS,\u201d the mark for which registration is sought, are confusingly similar when applied to the instant goods. See In re Beaunit Mills, 274 F.2d 436, 47 CCPA 755, 758, citing Burton-Dixie Corp. v. Restonic Corp., 234 F.2d 668, 43 CCPA 950. See also Denney v. Elizabeth Arden Sales Corp., 263 F.2d 347, 46 CCPA 790; Sealy, Inc. v. Simmons Co., 265 F.2d 934, 46 CCPA 857; Bellbrook Dairies, Inc. v. Hawthorn-Mellody Farm Dairy, Inc., 253 F.2d 431, 45 CCPA 842; Hat Corp. of America v. John B. Stetson Co., 223 F.2d 485, 42 CCPA 1001.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1068-8\">RICH, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ACsB\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">I would affirm. While consumers might be confused as to the source of some goods concurrently sold under the trademarks ELECTRA and ELEC-TRESS, I do not believe this would be the case when the goods are <em>electric </em>typewriters. Fort Howard Paper Co. v. Gulf States Paper Corp., 376 F.2d 904, 54 CCPA 1375 (1967); E. L. Bruce Co. v. American Termicide Co., 285 F.2d 462, 48 CCPA 762 (1960). Furthermore, electric typewriters are so expensive and purchased so infrequently as to assure that considerable care will be exercised in their selection with attention to who made them. It does not appear to me that the majority has given sufficient consideration to the nature of the goods, their cost, the purely descriptive nature of the \u201cELECTR\u201d portion of the marks, or the precedents above cited and others of like import.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-17\">Furthermore, opposer\u2019s own exhibits, presumably attached to its Notice of Opposition to support its case, show that its use of ELECTRA in advertising and on the typewriters is in association with \u201cSmith-Corona\u201d and \u201cSCM Corporation,\u201d or both. It is not opposer\u2019s practice to rely on ELECTRA as a primary source designation. This is another reason why, <em>on this record, </em>there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception. As further rendering it unlikely, the record shows the applicant\u2019s commercial practice to be to merchandise \u201cROYAL ELECTRESS\u201d typewriters so that purchasers know the source to be appellee, not opposer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>It appears to me that the majority has overlooked or given insufficient weight to the foregoing and other factors, as reported at 149 USPQ 904, which led the three-member board to its eminently sound unanimous decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
