Commander, \u00a7 702. In his \u00a7 2255 motion appellant alleged that his pleas of guilty were induced by an FBI agent\u2019s promise of a 7 year sentence. The district court without holding a hearing reviewed the transcripts of proceedings at arraignment and sentencing, the presentence report and file of the probation officer, and found that appellant\u2019s guilty pleas were voluntarily and understandingly made. Accordingly, the court denied appellant\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-22\">On appeal appellant cites as error the failure of the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing and the use by the court of the presentence report and file of the probation officer. This is appellant\u2019s second appearance in our court. In Streator v. United States, 367 F.2d 384 (5 Cir. 1966) we affirmed a denial of \u00a7 2255 relief where appellant alleged mental incompeteney at the time he pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-23\">We have examined the entire record and find that appellant was carefully and thoroughly questioned as to whether his pleas of guilty were voluntarily and understandingly made. The transcript of proceedings at arraignment and sentencing patently refute appellant\u2019s allegations. Appellant represented to the court that he had not been induced to plead guilty, nor had anyone made any</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>promises to him in exchange for guilty pleas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying the requested relief without an evidentiary hearing. Pursley v. United States, 391 F.2d 224 (5 Cir., March 1968); Kirsh-berger et al. v. United States, 392 F.2d 782 (5 Cir., April 1968); Plaster v. United States, 381 F.2d 578 (5 Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Appellant\u2019s contention that presentence reports and files of the probation officer are not \u201crecords and files\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is completely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\">. The following is from the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">\u201cMR. LEHMAN: Do you understand you could receive consecutive sentences? Five years, five years, and five years, consecutively? If the Court so desired ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnY\">DEFENDANT: Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9n\">MR.

And you wish the pleas to stand? Having heard what the Court and counsel for the Government have said, you wish them to stand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMWx\">DEFENDANT: On all of the cases I waive and plead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnNp\">* # \u00ed(S * <em>i\u2019fi </em>sfc \u2756 * * :\u00a1S * * sj:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzD\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aji-dedup-0\">I ask you at this time what you may have to say as to why sentence should not be imposed?
