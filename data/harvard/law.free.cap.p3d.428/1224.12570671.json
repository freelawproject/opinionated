WAC 296-900-17005(2) permits an employer to notify\n   the director by mail, and \"[t]he postmark is considered the submission date of a mailed request.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Waste Connections of Washington, Inc. (Waste Connections) timely submitted its notice of appeal by mail, but used insufficient postage. This resulted in the notice being returned to Waste Connections. Then, after the deadline, Waste Connections resubmitted its notice of appeal with sufficient postage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 The primary question is whether \"the submission date of a mailed request\" implies sufficient postage. We hold that it does. We affirm the superior court's dismissal of Waste Connections' appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 On February 9, 2015, the Department of Labor and Industries (Department) issued a citation and notice of assessment to Waste Connections for three regulatory violations. Waste Connections signed for the assessment on February 11. The citation specified Waste Connections had 15 working days to appeal from the date of signing for the citation. The parties agree the final date to appeal was March 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Waste Connections desired to appeal the citation. On March 2, Waste Connections addressed its notice of appeal to the Department, with directions that it be sent by certified mail. A Waste Connections employee mistakenly placed\n   <em>\n    first class\n   </em>\n   postage on the envelope and attempted to send the notice by certified mail. The envelope that contained the notice was postmarked March 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Because of insufficient postage, the postal service returned the notice to Waste Connections on March 12. Waste Connections resubmitted the notice by certified mail. The envelope that contained the resubmitted notice was postmarked March 13. The Department received the notice on March 17 and deemed the appeal untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 At Waste Connections' request, the Department forwarded the appeal to the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals (BIAA). The BIAA judge (IAJ) held a timeliness hearing. Waste Connections argued that its notice of appeal was timely under RCW 49.17.140, as supplemented by the plain meaning of the Department's own rule. The IAJ disagreed and concluded that the appeal was not timely. The IAJ issued a proposed decision and order with findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 Waste Connections filed a petition for review with the BIAA. In its petition, Waste Connections reiterated its prior argument. In addition, Waste Connections argued it \"substantially complied\" with the notice requirements, and that \"good cause\" permitted the BIAA to consider the late filing. The BIAA denied Waste Connections' petition and adopted the IAJ's proposed decision and order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 Waste Connections appealed to the Grant County Superior Court. It reiterated its prior arguments. In denying Waste Connections' appeal, the superior court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Notice is required to be accomplished in a manner reasonably calculated to give notice to the Director.\n   <em>\n    In re Saltis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1164063\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/94/889/#p898\">\n    94 Wash.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 898,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=621%20P.2d%20716\">\n    621 P.2d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980).

In addition, the superior court found that Waste Connections had not sufficiently argued \"substantial compliance\" or \"good cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Waste Connections timely appealed to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   SUBMISSION DATE OF A MAILED REQUEST\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 Waste Connections does not contest the BIAA's findings of fact. Rather, it argues that the superior court erred in its construction of RCW 49.17.140(1) and WAC 296-900-17005(2).

Pursuant to this authority, the Department enacted WAC 296-900-17005, which explains how an employer or employee wishing to appeal a workplace-safety citation notifies the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 15 WAC 296-900-17005(2) permits an employer or employee to notify the Department of an appeal by mail, fax, electronically, or by personal delivery. With respect to notification by mail, the subsection provides: \"The postmark is considered the submission date of a mailed request.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20P.3d%20627\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 16 Both parties argue that the meaning of the rule is plain. Nonetheless, they reach different results. The Department argues the rule requires the notice to be submitted or mailed, and a notice cannot be submitted or mailed with insufficient postage. Waste Connections argues the rule requires only that the postmarked date be within the appeal period. Waste Connections' argument ignores the rule's requirement that the submission be a \"\n   <em>\n    mailed\n   </em>\n   request.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17 \"Mail\" means \"to send postal matter by mail.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1361 (1993). Postal matter is not sent by mail unless it has sufficient postage. A person who places an envelope with insufficient postage in the mail knows the envelope likely will be returned, and therefore not sent. We hold that a submission is not \"mailed\" if the envelope has insufficient postage and is returned to the sender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 18 This holding is consistent with decisions that require proof of sufficient postage as an element toward establishing an item was mailed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lieb v.

This holding also comports with our obligation to construe legislation in a manner that avoids an absurd result. It would be an absurd result to construe a notice requirement satisfied when, because of the sender's mistake, the notice did not reach the recipient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   EQUITY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 19 Waste Connections, citing court rules that permit time extensions for \"good cause,\" argues that equitable principles compel allowing the appeal to proceed. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 20 A court will not grant equitable relief in contravention of a statutory requirement.\n   <em>\n    Longview Fibre Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cowlitz County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1169890\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/114/691/#p699\">\n    114 Wash.2d 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 699,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=790%20P.2d%20149\">\n    790 P.2d 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990).
