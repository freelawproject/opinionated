I have kids.\n   </em>\n   \" Victim's plea was in vain, as Defendant Harlin Argelio Ramos stabbed him eight times, including a fatal thrust to the heart. After fleeing the scene, police located and arrested Ramos. In his interview, Ramos alleged that Victim had been the aggressor and that he had only acted in self-defense. The State charged Ramos with murder. At trial, the judge instructed the jury on both perfect and imperfect self-defense, and on the lesser-included offense of imperfect-self-defense manslaughter. One of those instructions was flawed, but the error was not prejudicial. The jury convicted Ramos as charged, and he timely appeals. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Murder\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Shortly after 1:00 a.m. on a mid-April morning, Victim and Friend had just finished watching a late movie at a movie theater. Because they had driven separately, Victim walked Friend to her car and she drove him back to his own. Before parting ways, the two talked in the car. While they conversed, Friend noticed two men-Ramos and his accomplice (Accomplice)-walk in front of her car and look at her in a way that \"made [her] very uncomfortable.\" The men's behavior alarmed her so much that she removed her Taser from the glove compartment and rested it on the center console. Victim, however, seemed unconcerned about the men and continued their conversation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Just as Victim was about to exit the vehicle, Ramos suddenly opened the passenger door and thrust his \"whole arm\" inside. Friend thought Ramos was reaching for her keys in an attempt to rob her. Victim pushed Ramos away and the two struggled outside of the car. Meanwhile, Friend closed her passenger door and went to call 911, but accidentally dropped her phone on the car floor. She then locked her car doors, honked her horn, screamed for help, and tried to find her phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 When Friend looked back up, Victim and Ramos were no longer within eyesight, so she opened her door and stepped out of her car to find them. She heard Victim screaming \"Please don't kill me. I have kids. Please don't kill me.\" Friend then grabbed her Taser and ran around to the front of her car. She found Victim on the ground with Ramos straddling Victim's lower abdomen and upper legs. She thought that Ramos was punching Victim, so she approached Ramos from behind and applied her Taser to the back of his pant leg, but it had no effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Realizing that the Taser needed to contact skin, Friend pulled down the collar of Ramos's jacket and applied the Taser to the back of his neck. Ramos tried to fight her off, and she ran back to her car, locked her car doors, began honking her horn and screaming for help. Having located her phone, she then dialed 911. Ramos and Accomplice then\n   fled the scene on foot and were soon thereafter picked up by a taxi driver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Friend waited for someone to answer her 911 call, she saw Victim stagger in front of her car and fall near her door. Friend opened her door and heard Victim say, \"I'm dying. Please help me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 As the 911 operator answered, an off-duty paramedic (Paramedic) responded to Friend's cries for help. Paramedic testified that, as he approached, he saw Ramos \"cross in front of him and look directly at him.\" Paramedic rolled Victim onto his back to triage and treat his injuries, and soon thereafter he started CPR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Meanwhile, Witness, whose apartment overlooks the crime scene, was watching television at home when he heard a woman screaming for help. From his vantage point, Witness saw two men assaulting another man and pinning him to the ground. Thinking that a robbery was in progress, Witness went to help, but by the time he arrived, Paramedic had already begun treatment. Police and on-duty paramedics soon arrived and took over, but Victim had already passed away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Victim suffered nine sharp-force injuries: three to his chest, two to his upper back, two to his abdomen, one to his armpit, and one to the back of his right hand that was consistent with a defensive injury. All wounds were likely inflicted by a single-edged knife. The blade had entered Victim's chest and penetrated completely through his heart, \"fully perforat[ing]\" his \"right ventricle.\" This was \"a lethal injury\" that stopped Victim's heart \"within minutes.\" Victim's left lung was punctured twice, once from the front and once from the back, which hastened his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    The Arrest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Before police arrived, Ramos and Accomplice\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   fled the scene as Victim bled out. On arrival, police found two backpacks on site, one of which contained a cell phone receipt with Ramos's name on it, as well as his identification card. Police eventually located Ramos at a motel and arrested him. In the motel room, police found a t-shirt, a black jacket, and black athletic pants-all bloodstained-in the trash can in Ramos's room. DNA testing revealed Victim's blood on the t-shirt, jacket, and pants. Additionally, Ramos's fingerprint was on the front passenger door of Friend's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 Ramos was given his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and agreed to be interviewed by police. He informed police that he did not speak English, so the interview was conducted in Spanish. His interview resulted in several conflicting accounts. Initially, Ramos said that he and Accomplice had planned to meet a \"taxi\" from \"someone who had a white sedan\" and had mistaken Friend's car for the taxi. He further alleged that as he approached the door, Victim had jumped out and started hitting him in the head, grabbed his throat, and lifted him completely off of the ground. Ramos stated that as Victim hit him, Ramos said \" 'sorry, sorry,' and 'no problem,' \" in English, but Victim continued to choke Ramos until he \"became desperate\" because he was \"being asphyxiated.\" Ramos said he exclaimed, \"Help me, help me, he is going to kill me,\" and then pulled out his knife and stabbed Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 When a detective told Ramos to \"tell the truth,\" Ramos responded by claiming he was \"confused\" and maintained that he was attacked by Victim. But he then stated that he believed that Victim was somehow associated with a violent street gang and feared that they had come to harm him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 When the detective again asked Ramos to tell the truth, Ramos gave yet another version of the events, claiming that he had approached the vehicle because \"he was selling\n   drugs and he thought the people in the car wanted some.\" He continued to state that Victim had exited the car, began hitting and choking him, and because Ramos had drugs in his mouth that night, he spit them out when he was choked. But police did not recover any drugs at the murder scene or in Ramos's backpack or motel room. Ramos also told police initially that he dropped the knife as he fled the scene, but later said that he \"may have thrown it away\" with his clothing. Despite a thorough search, police did not find a knife in the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    The Taxi Driver\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Three days after the murder, the police interviewed Taxi Driver. He also testified at trial, but his two accounts differ significantly. During his police interview, Taxi Driver told police that Ramos called him \"around 1:00 a.m., 1:30 a.m., or 1:40 a.m.\" But when police asked to see Taxi Driver's phone log, he said that he had deleted it. A review of Ramos's phone records showed no outgoing calls to Taxi Driver during the 1:00 a.m. hour. Instead, Ramos's log showed only that Taxi Driver had called him at 1:08 a.m. that morning. Taxi Driver testified that after he got Ramos's call, it took him \"fifteen or twenty minutes to drive from his West Valley home to [the murder scene], and that he parked and waited another fifteen or twenty minutes before [Ramos] and [Accomplice] 'arrived.' \" Taxi Driver also initially told police that he did not see the fight and that Ramos claimed to have been hit, but did not mention being strangled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 Taxi Driver testified differently at trial. There, he stated that he operated a private taxi service and that on the night of the murder, Ramos called him in the early morning for a ride. Taxi Driver claimed that he saw both Ramos and Accomplice getting into a car. He then saw an angry man get out of that car and heard Ramos say in Spanish, \"This isn't the right car, sorry.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taxi Driver said that the man refused to accept the apology and fought with Ramos. Taxi Driver further testified that he never saw Ramos with a knife but did see a woman try to tase Ramos. Taxi Driver stated that Ramos looked \"dizzy\" and fell, and that he \"was bleeding all over [the left side of] his face,\" but photographs taken upon Ramos's arrest show only one abrasion on his forehead and no other injury to his face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 When asked about the discrepancies in his accounts, Taxi Driver testified that he was \"nervous\" during the police interview and \"might have omitted a few details here and there.\" Taxi Driver asserted that he had testified to \"the truth\"-that he witnessed the fight, including Ramos being choked, and that Ramos had asked for help because the man was \"killing him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    The Strangulation Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Ramos suffered minor injuries. At the time of his arrest, he had scratches on his neck, a scrape on his forehead, and one abrasion above his left clavicle. At trial, two experts testified to his injuries, Defense Expert and Medical Examiner. Medical Examiner testified that he did not see evidence of petechial hemorrhaging\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   or other signs of strangulation, and opined that \"[y]ou'd expect to see damage both externally as well as internally\" if a person were lifted completely off the ground by their neck. In contrast, Defense Expert testified that Ramos showed signs of strangulation-abrasions on his neck and petechiae on his skin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Her opinion was founded on her review of police photographs taken when they arrested Ramos, as well as her own examination and interview of Ramos more than thirteen months after the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   However, Defense Expert conceded that the scratches could have been consistent with having been tased on the neck by Friend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Summary of Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b617 The State charged Ramos with one count of murder. At trial, Friend testified that she heard Victim screaming, \"Please don't kill me. I have kids. Please don't kill me.\" Thereafter, the prosecutor asked Friend what kind of cell phone Victim had and whether she knew \"what was on the screen of his cell phone?\" Friend responded, \"He had a picture of his two little boys.\" When the prosecutor asked, \"A picture of his two little boys?\" Friend nodded her head affirmatively. The prosecutor never introduced the picture of Victim's two boys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b618 The judge then instructed the jury on both perfect and imperfect self-defense, and on the lesser-included offense of imperfect-self-defense manslaughter. While the imperfect-self-defense instruction correctly instructed the jury on the State's burden of proof, both parties agree that the instruction on imperfect-self-defense manslaughter misstated that burden.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instruction 34, which defined the elements of imperfect-self-defense manslaughter, contradicted Instruction 48 and misinformed the jury about the State's burden to disprove imperfect self-defense. Instruction 34 incorrectly told the jury that it could convict Ramos of imperfect-self-defense manslaughter only if it found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defense applied. The instruction stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   You may consider the lesser included offense of \"Manslaughter Involving a Dangerous Weapon.\" To do so you must find from all of the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt each and every one of the following elements of that offense. That on or about April 19, 2014, in Salt Lake County, Utah:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   1. The defendant ... individually or as a party to the offense;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   2. Either:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (a) Recklessly caused the death of [Victim]; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (b) Caused the death of [Victim] under circumstances where the defendant reasonably believed the circumstances provide a legal justification or excuse for his conduct, although the conduct was not legally justifiable or excusable under the existing circumstances; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   3. A dangerous weapon was used in the commission or furtherance of this act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   After you carefully consider all the evidence in this case, if you are convinced that each and every element has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must find the defendant GUILTY of Manslaughter Involving a Dangerous Weapon. On the other hand, if you are not convinced that one or more of these elements has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must find the defendant NOT GUILTY of Manslaughter Involving a Dangerous Weapon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b619 The jury was further instructed that it could consider the offense of manslaughter under Ramos's imperfect-self-defense theory only if it found \"from all of the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt each and every one of the ... elements of that offense.\" These statements impermissibly shifted the burden to Ramos because they either infer that the burden rests upon Ramos or they\n   are vague concerning which party bears the burden of proof.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b620 The jury convicted Ramos of murder, and he timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b621 Ramos brings two claims on appeal. He first contends that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object (1) to the erroneous imperfect-self-defense manslaughter jury instruction and (2) to the prosecutor's questions regarding photos of Victim's children on his cell phone. \"When a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised for the first time on appeal, there is no lower court ruling to review and we must decide whether the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Layton City v.

Ramos alleged imperfect self-defense, but several factors weigh heavily against his claim. Victim was stabbed not once, but nine times; Ramos was not alone, but attacked Victim with the help of Accomplice; Ramos's injuries, in comparison to Victim's, were minimal; and after repeatedly and fatally stabbing Victim, Ramos did not seek or await law enforcement, but instead fled. Finally, when Ramos was apprehended and talked to law enforcement, he gave significantly inconsistent stories about what happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b633 Furthermore, because Instruction 48 more plainly and separately outlines the burden of proof, it is not reasonably likely that the jury was confused as to the burden of proof, such that the outcome of the case would have been different. Instruction 48 read,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Imperfect self-defense is a partial defense to the charge of Murder. It applies when the defendant caused the death of another while incorrectly, but reasonably, believing that his conduct was legally justified or excused.

Failure to Object to Questioning Regarding Victim's Children\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b636 Ramos also argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective by failing to object to Friend's testimony that Victim had a picture of his two sons on his cell phone. As discussed, to show that his counsel was ineffective, Ramos must prove both that his counsel performed deficiently and that he was prejudiced as a result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Because there were multiple strategic reasons not to object, Ramos cannot demonstrate that no reasonable attorney would have failed to object, and his contention fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b637 First, counsel could have reasonably concluded that the testimony was relevant. Evidence is relevant if it has \"any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence\" and \"the fact is of consequence in determining the action.\" Utah R. Evid. 401(a). Counsel could have reasonably concluded that the testimony that Victim had a picture of his boys on his cell phone cleared this low threshold by helping corroborate Friend's account of the stabbing, including her testimony that Victim begged for his life because he had children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b638 Second, trial counsel could have reasonably concluded that the testimony about the cell phone picture was cumulative. The jury already knew from Friend's testimony that Victim was a father. Therefore, trial counsel could have reasonably chosen not to object based on the fact that the information was not new to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b639 In sum, counsel had valid reasons not to object to the testimony Ramos now claims counsel should have opposed. Ramos therefore has not rebutted the presumption that\n   his counsel's performance was objectively reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 687-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Cumulative Error Doctrine Is Unavailing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b640 Ramos' final contention is that because \"the evidence that [he] was guilty of murder ... was not overwhelming\" the cumulative errors in his trial undermine the jury verdict.

Thus, \"a jury instruction may not be assigned as error even if such instruction constitutes manifest injustice if counsel, either by statement or act, affirmatively represented to the court that he or she had no objection to the jury instruction.\"\n    <em>\n     State v. Geukgeuzian\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9274176\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/86/742/\">\n     2004 UT 16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 9,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9274176\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/86/742/\">\n     86 P.3d 742\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (cleaned up). Here, Ramos did not merely fail to object; he agreed to the instruction. When the court discussed the proposed jury instruction for imperfect-self-defense manslaughter, trial counsel stated, \"We don't have an issue with this instruction, Judge.\" Counsel therefore invited the error in the instruction and precluded any plain error review.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
