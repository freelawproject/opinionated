Stat. Ann. \u00a7 35-7-1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(i)(C) and (c)(ii) (Lexis Nexis 2017). The district court deferred entering a judgment on Ms. Brumme's child endangerment charge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%207-13-301\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 7-13-301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and placed her on three years of supervised probation. On the possession charge, the district court imposed a sentence of not less than two, nor more than four years, which it suspended in favor of three years of supervised probation. The court ordered the probationary periods to be served concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b64] As a condition of probation, the district court noted Ms. Brumme's addiction to methamphetamine and required her participation in a treatment program. The court also mandated Ms. Brumme's compliance with the Wyoming Department of Corrections Probation and Parole Agreement, which, in relevant part, required Ms. Brumme to appear for appointments with her\n   probation agent; report any changes to her address, phone number, and living arrangements within 24 hours; and submit to alcohol and drug screenings. The district court emphasized these requirements to Ms. Brumme during the sentencing hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    You'll not cancel any appointments related to supervision without the prior permission of your probation agent\n   </strong>\n   . Those appointments include but are not limited to office meetings, counseling appointments, doctor[']s appointments, and appointments with Job Service.\n   <strong>\n    And when I talk about not absconding from probation, that means that you'll sleep in the house that you tell your agent you'll sleep in\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The court's written judgment and sentence incorporated these terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b65] The State asked the district court to revoke Ms. Brumme's probation in September 2017, alleging three violations within two months of sentencing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 On or about August 8, 2017, the Defendant was found to not be living at the address she provided to her Probation Agent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 On or about August 18, 2017, the Defendant failed to attend an office visit for a urinalysis as previously scheduled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 On or about August 21, 2017, the Defendant was found to not be living at the new address she had provided to her Probation Agent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court held an initial probation revocation proceeding on October 17, 2017. Ms. Brumme denied the allegations and the district court set an adjudicatory hearing for the following week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b66] During the adjudicatory hearing, the State called Ms. Brumme's probation officer, Agent Hatch, as its sole witness. Agent Hatch testified that when Ms. Brumme registered for probation in July 2017, she informed his office she lived with her sister, Ms. Hutcherson, and provided her sister's address and phone number as her contact information. After Ms. Brumme missed a scheduled appointment on August 8, 2017, Agent Hatch attempted to locate Ms. Brumme at her sister's home. Ms. Brumme was not at the residence when Agent Hatch arrived. Over a hearsay objection overruled by the district court, Agent Hatch testified \"Ms. Hutcherson told me that since she was a foster parent, that M[s]. Brumme was never allowed to live there [nor] did she ever live there.\" Ms. Brumme called Agent Hatch later that day. Agent Hatch informed her of his visit to her sister's house and inquired about her living situation. Ms. Brumme provided an updated address and stated she lived with her cousin on Grass Valley. Agent Hatch rescheduled Ms. Brumme's appointment for August 17, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b67] Ms. Brumme appeared for her appointment in Evanston on August 17, 2017, but the urinalysis could not be performed because a female probation officer was not available. Agent Hatch verbally instructed Ms. Brumme to report back at 8:00 a.m. the next morning. Agent Hatch confirmed he attempted to contact Ms. Brumme after she failed to report back as directed by going to the Grass Valley address she previously provided. Ms. Brumme was not at the residence when he arrived. Over another hearsay objection, Agent Hatch testified that Ms. Brumme's cousin stated Ms. Brumme did not live at that address. The district court overruled the objection, finding the testimony was probative, trustworthy, and credible and, thus, admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b68] Defense counsel called Adam Rhodes, Ms. Brumme's significant other, as her sole witness. Mr. Rhodes testified that on August 18, 2017, he went to work and took the \"only car [they] had.\" He also testified that Ms. Brumme was \"really mad\" at him for leaving her without a vehicle that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b69] Defense counsel argued in closing that the State failed to establish the terms of probation purportedly violated and, in any event, the State's evidence did not support revocation because it was based solely on hearsay. Defense counsel further argued Ms. Brumme missed her scheduled urinalysis because she lacked transportation. The district court took judicial notice of Ms. Brumme's probation conditions and determined Ms. Brumme violated her probation as to each of the State's allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b610] After hearing from counsel and Ms. Brumme at the disposition hearing, the district court remarked it provided Ms. Brumme \"three bites out of the apple\" and yet she still refused to take responsibility for her underlying criminal actions and she had not enrolled in, much less successfully completed, the requisite treatment course for her substance abuse issues as previously ordered. The court also noted Ms. Brumme failed to take responsibility for misleading her probation agent about her living arrangements, instead blaming her failure to provide accurate addresses on her family members. The district court revoked its prior order deferring judgment on Ms. Brumme's child endangerment charge and revoked probation on the possession charge. The court imposed the underlying sentences on each charge and ordered the sentences to run concurrently, with credit for seventy-nine days served. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b611] We review probation revocation proceedings under an abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    Forbes v.

Violation for Failure to Provide Current, Valid Addresses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b613] Ms. Brumme asserts the district court abused its discretion when it determined she violated her probation on August 8, 2017, and on August 21, 2017, by failing to provide current, valid addresses to her probation officer. She contends the State failed to present any non-hearsay evidence to prove a violation occurred and, thus, the district court erred by relying solely on hearsay testimony in making its determination. Ms. Brumme does not challenge the district court's decision to admit the hearsay testimony, but instead asserts the district court should have concluded the State failed to meet its burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b614] The Wyoming Rules of Evidence apply during the adjudicative phase of probation revocation hearings, except hearsay that is \"is probative, trustworthy and credible may be received into evidence.\" W.R.Cr.P. 39(a)(5)(B). Notably, however, a court may not revoke probation\n   <strong>\n    solely\n   </strong>\n   on the basis of hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

The record here does not support Ms. Brumme's assertions that the district court ran afoul of\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b615] When viewed in the light most favorable to the district court, the record contains sufficient, corroborating non-hearsay evidence to support the district court's finding that Ms. Brumme violated her probation by failing to provide current, valid addresses.\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6776099\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/378/599/\">\n    378 P.3d at 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining the record contained direct evidence of noncompliance in addition to the court's reliance on a hearsay statement). Although Agent Hatch testified that Ms. Brumme's sister informed him that she did not live with her and that she had never lived with her, this hearsay testimony was not the only testimony Agent Hatch offered. He also testified that Ms. Brumme was not at her sister's residence when he arrived on August 8, 2017, and Ms. Brumme provided a new address after he inquired about her living arrangements. This undisputed testimony does not constitute hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b616] Agent Hatch also testified that Ms. Brumme was not at her cousin's residence on August 21, 2017, in corroboration of the hearsay statements of Ms. Brumme's cousin, who further informed Agent Hatch that Ms. Brumme did not live with her. Mr. Rhodes also testified that Ms. Brumme was \"really mad\" he took their only vehicle to work with him on the day of her scheduled appointment with Agent Hatch. The district court could reasonably infer from Mr. Rhodes' testimony that Ms. Brumme was living with him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b617] Agent Hatch's undisputed non-hearsay testimony, coupled with the testimony of Mr. Rhodes and Agent Hatch's hearsay statements the district court found to be probative, trustworthy, and credible, more than support the district court's determination that Ms. Brumme violated a condition of her probation by failing to accurately inform her probation officer of her living arrangements. The district court did not abuse its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Willful Violation of Probation for Missed Urinalysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b618] Ms. Brumme's remaining two issues are interrelated and we consider them together. Ms. Brumme first asserts the record lacks any \"affirmative evidence\" that she missed a scheduled urinalysis on August 18, 2017. She also asserts that even if sufficient evidence exists to prove she missed the appointment, the violation was not willful. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b619] Ms. Brumme argues that Agent Hatch never testified she missed the appointment, but rather, that fact was improperly implied in the prosecutor's question. The prosecutor asked, \"Did you attempt to reschedule or contact her after she failed to attend the UA you had directed?\" Agent Hatch replied, \"Yes,\" and described that he did so by going to the address Ms. Brumme provided him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b620] In support of her argument, Ms. Brumme relies on Instruction 1.01 of the Wyoming Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   If any counsel suggests by any of his questions that certain hinted facts are or are not true, you must disregard any such suggestion and must not draw any inference from it. As to any statement made by counsel in your presence concerning the facts of the case, you must not regard such a statement as evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   W.C.P.J.I. 1.01. Ms. Brumme concedes the pattern instruction is not \"directly applicable.\" We conclude the pattern instruction is\n   not applicable at all.

The record reflects Ms. Brumme knew the terms of her probation required her to attend all appointments scheduled by her probation officer and submit to urinalysis testing. Agent Hatch verbally informed Ms. Brumme of her urinalysis appointment scheduled for August 18, 2017, at 8:00 a.m.; her knowledge of the appointment was confirmed through the testimony of Mr. Rhodes stating she was \"really mad\" at him for taking their only vehicle with him to work on the day of her appointment. According to Agent Hatch, Ms. Brumme did not attempt to contact him prior to her appointment or at any time after missing her appointment to offer an explanation for her absence. Nor did Ms. Brumme offer any evidence to show that other forms of transportation were unavailable to her on that date. Ms. Brumme's actions and inactions are sufficient to support the district court's determination that she willfully violated her probation. The district court's determination was not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   [\u00b625] After determining Ms. Brumme willfully violated three conditions of her probation, the district court revoked its order deferring judgment on Ms. Brumme's child endangerment charge and revoked her probation on the possession charge. All that is necessary to uphold the district court's decision \"is evidence that it made a conscientious judgment, after hearing the facts,\" and deliberated \"not only upon the violation, but also the reasons the conditions were originally imposed and the circumstances surrounding the violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Mapp v.

The district court considered the evidence of Ms. Brumme's intentional and purposeful attempts to evade contact with her probation officer by failing to keep him informed of her residence and failing to appear for her urinalysis testing. The district court also considered Ms. Brumme's failure to enroll in a treatment program for her addiction as ordered, particularly in light of her initial noncooperation in completing the assessment. We have said \"[t]he granting of probation is addressed to the discretion of the trial court and is an act of grace, of clemency.\"\n   <em>\n    Gailey v.
