APP . P. 41. The district court certified three questions relating to the interpretation of the Governmental Immunity Act of Utah, Utah Code sections 63G-7-101 to 904 (Immunity Act). The certified questions are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. Are the Utah State University Research Foundation and the Utah State University Advanced Weather Systems Foundation entitled to immunity under the Governmental Immunity Act of Utah ... as a public corporation and/or an instrumentality of the state?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2. Utah Code sections 63G-7-501 and 502 vest exclusive, original jurisdiction over any action brought under the Immunity Act in the district courts and venue in the county in which the claim arose or in Salt Lake County. Do these provisions\n   reflect an intent by the State of Utah to limit the Immunity Act's waiver of sovereign immunity to suits brought in Utah district courts?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   3. If question 2 is answered in the affirmative, does the Office of the Attorney General for the State of Utah or any litigant have authority under Utah law to waive the jurisdictional and venue provisions enacted by the Utah Legislature in the Immunity Act?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b62 These questions raise important, unanswered questions of state law. We therefore provide the applicable legal standard for determining what is an instrumentality of the state. However, \"[o]ur authority to answer certified questions ... is a matter of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Zimmerman v. Univ. of Utah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%201\">\n    2018 UT 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567378\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/78/\">\n    417 P.3d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). And we use that discretion here to decline to establish a legal standard for public corporation immunity based on the focus of the parties' briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b63 The second and third certified questions are relevant only if one of the entities involved is an instrumentality of the state or a public corporation. Because that is a decision that must be made by the district court, we forgo answering the second and third questions before the first question has been answered in the affirmative, thereby necessitating answers to these questions. However, we noted significant confusion among the parties about the proper interpretation of the second and third certified questions. In light of this, we highlight this confusion so that, should the district court choose to certify these questions to us again, we can provide guidance in the way that is most helpful to the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b64 GeoMetWatch filed a lawsuit against various defendants in federal district court. Relevant to this certification from the district court, GeoMetWatch brought causes of action against Utah State University Research Foundation (USURF) and two of its employees-Robert Behunin and Curtis Roberts-and Utah State University Advanced Weather Systems Foundation (AWSF) and one of its employees-Scott Jensen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b65 USURF and AWSF are both 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporations wholly owned and operated by Utah State University (USU). USURF and AWSF were incorporated to carry out the functions of USU. Additionally, both entities' founding boards are appointed by USU.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b66 The defendants filed motions for summary judgment in federal court on multiple claims, alleging that the district court lacks jurisdiction over the claims because GeoMetWatch had not complied with the notice and undertaking requirements in the Immunity Act. As a result of those motions, the district court \"became concerned that it may not have jurisdiction to adjudicate whether the procedural requirements of the Immunity Act have been met due to the jurisdiction and venue limitations in Utah Code sections 63G-7-501 and 502.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b67 Based on these concerns, the district court certified three important but unresolved questions of state law for our review. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Utah Code section 78A-3-102(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b68 \"A certified question from the federal district court does not present us with a decision to affirm or reverse a lower court's decision; as such, traditional standards of review do not apply.\"\n   <em>\n    Garfield Cty. v.

When presented with a certified question, \"we merely answer the question presented, leaving resolution of the parties' competing claims and arguments ... up to the federal courts, which of course retain jurisdiction to decide [the] case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569494\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/46/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alterations in original) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b69 The federal district court has certified three questions of state law. The first question is focused on whether the defendants are public corporations or instrumentalities of the state and are thereby covered governmental entities for the purposes of the Immunity Act. We set out the applicable legal standard for determining whether an entity is an instrumentality of the state, but we do not address whether the defendants meet this criterion. Instead, we leave this determination to the district court. We also decline to address the appropriate legal standard for determining whether an entity is a public corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b610 The second and third certified questions require us to interpret the jurisdiction and venue provisions of the Immunity Act. The parties disagree about the proper interpretation of the thrust of these questions. And, based on the contents of the certification order, we see additional potential interpretations not addressed by the parties. Because these questions are relevant only if the defendants are governmental entities under the Immunity Act, we decline to answer these questions before the district court determines whether the defendants are covered by the Immunity Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b611 Nonetheless, we view certification orders as a dialogue between our court and the federal courts. So we discuss the relevant interpretations presented by the parties or contemplated by this court. By doing so, we hope to provide the district court with the opportunity to clarify the true nature of the question posed to both the parties and to this court should the district court choose to certify these questions to us again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I. GOVERNMENT ENTITY UNDER THE GOVERNMENT IMMUNITY ACT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b612 The Immunity Act is a \"comprehensive chapter\" containing \"waivers and retentions of immunity\" that \"appl[y] to all functions of government\" and \"govern[ ] all claims against governmental entities or against their employees or agents [under specific conditions].\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 63G-7-101(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unless immunity is waived by the Immunity Act, \"each governmental entity and each employee of a governmental entity are immune from suit for any injury that results from the exercise of a governmental function.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569494\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/46/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-7-201(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b613 The defendants contend that they are governmental entities or employees of a governmental entity covered by the Immunity Act. The term \"[g]overnmental entity\" means \"the state and its political subdivisions as\" defined in the Immunity Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569494\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/46/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-7-102(4). The \"[s]tate\" is defined as \"the state of Utah, and includes each office, department, division, agency, authority, commission, board, institution, hospital, college, university, Children's Justice Center,\n   <em>\n    or other instrumentality of the state\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569494\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/46/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-7-102(10) (emphasis added). \"Political subdivision\" is defined as \"any county, city, town, school district, community reinvestment agency, special improvement or taxing district, local district, special service district, an entity created by an interlocal agreement adopted under Title 11, Chapter 13, Interlocal Cooperation Act, or other governmental subdivision\n   <em>\n    or public corporation\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569494\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/46/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-7-102(8) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b614 The defendants do not argue that they fall under one of the specifically enumerated categories in the definitions of state or political subdivision. Instead, they contend that they are covered under the catchall provisions of \"other instrumentality of the state\" and \"other ... public corporation.\" The first certified question asks us to interpret these broad terms so that the district court may determine whether USURF and AWSF fall\n   into one of these sweeping categorical expressions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b615 When interpreting a statute, \"our primary objective is to ascertain the intent of the legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

However, those two cases are unhelpful here-they hold that instrumentality of the state and public corporation are terms of art in their respective states based upon the use of one of those terms in the state's constitution, code, or caselaw.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hagman v.

In fact, when GeoMetWatch discusses how instrumentality of the state and public corporation should be defined as terms of art in Utah, it does not reference their use as terms of art in California and Louisiana or even mention those cases to buttress its argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b619 Additionally, GeoMetWatch fails to provide a definition that each term should have when used as a term of art in Utah. In fact, GeoMetWatch fails to analyze each term separately at all. Instead, GeoMetWatch cites more than a dozen cases from other jurisdictions that deal with terms\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   than the ones that are at issue here. For example, many of the cases cited attempt to define \"arm of the state,\" which is a term relevant for Eleventh Amendment immunity purposes. But the governmental immunity\n   provided under the Eleventh Amendment is not coextensive with the coverage provided by the Immunity Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ambus v.

Moreover, the cited cases use tests that apply widely variant criteria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   GeoMetWatch asks us to take these tests, notwithstanding their disparity and analysis of terms\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   than public corporation or instrumentality of the state, and create a\n   <em>\n    single\n   </em>\n   six-part test for\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   public corporation and instrumentality of the state.

Looking at the dictionaries they cite, two operative categories emerge: 1) a general definition of instrumentality as a means by which something is achieved and 2) a more specific definition of instrumentality as it relates to governmental operation. For example,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   provides two relevant definitions for instrumentality: \"1. A thing used to achieve an end or purpose. 2.

USURF takes a slightly different approach, arguing that \"no party can waive the [Immunity] Act's jurisdictional or venue requirements in state-court proceedings,\" but whether a party \"can invoke or waive the State's immunity defenses when litigating in federal court\" is a federal question with a federal answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b664 The proper interpretation of, and answer to, the third question depends on two factors not discussed by the parties.

Second, we would be required to undertake a different analysis depending on the person or entity waiving the provisions. Although the district court expressly asks\n   whether the Attorney General has the authority to waive the jurisdiction and venue provisions, it also asks the same of \"any litigant.\" The district court later stated that it was requesting guidance \"as to whether Utah law allows for the Utah Attorney General or another governmental litigant to waive the jurisdiction and venue conditions of the Immunity Act.\" We therefore see a proper analysis of this question focusing on both governmental entities and employees of governmental entities, represented by the Attorney General or by private counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b665 We believe there are three potential (and interrelated) interpretations of the district court's third question not raised by the parties: 1) Does the Attorney General or any other litigant have the authority to affirmatively waive compliance with conditions to the waiver of immunity under the Immunity Act?; 2) Can a governmental entity (or an employee of a governmental entity) waive conditions to the waiver of immunity under the Immunity Act by not asserting it?\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and 3) Is the assertion of noncompliance with conditions to the waiver of immunity under the Immunity Act subject to equitable remedies based on litigation and/or other conduct?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b666 Importantly, these interpretations are relevant only if the jurisdiction and venue provisions are treated as conditions to the waiver of immunity.
