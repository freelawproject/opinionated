Mr. Steffensen asks this court to reverse the district court's findings of misconduct, direct that the case against him be dismissed, and vacate the sanction of disbarment. We affirm the district court's findings of misconduct, reverse the district court's imposition of sanctions, and remand to the district court for a new sanctions determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 After graduating from Stanford Law School in 1980, Mr. Steffensen became a member of the bar and began working as a lawyer in a large firm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He primarily represented a major bank focused on transactional work and real estate development. He left the firm approximately seven years later, continuing to work as a lawyer in a sole proprietorship. Then, in 1995, Mr. Steffensen incorporated the first of his many professional law firms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 Mr. Steffensen repeatedly failed to maintain accounting practices that would keep his law firms viable. Mr. Steffensen acknowledges his \"gross[ ] negligen[ce]\" in \"failing to file ... employee withholding tax returns.\" Additionally, Mr. Steffensen opened a new law firm each time the previous one financially floundered. To date, Mr. Steffensen has incorporated five firms subsequent to his sole proprietorship. Financial trouble led to the demise of at least three previous firms,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   with taxes left unpaid. The law firm currently in operation is AAA Law, PC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 Mr. Steffensen's first incorporated law firm-Brian W. Steffensen, a Professional Law Corporation (Firm #1)-operated from 1995 to 2001 and closed, resulting in an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) seizure of all assets \"because of his failure to pay withholding taxes.\" Mr. Steffensen also had problems with the Utah State Tax Commission with Firm #1. Mr. Steffensen admits having someone apply for a withholding account number for Firm #1 in 1995. So he has known since at least 1995 that he had a responsibility to withhold money from the employees' paychecks and pay that money to the Tax Commission. He also admits to knowing that filing a return was required even if no taxes were due and claims that he filed all returns for Firm #1. And, although he filed returns, he never remitted the taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Upon the heels of the IRS seizure, Mr. Steffensen established Steffensen Law, PC (Firm #2), which operated from 2002 to 2003. Operations under this firm ended due to \"the exact same problems with payroll and the Tax Commission\" as the first. In the same year, 2003, Mr. Steffensen started his third law firm, S Law, P.C. (Firm #3), which\n   ceased operation in 2007 \"because the financial and tax irregularities continued to exist.\" When Firm #3 closed, Mr. Steffensen established his next firm, SB Law, PC (Firm #4), which remained in operation until 2013. When that firm was in financial jeopardy, he established AAA Law, PC (Firm #5), Mr. Steffensen's currently operating law firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 The Tax Commission began to scrutinize Mr. Steffensen's employee tax withholding practices in 2006 when the filing process of one of his employees was suspended and came under review by the Tax Commission because her W2 from Firm #3 did not have a state withholding tax number. The Tax Commission investigated both Mr. Steffensen's business and personal taxes. While the Tax Commission started with investigating only Mr. Steffensen's law firm listed on the questionable W2, it soon discovered several withholding accounts for other businesses and began investigating those as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 In September 2008, the Tax Commission completed an investigation of Mr. Steffensen and recommended he be criminally charged with violating: (1) Utah Code section 76-8-1101(1)(c)(i), Failure to File; (2) Utah Code section 76-8-1101(1)(d)(i), Willful Evasion; and (3) Utah Code section 76-6-513(2), Unlawful Dealings of Property by a Fiduciary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 The Tax Commission's investigation uncovered a number of potential violations of tax law on Mr. Steffensen's part. As of July 2008, Firm #1 had an unpaid outstanding withholding tax account balance of $44,395.46. Mr. Steffensen broke seven payment arrangements regarding this balance. Regarding Firm #2, Mr. Steffensen perpetuated the same problems he had with the first firm. Additionally, Mr. Steffensen used invalid state withholding tax identification numbers, and the W2s he distributed to employees falsely declared that money had been withheld and remitted. And, as of September 2008, he still owed $48,895.17 for withholding taxes, penalties, and interest for tax years 2002-2006. Moreover, in operating Firm #3, Mr. Steffensen failed to file withholding returns for 2003 through 2006. He failed to remit withholdings for this firm's entire existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 In May 2009, Mr. Steffensen was charged with one count each of Failing to Render a Proper Tax Return (for tax years 2003-2008), Intent to Evade (for tax years 2003-2008), and Unlawful Dealing of Property by a Fiduciary (for years 2003-2006). On March 1, 2010, Mr. Steffensen entered into a diversion agreement with the State in which he did not admit to guilt but did admit there was probable cause for the charges against him. In that agreement, the charges were amended to an \"attempt to commit a crime,\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-4-101,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   namely \"knowingly and intentionally, and without a reasonable good faith basis, fail[ing] to make, render, sign or verify any return within the time required by law,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 76-8-1101(1)(c)(i). Mr. Steffensen in turn paid all taxes along with penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 After receiving notice of Mr. Steffensen's criminal charges in September 2009, the Office of Professional Conduct (OPC) alleged three violations in its case against Mr. Steffensen. The first claim under rule 8.4(b) of the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct is that Mr. Steffensen engaged in criminal\n   conduct that reflects adversely on his fitness to practice law. The second claim under rule 8.4(c) is that he engaged in dishonest conduct. And the third claim under rule 8.4(a) is that he engaged in misconduct by violating or attempting to violate the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 The district court concluded that Mr. Steffensen violated rule 8.4(b) and (c) of the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct. The court found professional misconduct under rule 8.4(b) for \"committ[ing] the criminal act [under Utah Code section 76-8-1101(1)(c)(i) ] of Failing to Render a Proper Tax Return [and] ... committ[ing] the criminal act [under Utah Code section 76-4-101 ] of Attempted Failing to Render a Proper Tax Return.\" The district court concluded that these \"committed criminal acts,\" established \"[b]y a preponderance of the evidence,\" \"reflect adversely on [Mr. Steffensen's] honesty, truthfulness or fitness as a lawyer [i]n other respects.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 The district court concluded that Mr. Steffensen committed professional misconduct under rule 8.4(c) because he \"engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to the criminal acts under rule 8.4(b), the district court found (1) that Mr. Steffensen, \"in the context of operating the law firm,\" failed \"to remit to the Tax Commission the amounts that [his] employees were ultimately obligated to pay in their taxes,\" which was \"dishonest;\" (2) that he distributed \"W2s to [his] employees stating that the tax monies had been withheld and remitted\" when they had not, which constituted a misrepresentation; and (3) \"that he presented [financial statements] to his bank in order to get a loan\" that were in conflict with \"forms he presented to the Tax Commission to obtain a financial hardship exemption\" and therefore that \"Mr. Steffensen's statements about his income and finances [that] he presented to the Tax Commission to receive a financial hardship exemption contained material misrepresentations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 The district court held a sanctions hearing and concluded that the violations of the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct justified the disbarment of Mr. Steffensen under Rule Governing the Utah State Bar 14-605(a)(1) and (a)(2). Mr. Steffensen appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant to article VIII, section 4 of the Utah Constitution and Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 The Utah Supreme Court has a constitutional mandate to \"govern the practice of law, including ... the conduct and discipline of persons admitted to practice law.\" UTAH CONST. art. VIII, \u00a7 4. Because of this mandate, professional discipline cases form a unique subset of the cases we hear and have a unique standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 While we generally \"presume that the [lower tribunal's] findings of fact are correct\" unless clearly erroneous, in attorney discipline cases we \"reserve the right to draw inferences from basic facts which may differ from the inferences drawn by the [lower tribunal].\"\n   <em>\n    In re Discipline of Babilis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11871119\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/951/207/#p213\">\n    951 P.2d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 213 (Utah 1997) (alterations in original) (citations omitted). Additionally, although \"we always give serious consideration to the findings and [rulings] of the [district court],\" \"we must treat the ultimate determination of discipline as our responsibility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11871119\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/951/207/#p213\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alterations in original) (citations omitted).

And, finding that Mr. Steffensen did commit professional misconduct, we then turn to the imposition of sanctions for those violations to determine whether the court applied the proper standard in its sanctioning of him. On the record before us, we find that the district court erred in its imposition of sanctions for Mr. Steffensen's violations, but understandably so given the inconsistencies in the comment section of rule 8.4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   I.

GOVERNING UTAH STATE BAR 14-511.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b620 In these proceedings brought before the district court by the OPC, the court concluded Mr. Steffensen violated both rule 8.4(b) and (c). Mr. Steffensen challenges the admissibility of evidence that the court allowed in his adjudication hearing as well as the court's determination of his mental state. He argues that the evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial. We hold that the evidence was relevant and admissible. Mr. Steffensen also argues that the district court's determination that his actions were \"knowing and intentional\" was not supported by the evidence. We disagree and affirm the district\n   court's findings of fact and conclusions of law at the adjudication hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    A. Admission of Evidence and Expert Witness Challenge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b621 At each stage of the trial, Mr. Steffensen objected with regularity to the relevance, unfair prejudice, and admissibility of the evidence. On appeal, Mr. Steffensen challenges the admission of evidence regarding (1) his failure to file personal tax returns, (2) his failure to file corporate tax returns, (3) his personal banking records, and (4) his personal estate planning. In less than one page, he summarily claims that the admission of this evidence violated Utah Rules of Evidence 401, 403, and 404(b)(1). But Mr. Steffensen fails to expound on his arguments-he does not discuss the challenged evidence (beyond listing broad categories) or explain why that evidence was irrelevant under rule 401, unfairly prejudicial under rule 403, or admitted in violation of rule 404(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b622 These arguments are inadequately briefed. \"Appellants have the burden to clearly set forth the issues ... and to provide reasoned argument and [valid] legal authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Espenschied Transp.

And Mr. Steffensen further does not address the district court's response to his objections-that the objections would go to the weight of the evidence, not the admissibility. The court also noted that it would \"give those documents the weight that they deserve[d],\" and further conceded that the court would \"give counsel an opportunity to argue that [the court] should give them no weight.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b624 With the exception of one reference to a loan application,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court appears to have given very little, if any, weight to the objected-to evidence in coming to its conclusions. Based on the nature of the proceeding as a bench trial, we have little doubt that the district court only considered appropriate relevant and nonprejudicial evidence, and there is nothing in the district court's findings to indicate otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

To qualify as professional misconduct a criminal act alone is insufficient. It must also reflect poorly on the qualities required of a practicing attorney (i.e., \"honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6955221\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/321/1136/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the court concluded, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Mr. Steffensen committed the criminal acts of Failure to Render a Proper Tax Return and Attempted Failure to Render a Proper Tax Return. It further concluded that these \"criminal acts reflect adversely on his honesty, truthfulness or fitness as a lawyer [i]n other respects[ ]\" in violation of rule 8.4(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b628 Finding that Mr. Steffensen failed to render a proper tax return, a violation of Utah Code section 76-8-1101(1)(c)(i), required finding that Mr. Steffensen \"knowingly and intentionally, and without a reasonable good faith basis, fail[ed] to ... render ... any return within the time required by law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Steffensen does not dispute that during the four-year period in question his law firm did not render tax returns. And the district court found no evidence of a good faith basis for the failure. Therefore, the main issue before the district court was whether Mr. Steffensen acted knowingly and intentionally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b629 Mr. Steffensen argues that\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   did not \"knowingly and intentionally\" fail to file, but rather that his employees failed to file. On the other hand, the OPC presented circumstantial evidence of Mr. Steffensen's state of mind, requiring the district court to make a credibility determination by weighing the evidence before it.

Mr. Steffensen has had a lengthy career as a practicing lawyer. \"Mr. Steffensen is a bright and accomplished lawyer, not someone with ignorance of the laws.\" He has worked for large firms, as a solo practitioner, and at small law firms he owned and operated. Mr. Steffensen testified that he knew about the requirements surrounding withholding taxes. Mr. Steffensen had dealt with the ramifications of failing to pay federal taxes and as a result \"would have been acutely aware of his obligations going forward.\" \"There were numerous offenses\" and \"numerous occasions of his failure to remit.\" Mr. Steffensen also testified that because he failed to remit withholding taxes, he has paid penalties and fines (totaling about $100,000), approximately double what he would have paid had he remitted the taxes timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b631 Mr. Steffensen offered only his own testimony to the district court as a defense.

Indeed, at oral argument, Mr. Steffensen candidly admitted that even those closest to him with the best ability to judge his character found his story hard to swallow. Moreover, considering this admission in addition to all the other factual findings before us, we choose to defer to the district court's determination and find that the evidence supports the district court's findings, which in turn support its legal conclusion that, by a preponderance of the evidence, Mr. Steffensen violated Utah Code sections 76-8-1101(1)(c)(i) and 76-4-101 by knowingly and intentionally failing to render a tax return and attempting to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b633 Having agreed with the district court that Mr. Steffensen's conduct satisfies the \"criminal acts\" element of professional misconduct under rule 8.4(b), we also agree that these acts reflect negatively \"on a lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness ... in other respects.\" UTAH R.

When a lawyer intentionally fails to file and render taxes, his \"honesty\" and \"trustworthiness\" are unquestionably called into doubt. Knowingly and intentionally avoiding one's employee withholding tax obligations as owner of a law firm also undermines the public's trust in the legal profession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH R.

Certain or not, \"knowingly and intentionally\" failing to file taxes is a crime that reflects adversely on a lawyer's fitness to practice law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   2. Violation of Rule 8.4(c)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b635 Rule 8.4(c) defines \"engag[ing] in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation\" as professional misconduct. UTAH R. PROF'L CONDUCT 8.4(c). Unlike rule 8.4(b), which requires criminal conduct, rule 8.4(c) looks at professional misconduct irrespective of criminality. The district court concluded that \"Mr. Steffensen engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation and his conduct violated Rule 8.4(c) of the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct.\" We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b636 The district court concluded that Mr. Steffensen had committed three violations of rule 8.4(c). First, the district court concluded that Mr. Steffensen's failure to remit money that was not owned by his firm was dishonest conduct. Specifically, in addition to failing to render proper tax returns, Mr. Steffensen also failed to remit withholding taxes. By his own testimony, the money was never withheld because there was only enough money to cover the net income of his employees. The district court found that \"Mr. Steffensen acknowledged that funds that were to be withheld from employee's checks were not withheld. Instead, [he] calculated his payroll obligations on the net amount and in doing so underpaid his employees.\" Despite maintaining a \"client trust account,\" Mr. Steffensen failed to maintain the similar \"Tax Commission trust account\" for his employees' tax funds. The court acknowledged that \"[t]he tax monies Mr. Steffensen failed to remit were not owned by him or his law firm,\" and this \"had the potential for causing substantial damage to his employees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b637 Second, and relatedly, Mr. Steffensen provided W2s to his employees that reflected that money was withheld and remitted to the state government. The district court concluded that representing to his employees that money was withheld and remitted to the state when it was not clearly fell within the bounds of misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b638 Finally, the district court concluded that Mr. Steffensen violated rule 8.4(c) because he presented financial statements \"to his bank in order to get a loan [that] conflicted with forms he presented to the Tax Commission to obtain a financial hardship exemption.\" The statements contained in his financial hardship application \"contained material misrepresentations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b639 Mr. Steffensen makes only two challenges to the district court's conclusion that he violated rule 8.4(c). The first is that for the same reasons the OPC could not show he acted \"knowingly and intentionally\" for purposes of rule 8.4(b), it could not show that he \"knowingly and intentionally engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, deceit or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c).\" We have already affirmed the district court's determination that Mr. Steffensen acted knowingly and intentionally.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b640 The second challenge is with regard to the discrepancies between the bank loan application and the information and records given to the Tax Commission when he applied for a hardship exemption. Mr. Steffensen argues that the finding that the discrepancies in his information given to the bank and the Tax Commission constituted a misrepresentation was erroneous. According to Mr. Steffensen, the district court's finding was based on the following discrepancy: in 2005, he listed shares of restricted stock as part of his financial assets on a loan application but then did not list them as part of his 2008 hardship exemption application to the Tax Commission. Mr. Steffensen admits that the documents contained \"substantially different financial information,\" but contends that it was because the restricted stock had no value by 2008, a fact to which he testified at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b641 In response, the OPC argues that \"[n]o evidence was introduced to corroborate Mr. Steffensen's testimony regarding the stated loss of value.\" Additionally, the OPC agrees that the discrepancy discussed by Mr. Steffensen was one of the misrepresentations found by the district court, but contends that \"there were other discrepancies that the district court found to be misleading when Mr. Steffensen provided information to the Tax Commission.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b642 The OPC does not provide any record support for its assertion that the district court found other material misrepresentations and we cannot find any support for this contention in the district court's order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, we focus on whether the district court erred in determining that the discrepancies in the stock assets listed on the 2005 loan application and 2008 hardship exemption application constituted a material misrepresentation. We conclude that it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b643 Mr. Steffensen testified at trial that the stock had no value by the time he submitted his hardship exemption application in 2008. The OPC offers us no evidence, direct or circumstantial, to contradict Mr. Steffensen's testimony. Instead, the OPC hangs its hat on the fact that Mr. Steffensen never presented evidence of the stocks' decrease in value.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b644 The OPC has the burden of proving that Mr. Steffensen committed each violation of the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. GOVERNING UTAH STATE BAR 14-517;\n   <em>\n    In re Discipline of Steffensen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800105\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/373/186/\">\n    2016 UT 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800105\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/373/186/\">\n    373 P.3d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The OPC cannot meet this burden of proving that Mr. Steffensen's hardship application contained a misrepresentation by merely highlighting that he did not provide additional support to his uncontradicted testimony explaining the discrepancy. Because the OPC fails to provide any evidentiary support that undermines Mr. Steffensen's explanation for the discrepancy, we conclude that the district court erred in determining that the hardship exemption application contained a misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b645 Therefore, we reject the district court's third finding of a violation of rule 8.4(c), but leave the other two findings-the dishonest conduct in failing to remit the tax monies and the misrepresentations on the W2s-untouched. Therefore, in determining the appropriate sanctions for Mr. Steffensen's violations of rule 8.4(c), only the two remaining violations should be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   II. DISBARMENT IS AN INAPPROPRIATE SANCTION UNDER RULE 14-605(a)(1) OR (a)(2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b646 We typically defer to the district court's findings in attorney discipline cases in\n   circumstances like this where the district court has to make a credibility determination of a witness. However, when the analysis involves \"the discipline actually imposed,\" this task invokes \"our constitutional responsibility\" and \"requires us to make an independent determination as to its correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Discipline of Grimes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975527\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/297/564/\">\n    2012 UT 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975527\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/297/564/\">\n    297 P.3d 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). In doing so, we are conscious of the serious consequences that can result. \"Disbarment is the harshest sanction available for attorney misconduct. It ... result[s] in the complete loss of [the attorney's] career and reputation.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Discipline of Bates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342566\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1039/\">\n    2017 UT 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342566\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1039/\">\n    391 P.3d 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (third alteration in original) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because disbarment is so harmful to an attorney, we do not take its imposition lightly. And, in this case, we find disbarment under rule 14-605(a)(1) or (a)(2) of the Rules Governing the Utah State Bar unsubstantiated, and we remand for a new determination of the appropriate sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    A. Disbarment Under Rule 14-605(a)(1)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b647 Rule 14-605(a)(1) states, in relevant part, that disbarment is appropriate when a lawyer \"knowingly engages in professional misconduct as defined in Rule 8.4(a), (d), (e), or (f) of the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct.\" R. GOVERNING UTAH STATE BAR 14-605(a)(1). Notably, rule 8.4(b) and (c) are absent in rule 14-605(a)(1), which governs sanctions for the other sections of Utah Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4. We presume this omission was intentional. Further, the structure of the rule confirms that this omission was no mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b648 Rule 14-605 distinguishes between behavior that qualifies for disbarment, suspension, reprimand, and admonition. Not all professional misconduct defined in rule 8.4(a), (d), (e), or (f) results in presumptive disbarment, and it is therefore graded using specific criteria as shown in rule 14-605(a)(1), (b)(1), (c)(1), and (d)(1). Violations of rule 8.4(b) or (c) are notably absent from 14-605(a)(1), (b)(1), (c)(1), and (d)(1). Instead, the appropriate sanctions for violations of rule 8.4(b) or (c) appear in other subsections of rule 14-605.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b649 The language of subsections (a)(2) and (b)(2) mirror the criminal conduct requirements of rule 8.4(b), providing for sanctions when an attorney \"engages in serious criminal conduct,\" R. GOVERNING UTAH STATE BAR 14-605(a)(2), or \"engages in criminal conduct\" that does not meet the requirements of subsection (a)(2),\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342566\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1039/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342566\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1039/\">\n    14-605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). Similarly, the language of subsections (a)(3) and (c)(2) provide for sanctions for \"dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation,\" mirroring the misconduct in rule 8.4(c). This structure and the nature of the language of rule 14-605 confirm that the omission of rule 8.4 sections (b) and (c) from rule 14-605(a)(1) is not only intentional, but also significant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b650 The OPC argues that by virtue of comment [1a] of rule 8.4, any violation of the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct falls under the umbrella of rule 8.4(a) when the time for sanctions arrives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   This cannot be the case.

But we believe a fairer reading of the comment limits its scope to violations of rules other than rule 8.4. If a violation of any of the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct could also be a violation of rule 8.4(a), rule 14-605(a)(1), (b)(1), (c)(1), and (d)(1) would encompass the entirety of rule 8.4, including rule 8.4(b) and (c), rendering the rest of rule 14-605 superfluous.

Violations of rule 8.4(b) do not trigger disbarment under rule 14-605(a)(1) when violated but must be assessed under subsections (a)(2) and (b)(2) for the appropriateness of disbarment. Similarly, violations of rule 8.4(c) do not trigger disbarment under rule 14-605(a)(1) but must be assessed under subsections (a)(3) and (c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    B.

Without specific findings that a violation of rule 8.4(c) falls under the requirements of rule 14-605(a)(3), including that it \"seriously adversely reflects on the lawyer's fitness to practice law\" and is \"intentional misconduct\"\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   than conduct that would fall under rule 14-605(a)(1) or (a)(2), we will not presume disbarment is the appropriate sanction under rule 14-605(a)(3). \"[A]lthough we always give serious consideration to the findings and [rulings] of the [district court],\" we will not hold that disbarment is appropriate without clear documentation of the rationale and reasoning for the court's conclusion.\n   <em>\n    In re Discipline of Bates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342566\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1039/\">\n    2017 UT 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342566\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1039/\">\n    391 P.3d 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (second and third alterations in original) (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Discipline of Ince\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11831889\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/957/1233/#p1236\">\n    957 P.2d 1233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1236 (Utah 1998) (\"With respect to the discipline actually imposed, our constitutional responsibility requires us to make an independent determination as to its correctness.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b658 This does not imply that Mr. Steffensen's conduct must go unsanctioned. Rule 14-605 leaves open several possibilities, including that his conduct for violating rule 8.4(c) falls under rule 14-605(a)(3) or (c)(2), and that his conduct for violating rule 8.4(b)\"seriously adversely reflects on [Mr. Steffensen's] fitness to practice law,\" warranting suspension under rule 14-605(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b659 Here, the district court does find that \"Mr. Steffensen's failure to remit tax monies [not owned by him or his law firm but belonging to the employees] affected his employees who were entitled to rely on him to remit their taxes.\" This \"failure to remit\" the money that should have been held in trust for his employees \"had the potential for causing substantial damage to his employees\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was dishonest conduct. And, \"[t]he distribution of W2s to the employees stating that the tax monies had been withheld and remitted\" was dishonest conduct and a misrepresentation under rule 8.4(c). The \"potential for causing substantial damage to his employees\" is not the same as \"seriously adversely reflect[ing] on the lawyer's fitness to practice law.\" In the orders before us, the district court did not make any determinations as to the appropriate sanctions that misconduct under rule 8.4(c) merits other than lumping this misconduct together with the misconduct found in rule 8.4(b) to reach disbarment under rule 14-605(a)(1). We have rejected rule 14-605(a)(1) as inappropriate for violations of rule 8.4(b) or (c). And we have further rejected rule 14-605(a)(2) as the appropriate sanction for violations of rule 8.4(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b660 Without reopening the proceedings, we leave it to the district court to interpret its own order and encourage the court to include more detailed findings specific to each violation\n   and the rationale behind the sanction imposed for each violation. In doing so, we implore all state district courts to be detailed in their findings and to be clear in tying the sanction imposed to the professional misconduct found. Therefore, having rejected disbarment under rule 14-605(a)(1) and (a)(2), we remand to the district court for clarification of its findings of fact and conclusions of law in its order regarding Mr. Steffensen's sanctions for professional misconduct under rule 8.4(b) and (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b661 Having reviewed the findings and conclusions from both Mr. Steffensen's adjudication and sanction hearings, we hold that there was no clear error in concluding that Mr. Steffensen had violated rule 8.4(b) and (c) of the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct. However, upon analyzing and clarifying the interpretation and application of rule 14-605, we hold that disbarment is unwarranted under subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b662 While we could enter a final judgment in this case under our constitutional mandate, we deem it more prudent to remand to the district court for reconsideration of the appropriate sanctions.
