On February 23, 2015, WSH staff found her sitting in the hospital's dayroom with her neck kinked awkwardly. When approached, she stated, \"I'm going to die, you're going to let me die.\" She was anxious, trembling, breathing rapidly, and reeked of urine. As staff members attempted to lift her from her chair to walk her to the hospital's \"OT room,\" they noticed numerous ants crawling on her foot. During a physical examination, WSH staff found dried blood on Ms. Gelok's visibly swollen feet, ants crawling on dark red abrasions on her feet and ankles, and insect bites. A WSH nurse practitioner diagnosed her bleeding abrasions as a \"rash\" and prescribed her prednisone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 4] When Wyoming Guardianship Corporation became aware of the situation, it ordered\n   that Ms. Gelok be taken to Evanston Regional Hospital (ERH). At ERH, hospital staff placed Ms. Gelok on oxygen, diagnosed her with a urinary tract infection, and treated her abrasions. When Ms. Gelok returned to WSH, she had a poor appetite, displayed paranoid delusions, was described as \"despondent,\" and complained of pain around her wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Later investigation revealed that Ms. Gelok had been sitting in nearly the same position on the couch in the dayroom for approximately 25 hours. During that time, no one gave her food or water, took her to the bathroom, changed her, or took her to bed. Hospital staff had done some cursory \"checks\" into the dayroom, but none of them noticed Ms. Gelok until maintenance staff requested that she be moved so they could work on the television. Investigators noticed food on the floor in several areas of the hall and observed that the dining room area floor was very dirty with food and possibly human feces. Hospital staff confirmed that the hospital had an ongoing ant-infestation problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 6] On May 12, 2016, Ms. Gelok presented a notice of claim to the appropriate governmental entities, in compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201-39-113\">\n    Wyo.
