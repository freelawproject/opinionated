The plaintiff, Copper Hills Custom Homes, then appealed those orders to this court. But we may not act on an appeal, including an appeal of a putative final order under rule 54(b), unless we are satisfied that we have appellate jurisdiction. And our review of the 54(b) certifications here reveals them to be flawed. This circumstance is by no means unique to this appeal-improper 54(b) certifications have proven to be a recurring source of jurisdictional complications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, we dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction, but take the time to readdress and refine the steps that the parties and district courts must take to ensure proper certification under rule 54(b) in order to avoid unnecessary remands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 We are not oblivious to the fact that our decision today will leave the parties feeling that form has triumphed over substance.

The final judgment rule has three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 The first exception to the final judgment rule \"is when the legislature provides a statutory avenue for appealing nonfinal orders.\"\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8389908\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/179/799/\">\n    2008 UT 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8389908\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/179/799/\">\n    179 P.3d 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). For example, Utah Code section 78B-11-129(1)(a)-(e) allows for appeals from several specific types of court orders in addition to \"a final judgment.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-11-129(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 The second exception is an interlocutory appeal. Our rules of appellate procedure prescribe when an interlocutory appeal may be requested:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   An appeal from an interlocutory order may be sought by any party by filing a petition for permission to appeal from the interlocutory order with the clerk of the appellate court with jurisdiction over the case within 20 days after the entry of the order of the trial court, with proof of service on all other parties to the action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   UTAH R. APP. P. 5(a). An interlocutory appeal is a discretionary appeal of a non-final order, meaning that the appellate court has the discretion to hear the appeal as it is not an appeal as a matter of right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10415688\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/716/806/#p807\">\n    716 P.2d at 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the existence of an exception for \"any interlocutory order or decision, but only at this Court's discretion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 15 The third exception, and the one with which we concern ourselves in this opinion, is an appeal brought under rule 54(b) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   When an action presents more than one claim for relief-whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross claim, or third party claim-and/or when multiple parties are involved, the court may enter judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay. Otherwise, any order or other decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties, and may be changed at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   UTAH R.

This exception to the final judgment rule is similar to the interlocutory appeal exception in that it allows an appellate court to weigh in on a matter even though not all of the causes of action for all of the parties have been adjudicated. It differs, primarily, in that (1) an order properly certified under rule 54(b) is considered final and appealable by right and (2) it is the district court and not the appellate court that has the discretion (at least in the first instance) to decide whether an order that does not dispose of the entire action may nevertheless be appealed if it meets certain criteria. This discretion, however, should not be interpreted to mean that appellate courts can consider matters that district courts have improperly certified.

We disavow the language that deems this issue one of subject matter jurisdiction.

We agree that in multiple party cases 54(b) certification may still be appropriate even if there is complete overlap between the certified claims and the remaining claims. And nothing in this opinion should be interpreted as being to the contrary. Nevertheless, we still require our district courts to explain whether in any given matter there is factual overlap between the certified claims and the remaining claims and why, despite any overlap, 54(b) certification is appropriate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Rule 5(a) of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure, allows us, in our discretion, to treat certain improper 54(b) certifications as interlocutory appeals. We decline to exercise that discretion here for three reasons. First, we see no basis in the materials before us to conclude that this \"appeal may materially advance the termination of the litigation,\" an integral showing in any interlocutory appeal. Utah R. App. P. 5(c)(1)(D). Second, the parties have the ability to ask the district court to re-certify the relevant orders. And third, we believe this is an allowance that we should wield judiciously and sparingly.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
