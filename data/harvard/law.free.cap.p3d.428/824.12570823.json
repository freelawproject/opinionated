Pabst appeals from the district court's summary dismissal of his motion to amend a previously adjudicated K.S.A. 60-1507 motion. On appeal, Pabst argues he timely filed his motion to amend because his arguments should relate back to the filing of his original K.S.A. 60-1507 motion filed in 2003. However, we find that Pabst has no right to amend his prior K.S.A. 60-1507 motion at this late date. Specifically, we conclude that the relation back doctrine is not applicable under the circumstances presented in this case. Moreover, we do not find that justice requires that the district court grant Pabst leave to amend his prior K.S.A. 60-1507 motion. Thus, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In affirming the denial of Pabst's prior K.S.A. 60-1507 motion, the Kansas Supreme Court summarized the underlying facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"In 1997, Pabst was first convicted of premeditated first-degree murder in the shooting death of his fianc\u00e9e, Phoebe Harkins.

However, for his last ground, Pabst's attorney stated that, because of the applicable statute of limitation, he had filed the motion prior to a full investigation and review and informed the court that Pabst intended to file supplemental pleadings, with leave of court, after an examination of the record. Inexplicably, there was no activity on the motion until September 2, 2004, when Pabst's attorney withdrew as counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Pabst requested appointed counsel on November 19, 2004, but apparently never returned the requisite paperwork. He then hired current counsel, Richard Ney, who entered an appearance on March 1, 2005, and several months later filed a pleading entitled, 'Amended Petition Pursuant to K.S.A. 60-1507.' The pleading set forth 16 grounds for relief, 10 of which differed from the original motion. Pabst had not sought or obtained leave of court to file a supplemental pleading.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The State, after obtaining a continuance, filed an answer which, inter alia, sought to dismiss those claims which were not raised in the original 60-1507 motion because the new claims were barred by the new limitation period in K.S.A. 60-1507(f). In a reply and a separate motion to strike, Pabst argued that, under K.S.A. 60-215, he had the right to amend his motion as a matter of course at any time prior to the State filing a responsive pleading; that the claims made in both pleadings were of the same type, permitting the later claim to relate back; and that the State had failed to specifically plead a statute of limitations defense as required by the Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"At an evidentiary hearing on March 15, 2006, the parties first presented arguments on the statute of limitations issue. The district court ruled that Kansas law does not require the State to answer or otherwise plead to a convict's 60-1507 motion in order to refute the motion or the evidence offered in support of the motion; that it is presumed that when a movant sets out grounds for relief under K.S.A. 60-1507, he or she has listed all of the grounds upon which he or she is relying; and that a movant cannot avail himself or herself of the relation-back standard by raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the original petition and then amending the petition to assert another ineffective assistance claim based on a distinct type of attorney malfeasance. The district court dismissed the allegations found in (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (l), (m), and (p) of the amended 'petition.' The district court proceeded on the originally filed 60-1507 motion, permitting Pabst to raise the grounds that had been abandoned by the amended 'petition.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Pabst and Irigonegaray testified as Pabst's witnesses. Irigonegaray related that he was retained by the victim's sister and parents to be an associate to the attorney general's office under K.S.A. 19-717 to assist with the prosecution of the murder trial. Irigonegaray admitted that he represented the victim's sister and her husband in a termination of parental rights and adoption case involving Pabst's child. At the time of the criminal retrial, Pabst had filed a motion to set aside the termination, and Irigonegaray was involved in the case. Irigonegaray's office was also involved in other civil cases involving the victim's family which were at least prompted by the murder, albeit the record is not altogether clear on the details of those cases or the extent of Irigonegaray's involvement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Although Irigonegaray admitted involvement in the civil cases, he denied that he ever used information from the civil cases to gain an advantage in the criminal trial. However, he did admit that the murder conviction had some impact on the attempt to set aside his client's adoption of Pabst's child. Further, Irigonegaray did use the fact that Pabst had filed two civil cases involving property to argue for a hard 40 sentence based on murder for financial gain, although the sentencing court rejected the argument and refused to impose the enhanced minimum sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Assistant Attorney General Stephen Maxwell testified on the State's behalf, acknowledging that he was the lead attorney on the case and had assigned the handling of several parts of the trial to Irigonegaray.

In 2009, he filed a federal habeas petition under 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2254 (2006) in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. Again, Pabst alleged that the state district court should have removed Irigonegaray from his criminal case due to a conflict of interest.\n   <em>\n    Pabst v.

Kan. 2009) (unpublished opinion). After the federal district court denied his petition, Pabst appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In 2011, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court's finding that Irigonegaray's participation as a privately retained attorney for the prosecution did not violate Pabst's due process rights and that he was not denied effective assistance of trial or appellate counsel.\n   <em>\n    Pabst v.

In his amended petition, Pabst asserts that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to call his trial counsel to testify regarding why he failed to object to Irigonegaray's involvement in the case as a special prosecutor. Pabst further asserts that he timely filed his amended petition because it \"relates back\" to the original K.S.A. 60-1507 motion he filed in 2003. In a 10-page Memorandum Decision, the district court found that the amended petition did not relate back to the motion filed 15 years ago. Thus, the district court summarily denied the amended petition on the grounds that it was untimely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, Pabst contends that the district court erred in summarily denying his Amended Petition for Relief Pursuant to K.S.A. 60-1507. Specifically, Pabst argues that his current pleading should relate back to the K.S.A. 60-1507 motion he filed in 2003. He further argues that he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his amended petition for relief. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When a district court summarily denies a K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 60-1507 motion, we conduct a de novo review to determine whether the motion, files, and records of the case conclusively establish that the movant is not entitled to relief.\n   <em>\n    Sola-Morales v.

To avoid the summary denial of a motion brought under K.S.A. 60-1507, a movant bears the burden of establishing entitlement to an evidentiary hearing. To meet this burden, a movant's contentions must be more than conclusory. In other words, the movant must set forth an evidentiary basis to support those contentions or the basis must be evident from the record.\n   <em>\n    State v. Sprague\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415878\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/303/418/#p425\">\n    303 Kan. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 425,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415878\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/303/418/#p425\">\n    362 P.3d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Under K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 60-1507(f)(1)(A), movants have one year to timely file a motion following the last appellate court to exercise jurisdiction on direct appeal. A movant that files a K.S.A. 60-1507 motion outside the one-year time limitation and fails to affirmatively assert \"manifest injustice\" is procedurally barred from maintaining the action.\n   <em>\n    State v. Trotter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417167\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/296/898/#p905\">\n    296 Kan. 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 905,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417167\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/296/898/#p905\">\n    295 P.3d 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). In this case, Pabst makes no argument-either in his amended petition for relief or in his brief on appeal-that the one-year time limitation should be extended pursuant to K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 60-1507(f)(2) due to manifest injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, it is undisputed that Pabst's conviction for the first-degree premeditated murder of his fianc\u00e9e became final upon the issuance of a mandate in the case of\n   <em>\n    State v. Pabst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1485239\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/273/658/\">\n    273 Kan. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1485239\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/273/658/\">\n    44 P.3d 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). We note that the Clerk of the Appellate Courts issued the mandate on May 20, 2002. It is also undisputed that Pabst did not file his amended petition for relief until August 24, 2016. Thus, we find that Pabst's Amended Petition for Relief Pursuant to K.S.A. 60-1507 is untimely on its face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Nevertheless, Pabst attempts to get around the timeliness bar by arguing that his amended petition for relief should relate back to the K.S.A. 60-1507 motion that he filed in 2003. While movants filing K.S.A. 60-1507 motions generally do not have the right to amend their original motions, they may do so if the district court-in its discretion-allows them to do so. See\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

Under this test, the new claims only relate back to the date of the filing of the original K.S.A. 60-1507 motion if they arose \"out of the conduct, transaction or occurrence set out, or attempted to be set out, in the original pleading.\" K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 60-215(c)(2) ; see\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365002\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/293/704/#p714\">\n    293 Kan. at 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, the Kansas Supreme Court affirmed the district court's decision and the Clerk of the Appellate Courts issued a mandate. As such, to allow Pabst to relate the allegations in his current motion back to his prior K.S.A. 60-1507 motion would require the district court to reopen a 15-year-old motion that our Supreme Court has already ruled upon.

As our Supreme Court found in affirming the denial of Pabst's prior motion, \"[a]n amendment to a motion for relief under K.S.A. 60-1507 that asserts a new ground for relief which is supported by facts that differ in both time and type from those grounds set forth in the original motion does not relate back to the date of the original motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Pabst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672859\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/287/1/#p2\">\n    287 Kan. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Syl. \u00b6 7. Pabst's current allegation is that his appellate counsel failed to call his trial counsel as a witness. As the district court found, Pabst is attempting to \"assert another ineffective assistance claim based upon an entirely distinct type of attorney malfeasance.\" Memorandum Decision, pp. 9-10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Champi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928720\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/419/20/#p24\">\n    419 F.3d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 24 [1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Cir. 2005] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under the circumstances presented, we do not find that the district court abused its discretion in denying Pabst's request to relate back and reopen the original K.S.A. 60-1507 motion. We also do not find that the district court erred as a matter of law. Rather, we find that the district court appropriately applied the law. Under these circumstances, we conclude that justice does not require the district court to grant Pabst leave to amend his prior K.S.A. 60-1507 motion at this late date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To the extent that Pabst is reasserting the allegation found in his original K.S.A. 60-1507 motion that Irigonegaray's conflict denied him a fair trial, this claim is barred on the ground that it is successive. A district court is not required to entertain a second or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same prisoner.\n   <em>\n    Trotter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417167\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/296/898/#p905\">\n    296 Kan. at 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is presumed that a movant filing a K.S.A. 60-1507 motion has \"listed all grounds for relief, and a subsequent motion need not be considered in the absence of a showing of circumstances justifying the original failure to list a ground.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417167\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/296/898/#p905\">\n    296 Kan. 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Syl. \u00b6 2 ; see Supreme Court Rule 183(d) (2017 Kan. S. Ct. R. 222). Kansas courts will only consider successive motions upon a showing of exceptional circumstances justifying consideration.\n   <em>\n    State v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148462\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/291/868/\">\n    291 Kan. 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Syl. \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148462\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/291/868/\">\n    248 P.3d 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ultimately, Pabst is making a backdoor attempt to relitigate the issue of whether he received a fair trial in light of the special prosecutor's conflict of interest. As indicated above, the Kansas Supreme Court has already considered this issue and found that Pabst received a fair trial. The United States District Court for the District of Kansas and the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit have decided similar, if not identical, issues. Pabst has not attempted to assert the existence of any exceptional circumstances that would allow him to have this issue litigated yet again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We conclude that the motion, files, and records in this case conclusively establish that Pabst is not entitled to relief on his amended petition. Specifically, we find the amended petition for relief to be time barred and successive. Accordingly, we affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
