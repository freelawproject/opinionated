Melvin and Glenna D. Bulloch Living Trust (the Trust) was void as a matter of law. We also consider whether the court exceeded its discretion in entering final judgment before resolving other issues relating to the administration of the Trust. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 J. Melvin Bulloch and Glenna D. Bulloch\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   established the Trust in May 1996. They were each designated as Grantors and also as Trustees of the Trust. Among its provisions, and as relevant here, the Trust provided, \"So long as both Grantors are living, they reserve the right to revoke, alter or amend this Trust instrument in whole or in part by a written instrument signed, acknowledged and delivered to the Trustees. Such election must be made by both Grantors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 In August 1998, Melvin appointed Glenna as his attorney-in-fact through a written \"General Power of Attorney\" (the Power of Attorney). The Power of Attorney defined the scope of Glenna's authority, stating that Glenna was appointed to act for Melvin as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   In my name, place and stead, to do any act or transaction which I would do myself, if I were personally present, with respect to all matters to the fullest extent that I as an individual am permitted by law to perform by and through an agent (including what I may do as Trustee of The J. Melvin and Glenna D. Bulloch Living Trust ...).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Power of Attorney then provided a non-exclusive listing of powers delegated to Glenna as attorney-in-fact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   To conduct banking transactions; to receive, endorse and cash any checks payable to me, from whatever source, to deposit such funds in any bank or invest such funds or expend such funds for my maintenance and support, whether directly or indirectly, and to have control over any funds deposited in my name, personally or in my name as Trustee ... and to have access to any safe deposit box held in my name. To conduct real estate transactions, including the power to sell, rent or lease any rights I may own in real estate, and to receive and receipt any and all rents, royalties, and all payments now due or to become due to me as I would be able to do myself (including what I may do as Trustee ...); to sign tax returns and receive and cash tax refund checks; to make gifts in my name and to take steps to perpetuate and carry out my estate plan and financial plans; and to do any and all other things necessary and proper in the conduct of my personal, business, banking and Trust affairs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b64 Many years later, on April 2, 2013, Glenna signed the Second Amendment to the Trust (the Second Amendment). It purported to amend the Trust by, among other things, altering the property distribution such that two particular parcels of property held in the Trust for the benefit of all the beneficiaries would be conveyed to Kim Murie, the Bullochs' daughter. Glenna signed the Second Amendment in her individual capacity and in her capacity as Melvin's attorney-in-fact. Melvin did not sign the Second Amendment. He died two days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b65 In June 2014, Glenna filed a petition for declaratory judgment, claiming that she \"did not understand the Second Amendment when she signed it\" and requesting a court order declaring it void \"so as to resolve any disputes over her estate.\" She argued that the Second Amendment should be declared void pursuant to Utah Code section 75-5-503(1), which prohibited an attorney-in-fact from modifying an inter vivos revocable trust unless such power was \"expressly authorized in the power of attorney.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-5-503\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 75-5-503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (LexisNexis Supp. 2014).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   She claimed that the Second Amendment was void on the basis that there was \"no language in the Power of Attorney that expressly authorizes the agent to modify the Trust.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b66 In March 2016, Glenna moved for summary judgment in which she repeated the section 75-5-503 statutory argument she\n   made in the petition. Relatedly, Glenna also contended that the broad language in the Power of Attorney giving her authority \"to do any and all other things necessary and proper in the conduct of [Melvin's] ... Trust affairs\" could not be construed to authorize her to amend the Trust. And she asserted that while the language in the Power of Attorney referenced her authority to act in Melvin's stead as a Trustee, the Trust \"makes it clear that only the grantors of the Trust are allowed to amend the Trust, not the trustees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b67 Murie responded, arguing that Glenna had authority to amend the trust on Melvin's behalf through the Power of Attorney. She argued that the \"general power of attorney ... has no restrictions\" on the power afforded Glenna and that its broad language was sufficient to bestow her with amendment power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b68 On June 8, 2016, the district court issued a memorandum decision granting Glenna's summary judgment motion and concluding that the Second Amendment was void as a matter of law. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Kline v. Utah Department of Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10383974\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/776/57/\">\n    776 P.2d 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah Ct. App. 1989), the court noted that courts \"must strictly construe the language in the power of attorney.\" And referencing the requirements of section 75-5-503, it determined that \"[t]here is no language in [the Power of Attorney] expressly authorizing [Melvin's] agent to amend the Trust.\" The court noted that \"each specific reference to the Trust\" in the Power of Attorney \"expressly limits the agent to Melvin's rights 'as Trustee' of the Trust,\" and that the Trust makes clear that only the Grantors could amend the Trust. Further, the court determined that because the language in the Power of Attorney must be strictly construed, its broad language \"cannot be construed to grant [Melvin's] agent power to amend his Trust\" as required by section 75-5-503. Rather, because the Power of Attorney \"did not specifically authorize his agent to act as Grantor of or otherwise modify the Trust,\" Glenna's signature on the Second Amendment as Grantor on Melvin's behalf \"exceeded the Power of Attorney.\" The court directed Glenna to prepare an order consistent with the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b69 On June 15, 2016, before Glenna filed her proposed order, Murie and her husband Brent Murie\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a motion captioned \"Motion in Support of Petition or Amended and Supplementary Answer and Cross-Petition and for Related Supplementary Discovery and Supplementary Proceedings\" (the Motion). The Muries contended that, during the June 8 summary judgment hearing, offhand comments made by Glenna's attorney hinted at certain Trust administration issues of which the Muries had not been previously aware, and they asserted that upon further inquiry \"it became clear ... that [Murie] was being denied proper disclosure, input, involvement, valuation, accounting, partition, and other arrangements consonant with fair and equitable treatment\" in relation to the Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 The Muries argued in their motion that even if the Second Amendment is judged void, the other Trust administration issues would need to be resolved. They therefore asked the district court to allow their petition to go forward, invoking rule 15(a) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure for leave to amend, rule 15(d) for leave to file supplementary pleadings, and rule 20(a) for leave to join additional parties to the proceeding. They concurrently filed a proposed \"Verified Petition (or Amended and Supplementary Answer and Cross-Petition) for An Accounting, Declaratory Judgment, Valuation, Partition, and Other Relief\" (the Proposed Verified Petition).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b611 Glenna did not file a memorandum in opposition, and the Muries never submitted the motion to the court for decision. Glenna subsequently filed her proposed order, which memorialized the district court's summary judgment decision in her favor and stated that the judgment was final. Murie filed an objection to it on the same day (the Objection). In the Objection, Murie referred to the Motion, the Proposed Verified Petition, and the \"numerous other as-yet unresolved issues\" she identified in them, and she informed\n   the district court that she did \"not believe that [the court] intended to render a final judgment and dismiss the entire litigation.\" Instead, she stated that she believed the court \"intended to take the normal approach of deciding all petitions, issues, and disputes that may arise in relation to a trust estate, and then rendering one final integrated judgment.\" She thus asked the court to grant only partial summary judgment, rendering judgment that the Second Amendment was void as the court had ruled, but not issuing a \"final and appealable judgment ... until a comprehensive resolution is reached or adjudicated as to all controversies, matters, petitions, and parties in relation to\" the Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 The district court signed Glenna's proposed order and overruled the Objection. In so doing, the court declined to entertain, as part of this lawsuit, the Motion and the Proposed Verified Petition. The court concluded that it was inappropriate to keep the matter open to resolve the various Trust administration issues Murie identified. It noted that the \"sole issue\" in the proceeding was \"whether or not the Second Amendment to the Trust was valid,\" and that it had already entered a ruling that it was not. In this regard, the court stated that it would \"not be prudent to allow [Murie] to extend this declaratory judgment matter into a long [protracted] estate matter when [Glenna] filed a petition seeking specific declaratory relief on one issue.\" The court also noted that Murie retained the \"ability to seek relief from the Court in a separate matter\" under Utah Code section 75-7-201(2)(b) regarding any Trust administration issues she believed required court supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 The Muries appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614 Murie argues that the district court's summary judgment ruling was erroneous. In particular, she argues that the court erred in ruling that the Second Amendment was void as a matter of law. \"The court shall grant summary judgment if the moving party shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Utah R. Civ. P. 56(a). \"We review the trial court's grant of summary judgment for correctness, considering only whether the trial court correctly applied the law and correctly concluded that no disputed issues of material fact existed.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Evan O. Koller Revocable Living Trust\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%2026\">\n    2018 UT App 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565898\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/414/1099/\">\n    414 P.3d 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 She also argues that the district court erred by entering judgment in the case without addressing the \"other unresolved existing controversies ... related to the Trust\" that she identified in the Motion and the Proposed Verified Petition and referred to in the Objection. Relatedly, the Muries argue that the court erred by denying them leave to file the Proposed Verified Petition or amended and supplementary pleadings.

The Second Amendment to the Trust\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 Murie argues that the district erred in concluding that the Second Amendment was void as a matter of law. She contends that the court erred in applying Utah Code section 75-5-503 when it determined that the Power of Attorney did not expressly authorize Glenna to amend the Trust on Melvin's\n   behalf. In particular, she contends that the Power of Attorney \"expressly contemplated the kind of act in which [Glenna] engaged when she signed the Second Amendment,\" and that the broad and plain language of the Power of Attorney bestowed on her the authority to modify the Trust. She also asserts that in interpreting the Power of Attorney, the district court improperly \"attempted to graft a limiting distinction between Trust 'Grantor' authority and 'Trustee' authority.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 Murie's argument requires us to interpret and apply the relevant statute, section 75-5-503, to the Power of Attorney.

Section 75-5-503 is a codification of the common law rules limiting an agent's powers in relationship to a trust to the actions expressly authorized in the power of attorney.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fields v.

It was therefore clearly a modification of the Trust.\n   <em>\n    See Modify\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (\"To make somewhat different; to make small changes to (something) by way of improvement, suitability, or effectiveness ....\");\n   <em>\n    Modify\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster.com, https://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/modify [https://perma.cc/G5UA-67DF] (\"to make minor changes in\" or \"to make basic or fundamental changes in often to give a new orientation to or to serve a new end\").

Indeed, the specific powers identified in the Power of Attorney by-and-large deal with actions related to funds, such as depositing or investing funds, and other like-actions, including those related to real estate transactions, taxes, and making gifts. Further, the only category of authority mentioned with particularity vis-\u00e0-vis the Trust itself and Glenna's authority is Melvin's authority as a Trustee. And, as the district court aptly observed, the Trust explicitly provided that only the Grantors, not the Trustees, had power to modify the Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b622 In sum, because the Power of Attorney did not include an express authorization to Glenna to modify the Trust, and because we decline to infer that authorization from the Power of Attorney's broad, general language, the district court correctly concluded that the Second Amendment was void as a matter of law under section 75-5-503.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II. The Motion, the Proposed Verified Petition, and the Objection\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b623 The Muries also argue that the court erred and exceeded its discretion in declining to reach the other Trust-related issues identified in the Motion and the Proposed Verified Petition and referred to in the Objection. We disagree and affirm the district court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b624 The Muries filed the Motion and the Proposed Verified Petition on June 15, 2016, a week after the court granted Glenna's motion for summary judgment. The Muries argued that the court should grant leave to allow their petition to proceed or leave to amend Murie's answer under rule 15(a) and file supplementary pleadings under rule 15(d), as well as leave for parties to be joined under rule 20(a). Glenna did not file a responsive memorandum, and neither Glenna nor the Muries thereafter filed a request that the motion be submitted for decision. The Motion and the Proposed Verified Petition were therefore not properly before the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Civ. P. 7(g) (\"When briefing is complete or the time for briefing has expired, either party may file a 'Request to Submit for Decision,' but, if no party files a request, the motion will not be submitted for decision.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golding v.

As a result, we cannot fault the court for not granting the Muries leave to file the Proposed Verified Petition, amend pleadings, or join new parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b625 Moreover, we cannot discern an abuse of discretion in the district court's overruling of Murie's Objection to Glenna's proposed order, in which Murie argued that the numerous issues identified in the Motion and the Proposed Verified Petition made final judgment inappropriate. A district court is endowed with discretion in exercising its \"inherent power to manage its docket.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jensen v.

When Murie filed the Objection, discovery had been completed, the deadline for dispositive motions had passed, and the district court had resolved the only issue before it: whether the Second Amendment was void. The case was effectively over. Given that posture, the court was well within its discretion to reject Murie's suggestion (made in an objection to the form of an order, no less) that the court should wait to enter final judgment until issues not yet before the court had been resolved.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12345900\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/405/836/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And apart from arguing that it would be more prudent to generally decide issues involving the same Trust in the same proceeding and conclusively asserting that the district court's refusal to address those issues had created \"an intolerable and unmanageable Kafkaesque mess,\" Murie has directed us to no authority suggesting that the district court nonetheless abused its discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b626 Accordingly, we affirm the district court's decision to decline to prolong the litigation to address the Trust administration issues Murie referred to in the Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b627 We affirm the district court's summary judgment order.
