In response, Tulley violently assaulted Victim, a 71-year-old man. Tulley wanted to introduce evidence at trial of Victim's prior sexual misconduct. The district court excluded much of that evidence, but held that Tulley could present some of it in a \"sanitized\" form. Tulley also asked the district court to instruct the jury that he would be entitled to defend himself if he was trying to prevent \"forcible sexual abuse.\" The district court declined Tulley's request. The jury convicted Tulley of reckless aggravated abuse of a vulnerable adult and interference with an arresting officer. Tulley received a sentence enhancement because he qualified as a habitual violent offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 Tulley challenges the district court's exclusion of Victim's prior sexual misconduct evidence and contends that the jury was incorrectly instructed. Tulley also argues that Utah's aggravated abuse of a vulnerable adult statute is unconstitutionally void. Finally, Tulley contends that Utah's habitual violent offender statute violates the Utah Constitution's cruel and unusual punishment and double jeopardy clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 We conclude that the district court correctly excluded evidence of Victim's prior sexual misconduct and correctly instructed the jury. Additionally, we hold that Utah's aggravated abuse statute is not unconstitutionally vague and conclude that Tulley has not met his burden of establishing that Utah's habitual violent offender statute violates either the Utah Constitution's cruel and unusual punishment clause or the double jeopardy clause. In the end, we affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b64 Tulley met Victim at the sex offender treatment program they both attended.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Victim mentored Tulley during the program, and the two remained in contact afterwards. More than a decade after they first met, Victim invited Tulley to his apartment. Over drinks, Tulley explained that he didn't have a place to live. Victim invited Tulley to stay with him for a few days. The next day, the two started drinking again. While making dinner, Tulley accidentally burned his hand on the oven. Victim suggested that Tulley needed to get some sleep and offered Tulley sleeping medication. Tulley took \"several\" pills while Victim continued drinking. Tulley eventually fell asleep on the couch. Tulley testified that he awoke to find a knife at his forehead and Victim's hand on his genitals. Tulley \"started throwing [his] fists.\" Victim backed away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b65 At some point thereafter, Victim's next door neighbor heard \"screaming and ... hollering and ... swearing\" for \"at least 15 minutes.\" She opened her door and saw another neighbor, Ron Boren, trying to enter Victim's apartment. She returned to her apartment and \"all of a sudden ... heard this real loud bumping\" behind her bathroom wall. When she hit the wall to try to quiet things down, \"it didn't stop ... [a]nd then it got worse.\" She heard \"consistent thumping in the bathroom\" that was \"very loud\" but couldn't hear any voices inside of Victim's apartment. She called the building manager to report the disturbance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 Tulley let Boren enter Victim's apartment. Boren found Victim lying in a \"big puddle of blood.\" Boren located a towel, wet it, and placed it on Victim's head. According to Boren, \"[t]here was blood everywhere,\" so he wiped up the blood in the bathroom. When Boren started cleaning the apartment,\n   Tulley became agitated and told Boren, \"I'll kill you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 At this point, the on-site assistant responded to the complaints about the ruckus in Victim's apartment. Tulley and Boren attempted to block the assistant from entering, but eventually she opened the door \"a little bit to find [Victim] on the floor.\" She quickly assessed the apartment and described \"a blood bath\" with blood \"all over kind of semi oozing out a little bit in the kitchen, and bedroom, [and] bathroom.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tulley and Boren then slammed the door on the assistant. The assistant went to an open window to listen and heard Victim tell Tulley that he \"loved him like a son.\" Tulley responded, \"I love you too, Dad.\" Tulley then placed his hands over Victim's mouth to muffle him, told him \"I'll kill you,\" and beat Victim with a club.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 At this point, the building manager arrived and walked into Victim's apartment to find Victim \"on the floor ... with a towel wrapped around his head.\" She saw Tulley, who was not wearing pants, standing in the doorway. Tulley told the manager to \"get the hell out.\" The manager called for an ambulance and the police. Tulley became increasingly agitated and said he would kill Victim. Tulley came across the room and shut the door, forcing the manager out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 When the police arrived, they walked into \"[a] bloody mess.\" A pair of glasses with bloody lenses sat on the kitchen table. Blood was \"smeared on the walls [and] smeared all over the floor\" in the hallway. The police found two of Victim's teeth on the bedroom floor. Between the bedroom and the bathroom, they found a golf club with a \"brownish substance\" on it. In the bathroom, they found blood on the floor, blood spatters on the wall, and wet, bloody towels. A bloody towel rack had been pulled from the wall with the brackets still attached. A bloody, broken, wooden spoon lay near it. Smeared blood stained the sink. The shower curtain had been pulled down. Blood covered the bathtub.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 The police found Victim lying in a pool of blood. He had blood \"all over him\" and \"was lying prone on the floor not moving.\" One officer thought Victim had been killed because of the extent of his facial injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 Meanwhile, Tulley was sitting in the bedroom, drunk, with blood on his hands, face, and clothing, holding a gallon-sized container of liquor in one hand and a 20-ounce beer can in the other. Tulley screamed at the police to get out and attempted to hit the officer with the bottle and the beer can. The police temporarily incapacitated Tulley with a Taser and handcuffed him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 After his arrest, Tulley requested that police officers photograph his face to document a cut where Tulley claimed Victim had held the knife. An officer took the photo, but \"didn't see anything at that spot.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Victim arrived at the hospital covered in blood and in serious condition. He had multiple facial lacerations that required plastic surgery. Victim's eyes were swollen shut and one of his eyeballs was bruised. His nasal bone, nasal septum, and eye sockets were fractured. His sinuses were fractured and filled with blood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 Emergency room doctors diagnosed Victim with a traumatic brain injury and concluded that there was \"a reasonable risk that he would die\" from the injuries he sustained. Victim remained in the hospital for nearly two days. At the recommendation of his doctor, Victim was placed in a skilled nursing facility after discharge from the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 The State charged Tulley with intentional aggravated abuse of a vulnerable adult, failure to register as a sex offender, and interference with an arresting officer. Tulley claimed he was justified in using force against Victim to prevent death or serious bodily injury, or to prevent the commission of forcible sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 Before his trial, Tulley sought to introduce evidence of several phone calls Victim\n   made to Tulley's sister which she described as sexual and \"disgusting.\" The district court denied Tulley's motion. Tulley also sought to introduce evidence of Victim's numerous prior convictions for rape and sodomy of women and children. The convictions had occurred between 1959 and 1985. Tulley also wanted to introduce evidence that Victim returned to prison in 1992 after engaging in sexual activity with a male roommate while on parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 Tulley argued that this evidence could be admitted for three non-character purposes under Utah Rule of Evidence 404(b) : (1) to demonstrate the reasonableness of his response; (2) to demonstrate Victim's motive to sexually assault Tulley; and (3) to demonstrate that Victim had expressed \"some confusion about his sexual orientation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b618 The district court concluded that \"based upon 404(b) associated with at least the absence of mistake or motive and/or intent ... being the fact that this is something that has a history with [Victim], at least in one period of time, [the evidence Tulley wanted to introduce] certainly falls within what might otherwise be the exception under 404(b).\" The court granted Tulley's motion \"to a very limited extent.... to indicate that there is some sort of history of ... confusion associated with sexual preference and sexually acting out.\" The court explained that rule 403 \"suggests that although I'm letting this evidence in, I'm only letting it in, in a sanitized fashion....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b619 Tulley also proposed a jury instruction to explain his self-defense theory:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Travis Tulley is justified in using force against [Victim] when and to the extent that Travis Tulley reasonably believed that force was necessary to defend himself against [Victim's] imminent use of unlawful force against him. Travis Tulley was also justified in using force intended or likely to cause death or serious bodily injury against [Victim] if he reasonably believed that such force was necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury to him as a result of [Victim's] imminent use of unlawful force, or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony,\n   <em>\n    including forcible sexual abuse\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Emphasis added). The district court accepted the standard portion of the instruction, which included all of the language Tulley proposed except for the phrase \"including forcible sexual abuse.\" The court explained that it would not \"make caveats and interlineations to address\" forcible sexual abuse, because the jury instruction is \"broad enough to incorporate it and you may argue from that, of course, that indeed this is exactly what [the self-defense] statute contemplates....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 Tulley also objected to one of the State's instructions, arguing that it was unconstitutionally vague. The State's proposed instruction defined \"serious physical injury\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Serious physical injury\" means any physical injury or set of physical injuries that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   a. Seriously impairs a vulnerable adult's health;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   b. Was caused by the use of a dangerous weapon;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   c. Involves physical torture or causes serious emotional harm to a vulnerable adult; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   d. Creates a reasonable risk of death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Tulley objected to the language \"[s]eriously impairs a vulnerable adult's health\" and argued \"it is impossible to determine what the language means.\" Tulley argued that the statute is \"void for vagueness and unconstitutionally vague.\" The district court overruled Tulley's objection and explained that \"two experts testif[ied] in this particular case, both associated with what it does or doesn't mean or what the understanding of common usage may be associated with impairment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b621 Tulley testified at trial. He explained that after he woke up and felt Victim's hands on his \"phallus and ... scrotum[,]\" he \"started throwing [his] fists,\" and estimated that he hit Tulley four or five times. Tulley did not have pants on, and said that he had \"no memory ... or knowledge\" of how they were removed. He said he hit Victim because he could only see part of Victim's face \"from the knife that was straight pointing at me.\" When Tulley started \"cussing\" at Victim, Tulley said Victim went into the bathroom, at which point Tulley grabbed the knife and threw the knife in the sink. Tulley said he then went to the bedroom and remembered\n   \"getting down on the ground and ... kind of pounding [his] fists as [he] was kneeling to the ground.\" He fell asleep in the bedroom, but later awoke when he heard a noise in the bathroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b622 Tulley testified that he went to the door and saw Victim's \"feet and ... legs protruding out\" from the bathroom, and then found Victim with blood pooled around him, \"moving around in it.\" When he tried to talk to Victim, Tulley said that Victim told him to leave him alone. Tulley ignored Victim's request. Tulley testified that he picked Victim up from the bathroom floor, but dropped him because a dog bite had \"totally destroyed\" his left hand in the months preceding the incident. Tulley said he had Victim's blood on his body from attempting to lift him up and got more blood on his hands after trying to lift Victim a second time. When he couldn't lift Victim, Tulley explained that he started \"flicking [his] hands\" because of the blood on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b623 Tulley said he took \"a handful\" of pills out of Victim's medicine cabinet that contained both sleeping and pain medications and \"chugged\" out of a bottle of liquor in the kitchen. Tulley testified that he drank half of the gallon bottle and that he did not remember what happened next, but when he came to, he was in the bedroom leaning against the bed, at which point Boren knocked on the door. Tulley explained that after Boren entered and the building manager arrived, he drank the rest of the gallon liquor bottle. He testified that the next thing he remembered was being tased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b624 The jury convicted Tulley of reckless aggravated abuse of a vulnerable adult, a third degree felony, and interference with an arresting officer, a class B misdemeanor. Tulley pled guilty to failure to register as a sex offender, a third degree felony. Because Tulley had two prior convictions for violent offenses, his reckless aggravated abuse of a vulnerable adult charge carried a potential enhancement to a first degree felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-3-203.5(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b625 On the day of sentencing, Tulley's counsel filed a motion challenging the constitutionality of the habitual violent offender statute. Tulley argued that the statute twice placed him in jeopardy contrary to the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 7 of the Utah Constitution. Tulley also posited that the statute subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 9 of the Utah Constitution. The district court denied Tulley's motion. Tulley received a sentence enhancement to a first degree felony sentence, but he also received a sentence reduction, resulting in an overall enhancement to a second degree felony sentence. Tulley appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b626 Tulley raises four issues on appeal. First, Tulley contends that the district court abused its discretion when it excluded evidence of Victim's history of sexual misconduct. Most decisions to admit or exclude evidence \"involve a threshold statement of the legal principle governing admission or exclusion, findings of fact pertinent to a determination, and the application of the legal principle to the facts at hand with regard to admissibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Arnold v. Grigsby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%2014\">\n    2018 UT 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567368\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/606/\">\n    417 P.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"We review the legal questions to make the determination of admissibility for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567368\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/606/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).

A district court \"abuses its discretion only when 'its decision to admit or exclude evidence is beyond the limits of reasonability.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12343397\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/398/1032/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b627 Second, Tulley contends that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury that the term \"forcible felony\" includes sexual offenses. \"Whether a jury instruction correctly states the law presents a question of law which we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Houskeeper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9327333\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/62/444/\">\n    2002 UT 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9327333\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/62/444/\">\n    62 P.3d 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b628 Third, Tulley contends that the definition of \"serious physical injury\" set forth in the aggravated abuse of a vulnerable adult statute, and adopted by the district court in\n   the jury instructions, \"rests on provisions that are void-for-vagueness both facially and as-applied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b629 Finally, Tulley contends that Utah's habitual violent offender statute violates the Utah Constitution's cruel and unusual punishment and double jeopardy clauses. A statute's constitutionality is a question of law that we review for correctness, giving no deference to the district court.\n   <em>\n    State v. MacGuire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9286984\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/84/1171/\">\n    2004 UT 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9286984\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/84/1171/\">\n    84 P.3d 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   I. Evidence of Prior Sexual Misconduct\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b630 Tulley first contends that the district court abused its discretion when it excluded evidence of Victim's history of sexual misconduct. Tulley argues that the evidence \"was central to the plausibility of [his] testimony.... Not only did it shed light on [Victim's] motivations in committing a sexual attack, but it also demonstrated the reasonableness of Tulley's response.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b631 Tulley sought to introduce the following evidence of Victim's criminal past: a 1959 sexual assault conviction; a 1961 conviction for rape of a 17-year-old girl; a 1969 conviction for rape of a 14-year-old girl; a 1973 conviction for attempted rape of a 19-year-old woman; a 1979 conviction for \"contributing to the sexual delinquency\" of a 14-year-old boy; a 1979 conviction for sodomy of a woman; an arrest for sexual offenses against a 14-year-old and 15-year-old boy around 1985; and evidence that Victim \"sexually acted out with a roommate\" during treatment while he was on parole, and returned to prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b632 Tulley also sought to introduce evidence of the sexually explicit phone calls that Victim made to Tulley's sister in the months preceding the assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b633 As an initial matter, the district court ruled orally from the bench and the court's rationale is not entirely clear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It appears that the district court concluded that the evidence \"certainly falls within what might otherwise be an exception under 404(b).\" But the court then referenced Utah Rule of Evidence 403 in holding that \"[w]e are not going back to the 60's and the 70's, but simply to indicate that there is some sort of history ... of confusion associated with sexual preference and sexually acting out.\" Therefore, the court said that the evidence would be admitted in a sanitized form, but \"how we sanitize that in some way, I'm not certain.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b634 The rationale behind the district court's rule 403 decision appears to be rooted in its concern about the age of the evidence and the risk of unfair prejudice. While discussing the convictions \"from the 60's and 70's,\" the court explained that Utah Rule of Evidence 609\"has to apply by way of a guideline associated with what might otherwise be stale on old claims.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b635 \"Evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in conformity with the character.\" UTAH R. EVID . 404(b)(1). This evidence, however, \"may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   404(b)(2). Even then, under rule 403, the court \"may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   403. \"[U]nfair prejudice results only where the evidence has an undue tendency to suggest decision upon an improper basis.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

To determine whether it will admit evidence under rule 403, the court must \"bind its analysis to the text of rule 403, considering those factors that are appropriate given the particular circumstances of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Lowther\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12343397\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/398/1032/\">\n    2017 UT 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 45,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12343397\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/398/1032/\">\n    398 P.3d 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b636 Although Tulley was not using Victim's prior sexual misconduct for impeachment purposes, the district court's invocation of rule 609 suggests that it had some concern about the age of the evidence. Tulley argues that the district court improperly relied on rule 609. But we do not read the ruling that way. It does not appear that the court believed that rule 609 applied or compelled a decision. Rather, it appears that the court mentioned rule 609 to illustrate that evidence of acts from decades ago might possess little probative value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b637 Tulley argues that the evidence \"revealed [Victim] was motivated by sexual opportunism, ambivalence, and deviancy, which supported Tulley's narrative and explained why [Victim] would sexually attack a stronger, younger male friend.\" Tulley also argues that his \"knowledge that [Victim] was a convicted rapist explained why Tulley would be fearful of [Victim] notwithstanding [Victim's] age and stature.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b638 The district court was within its broad discretion in finding that the probative value of Victim's prior sexual misconduct to demonstrate motive or intent to attack Tulley or to show that Tulley had a basis to fear Victim was low.

Forcible Felony Jury Instruction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b641 Tulley next contends that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that the term \"forcible felony\"-when used\n   to explain when a person may legally defend himself-includes sexual offenses. Specifically, Tulley argues that the district court should have expanded the definition of \"forcible felony\" to clarify for the jury that the term includes sexual offenses such as forcible sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b642 \"A person is justified in using force intended or likely to cause death or serious bodily injury only if the person reasonably believes that force is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury to the person ... as a result of another person's imminent use of unlawful force, or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-2-402(1)(b). The self-defense statute defines forcible felony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (a) For purposes of this section, a forcible felony includes aggravated assault, mayhem, aggravated murder, murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, and aggravated kidnapping, rape, forcible sodomy, rape of a child, object rape, object rape of a child, sexual abuse of a child, aggravated sexual abuse of a child, and aggravated sexual assault ..., and arson, robbery, and burglary....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (b) Any other felony offense which involves the use of force or violence against a person so as to create a substantial danger of death or serious bodily injury also constitutes a forcible felony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (c) Burglary of a vehicle ... does not constitute a forcible felony except when the vehicle is occupied at the time unlawful entry is made or attempted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-2-402(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b643 Tulley argues that although section 402(4) does not explicitly list \"forcible sexual abuse\" as a forcible felony, \"the statutory term 'includes' is an 'established term of art' indicative of a 'partial list.'

Section 402(4)(a) says that \"forcible felony\" includes eighteen enumerated crimes that constitute a forcible felony. If the statute stopped there, Tulley might have a persuasive argument. But the statute further describes a forcible felony as \"[a]ny other felony offense which involves the use of force or violence against a person so as to create a substantial danger of death or serious bodily injury.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-2-402(4)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b646 Section 402(4)(b) would be meaningless unless it is read to limit the types of felonies that can be included in the category of forcible felonies. Accordingly, we conclude that although section 402(4)(a) provides a non-exhaustive list of felonies, section 402(4)(b) describes the types of crimes that can be added to that non-exhaustive list. And that those crimes \"involve[ ] the use of force or violence against a person so as to create a substantial danger of death or serious bodily injury....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880071\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/619/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b647 In some circumstances, the commission of forcible sexual abuse can create a substantial danger of serious bodily injury.

If the defendant does not cause serious bodily injury, forcible sexual abuse is a second degree felony.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880071\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/619/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-5-404(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b649 As explained above, for self-defense purposes, forcible felonies are limited to eighteen enumerated crimes and crimes that \"involve[ ] the use of force or violence against a person so as to create a substantial danger of death or serious bodily injury....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880071\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/619/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-2-402(4)(b). And because of the two variants of forcible sexual abuse, it is possible for an actor to commit the crime in a manner that may create a substantial danger of death or serious bodily injury, and in a manner that does not. The degree of risk, and the defendant's perception of that degree of risk dictate whether or not a defendant was justified in using force intended or likely to cause death or serious bodily injury. In other words, a defendant may be justified to use deadly force to prevent forcible sexual abuse that the defendant reasonably believes is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury, but cannot use such force to prevent forcible sexual abuse that the defendant does not reasonably believe presents such a risk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b650 That distinction assumes importance here because if Victim had a knife, Tulley might be justified in using deadly force to prevent the attack. And the jury was properly instructed in that regard. The instruction told the jury that if Tulley reasonably believed that \"the force [was] necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury,\" he was justified in using force to defend himself. Tulley wanted the district court to go one step further and include language in the instruction that suggested forcible sexual abuse would always present a danger of death or serious bodily injury. For the reasons we have just discussed, that is not a correct statement and Tulley's proposed amendment to the instruction would have misstated the law. Accordingly, the district court did not err in instructing the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   III.

For example, Tulley argues that \"[t]he intent of the framers in drafting the [cruel and unusual punishment clause] reflects a concern for disproportionate sentences.\" To support his argument, Tulley explains that \"attempts to wipe out polygamy resulted in 'numerous [ ] violations of basic rights provided by the Bill of Rights,' and accused polygamists faced 'extreme sentences' that were disproportionate to the sentences for other crimes.\" (Alteration in original) (Quoting Martha Sonntag Bradley,\n   <em>\n    \"Hide and Seek\": Children on the Underground\n   </em>\n   , 51 UTAH HIST. Q . 133, 134, 141 (1983) ). Tulley suggests that because the framers of the Utah Constitution were \"aware of the disproportionate sentences handed out to polygamists,\" they \"would make every effort to ensure the state constitution protected against such sentences.\" But citation to one historic example, without more, is not enough to demonstrate that the framers of the Utah Constitution intended the constitutional guarantees to protect against sentences like the one dictated by the sentence enhancement our habitual violent offender statute imposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b682 Tulley can be forgiven for framing his argument this way, as it models the way in which we have, at times, approached these issues.

The specifically enumerated crimes are those that carry a high risk of a victim suffering death or serious bodily injury.

The best evidence available to us on that question is the view expressed by the people's representatives in the legislature, who enacted the applicable sentence enhancement provision into law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-3-203.5. It seems a little presumptuous for judges to purport to understand the people's conscience better than their elected representatives (who are regularly accountable to them in elections).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b690 This standard thus asks us to second-guess the judgment made by the legislature by consulting our \"humanitarian instincts\" and personal beliefs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6859241\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/353/55/\">\n    2015 UT 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 155,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6859241\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/353/55/\">\n    353 P.3d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Lee, A.C.J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). Our instincts and beliefs are useful-and even essential-on any of a range of discretionary judgment calls we make in the judiciary. But they can't form the reliable basis for a principle of constitutional law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b691 For now I am content to concur in an opinion that applies our precedent to the resolution of the case before us. But I, for one, would remain open to an invitation that we revisit the standard we established in\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   in an appropriate case in the future.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    The majority attributes the standard it applies to\n    <em>\n     State v. Lafferty\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11112235\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/20/342/\">\n     2001 UT 19\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11112235\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/20/342/\">\n     20 P.3d 342\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 76. And the\n    <em>\n     Lafferty\n    </em>\n    opinion does apply a standard like that employed by the court today. But I view\n    <em>\n     Houston\n    </em>\n    as the key turning point in our jurisprudence-because prior to\n    <em>\n     Houston\n    </em>\n    \"no majority opinion of this court [had] ever employed a state standard of proportionality that is distinct from the federal standard.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.
