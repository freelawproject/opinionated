Concluding that the redemption statute applied only to merchants and others who seek reimbursement by the government for food stamp benefits previously used by a consumer, the trial court arrested judgment because the information did not charge a crime. We agree and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Mr. Gray was captured on video camera using a food stamps EBT\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   card at Anderson's Grocery Store in Republic on four occasions over a four day period. The card belonged to a couple from Moses Lake. Upon noticing that their card was gone, the couple obtained a new card. When they attempted to use the new card, however, they discovered that no benefits remained in their account. An investigation of computer records revealed when and where the EBT card had been used. That information allowed Andersons to identify Mr. Gray on its video records as the person who used the card on each occasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The case was tried in the Ferry County Superior Court on four counts of unlawful redemption of food stamp benefits in violation of RCW 9.91.144.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the crime is a class C felony, the amended charging document identified three of the offenses as gross misdemeanors and only one count as a felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the conclusion of the State's thoroughly documented case, the defense moved to dismiss the charges on the basis that the charging document did not state a crime. The trial court denied the motion and the case proceeded to jury verdict. The jury found Mr. Gray guilty on all four counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Mr. Gray moved to arrest judgment. The parties briefed and argued the motion. The trial court granted the motion, deciding that the redemption statute did not apply to someone who used an EBT card to purchase food and, therefore, that the charging document did not state a crime against Mr. Gray.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of the ruling. The State timely appealed to this\n   court. A panel heard oral argument on the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 The State's appeal raises three contentions, although we need only address one of the arguments. We conclude from congressional and legislative history that retail customers do not \"redeem\" food stamp benefits, as that word is used in federal and state criminal statutes, when they purchase food. Although undefined in the relevant federal and state criminal statutes, \"redeem\" is a term of art under the Food Stamp Act of 1964. We first address the history of the food stamp program and the anti-fraud statutes adopted by Congress before turning to related Washington criminal statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Federal Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 The food stamp program was enacted by Congress in 1964.

The program is administered through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). In grossly oversimplified terms, the program works as follows: the federal government approves and pays merchants for accepting food stamp benefits and provides some financial support for administrative expense to the States, which must administer the program in accordance with federal guidelines, determine the eligibility of recipients, and provide benefits to them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202014\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2018, 2020, 2025.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 As the government that both authorizes merchants to accept food stamp benefits and reimburses them for doing so, the federal government from the beginning was authorized to combat fraud using both civil and criminal statutes. Pub. L. No. 88-525, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 11, 13-14. From that beginning in 1964, the term \"redeem\" had a specific meaning, even if it did not have a definitional statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   REDEMPTION OF COUPONS\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   SEC . 9.

No financial institution may impose on or collect from a retail food store a fee or other charge for the redemption of benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Consistent throughout this statute is the fact that \"redemption\" is the process by which retailers receive reimbursement from the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 10 The program includes a civil administrative enforcement provision that leads to the disqualification of businesses that violate provisions of the act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202021\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Multiple congressional reports over the decades reflect this focus. The 1996 House of Representatives Committee on the Budget provides one of the more concise explanations. H.R. REP. NO. 104-651, at 67-70 (1996),\n   <em>\n    reprinted in\n   </em>\n   1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2183, 2200-04. In this bill report, the committee details three categories of fraud in the Food Stamp Program: recipient fraud, street trafficking, and retail food store trafficking:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Recipient fraud varies from the intentional under-reporting of income or inflation of household expenses to elaborate schemes involving the creation of false documents and fictitious identities. The committee heard testimony describing a recent incident in the State of Washington in which two State welfare caseworkers and a refugee counselor were engaged in a scheme to fraudulently obtain social security and food stamp benefits for at least 300 refugees. The false food stamp applications were prompted by the refugee counselor and the caseworkers, who took kickbacks from the refugees in return for their being certified to receive benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The second method of fraud is street trafficking in food stamp coupons. Street trafficking involves a person who sells, purchases, or barters food stamps for cash or other nonfood items. In many communities, food stamps have become a second currency. The committee heard reports and witnessed undercover video footage of food stamps being traded for cash, drugs, guns, and a stolen car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The third method of fraud is retail food store and wholesale food concern trafficking. USDA is responsible for authorizing retail food stores and wholesale food concerns to redeem food stamps. Currently,\n   over 207,000 retail food stores and wholesale food concerns are authorized to redeem food stamps. Each year, about 30,000 new entities apply for authorization. Also, each year about 30,000 entities are disqualified or become ineligible to redeem food stamps. Approximately 77 percent of all food stamps are redeemed by supermarkets which comprise only about 15 percent of all authorized entities. USDA has found that most retail trafficking occurs in smaller food stores and in other retail entities whose business is not primarily food sales. During fiscal year 1994, USDA compliance investigators reviewed 4,300 entities authorized to redeem food stamps. Of these entities, 1,300 were found to have committed violations serious enough to warrant sanctions, including 902 entities which were trafficking in food stamps.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   While neither USDA, OIG, nor GAO can provide an estimate with any certainty as to the amount of food stamp trafficking that occurs each year, trafficking in food stamps is believed by OIG to exceed $1 billion each year. Clearly, the number of trafficking investigations involving multi-million dollar food stamp trafficking operations and the organization with which such operations are operating is on the rise. The committee heard testimony of a case in Brooklyn, New York, in which investigators found an individual who had obtained authorization to redeem food stamps from USDA for a fictitious retail store. In a 22-month period, this fictitious store illegally accepted more than $40 million in food stamps from over 600 restaurants, retail stores, and other businesses. In 1 month alone, this fictitious store illegally redeemed over $4.7 million in food stamps, nearly 5 percent of all food stamps redeemed that month in New York City.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 68-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 12 Under federal food stamp law, \"redemption\" is the process of obtaining reimbursement from the federal government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Washington Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 13 As may be expected by the original distribution of duties between the states and the federal government, Washington's initial foray into criminal enforcement of the food stamp law focused on misuse of the benefit by recipients. That offense, codified at former RCW 9.91.120 (1974), made it a crime to misuse food stamps by any \"person who resells food stamps ... or food purchased therewith, and any person who knowingly purchases such resold stamps or food.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LAWS OF 1973, 2d Ex.

Former RCW 9.91.120 was recodified as RCW 9.91.140, while two new crimes copied from\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202024\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and (c) were added to new section 140.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LAWS OF 1988, ch. 62, \u00a7 1.

RCW 9.91.140 addresses the unlawful sale of benefits; it currently provides that \"A person who sells food stamps ... or food stamp benefits transferred electronically, or food purchased therewith\" is guilty of a gross misdemeanor if the value of the benefit is over $100 and is a misdemeanor if less than that amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 15 RCW 9.91.142 defines the offense of food stamp trafficking as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A person who purchases, or who otherwise acquires and sells, or who traffics in, food stamps as defined by the federal food stamp act, ... or food stamp benefits transferred electronically.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The crime is a class C felony if the value exceeds $100, or a gross misdemeanor if the value is less than $100. RCW 9.91.142(1), (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 16 The \"unlawful redemption\" of food stamps is declared a crime by RCW 9.91.144.
