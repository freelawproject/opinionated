In response, Podworks filed a CR 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss all claims. The trial court granted the motion, ruling that Headspace did not allege any lawful use of its mark in the ordinary course of trade in Washington and therefore had no trademark rights in \"THE CLEAR\" in Washington. Holding that Headspace did allege lawful use of its mark in the ordinary course of trade in Washington, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 On January 26, 2017, Headspace filed suit against Podworks alleging trademark infringement, unfair competition, unfair business practices, and violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act, chapter 19.86 RCW. Headspace made the following factual allegations in its complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [Headspace], is and has been for many years, a well-known seller and licensor of concentrated and refined essential plant oils including cannabis concentrates, vapor related products, educational and other services sold under the trademark THE CLEAR. [Headspace] developed a notoriety in the cannabis industry because their in-house chemist and engineer developed a proprietary chemical process to create highly refined essential plant oils including cannabis concentrates. [Headspace] has, since April 10\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   2013, adopted and used the mark THE CLEAR for its products in California and for its services including licensing the mark THE CLEAR in Washington State....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   ... Since the initial use of THE CLEAR, [Headspace] has continually used the mark for its products and services. [Headspace]'s Washington State trademark registration was granted by the Washington State Secretary of State on December 15\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2014, file number 57531, in class 34 - cannabis concentrates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ... In 2014 [Headspace] entered into an agreement to license their proprietary chemical process and THE CLEAR mark to X-Tracted Laboratories 502 Inc., a Washington State business that is licensed with [the] Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board. X-Tracted Laboratories 502 Inc. sells and distributes various marijuana related products, including cannabis concentrates, in Washington State. X-Tracted Laboratories 502 Inc. licensed [Headspace]'s\n   THE CLEAR mark to use on cannabis concentrates and related products sold and/or used in commerce in Washington State. X-Tracted Laboratories 502 Inc. continues to license [Headspace]'s proprietary chemical process and use [Headspace]'s THE CLEAR mark in commerce in Washington State according with its Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board license.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 Headspace further alleged that Podworks had used and continues to use the mark \"THE CLEAR,\" or \"CLEAR,\" for the sale of cannabis concentrates in Washington. Headspace also alleged that it sent Podworks a cease and desist letter, informing Podworks of its trademark for the mark \"THE CLEAR,\" and demanding that Podworks immediately terminate further use of the mark or confusingly similar marks. Podworks refused, and Headspace filed this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 Podworks responded by filing a CR 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss all claims against it for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Podworks argued that Headspace failed to allege that it had trademark protection in Washington for its mark \"THE CLEAR,\" because it did not allege lawful use of the mark in the ordinary course of trade in Washington. The trial court granted the motion, reasoning that Headspace failed to allege lawful use of its mark in the ordinary course of trade in Washington and holding that there \"is no claim for trademark infringement where the plaintiff does not allege that its mark is\n   <em>\n    lawfully\n   </em>\n   placed in the ordinary course of trade.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 Headspace appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 6 Headspace asserts that the trial court erred by dismissing its complaint for failure to state a claim.

Washington's trademark statute is based on the Model State Trademark Bill (MSTB) produced by the International Trademark Association. In the most recent update to the statute, the Senate and House Committees on the Judiciary recommended updating Washington's trademark statutes to more closely conform to federal law and the MSTB.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FINAL B. REP. on S.B. 5122, 58th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 9 One of the assumed benefits for states that have adopted the MSTB is that it is designed to enable state courts interpreting state trademark statutes to rely on federal court decisions interpreting federal trademark law, as set forth in the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201051\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our state legislature affirmed this assumption by explicitly instructing Washington courts to construe the language of our trademark statute in accordance with federal decisions interpreting the Lanham Act. RCW 19.77.930.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 10 Our Supreme Court has employed just such an approach. In\n   <em>\n    Seattle Endeavors, Inc. v.

As the Ninth Circuit explained when interpreting the federal lawful use requirement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [A]s a logical matter, to hold otherwise would be to put the government in the \"anomalous position\" of extending the benefits of trademark protection to a seller based upon actions the seller took in violation of that government's own laws ... [and] as a policy matter, to give trademark priority to a seller who rushes to market without taking care to carefully comply with the relevant regulations would be to reward the hasty at the expense of the diligent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    CreAgri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5712234\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/626/#p630\">\n    474 F.3d at 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To avoid placing the government in such an \"anomalous position,\" we interpret Washington's statute to require lawful placement of a mark in the ordinary course of trade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 12 Here, the allegations in Headspace's complaint, when treated as verities, are sufficient to satisfy its obligation to allege a set of facts that could justify recovery. The allegations of the complaint, as well as hypothetical facts consistent with the complaint, set forth the following: (1) that Headspace used its mark \"THE CLEAR\" in Washington when it licensed the mark to X-Tracted Laboratories 502 Inc. (X-Tracted) and that X-Tracted placed the mark on cannabis concentrates placed in the ordinary course of trade in Washington; and (2) that such use was lawful because such a licensing agreement was and is not prohibited by Washington's Uniform Controlled Substances Act, codified at chapter 69.50 RCW (CSA), when it does not require Headspace to produce, process, or sell cannabis products in Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 13 Headspace asserts that it alleged use of its mark in the ordinary course of trade in Washington when it alleged X-Tracted's use of the mark on cannabis products X-Tracted produced and sold in Washington. In response, Podworks avers that such indirect placement of the mark in the ordinary course of trade in Washington does not satisfy the requirements of the statute. We disagree. It does not matter if the use of the mark is direct or indirect. Either can be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 14 While the language of RCW 19.77.010(11) does not directly speak to whether indirect placement by another inures to the benefit of the owner of a mark, common law principles and federal court interpretations of the Lanham Act support the view that indirect placement can be sufficient. It is an established principle of the common law of trademark that indirect use of a protected mark by a licensee inures to the benefit of the owner of the mark when the owner has sufficient control over the\n   quality of the goods or services provided to customers under the licensed mark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION \u00a7 33 cmt. b ( AM. LAW INST. 1995) (\"If the trademark owner exercises reasonable control over the nature and quality of the licensee's goods or services, the benefits of the licensee's use accrue to the trademark owner.\"); 2 J. Thomas McCarthy,\n   <em>\n    McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 18:52 (4th ed. 1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 15 Similarly, federal courts have opined that the licensing of trademarked marks is permissible under the Lanham Act when the trademark owner has sufficient control over the quality of goods or services produced by the licensee. Although federal courts have not uniformly applied a single analytical approach to determining the extent of control over quality necessary for a mark's owner to retain trademark rights, they have generally focused on three factors when making such a determination: (1) contract language authorizing control over the licensee by the licensor,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) whether the licensor exercised actual control over the licensee,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   or (3) whether the product quality over time was sufficient for the licensor to rely on the licensee to ensure quality control.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a recent decision discussing this question, the Ninth Circuit analyzed all three factors when determining whether a licensor maintained sufficient control over the quality of goods or services produced by the licensee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FreecycleSunnyvale v. Freecycle Network\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052079\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/626/509/#p516\">\n    626 F.3d 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 516-19 (9th Cir. 2010) (finding no evidence to show contractual control, actual control, or control pursuant to sufficient grounds to trust in the quality control procedures of the licensee). Because federal courts have found sufficient control over quality based on any of the three factors, we apply the Ninth Circuit's test evaluating all three factors to determine whether any factor supports an assertion that the licensor possesses sufficient control over quality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 16 Here, Headspace's complaint did not specifically allege that it retained control over X-Tracted's production of cannabis concentrates. Instead, in its briefing, Headspace proffered hypothetical facts consistent with the allegations in its complaint that could support a claim that it had sufficient control over X-Tracted's production of cannabis concentrates to maintain trademark rights. Specifically, Headspace proffered, both in the trial court and in its briefing on appeal, that its license agreement with X-Tracted included terms that provided Headspace sufficient quality assurances. Furthermore, it is not inconsistent with the allegations of the complaint to hypothesize that Headspace could have relied on the quality control measures utilized by X-Tracted. Because either the hypothetical quality control terms in the license agreement or Headspace's hypothetical reliance on X-Tracted's quality control measures would satisfy the applicable test for quality control, we hold that Headspace has made the necessary showing that it alleged use of its mark \"THE CLEAR\" in the ordinary course of trade in Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 17 Podworks next contends that even if Headspace exercised sufficient control over the quality of the goods produced and sold by X-Tracted, such control necessarily constituted a violation of the CSA and, therefore, cannot satisfy the requirement of lawful placement of the mark in the ordinary course of trade. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   i\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 18 Podworks first asserts that Headspace's licensing agreement with X-Tracted\n   directly violated the CSA at the time Headspace filed its lawsuit. This is so, Podworks avers, because the agreement necessarily required Headspace to participate in X-Tracted's processing of marijuana products, which it was legally prohibited from doing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 19 In 2012, Washington voters approved Initiative Measure 502, LAWS OF 2013, ch. 3, codified as part of chapter 69.50 RCW (I-502), setting forth the circumstances attendant to the legal possession and sale of marijuana. I-502 modified the CSA by establishing a framework pursuant to which individuals and businesses could apply to the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (WSLCB) for licenses to legally produce, process, or sell marijuana products in Washington. RCW 69.50.325. To avoid conflicting with those federal interstate commerce laws and regulations prohibiting the possession and sale of marijuana products, licenses may not be issued to out-of-state companies or individuals. RCW 69.50.331(1)(b). In addition, businesses that obtain a license to produce, process, or sell marijuana products must not permit any other person or entity to use the license or to participate in the production, processing, or sale of marijuana products. RCW 69.50.325.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 20 Here, Headspace is an out-of-state company that is not permitted to obtain a license to produce, process, or sell marijuana products in Washington. However, Headspace's alleged licensing agreement with X-Tracted does not necessarily require that Headspace participate in X-Tracted's processing of marijuana products. While Podworks asserts that the only way that Headspace could have sufficiently controlled the quality of X-Tracted's products was to be directly involved in the processing of X-Tracted's marijuana products, this is not so. Headspace could have ensured the necessary quality through contractual means or by relying on X-Tracted's quality control measures. Headspace's alleged licensing agreement arranged for Headspace to provide X-Tracted with the formula or recipe for processing cannabis concentrates and the right to place Headspace's mark on those concentrates X-Tracted processed using said formula or recipe. The agreement as alleged did not require Headspace to actually participate in the processing or sale of those products. Because no provision of the CSA prohibited Headspace from reaching such an agreement with X-Tracted, Podworks' contention that the agreement necessarily violated the CSA fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   ii\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 21 Podworks next asserts that a recently added provision of the CSA stating that trademark and proprietary information licensing agreements are lawful, enacted in 2017 as part of Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill (ESSB) 5131\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and codified at RCW 69.50.395, necessarily implies that such agreements were illegal prior to the enactment of ESSB 5131. To be sure, because the alleged licensing agreement never required Headspace to produce, process, or sell cannabis in Washington, nothing in the pre-amendment CSA specifically addressed this matter. Similarly, because X-Tracted's processing and sale of cannabis was lawful, the licensing agreement did not make Headspace an accomplice to any wrongdoing. This leaves Podworks with only the argument that an implied prohibition existed prior to ESSB 5131's enactment. We next analyze this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 22 When construing a law adopted by initiative, \"[t]he collective intent of the people becomes the object of the court's search for 'legislative intent.' \"\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Revenue v.

The legislative history of the bill is devoid of any indication that members of the legislature were of the view that, at the time, trademark and proprietary information licensing agreements were illegal or that the bill was designed to authorize their lawful existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 26 The intent of the voters who approved I-502 was clear: to legalize the business of producing, processing, and selling marijuana pursuant to a strict regulatory framework. However, the WSLCB did not view I-502 as authorizing or requiring it to monitor all licensing agreements entered into by licensed\n   marijuana businesses for trademarks and proprietary information relating to the processing of marijuana products. As a result, the WSLCB did not develop the regulations necessary to monitor the industry's use of such agreements, contravening the intent of the voters as perceived by the legislature. To correct this misperception by the executive branch agency and \"continue the regulation\" of Washington's experiment with legal marijuana, the legislature passed a \"clean-up bill\" that, in part, clarified for the WSLCB its obligation to monitor licensing agreements entered into by licensed marijuana businesses. ESSB 5131's legislative history is devoid of any indication that the legislature sought to make legal any licensing agreements that had been previously illegal. Instead, its purpose was to better regulate that which I-502 had previously legalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   iii\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 27 Podworks next asserts that if Headspace actually possessed the amount of control over the quality of X-Tracted's cannabis products necessary to protect its trademark rights, such control would have necessarily made Headspace a \"true party of interest\" of X-Tracted. Podworks also avers that this would have required disclosure of the agreement (and Headspace's status as a \"true party of interest\") to the WSLCB. Furthermore, Podworks reasons, because Headspace did not allege that X-Tracted had ever reported that Headspace was a \"true party of interest\" to the WSLCB, the alleged use of Headspace's mark by X-Tracted could not have been lawful. We disagree. Podworks' argument is unavailing because Headspace could have possessed the required control over quality to maintain its trademark rights without becoming a \"true party of interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 28 The definition of a \"true party of interest\" is set forth in WAC 314-55-035. The regulation requires that all \"true parties of interest\" be listed on a marijuana business's license. WAC 314-55-035(1). Pursuant to the regulation, the \"true parties of interest\" for a corporation are all corporate officers and stockholders, and their spouses. WAC 314-55-035(1). The regulation also provides that any entity or person expecting a percentage of the profits from a marijuana licensed business in exchange for a monetary loan or expertise is also a \"true party of interest.\" WAC 314-55-035(1). We have previously explained that a \" 'true party of interest' is specifically distinguishable from ... 'persons who exercise control of business.' \"\n   <em>\n    Haines-Marchel v.

The regulation does not require that persons or entities who exercise control of the business be listed in a marijuana business's license, but does state that the WSLCB will investigate those persons or entities. WAC 314-55-035(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 29 Podworks' assertion that Headspace, to protect its trademark, must have exercised sufficient control over X-Tracted so as to become a \"true party of interest\" misapprehends the meaning of \"true party of interest\". That Headspace might have sufficient control over X-Tracted's production of cannabis concentrates to protect its trademark rights does not establish that Headspace thereby became either a corporate officer or a stockholder of X-Tracted (nor a spouse of corporate officers or stockholders). Similarly, it does not necessitate that Headspace receives a percentage of X-Tracted's profits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hence, Headspace can have the necessary control over quality of X-Tracted's cannabis\n   concentrates to establish trademark rights without becoming a \"true party of interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 30 Furthermore, even if Podworks had asserted that Headspace was required to submit to an investigation by the WSLCB as an entity that controlled X-Tracted's business operations, such an assertion is not supported by the language of the regulation. The regulation stated that the WSLCB would conduct investigations of persons or entities that exercised control over business operations. WAC 314-55-035(4). It did not require the licensed business to provide a list of all parties with whom it has licensing agreements or copies of those agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 31 Additionally, the recent enactment of RCW 69.50.395 supports our reading of the regulation. The current version of WAC 314-55-035 came into effect on June 18, 2016, and ESSB 5131, with the pertinent provisions codified at RCW 69.50.395, was signed into law on May 16, 2017. RCW 69.50.395 clarifies that marijuana businesses must disclose to the WSLCB all licensing agreements, and was passed after the enactment of the WAC regulation directing the WSLCB to investigate persons exercising control over a licensed marijuana business. RCW 69.50.395(2). It is plain that the legislature collectively thought that the WSLCB required a clearer statement of its role under I-502's regulatory system, as regards licensing agreements. The legislature determined that requiring the disclosure of licensing agreements to the WSLCB would best implement the policy approved by the voters in I-502. The legislature clarified this for the WSLCB, explicitly mandating that it require disclosure of licensing agreements in the future.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 32 If, indeed, X-Tracted failed to disclose its licensing agreement with Headspace to the WSLCB, such failure was not unlawful because the WSLCB did not previously require the disclosure of such agreements. Following the enactment of RCW 69.50.395, however, it is clear that the WSLCB must now require X-Tracted to disclose the agreement. Podworks' assertion that Headspace could not have had sufficient control over X-Tracted's production of cannabis concentrates without violating the CSA is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 33 Reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Andrus, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Appelwick, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Anne W.
