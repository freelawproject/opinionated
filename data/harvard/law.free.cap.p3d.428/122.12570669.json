This department granted review and remanded to the superior court for a reference hearing on two issues: first, whether defense counsel Barbara Corey advised Mr. Garland of a November 2008 plea offer, and if not, whether defense counsel was ineffective for failing to convey the plea offer; and second, whether defense counsel changed trial strategies without researching and understanding the effect of the change, and if so, whether defense counsel was ineffective for doing so. The superior court conducted an evidentiary hearing and entered findings that Mr. Garland failed to demonstrate that his attorney did not convey the plea offer, and thus he failed to prove that defense counsel was ineffective. On the second issue, the court held that Mr. Garland failed to demonstrate that his attorney did not research and understand the effect of any strategy change, and thus Mr. Garland failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 3 To demonstrate ineffective assistance. Mr. Garland must show that Ms. Corey's performance was objectively unreasonable and that he was prejudiced.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Prejudice is established when there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional performance, the result of the trial would have been different.\n   <em>\n    State v. Hendrickson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"904193\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/129/61/#p78\">\n    129 Wn.2d 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 78,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=917%20P.2d%20563\">\n    917 P.2d 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). When the superior court rules on an ineffective assistance claim in relation to a reference hearing, the court's ultimate conclusion of law as to ineffective assistance is reviewed de novo, while the findings of fact are reviewed for substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    In re Pers.

In light of those findings and credibility determinations, Mr. Garland fails to demonstrate that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See In re Pers.
