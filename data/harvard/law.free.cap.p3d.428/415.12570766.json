The manufacturing process produces liquid boric acid. A boric acid evaporator system (BAES) converts the 180-degree liquid boric acid into distilled water for reuse in manufacturing anode aluminum foil and into solid waste for disposal. In July 2012, CMC worker Javier Puente suffered fatal injuries while performing maintenance work on the BAES pump that had been installed in the environmental building of the facility in 2002. Corina Puente individually and as the personal representative of the Estate of Javier Puente (collectively, the Estate) filed a lawsuit against GE Ionics Inc. and Resources Conservation Company International (collectively, RCCI) alleging claims of negligence and liability under the Washington product liability act (WPLA), chapter 7.72 RCW. The court ruled on summary judgment that the lawsuit against RCCI is barred by the six-year statute of repose for claims arising from construction, design, or engineering \"of any improvement upon real property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Estate appeals the order granting summary judgment dismissal of the lawsuit and the order denying reconsideration.

NCC uses the anode aluminum foils to manufacture aluminum electrolytic capacitors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 The CMC manufacturing facility at Moses Lake operated in a building originally built as a United States Air Force base hanger. CMC decided to expand the west bay building of the existing facility and add six new aluminum formation machines to increase production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Baugh Industrial Contractors Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   was the general contractor for the approximately $32.6 million \"Large Phase 3\" (LP3) \"West Bay Expansion Project.\" Baugh retained architect and engineering firm Harris Group Inc. to design the expansion.

In addition to the six new aluminum formation machines in the main facility, the \"environmental building\" was expanded to house utility systems and \"support equipment,\" including \"[c]ity water reverse osmosis\" systems, deionization units, a phosphoric acid recovery system, air compressors, and a new, larger boric acid evaporator system (BAES). A BAES converts the liquid boric acid produced during the manufacturing of anode aluminum foils into distilled water and into solid waste for disposal. The distilled water is stored in a condensate tank and reused in the manufacturing process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 Baugh entered into a contract with GE Ionics Inc. and Resources Conservation Company International (collectively, RCCI)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the new BAES.

The \"Project Completion Report\" describes the work completed and the new equipment installed. The report identifies the BAES as a new \"major process\" system that is \"[m]ajor equipment installed as part of the LP3 west bay expansion project.\" The RCCI BAES \"Maintenance Manual\" contains \"the equipment manufacturers' instructions for installation and maintenance\" of the BAES.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 11 On July 23, 2012, CMC shut down the Moses Lake \"manufacturing plant\" for \"routine maintenance.\" Sixty-four-year-old Javier Puente had been a CMC maintenance department employee for more than 10 years and had been responsible for maintenance of the BAES for \"many years.\" Before performing maintenance on the BAES recirculation pump located in the environmental building, the CMC employees drained the liquid from the BAES. Puente and the other maintenance workers removed the bolts that attached the BAES recirculation pump to the piping system. Puente was \"standing near the joint between the pump and the piping system\" when a large volume of 180-degree \"boric acid solution\" burst onto him. Puente died two days later from thermal burns to 80 percent of his body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 12 Corina Puente individually and as the personal representative of the Estate of Javier Puente (collectively, the Estate) filed a lawsuit against GE Ionics Inc. and Resources\n   Conservation Company International (collectively, RCCI) alleging claims of negligence and liability under the Washington products liability act (WPLA), chapter 7.72 RCW.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Estate alleged RCCI is a \"product manufacturer.\" The Estate alleged RCCI negligently installed equipment, provided defective designs and equipment, did not design a reasonably safe BAES, breached express and implied warranties, and did not provide adequate warnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 13 A chemical engineer expert retained by the Estate concluded the BAES designed by RCCI was \"inherently dangerous.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [I]t is my opinion that Defendant RCCI designed the BAES, knowing that the hazard of hot boric acid solution would exist and that the recirculation pump would need to be removed for maintenance periodically, and did not provide any way to block the hazard of hot boric acid solution when workers removed the recirculation pump for maintenance. It is my opinion that Defendant RCCI designed a product that was inherently dangerous because Defendant RCCI knew that the BAES included wearable parts that would require maintenance (e.g., the recirculation pump), and they did not include double block and bleed mechanisms so that the pump could be safely removed without workers being exposed to the hazard of hot boric acid solution.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 14 RCCI filed a motion for summary judgment dismissal on the grounds that the six-year construction statute of repose barred the lawsuit. RCW 4.16.300 states actions or claims arising from construction of an improvement upon real property are subject to the six-year construction statute of repose. RCW 4.16.310 bars claims that accrue within six years of substantial completion. RCCI argued the BAES is an improvement upon real property because it was integral to the function of the environmental building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 15 In opposition to summary judgment, the Estate argued the construction statute of repose did not bar the lawsuit because the record established the BAES was part of the manufacturing process, not an improvement upon real property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 16 The court entered an \"Order Granting Defendant Resources Conservation Company International's Motion for Summary Judgment Pursuant to Construction Statute of Repose.\" The court denied the motion for reconsideration. The order denying reconsideration states the court finds RCCI are \"engineers entitled to the protection of the construction statute of repose in RCW 4.16.300 and 4.16.310 against Plaintiff's claims herein,\" the claims \"arise out of construction activities related to improvements upon real property,\" and the claims \"accrued after the expiration of the construction statute of repose in RCW 4.16.300 and 4.16.310.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 17 The Estate appeals the summary judgment order of dismissal and the order denying the motion for reconsideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 18 The Estate contends the court erred in ruling that the BAES is an improvement \"upon real property\" barred by the construction statute of repose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 19 We review an order of summary judgment dismissal de novo and engage in the same inquiry as the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Kofmehl v.
