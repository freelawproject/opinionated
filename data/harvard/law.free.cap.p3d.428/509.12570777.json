Because we lack jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 In February 2016, Perry filed an application to restore his civil rights and set aside his convictions for aggravated driving under the influence and disorderly conduct. Perry also requested that the court restore his right to possess firearms. In April 2016, the court granted Perry's application as to his civil rights and set aside the judgment, but declined to restore his gun rights. In July 2017, Perry filed a new application to restore his gun rights. On August 15, after a hearing, the trial court denied that application. On November 17, Perry filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Although the state has not contested the issue of jurisdiction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   we have an independent duty to determine our jurisdiction over the appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Serrano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324822\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/491/\">\n    234 Ariz. 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324822\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/491/\">\n    323 P.3d 774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 2014) (appellate jurisdiction \"provided and limited by law.\"). To address whether we have jurisdiction over Perry's claim, we must first determine whether the action to restore gun rights after a criminal conviction is civil or criminal in nature. For the reasons that follow, we conclude Perry's action is properly characterized as criminal. Perry's application for restoration of his right to possess firearms seeks relief from a sanction imposed in a criminal case. And, he seeks restoration under statutes and rules addressing applications arising from criminal cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-907 ; Ariz. R. Crim. P. 29. Furthermore, our courts have largely treated an action for a restoration of rights after a criminal conviction as a criminal proceeding, implicitly treating them as orders appealable under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4033(A)(3).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.
