They developed a friendly relationship. They maintained contact after Ms. Dumas moved to Alabama in 2014, and their friendship developed into a relationship that was as \"romantic as it could be for long distance.\" They decided Ms. Dumas would move back to Wyoming so they \"could make a go of it.\" She returned to Wyoming in July of 2015, and moved in with Mr. Dumas at his home in Thermopolis, Wyoming. Nine days later, they married.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b64] The relationship soon soured, and by June of 2016, \"[t]here was a lot more bickering, arguing, [and they] didn't really see eye to eye on a lot of things.\" One source of friction was a group of friends who stayed at their home as roommates for a time. Mr. Dumas claimed that when the roommates moved out, they stole \"stuff\" from him. On Friday, September 23, 2016, Mr. Dumas accused Ms. Dumas of cheating, lying, \"and being in cahoots\" with the former roommates. She tried to show him messages on her tablet computer to refute his claims. Mr. Dumas took the tablet and \"smashed it\" on Ms. Dumas's head and \"shattered the screen.\" She then tried to show him messages from her cell phone, but he \"smashed\" that on the dresser. When the two continued to argue, Mr. Dumas grabbed her by the throat and pushed her up against the wall. She found it hard to breathe, and \"saw stars briefly.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b65] The next day, Ms. Dumas reached out to the Hope Agency,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and employees there arranged a place for her to stay. Before she left home, however, she wrote two letters to Mr. Dumas saying that she still loved him, did not want to get divorced, and would do whatever she had to do to make the marriage work. She left one letter in the kitchen and the other in their bedroom. She did not report the previous day's incident to law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b66] On Monday, September 26, 2016, Ms. Dumas returned to the house to collect some of her belongings, believing that Mr. Dumas would not be there. However, at around six o'clock in the evening, Mr. Dumas arrived home with his stepmother and her three grandchildren. Ms. Dumas went outside to talk to him, but \"of course it escalated into an argument.\" She testified that, when they went into the house, he pushed her up against a cabinet, then grabbed her wrist with both of his hands and twisted her skin in opposite directions. Mr. Dumas insisted that Ms. Dumas had to babysit the grandchildren. They moved into the bedroom to avoid fighting in front of the children, and she told him she did not want to babysit. He grabbed her hair, hit her, and \"cupped\" her ears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b67] Ms. Dumas stayed with the children when Mr. Dumas and his stepmother left. Mr. Dumas returned after about thirty-five minutes. Ms. Dumas suggested that she would leave since he was there to watch the children, but he insisted that she stay to care for the children because he was going to bed. The argument escalated, and Mr. Dumas struck her in the face, told her he did not want to talk with her, that their relationship was over, and he did not want anything to do with her. When she tried to \"hug him good-bye,\" he pushed her away, then grabbed her by the throat. According to Ms. Dumas, \"He squeezed, told me it was over, told me to leave him alone, and it apparently sunk in, because I left that time. And like I said, that was the last time I saw him.\" Ms. Dumas testified that it was difficult to breathe while his hands were on her, and that it was \"like being trapped underwater gasping for air.\" She had difficulty swallowing for about a month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b68] The next morning, Ms. Dumas went to the Hope Agency to report what had happened. Agency staff called the Thermopolis police, and Officer Bobbi Zupan was dispatched to the Hope Agency. The officer observed redness and bruising on Ms. Dumas's face and arms, and because Ms. Dumas reported being choked or strangled, the officer\n   advised her to go to the emergency room for a medical examination. The hospital nurse observed Ms. Dumas's injuries, including petechiae\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on her neck. The doctor noted that Ms. Dumas appeared to have three recent injuries: a bruise on her upper left arm, a bruise on her left forearm, and swelling behind the ear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b69] Mr. Dumas was arrested and charged with one count of strangulation of a household member in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-509\">\n    Wyo.

Ms. Bartlow was the last witness called by the State. She is an employee of the Hope Agency. She testified in general about the Hope Agency, the services it offers to victims of domestic violence, and her duties there. She testified about her interactions with Ms. Dumas and her observations of Ms. Dumas on September 27\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   . She described Ms. Dumas as \"very distraught, crying.\" She observed bruises. Ms. Dumas was \"shaking.\" She took Ms. Dumas to the hospital and, after Ms. Dumas had been examined and treated, she drove her back to the Hope Agency. Ms. Bartlow also testified as to the additional assistance that Hope Agency provided to Ms. Dumas. It provided Ms. Dumas initial shelter for three days and also paid the initial deposit and rent for six months for an apartment that Ms. Dumas obtained in a different town. The agency provided food for Ms. Dumas, allowed her to take some clothing from the agency's \"emergency\" supply, and filled the gas tank of her car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b612] Mr. Dumas contends that Ms. Bartlow's testimony about the assistance provided by the Hope Agency after her return from the hospital was \"not of consequence to the determination of whether Mr. Dumas assaulted his wife,\" and was therefore irrelevant and inadmissible. He claims that this testimony \"served only to inflame the passions of the jury and constitute[d] impermissible victim impact testimony.\" The State contends that the evidence was not intended to inflame the passions of the jury and that Mr. Dumas's trial strategy rendered the challenged testimony relevant. Based upon our review of the record, we agree with the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b613] \"Broadly speaking, victim impact evidence is that evidence relating to the victim's personal characteristics and to the physical, emotional, or social impact of a crime on its victim and the victim's family.\"\n   <em>\n    Benjamin v.

The testimony could also properly be viewed as a clarification of previous testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b615] Near the beginning of her testimony, Ms. Bartlow testified in general to the services offered by Hope Agency to victims of domestic violence. She explained that Hope Agency is \"able to offer them shelter for three nights, and we pick up that tab. We'll also take them and get food so that they can eat while they are in shelter.\" She also testified that \"if the person [has] the ability to move into another apartment\" that the transitional housing program would \"pay\" for that for \"up to 2 years in support of that victim.\" That testimony was received without objection and is not challenged on appeal. The testimony at issue could properly be viewed as mere clarification of the specific services provided to Ms. Dumas. The evidence is also relevant in light of the defense strategy at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b616] The defense strategy focused primarily upon the credibility of Ms. Dumas. The defense took the position that Ms. Dumas had fabricated her story. She did so, according to defense counsel's opening statement, because Mr. Dumas wanted a divorce and she \"was not ready for this relationship to end.\" She was jealous because \"she believed that Mr. Dumas had feelings for another woman.\" Near the conclusion of her opening statement, defense counsel succinctly summarized the case: \"What you are going to hear is the old adage, 'If I can't have you no one will, and if you leave me, you will pay.' Ms. Dumas told these stories due to Mr. Dumas'[s] request to end the relationship, and she figured if she couldn't have him, no one was going to.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b617] There were several aspects to the defense attack on Ms. Dumas's credibility during trial. The defense claimed that Ms. Dumas had failed to provide a consistent narrative of the events. During opening statement, defense counsel told the jury, \"From this point of the story you are going to hear many different versions of Ms. Dumas'[s] tale. Her story was reduced to writing in three different reports, none of which are consistent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b618] The defense also attempted to undermine Ms. Dumas's credibility by emphasizing her relationship with the Hope Agency. The defense suggested that Ms. Dumas reported the domestic violence to the Hope Agency in order to obtain financial support and because the Hope Agency would believe her. During\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   , defense counsel directly linked the attack on Ms. Dumas's credibility to the services offered by the Hope Agency, asking the jury this question: \"So we talked about the Hope Agency and how the resources can make it easier to report because you know they are there for you. Who believes it can also make it easier for a false report if someone knows where to go?\" In response, one prospective juror observed that \"the Hope Agency provided a lot of services; food, clothes, toys, different stuff, so somebody could lie just to get a free handout.\" When\n   another prospective juror agreed with the first, defense counsel asked, \"And do you think that having an agency like the Hope Agency that gives out free rooms and free food and free toys sometimes adds an incentive [to lie]?\" The prospective juror agreed, \"Sometimes.\" A third juror responded: \"I saw a couple instances in the military where spouses were exaggerating on what they had for meals and what not to try to get more money out of the military.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b619] During cross-examination of Ms. Dumas, defense counsel attempted to establish that Ms. Dumas was aware that the Hope Agency provided resources to help victims of domestic violence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Q: ... You volunteered at the Hope Agency; correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A: I did. They helped me, I helped them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q: So you knew what resources they had?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A: We never really talked about that, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q: Did you - you knew they could help you; correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A: I knew that they helped with domestic violence, but when I met them I wasn't domestic violence, I was just a person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q: Correct. So on - on the weekend, even the entire month of September, you knew the resources the Hope Agency had; correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A: I - I didn't know what extent their resources were.

Ms. Bartlow's testimony did not contain an actual conclusion of guilt. Instead, she commented that she had no reason to disbelieve Ms. Dumas's version of events.

In\n   <em>\n    Saldana\n   </em>\n   , this Court distinguished direct opinions of guilt from witness testimony that merely supported an \"inference of guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8392198\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/177/819/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 846 P.2d at 616-17. At most, Ms. Bartlow's statements fell into the latter category. In the absence of an actual conclusion of Mr. Dumas's guilt, Ms. Bartlow's testimony did not violate a clear and unequivocal rule of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. Vouching\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   [\u00b628] Mr. Dumas also contends that the challenged testimony violates the prohibition against vouching for the credibility of a witness. The State contends that \"in context\" the testimony is not improper. As we understand it, the State is asserting that Mr. Dumas opened the door for the testimony based upon his theory of defense and questions that he had asked Ms. Bartlow on cross-examination. The State contends that the issue of Hope Agency's belief in its clients was introduced by Mr. Dumas during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   , elicited by Mr. Dumas during cross-examination of Ms. Bartlow, and emphasized by Mr. Dumas in closing argument in an effort to undermine the credibility of Ms. Dumas. The State asserts that the brief exchange with Ms. Bartlow during redirect was warranted by that strategy. Also, as previously mentioned, the State contends that Mr. Dumas has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by the testimony, even if it was improper. In light of the defense strategy in this case and its reliance on the evidence to undermine the credibility of Ms. Dumas, we are unable to find any prejudice to Mr. Dumas. Consequently, it is not necessary to determine whether the defense \"opened the door\" for this testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   [\u00b629] In order to establish plain error, an appellant must show a reasonable probability that he would have received a more favorable verdict in the absence of the error.\n   <em>\n    Osterling v.

The testimony that is challenged was, in many respects, cumulative. It was consistent with testimony that had been elicited by the State during direct examination of Ms. Bartlow. It also aligned with Ms. Bartlow's testimony during cross-examination by defense counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   [\u00b630] On direct examination, Ms. Bartlow testified that in her job, \"the largest thing that we offer is belief. When a client comes in, we believe, period. We don't blame the victim, we try to ascertain what that victim is going through, if that victim is in a safe place, if not, we can provide a safe place.\" During cross-examination, this exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Q. And you said that your first and biggest priority is to believe; correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   A: Yes, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Q: So you don't really question the sincerity of a victim; correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   A: We're not the police, it is not ours to question the details.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The State did not emphasize or refer to the testimony during closing, but Mr. Dumas did. During closing, defense counsel told the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   She had to have some players in this plan. First of all the Hope Agency. She knew exactly where to go and report because she had been volunteering there, and she knew what they did. And Ms. Bartlow indicated to you what that was; they believe. They never question the story. This is common throughout the story with the players involved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   [\u00b631] Later in her argument, defense counsel reminded the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Now we all have our roles to play in our community. We all have our jobs. The Hope Agency's job is to be there for victims, and they do a great job of that. ... They're a great resource for people who need it, and they did their job. They believed her without question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   [\u00b632] In sum, the testimony of Ms. Bartlow was very brief, was not emphasized by the State, and was consistent with testimony that had previously been given by Ms. Bartlow and elicited by Mr. Dumas during cross-examination. The testimony was utilized by Mr. Dumas in his efforts to undermine the credibility of Ms. Dumas and supported his theory of defense. Under the circumstances, we see no reasonable probability that the jury would have returned a more favorable verdict in the absence of the disputed testimony.
