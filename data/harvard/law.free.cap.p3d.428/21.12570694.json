Abraham. Because Federated did not present to the district court the issue it raises on appeal, we conclude that Federated waived the challenge. Accordingly, we affirm and remand for the limited purpose of calculating Abraham's attorney fees incurred on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 In August 2011, Federated, a Michigan corporation, brought suit against Abraham, a Texas resident, alleging that she had breached a credit card contract that required her to make payments in Pennsylvania. Specifically,\n   Federated alleged that Abraham had failed to make credit card payments to Federated's predecessor-in-interest totaling $11,528.59 and that she consequently owed Federated that amount plus approximately five years of interest at 39.64%. A provision of the contract specified that Utah law applied, that Utah courts were the proper forum, and that the parties consented to Utah courts' jurisdiction (the Controlling Law &amp; Jurisdiction Clause). The contract also contained an attorney-fee provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Abraham filed an answer, in which she asserted, \"As an affirmative defense, the defendant alleges that this action fails because of the statute of limitations.\" Thereafter, Abraham filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the cause of action arose in Pennsylvania and that Utah's borrowing statute\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   required the district court to apply Pennsylvania's four-year statute of limitations for breach of contract instead of Utah's six-year statute of limitations. Thus, according to Abraham, Federated's claim was barred because Federated had not filed suit until August 9, 2011, \"a date well [past] the four year limitations period for suit on written contracts under Pennsylvania law.\" Abraham also requested attorney fees under Utah's reciprocal attorney fee statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-5-826 (LexisNexis 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Federated filed an opposition to Abraham's motion for summary judgment, addressing Abraham's statute-of-limitations defense on the merits. Specifically, Federated argued that its claim was not time-barred, because Utah's six-year statute of limitations applied as a result of the Controlling Law &amp; Jurisdiction Clause. Federated did not argue or suggest to the court that Abraham's answer lacked specificity nor did it raise a challenge to the manner in which Abraham had pleaded her affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The district court agreed with Abraham's interpretation of Utah law and the applicability of Utah's borrowing statute, and it granted summary judgment in her favor. The court also awarded Abraham attorney fees pursuant to the reciprocal attorney fee statute. Federated appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 On appeal, Federated contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Abraham. Federated specifically asserts that Abraham failed to properly plead her statute-of-limitations defense, and thereby lost the right to pursue that defense. However, Federated did not raise this objection to the district court. Generally, issues that are not preserved are waived, absent a valid exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    438 Main St. v.

Specifically, she asserted that \"[Federated] brought this action in Utah. Thus, the statutes of limitation of Utah apply to this lawsuit. These statutes include the Utah borrowing statute.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2078-2-103\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78-2-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2012). Abraham further alleged that \"[a] cause of action for breach of contract arises in the state in which the parties determine that performance was due\" and that, based on the contract, \"[t]he cause of action ... arose in Pennsylvania.\" Observing that \"Pennsylvania has a four year statute of limitations for breach of contract\" pursuant to section 5525 of title 42 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, Abraham asserted that Federated's suit was not timely filed and that the case should be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%205525\">\n    42 Pa.

However, Federated did not bring these arguments to the attention of the district court, nor did it object to Abraham's assertion of the statute-of-limitations defense in responding to her motion for summary judgment. Instead, in its memorandum in opposition to summary judgment, Federated addressed Abraham's affirmative defense on the merits, arguing that Utah's borrowing statute was inapplicable because the contract contained a forum-selection clause that \"required the parties to bring suit in Utah\" and that Pennsylvania's four-year statute of limitations was therefore \"irrelevant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611 \"A party waives all defenses and objections not presented either by motion or by answer or reply[.]\" Utah R.

Accordingly, even if we assume, without deciding, that Abraham had lost the right to pursue any statute-of-limitations defense by not pleading that defense with specificity in her answer under rule 9(i), Federated waived any objection to Abraham's defective answer when it responded to her motion for summary judgment and addressed her affirmative defense on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Golding v.

Our supreme court has recognized that while rule 8(c)\"is a good rule whose purpose is to have the issues to be tried clearly framed,\" the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure \"must all be looked to in the light of their even more fundamental purpose of liberalizing both pleading and procedure to the end that the parties are afforded the privilege of presenting whatever legitimate contentions they have pertaining to their dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.
