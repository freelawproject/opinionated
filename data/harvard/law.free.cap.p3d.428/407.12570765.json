The following day, the court granted the petition, and C.V. was sent to Evergreen Hospital. Evergreen was not a certified evaluation and treatment facility.

C.V. argues that dismissal is warranted because a valid single bed certification is a fundamental requirement of the involuntary treatment act. Further, C.V. notes that proper individualized descriptions of persons being detained are necessary to ensure that the professionals approving single bed certifications have the information necessary to exercise their professional judgment. Underlying these contentions is C.V.'s \"constitutional right to receive 'such individual treatment as will give [C.V.] a realistic opportunity to be cured or to improve his or her mental condition.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23 The involuntary treatment act sets out procedural requirements for 14-day commitment petitions in RCW 71.05.230. \"A petition may only be filed\" if all nine \"conditions\" are met, including that \"[t]he facility providing intensive treatment is certified to provide such treatment by the department.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 24 The procedural deficiency here can be can be compared with a claimant's failure to follow the preconditions to a tort claim against the State. All tort claims against the State \"must be presented\" to the office of risk management before they can be filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dismissal is the proper remedy for a substantive claim that does not comply with the procedural requirements of RCW 4.92.100 and RCW 4.92.110.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dismissal of a civil commitment petitions is evaluated under a different standard. Unlike the tort claim precondition, courts may dismiss an involuntary commitment petition only when the statutory requirements are totally disregarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 25 Although the single bed certification form used for C.V. violated involuntary treatment act requirements, the violation does not rise to the level of total disregard under these circumstances. As in\n   <em>\n    C.W.\n   </em>\n   , Evergreen's conduct did not violate C.V.'s constitutional liberty interests or undermine the involuntary treatment act's purpose. Unlike\n   <em>\n    D.W.\n   </em>\n   , C.V. was not denied any psychiatric or therapeutic care for his mental illness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 26 As the State acknowledges, detaining a person at an uncertified facility without a single bed certification would constitute total disregard of the involuntary treatment act. The circumstances here differ significantly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court carefully reviewed the detailed records of C.V.'s diagnosis, care, and\n   treatment at Evergreen when considering his motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   A court with such detailed information about an individual's specific treatment needs and a facility's specific treatment efforts is well situated to analyze whether the involuntary treatment act requirements were totally disregarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 27 It is problematic that the Department of Social and Health Services issued a single bed certificate after a two-minute review of a \"check the box\" form. The purpose of the descriptive requirements in RCW 71.05.745 and the related regulation is to promote the exercise of meaningful, professional judgment by a qualified individual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Individualized facts are required to accurately assess whether an individual's specific treatment needs may be timely and appropriately met by the particular facility applying for a single bed certificate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 28 But the trial court's review was consistent with the legislature's direction to dismiss petitions for involuntary commitment only where there was a total disregard of involuntary treatment act requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judicial review of C.V.'s treatment records adequately safeguarded C.V.'s interests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 29 Evergreen and the Department of Social and Health Services disregarded some requirements of the involuntary treatment act. But dismissal of a petition for involuntary commitment of a person who presents a likelihood of serious harm or is gravely disabled is unwarranted unless the petition fails on its merits or the person or entities involved totally disregarded the requirements of the involuntary treatment act. Under the circumstances here, no one totally disregarded the requirements of the involuntary treatment act. Dismissal is not the proper remedy.
