The Fire Department was summoned and, during the investigation,\n   Ellison reported he saw flames from his bedroom window but was unable to escape the house because the doors had been tied shut from the outside. Ellison and his parents claimed they saw someone who looked like Fritz or his \"twin\" in their yard on the night of the fire, and that the same man had been at their home several times before. They later made statements in the proceeding that Fritz was responsible for starting the fire at the home. At trial, Fritz and other officers testified that Fritz was investigating another crime scene elsewhere in Billings in the hours before, during, and after the fire at Ellison's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 After testing, the Montana State Crime Lab determined the DNA found on the ropes tied to the doors of Ellison's home matched Ellison's DNA. Ellison was arrested on July 31, 2014. Later, soon after Ellison was released on bond, Ellison made phone calls to two employers in which he falsely identified himself as Fritz and maintained that they should not hire Ellison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Ellison was charged with one count of arson, two counts of tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, and one count of impersonation of a public servant. Before trial, Ellison moved in limine to exclude evidence of any other crimes, wrongs, or acts pursuant to M. R. Evid. 404(b). These prior acts raised by Ellison included investigations by the Yellowstone County Sheriff's Office and Park County Sheriff's Office after Ellison staged his own abductions in 2008 and 2010, a conviction for arson in 2009, a conviction for misdemeanor theft in 2010, a conviction for Partner or Family Member Assault (PFMA) in 2010, and a conviction for two counts of Violation of an Order of Protection (VOP) in 2012. Fritz had investigated the PFMA and VOP cases, leading to charges against Ellison. Following Ellison's convictions in those cases, Ellison and his parents attempted to prosecute a civil lawsuit against Fritz and the Yellowstone County Sheriff's Office, alleging intimidation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 The District Court partially granted and partially denied Ellison's motion, ruling that evidence relating to Ellison's staged abductions in\n   2008 and 2010, his conviction for arson in 2009, and his conviction for theft in 2010 was not admissible; but that \"evidence of Ellison's past acts relating to Detective Fritz may properly be admitted,\" including the PFMA and VOP investigations, as well as evidence relating to the Ellisons' lawsuit against Fritz. The court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Evidence that is inextricably linked to and explanatory of a fact in dispute may be admitted under the transaction rule in order to provide a comprehensive and complete picture of the commission of a crime [internal quotations and citations omitted].... By making these accusations [that Fritz started the fire], Ellison and his parents made the other evidence concerning Detective Fritz relevant to show the source of Ellison's animosity toward Detective Fritz, as well as Ellison's motive to concoct the crime scene. The State's evidence relating to Detective Fritz-including his investigation of Ellison for prior convictions and the Ellisons' lawsuit against him-\n   <em>\n    is thus relevant not for propensity purposes, but rather to show motive and provide context, inter alia\n   </em>\n   , for the reasons behind the fire, the discovery of a knife with the word 'Fritz' written on it, and Ellison's impersonation of Detective Fritz. [Emphasis added.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 At trial, the State called Fritz to testify about his prior investigations of Ellison, at which time the court gave a cautionary instruction to the jury about the proper use of evidence about other acts, stating \"[t]he only purpose of admitting that evidence is to show motive and context. You may not use that evidence for any other purpose.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fritz discussed an incident in which Ellison allegedly tampered with the victim in the PFMA case, explaining that Ellison \"had his wife go down to the jail ... to have all of the charges dropped against him.\" Fritz testified both to his involvement in and the details surrounding the VOP case, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The victim had alleged that the defendant was holding her-her medication that she needed as a bargaining chip for her to go to the county attorney's office and have all of the charges dropped and to give a different story or a different version of events that had taken place during their partner family member assault case. Not only did he have the medication, but it was also alleged by the victim that he would not pay the power bill at the house that she was living in unless [she] went to the county attorney's office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Fritz further testified that Ellison was to meet up with his then-wife, but when he saw a patrol car coincidently parked near their meeting place, he got \"spooked.\" In a subsequent meeting with his then-wife, Ellison refused to return her medication \"unless she went and spoke with the county attorney about the partner family member assault case.\" Ellison's then-wife became extremely upset, leading Fritz to seek approval for Ellison's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b67 After a three-day trial, the jury acquitted Ellison of arson, and convicted him of the other charges. Ellison appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b68 This Court \"review[s] evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion, which occurs when a district court acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

R. Evid. 404(b) as evidence of Ellison's motive, Ellison challenges the State's introduction of detailed facts underlying those cases as violative of M. R. Evid. 404(b). In answer, the State argues the evidence was properly admitted to demonstrate Ellison's \"motive, intent, plan, [and] knowledge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b611 \"All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by constitution, statute, [or] these rules....\" M.

An item of evidence is relevant if it has any value, \"as determined by logic and experience, in proving the proposition for which it is offered.\"\n   <em>\n    Berger\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b612 Under Rule 404(b), evidence of \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\" However, such evidence may be admissible to establish \"proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\" M. R. Evid. 404(b). This list of permissible, non-propensity\n   purposes is not exclusive and not precise; rather, the categories are \"amorphous, overlapping, and dependent upon the underlying facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Blaz\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12. In a Rule 404(b) analysis, \"the distinction between admissible and inadmissible\" evidence depends \"on the intended purpose of the evidence, not its substance.\"\n   <em>\n    Blaz\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12 ;\n   <em>\n    Madplume\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 23 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b613 Motive can be defined as \" '[s]omething ... that leads one to act.' \"\n   <em>\n    Blaz\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1172 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 10 ed. 2014) ). Fritz' prior investigations of Ellison for PFMA and VOP logically can be explained as the motive for Ellison to tie ropes to the doors of his parents' home, place a knife with the name \"Fritz\" in the yard, light the house on fire, and call two employers impersonating Fritz. Without Fritz' investigations of Ellison for the PFMA and VOP, Ellison may not have been arrested and charged for those previous crimes. Thus, Ellison had a viable motive to retaliate by concocting a crime scene in an attempt to frame Fritz, and the\n   evidence surrounding those investigations was admissible under Rule 404(b) for that non-propensity purpose. Ellison cites our language in\n   <em>\n    Blaz\n   </em>\n   cautioning against defining \"motive\" too broadly and \"potentially encroaching upon the impermissible use of motive as propensity evidence,\" to argue that the District Court defined motive here too broadly in order to admit Ellison's prior convictions for PFMA and VOP.\n   <em>\n    Blaz\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15. In\n   <em>\n    Blaz\n   </em>\n   , we concluded that admission of the defendant's prior PFMA conviction as evidence of motive had defined \"motive\" too broadly.\n   <em>\n    Blaz\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15. Here, beyond the fact of Ellison's prior convictions for PFMA and VOP and Fritz' involvement in those cases, the circumstances surrounding those cases, including the details of Fritz' interactions with Ellison that led to the charges, provided the necessary background to understand Ellison's attempt to frame Fritz, made his guilt more likely, and was properly admitted to demonstrate this motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b614 Further, the District Court admitted the contested evidence under the transaction rule, \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, to provide context for the allegations against Ellison. We have held that it is permissible to admit \"limited evidence that is 'intrinsic to' or 'inextricably intertwined with' a charged crime\" for the purpose of providing \"a comprehensive and complete picture of the commission of a crime.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Guill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5713508\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/355/490/\">\n    2010 MT 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 28, 36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5713508\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/355/490/\">\n    355 Mont. 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5713508\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/355/490/\">\n    228 P.3d 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Part of the rationale for admission of transactional evidence is that \"it is difficult for a witness to testify coherently to an event if the witness is only permitted to reference the minutely defined elements of the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Guill\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 27 (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   Charles Alan Wright &amp; Kenneth W. Graham, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence\n   </em>\n   vol. 22, \u00a7 5239, 446 (West 1988) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b615 The details surrounding Fritz' and Ellison's involvement explained the circumstances underlying the charged offenses and allowed the \"complete picture\" to be given to the jury. Ellison's tying ropes to the doors, placing a knife with Fritz' name at the scene, setting his own house on fire, and making phone calls to employers make little logical sense, and thereby tend to erode the strength of the charges, without the context of Fritz' and Ellison's prior involvements. Relevancy of evidence lies in \"logic and experience, in proving the proposition for which it is offered,\"\n   <em>\n    Berger\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 39, and here the contested evidence was logical and helped prove the charges by providing necessary context. Therefore, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b616 Ellison also argues that, even if the evidence was admissible under Rule 404(b), it was inadmissible under Rule 403 because its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. The State responds that Ellison forfeited this issue by failing to raise it before the District Court. Ellison's motion in limine, in which he raised the evidentiary issues he argues on appeal, sought \"to exclude from trial evidence of any other crimes, wrongs, or acts allegedly committed by Defendant,\" which he described as a \"limited criminal history,\" on the ground that this evidence violated Rule 404(b), and also sought to exclude his 2006 arson conviction on the ground it was \"so far removed, in time and material facts, from the new charges that it is irrelevant and therefore inadmissible under Rule 401.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b617 A motion in limine may \"preserve an objection for appeal provided the objecting party makes the basis for his objection clear to the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State reasons that \"there is nothing to suggest that Ellison's tying ropes to the door handles of the trailer would implicate Detective Fritz in the crime,\" and, thus, these\n   convictions should be treated as separate offenses. However, we view the State's framing of the facts and Ellison's purposes, in its effort to avoid application of the statute, overly nuanced and unreflective of the record as a whole. Ellison engaged in \"a series of acts or omissions that [were] motivated by ... a purpose to accomplish a criminal objective and that [were] necessary or incidental to the accomplishment of that objective,\" and thus arose out of the \"same transaction.\" Sections 46-1-202(23)(a)-(b), 46-11-410, MCA. The staging of an arson and the framing of another for that same arson are two offenses that were motivated by a common objective. Ellison had the same purpose and motivation for tying the ropes to the doors as he did when placing the \"Fritz\" knife-to stage a crime, mislead investigators, and frame Fritz.

In\n   <em>\n    Becker\n   </em>\n   , a defendant\n   alleged that the District Court erred by sentencing him for both possession of methamphetamine and production or manufacture of methamphetamine.\n   <em>\n    Becker\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16. Applying\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , this Court held, in relevant part, that because the defendant's trial counsel relied only upon federal double jeopardy grounds, and failed to recognize the protections provided by \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, his performance was deficient.\n   <em>\n    Becker\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20. We further determined that counsel's deficient performance prejudiced Becker because he \"would have been sentenced to a lesser term had counsel made the appropriate argument regarding the lesser-included offense under \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, rather than under the [federal]\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   test.\"\n   <em>\n    Becker\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b626 Ellison's counsel failed to make any motion in the District Court raising the application of the multiple conviction statute.

Section 3-1-317(1)(a), MCA, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), all courts of original jurisdiction shall impose:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (a) on a defendant in criminal cases, a $ 10 user surcharge upon conviction for any conduct made criminal by state statute or upon forfeiture of bond or bail;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   According to the plain language of the statute, the information technology user surcharge is a \"user surcharge\" to be assessed \"per user,\" irrespective of the number of criminal counts charged. This Court has held that this statute implies a surcharge \"\n   <em>\n    per user\n   </em>\n   upon conviction, and not per conviction of that user.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
