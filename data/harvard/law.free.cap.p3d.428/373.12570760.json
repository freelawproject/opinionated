Singh sued (1) the buyer at the trustee's sale, Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), (2) the trustee, Quality Loan Service Corporation of Washington (Quality), and (3) the beneficiary of the deed of trust, Nationstar Mortgage, LLC (Nationstar). He alleged that the defendants violated the Washington's \"Deed of Trust Act\" (DTA), chapter 61.24 RCW, and the Consumer Protection Act (CPA), chapter 19.86 RCW. Singh appeals the trial court's decision granting the defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In 2007, Singh purchased a home and property at 4925 S. 181st Place, in Sea-Tac. In 2010, Singh borrowed $266,300.00 from Bank of America, N.A., and secured the note with a deed of trust encumbering the property. Bank of America assigned its beneficial interest to Nationstar. After Singh defaulted on the note, on January 7, 2016, Quality recorded a notice of trustee's sale in King County. A sale date was set for May 6, 2016, and Nationstar was identified as the beneficiary of the deed of trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Singh filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code on May 5, 2016-the day before the property was scheduled to be sold. The next day, Quality continued the trustee's sale to June 3, 2016. On May 25, 2016, Singh's bankruptcy petition was dismissed. On June 2, Quality continued the trustee's sale a second time to July 1, 2016. The sale went forward on July 1, 2016, and Fannie Mae was the successful bidder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 After the trustee's sale, Singh sued Fannie Mae, Quality, and Nationstar. He alleged that the defendants violated the DTA and the CPA. Fannie Mae and Nationstar moved to dismiss Singh's complaint under CR 12(b)(6) and submitted additional documents in support of their motion. Quality also moved to dismiss Singh's complaint and submitted additional documents in support of its motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The court denied Singh's motion for summary judgment and granted the defendants' motions to dismiss. Singh appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Fannie Mae, Nationstar, and Quality filed their motion to dismiss under CR 12(b)(6).

We disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    \u00b6 10 Singh is correct that RCW 61.24.130(4) provides that, where a sale has been stayed by a bankruptcy petition, upon dismissal of the petition, if the trustee chooses to set a new sale date, the new sale must be at least 45 days after the bankruptcy dismissal:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    If a trustee's sale has been stayed as a result of the filing of a petition in federal bankruptcy court and an order is entered in federal bankruptcy court granting relief from the stay or closing or dismissing the case, or discharging the debtor with the effect of removing the stay,\n    <em>\n     the trustee may set a new sale date which shall not be less than forty-five days after the date of the bankruptcy court's order\n    </em>\n    .\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    RCW 61.24.130(4) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    \u00b6 11 But, RCW 61.24.130(4) does not apply where a previously noticed sale has been properly continued. RCW 61.24.130(5) provides that RCW 61.24.130(3) is \"permissive only and do[es] not prohibit the trustee from proceeding with a trustee's sale following termination of any injunction or sale on any date to which such sale has been properly continued in accordance with RCW 61.24.040(6).\" Under RCW 61.24.040(6), a trustee is allowed to continue a previously noticed sale for a period not exceeding 120 days. Because Quality initially recorded a notice of sale set for May 6, 2016, and then continued that sale to June 3, 2016, and then July 1, 2016, the sale date complied with RCW 61.24.040(6) and thus the 45-day period for setting a new sale in RCW 61.24.130(4) was not applicable. Although the sale occurred 37 days after Singh's bankruptcy petition was dismissed, it did not violate RCW 61.24.130(4).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <em>\n     Continuance\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    \u00b6 12 Singh also argues that Quality's sale continuance violated the automatic stay. We disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    \u00b6 13 When a bankruptcy petitioner files a petition for bankruptcy, the petitioner's property becomes the property of the bankruptcy estate.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).

The\n    <em>\n     Roach\n    </em>\n    court reasoned that because the bank maintained the status quo and did not harass, interfere with, or gain any advantage over Roach by postponing the sale, the postponement notice did not violate the automatic stay.\n    <em>\n     Roach\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"390808,6558355\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/660/1316/\">\n     660 F.2d at 1318-19\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    \u00b6 15 Here, Quality did not violate the automatic stay by mailing Singh a notice of postponement and postponing the trustee's sale to June 3, 2016.
