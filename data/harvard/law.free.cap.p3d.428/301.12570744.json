On appeal, Defendant maintains that the district court improperly excluded expert opinion testimony related to his ability to form deliberate intent and as a result, his conviction for second-degree murder should be reversed and remanded for a new trial. We conclude that the district court erred in excluding the expert testimony, but that such error was harmless. We therefore affirm Defendant's second-degree murder conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {2} Jeannie \"Anna\" Sandoval was raised by George Ortiz (Victim), her adoptive mother's boyfriend. In 2012, Sandoval and her\n   boyfriend, Defendant, were living with Victim. According to Sandoval's testimony at trial, Victim was often angry and would fight with her. The tension between Sandoval and Victim would escalate when they were drinking alcohol, and although the anger was mostly verbal, Victim had previously pushed her, pulled her hair, and slapped her a few times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {3} On October 29, 2012, Victim, Sandoval, and Defendant were alone in Victim's apartment. Defendant was reading to Sandoval, and all three were drinking alcohol. Sandoval starting arguing with Victim and the argument escalated until Victim pushed Sandoval and hit her in the face. Defendant became upset and stopped reading. Between one and ten minutes later, Defendant went to Victim and they began to struggle. Sandoval testified that Victim and Defendant \"tussled\" and fell into the hallway, and that Victim's recliner \"ended up going with them.\" Defendant restrained Victim with a hand and arm across his neck and chest area. Sandoval ran to her room. She testified that Victim \"hit pretty hard when he landed[,]\" and that she did not see Defendant hit Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {4} Defendant called to Sandoval, and when she came out of her room, there was blood on the floor. Sandoval believed Victim was dead. He was motionless, his eyes were open, and he was not breathing. Defendant tried to calm Sandoval down and told her they \"had to get rid of the evidence and the body.\" Defendant went to the kitchen, returned with a bottle of cooking oil, and handed it to Sandoval. She took the bottle and dumped the oil around Victim's body. Sandoval saw Defendant light a piece of paper with a lighter but did not see him set fire to Victim's body. Sandoval took Victim's car keys and left with Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {5} Rachel Piatt, Sandoval's cousin, testified that Sandoval and Defendant came to her home. According to Rachel, Sandoval and Defendant were intoxicated and did not \"seem themselves.\" Rachel testified that Sandoval told her, \"My dad's dead.\" Rachel asked if Sandoval was sure, and Sandoval responded, \"Yes, he's dead.\" Rachel asked how she knew and she testified that Sandoval said, \"Because [we] burned him.\" The next day, after going to Victim's apartment and looking inside, Rachel called 911. Sandoval and Defendant were taken into custody later that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {6} An autopsy concluded that the cause of Victim's death was \"homicidal violence\" and \"thermal injuries,\" and the manner of death was \"homicide.\" Consequently, Defendant was charged\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   with first-degree murder, conspiracy, tampering, and unlawful taking of a motor vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {7} As the case proceeded toward trial, Defendant filed a motion in limine that requested either judicial notice of the admissibility of proposed expert testimony with respect to the results of a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. James Walker or a hearing on the admissibility of the expert testimony. Specifically, Defendant's motion explained that his proposed experts would testify that he had \"the low[-]activity [monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) ] gene\" and that such condition is \"statistically associated with the occurrence of maladaptive, or violent, behavior in individuals who have experienced maltreatment in childhood.\" This expert testimony, Defendant asserted, would \"serve as almost the entire basis of [his] defense in his capital trial on charges of first-degree murder, among others.\" Soon thereafter, Defendant filed a \"[n]otice of [i]ncapacity to [f]orm [s]pecific [i]ntent\" indicating that he intended to present expert testimony about whether he was capable of forming the specific intent for the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {8} In turn, the State filed a motion in limine to exclude Defendant's proposed expert testimony pursuant to Rule 11-702 NMRA,\n   <em>\n    Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993), and\n   <em>\n    State v. Alberico\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1993-NMSC-047\">\n    1993-NMSC-047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"727672\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/116/156/\">\n    116 N.M. 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"727672\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/116/156/\">\n    861 P.2d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State argued that the evidence was not reliable, not relevant, and so complicated it would confuse and mislead the jury. While the State did not contest the experts' qualifications, it maintained that current literature does not establish a \"direct[ ] link[ ]\" between\n   a low-activity MAOA variant and increased violent behavior. The State additionally argued that the studies had not been reliably reproduced, the \"maltreatment\" factor was not sufficiently identifiable, and Defendant's reports of childhood maltreatment were suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The January 29, 2015\n    <em>\n     Daubert/Alberico\n    </em>\n    Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {9} The district court held a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alberico\n   </em>\n   hearing on January 29, 2015. At the hearing, Dr. Adrian Raine testified that approximately 50 percent of variations in human antisocial and aggressive behavior are due to genetic influences and 50 percent to environment. A wide array of biological risk factors are associated with increased violent behaviors, including poor frontal brain functioning, birth complications, poor nutrition, low resting heart rate, and low IQ. Dr. Raine testified that the scientific research demonstrates that individuals with a genotype that confers low levels of MAOA, combined with a history of child abuse, are more likely to be antisocial and aggressive in adulthood. This research includes several studies that were attached to Defendant's motion in limine, including a study titled Avshalom Caspi, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Role of Genotype in the Cycle of Violence in Maltreated Children\n   </em>\n   , Science, Aug. 2, 2002, 297 at 851. The\n   <em>\n    Caspi\n   </em>\n   study refers to connections between the low-activity MAOA gene and aggressive and antisocial behaviors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {10} According to Dr. Raine, 30 percent of humans have a low-functioning MAOA gene. Dr. Raine testified that this relationship between low-activity MAOA and a history of child abuse has been validated, scientists in the field concur that this is a replicable finding, and the relationship has statistical significance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {11} Dr. Raine further explained that the low-activity MAOA condition \"can\" also contribute to poor impulse control and \"doing things without thinking about them ahead of time.\" He concluded that the gene-environment interaction produces reliable conclusions and also noted that \"a number of people think it's especially with respect to impulsive behavior.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {12} Dr. Walker, a forensic neuropsychologist, also testified at the hearing. Dr. Walker performed a forensic neuropsychological evaluation of Defendant in order to identify any relevant neuropsychological information. As part of the evaluation, Dr. Walker reviewed police reports, educational records, witness statements, autopsy reports, and crime scene reports. He also interviewed Defendant, administered neuropsychological tests, and made behavioral observations. According to Dr. Walker, Defendant described having a \"pretty horrific childhood.\" Defendant demonstrated a low-average IQ, no signs of brain injury, and adequate problem-solving skills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {13} In the course of his evaluation, Dr. Walker requested that Dr. David Lightfoot perform genotyping on Defendant to determine whether he had a low- or high-activity MAOA gene. Dr. Walker testified that the results of Dr. Lightfoot's testing demonstrated that Defendant exhibited \"extremely low function of the gene,\" which would make him \"particularly more likely than the average person to do violent things.\" When the district court asked what Dr. Walker's opinion would be at trial, he stated, \"the fact that [Defendant] has a history of childhood abuse [and] a low MAOA activity gene [that] made him exceptionally predisposed to committing violent behavior.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {14} On cross-examination, Dr. Walker confirmed that he is not a medical doctor or a molecular biologist, he does not do genetics research or genotyping on his own, and he does not conduct independent research on the issue. Dr. Walker also testified that even if Defendant were prone to violence because of the low-activity MAOA gene, Defendant could still have had sufficient presence of mind to know what he was doing. According to Dr. Walker, it was possible that Defendant could have intended to take Victim's life and such intent would have been \"perfectly consistent\" with the low-activity MAOA variant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {15} At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court determined that Dr. Walker's opinion that Defendant \"has a history of child abuse [and] a low MAOA activity gene [that] made him exceptionally predisposed to committing violent behavior\" sufficiently satisfied\n   the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alberico\n   </em>\n   factors. Nevertheless, the district court noted that Dr. Walker could not testify about Dr. Lightfoot's genetic testing and did not testify that Dr. Lightfoot's report meant that Defendant had the low MAOA variant. Because no witness interpreted the genetic study to show that Defendant actually had the low MAOA variant, the district court could not determine whether Dr. Walker's conclusions were supported. And as a result, the district court found that Dr. Walker's testimony would not assist the trier of fact and excluded the testimony under Rule 11-702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Reconsider\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {16} Defendant filed a motion to reconsider and provided additional affidavit evidence from Drs. Bernet, Lightfoot, Walker, and Raine. All of the doctors characterized Defendant's MAOA gene as \"low activity.\" Dr. Walker's affidavit stated that Dr. Lightfoot's conclusion with respect to Defendant's low-activity MAOA gene\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   formed a necessary basis for [Dr. Walker's] further opinion that, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that [Defendant], due to his genetic characteristics and childhood maltreatment, is predisposed to acts of impulsive violence and is substantially more likely to engage in acts of impulsive violence than the ordinary person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The district court subsequently entered an order on the pleadings, again denying Defendant's motion to admit the testimony of Dr. Walker. The district court ruled that the\n   <em>\n    Daubert-Alberico\n   </em>\n   test was satisfied for studies related to persons with a low-functioning MAOA gene and a history of child abuse, who are predisposed or inclined toward \"antisocial and aggressive behaviors,\" including violent acts. However, the district court viewed Dr. Walker's affidavit as a change in his opinion from a conclusion that Defendant was predisposed to \"violent behavior\" to a later conclusion that he was prone to \"impulsive violence.\" The district court considered Dr. Walker's new opinion to be inconsistent with the prior studies on low-activity MAOA, including the\n   <em>\n    Caspi\n   </em>\n   study, which referred to violent, rather than impulsive, actions. The district court attached to its order a table from a meta-study submitted by Defendant (compiling and analyzing twenty-seven studies) that listed \"antisocial behaviors\" associated with low-activity MAOA. That list of antisocial behaviors did not include impulsivity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {17} The district court determined that Dr. Walker's opinion with respect to impulsivity exceeded the district court's understanding of the scientific literature as presented by both sides. As a result, the district court was not satisfied that Defendant demonstrated that Dr. Walker's opinion related to impulsivity had been tested, subjected to peer review or publication, had potential for error, or was grounded in scientific principles. Consequently, the district court concluded that Dr. Walker's opinion was a \"misstatement of the results of the studies [he] relie[d] upon for his opinion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {18} The district court also determined that Dr. Walker's testimony would not assist the jury with deciding the issue of deliberate intent. That is, the district court reasoned that any predisposition or inclination toward antisocial or aggressive behavior on Defendant's part would not explain whether Defendant deliberated prior to engaging with Victim or whether Defendant acted impulsively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Trial and Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {19} At trial, the district court instructed the jury on first-degree murder, which required the jury to find that Defendant killed Victim \"with the deliberate intention to take\" his life. The jury was also instructed on second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter. The jury ultimately found Defendant guilty of second-degree murder, tampering with evidence, and the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle. Defendant appeals his conviction for second-degree murder and argues that the district court erred in refusing to admit the expert testimony about the low-activity MAOA gene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {20} Defendant argues on appeal that the district court improperly assessed the credibility of his proposed experts, the expert testimony would have provided \"an important framework\" for Defendant's actions, and\n   as a result of the exclusion of Dr. Walker's testimony, Defendant was denied \"a likely defense.\" The State maintains that the proposed expert testimony did not comport with the underlying studies and science related to the low-activity MAOA expression. Further, the State asserts that a genetic predisposition toward impulsivity or aggression is not a defense to second-degree murder-the crime for which the jury convicted Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Admission of Expert Opinion Testimony under Rule 11-702\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {21} Rule 11-702 governs the admissibility of expert testimony and permits a\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education [to] testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Thus, for evidence to be admissible under Rule 11-702, the following prerequisites must be met: \"(1) [the] experts must be qualified; (2) their testimony must assist the trier of fact; and (3) their testimony must be limited to the area of scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge in which they are qualified.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

No party challenges this finding on appeal, and we therefore do not address whether the witnesses were properly qualified as experts or whether the science underlying the proposed expert testimony actually satisfies the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alberico\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The District Court Abused its Discretion in Concluding That the Proffered Expert Opinion Testimony Failed to Satisfy the Rule 11-702 Requirement That the Opinion Assist the Trier of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {25} Two of the Rule 11-702 prerequisites having been satisfied, this appeal turns primarily on whether the proffered expert opinion testimony satisfied the remaining Rule 11-702 prerequisite that the opinion assist the trier of fact. The district court determined that the opinion testimony would not assist the trier of fact in this case for two reasons: (1) the expert opinion testimony as to Defendant's predisposition toward impulsive violence is unsupported by the scientific studies presented to the district court; and (2) the expert opinion testimony with respect to Defendant's predisposition toward aggression, antisocial behavior, and violence is not relevant to the question of whether he deliberately intended to kill Victim. For the reasons described below, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the opinion testimony regarding Defendant's impulsivity, which would have been relevant to the question of deliberate intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {26} First of all, we observe that the district court was not satisfied that Dr. Walker's affidavit testimony about Defendant's impulsivity was based on reliable science. That is, the district court reviewed the testimony, affidavits, and the journal articles submitted by both parties and concluded that Dr. Walker's opinion with respect to the correlation between low-functioning MAOA and impulsive behavior was not supported by the research that it had determined to be valid and reliable. In particular, the district court pointed out that neither the\n   <em>\n    Caspi\n   </em>\n   study nor the meta-study referenced impulsive violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {27} On appeal, Defendant contends that the scientific evidence met the\n   <em>\n    Daubert-Alberico\n   </em>\n   factors and argues that the district court \"excluded the evidence based on a credibility assessment.\" We note that it does not appear that the district court focused on the fact that Dr. Walker altered his opinion from \"exceptionally predisposed to violent acts\" to \"substantially more likely to engage in acts of impulsive violence.\" Rather, the district court appears to have focused on the failure of Defendant's experts to establish that the correlation explained in the literature between low-activity MAOA, childhood maltreatment, and predisposition to violent acts also extended to impulsive behaviors or impulsive violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {28} In essence, the district court determined that there was an analytical gap between the reliable scientific knowledge presented, including the\n   <em>\n    Caspi\n   </em>\n   study and the meta-study, and Dr. Walker's affidavit testimony that Defendant is \"predisposed to acts of impulsive violence and is substantially more likely to engage in acts of impulsive violence than the ordinary person.\" While this line of reasoning makes some sense conceptually, our Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    Acosta v.
