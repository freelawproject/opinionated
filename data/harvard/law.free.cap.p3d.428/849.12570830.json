The Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, sentenced Hamilton to 100 years imprisonment with 75 years suspended and 25 years of parole ineligibility on each count. Hamilton appeals, and we address the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Did the District Court err when it issued a written judgment that conflicted with its oral pronouncement of the sentence?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part. On remand, we instruct the District Court to correct its written judgment to reflect that Hamilton's sentences are to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 On January 2, 2014, Hamilton pleaded not guilty to charges of incest against his daughter in violation of \u00a7 45-5-507, MCA. That day, the District Court signed an order scheduling an omnibus hearing for February 19, 2014, and notifying Hamilton that \"[p]re-trial motions not noticed at the omnibus hearing will be allowed only for good cause and reasonable diligence shown.\" When the District Court held Hamilton's omnibus hearing the following month, Hamilton listed the motions he planned to file. Although he reserved the right to file a general motion \"to dismiss,\" he did not state that he planned to challenge the constitutionality of Montana's statute defining \"sexual contact.\" In March 2014, the State filed an Amended Information charging Hamilton with two counts of sexual intercourse without consent and two counts of incest. The District Court arraigned Hamilton on the Amended Information on April 24, 2014. Between his arraignment and the first day of trial on October 6, 2014, Hamilton filed numerous motions with the District Court in anticipation of trial, but none of them challenged the constitutionality of Montana's statute defining \"sexual contact.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Before trial, when Hamilton and the State settled jury instructions, Hamilton did not object to the District Court's instruction on the definition of \"sexual contact,\" which was identical to the definition found in \u00a7 45-2-101(67), MCA. Moreover, Hamilton did not argue that the statutory definition of \"sexual contact\" was unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Beginning October 6, 2014, the District Court held a three-day jury trial. Late in the evening on the final day of trial, the jury informed the District Court that it could not reach a consensus on two of Hamilton's charges. The District Court then gave the jury a\n   <em>\n    Norquay\n   </em>\n   instruction-an instruction given to deadlocked juries that we adopted in\n   <em>\n    State v. Norquay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3745098\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/359/257/\">\n    2011 MT 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3745098\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/359/257/\">\n    359 Mont. 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3745098\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/359/257/\">\n    248 P.3d 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After further deliberation, the jury found Hamilton guilty on both counts of incest and not guilty on both counts of sexual intercourse\n   without consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 On October 10, 2014, a juror contacted Hamilton's defense counsel. She told him that in retrospect, she believed the jury instruction defining \"sexual contact\" was misleading. Based on the juror's statements, Hamilton filed a motion to dismiss on November 14, 2014, arguing for the first time that the definition of \"sexual contact\" found in \u00a7 45-2-101(67)(a), MCA, was unconstitutionally vague. The State responded to Hamilton's motion to dismiss by arguing that it was time-barred and that the definition of \"sexual contact\" was constitutional. The State also objected to allowing Hamilton to call a juror to testify at a hearing on the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 The District Court conducted a hearing to rule on Hamilton's motion to dismiss in March 2015. Over the State's continued objections, the District Court heard testimony from Hamilton's former juror. Ultimately, the District Court denied Hamilton's motion to dismiss. It found that Hamilton's motion was untimely and that there were no deficiencies in the jury instructions based on the juror's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 After denying Hamilton's motion to dismiss, the District Court immediately moved on to his sentencing hearing. During Hamilton's sentencing hearing, the State called Probation and Parole Officer Tim Hides, and Hamilton called Dr. Michael Scolatti, who had performed a psychosexual evaluation of Hamilton. The District Court also allowed Hamilton's victim to give a statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 At the time of Hamilton's offense, \u00a7 45-5-507(5)(a), MCA (2009 and 2011), set a mandatory minimum sentence of 100 years imprisonment with 25 years of parole ineligibility for the crime of incest when the victim was 12 years of age or younger and the offender was 18 years of age or older. The statute allowed for an exception to the mandatory minimum through \u00a7 46-6-222(6), MCA (2009 and 2011), if a district court determined, based on a psychosexual evaluation of the defendant, that an alternative sentence afforded a better opportunity for the defendant's rehabilitation and \"for the ultimate protection of the victim and society....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 During Hamilton's sentencing hearing, both parties argued extensively about whether the above exception applied. After considering the testimony and arguments, the District Court found that the exception was inapplicable and sentenced Hamilton:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I'm going to give you the 100 years for both counts. I'm going to suspend 75 years of each of the counts and make you ineligible for parole for the 25 years on the Count III because that's what the legislature said. I don't quite see the exception.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 At the end of the hearing, the District Court asked both parties whether they had any questions. Hamilton asked for clarification on whether his sentences would run consecutively or concurrently. The District Court stated they would run concurrently. Hamilton raised no other issues at the time, and the sentencing hearing concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 On March 15, 2015, the District Court issued its judgment of conviction and sentencing order. The sentencing order did not restate the District Court's prior oral pronouncement that Hamilton's sentences would run concurrently. The order also omitted any reasoning for why the District Court declined to apply the exception from \u00a7 46-6-222(6), MCA (2009 and 2011), to Hamilton's mandatory minimum sentence, as required by \u00a7 46-6-223, MCA. After receiving the order, Hamilton raised no further issues with the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law which we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

When he objected to his jury instructions under the same theories, his objections were claims of error affecting his constitutional rights that must have been timely made during trial.

Second, Hamilton's vague-as-applied objection would have required the District Court\n   to: (1) determine whether the statute provides constitutionally adequate notice by examining the statute in light of the conduct with which Hamilton was charged in order to ascertain whether he could have reasonably understood that his conduct was proscribed; and (2) determine whether the statute provides law enforcement with sufficient guidelines to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement regarding Hamilton's conduct.

Instead, the analysis is a question of law that may be resolved before trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Watters\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 17-18 (taking supervisory control over a case involving a vague-as-applied constitutional challenge because the challenge involved \"purely legal questions\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b623 Hamilton waived his statutory vagueness objections because they presented questions of law that were \"capable of determination without trial of the general issue.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 46-13-101, MCA. Hamilton likewise failed to make a timely statutory vagueness objection to the jury instruction defining \"sexual contact\" when he raised the issue for the first time in his postconviction motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 46-20-104. We would, however, like to clarify these issues: although the basis for Hamilton's statutory vagueness objection was apparent before his omnibus hearing, his failure to raise the issue there did not necessarily preclude him from objecting to his jury instructions on the same grounds later. A jury instruction is clearly not a \"defense, objection, or request capable of determination without trial of the general issue.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 46-13-101, MCA. Our holding today does not foreclose the possibility of raising a statutory vagueness objection to jury instructions when a court adopts final instructions, but neither does it prevent a court from determining that the underlying arguments behind the objection are untimely. Nevertheless, Hamilton had already waived each of these objections when he raised them for the first time in his postconviction motion to dismiss. Therefore, under the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 46-13-101 and 46-20-104, MCA, each of the objections Hamilton raised for the first time in his motion to dismiss were untimely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Griffing\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12. We conclude that Hamilton waived them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b624 In his reply brief, Hamilton also asserts that, although the State objected to the timeliness of his motion to dismiss, when the District Court nonetheless held an evidentiary hearing prior to sentencing, it was \"thereby rejecting the State's procedural arguments.\" Hamilton asserts that the District Court impliedly overruled the State's timeliness argument when it considered his post-trial motions and made a record for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b625 We have never held that a district court effectively grants relief to a party for a claim waived pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-101, MCA, by holding an evidentiary hearing about the waived claim. Although a district court may, for cause shown, grant such relief, holding an evidentiary hearing does not force its hand: \"[A] district court retains the authority to control the progress of the case, and may, within its discretion, grant or deny the requested relief, as it deems appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Furthermore, a district court may, in its discretion, determine that a hearing is necessary to establish whether cause for granting relief exists. Section 46-13-101(3), MCA. If the district court finds none, it may hold that a motion is time-barred under \u00a7 46-13-101(1), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b626 The District Court held a hearing on Hamilton's motion to dismiss\n   before sentencing. After allowing one of the jurors from Hamilton's trial to testify, the District Court heard an oral argument from Hamilton, and the State deferred to its brief on the issue. Ultimately, the District Court denied Hamilton's motion for two reasons. First, the District Court did not find that the juror's testimony indicated a deficiency with the definition of \"sexual contact\" in the jury instructions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   I think it was more prompted by the fact that [the juror] realized the penalty was more severe than she thought it was at the time she made the decision. I think her hindsight, you know, that she doesn't like the verdict isn't a basis for setting aside the verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, the District Court declined to grant relief to Hamilton for waiving his statutory vagueness argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   In addition, we have the time limitation, and I recognize I could waive that. But I think your brief said you learned about it October 10th, but you didn't file your motion until November 18th, and I recognize you guys are overworked and behind also.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b627 We find nothing in the record that indicates the District Court granted Hamilton relief for failing to timely raise his statutory vagueness or jury instruction objections. Quite the opposite, the motion's tardiness was one of the reasons the District Court gave for denying it. By holding the hearing, the District Court acted within its \"authority to control the progress of the case\" and \"within its discretion\" to \"grant or deny the requested relief, as it deem[ed] appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    VonBergen\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b628 Finally, Hamilton urges us to find that his post-trial jury instruction objection is reviewable on appeal because it was made \"during trial\" as we defined the term in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, we remanded the case to the district court with specific instructions to enter findings of fact to support its conclusion that \u00a7 46-18-222(4), MCA, did not apply to Sprinkle's case.\n   <em>\n    Sprinkle\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b640 Mere months after\n   <em>\n    Sprinkle\n   </em>\n   , we reviewed the requirements of \u00a7 46-18-223, MCA, once again in\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   . Tucker pleaded guilty to attempted aggravated assault, which carried an additional minimum sentence of two years imprisonment because Tucker had used a\n   dangerous weapon-a knife-while carrying out the offense.\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 4-5 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 46-18-221(1), MCA. Tucker asked the district court to apply a mandatory minimum sentence exception under \u00a7 46-18-222(4), MCA, which provided for an exception where \"the offender ... was acting under unusual and substantial duress\" at the time of the offense.\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6. During Tucker's sentencing hearing, the district court weighed the evidence regarding Tucker's mental state and found that he was not acting under unusual and substantial duress at the time of his offense. It therefore declined to apply the exception.\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7. Tucker never objected to the district court's findings during his sentencing hearing, and he never objected after the hearing when the district court failed to issue findings of fact in its written judgment.\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8. On appeal, we concluded that Tucker had failed to preserve the issue: \"We refuse to remand for resentencing when a defendant failed to bring the allegations of sentencing errors to the district court's attention in a timely fashion.\"\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15 (internal citations omitted). We also distinguished\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   from\n   <em>\n    Sprinkle\n   </em>\n   , finding that unlike the record in\n   <em>\n    Sprinkle\n   </em>\n   , the record in\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   provided us with the district court's factual basis for refusing to apply a mandatory minimum sentence exception.\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b641 Hamilton's case is factually similar to\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   . Due to Hamilton's and his victim's ages at the time of his offenses, Hamilton's conviction of incest carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 100 years imprisonment. Section 45-5-507(5)(a), MCA (2009 and 2011). Hamilton asked the District Court to find that an exception to the mandatory minimum sentence applied through \u00a7 46-18-222(6), MCA. Specifically, the statute provided for an exception to Hamilton's minimum sentence if\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   the judge determines, based on the findings contained in a psychosexual evaluation report prepared by a qualified sexual offender evaluator ..., that treatment of the offender while incarcerated, while in a residential treatment facility, or while in a local community affords a better opportunity for rehabilitation of the offender and for the ultimate protection of the victim and society....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Section 46-18-222(6), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b642 The District Court reviewed the psychosexual evaluation report and found that an alternative sentence, while it may have provided Hamilton a better opportunity for rehabilitation, did not provide for a better opportunity for the ultimate protection of\n   Hamilton's victim and society. When evaluating Hamilton's proposed sentencing exception, the District Court considered the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report,\n   the Psychosexual Evaluation Report, the facts of the case, a statement from the victim, testimony from Officer Hides and Dr. Scolatti, arguments from the State and the defense, and the relevant sentencing statutes. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Sprinkle\n   </em>\n   , the record clearly shows that the District Court made findings of fact that led to its decision not to apply the mandatory minimum sentence exception to Hamilton's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b643 Hamilton failed to object to whether the District Court's findings were adequate, and he failed to object again after the District Court neglected to reduce its findings to writing in its judgment, waiving both claims. Following similar logic, we make the same conclusion about Hamilton's claim that the District Court \"prejudged\" his sentence-Hamilton waived it when he failed to object below. Therefore, we decline to review his claims for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 31 ;\n   <em>\n    Kotwicki\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22. Instead, we confine our analysis to: (1) whether Hamilton's sentence was illegal or outside the statutory parameters; and (2) whether the District Court's underlying factual findings supporting Hamilton's sentence and its decision not to apply an exception were clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garrymore\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9 ;\n   <em>\n    Shults\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b644 First, Hamilton's sentence clearly fits within the statutory parameters. At the time of Hamilton's offenses, \u00a7 45-5-507(5)(a), MCA (2009 and 2011), provided the following sentence for a conviction of incest:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (5)(a) If the victim was 12 years of age or younger and the offender was 18 years of age or older at the time of the offense, the offender: (i) shall be punished by imprisonment in a state prison for a term of 100 years. The court may not suspend execution or defer imposition of the first 25 years of a sentence of imprisonment imposed under this subsection (5)(a)(i) except as provided in 46-18-222, and during the first 25 years of imprisonment, the offender is not eligible for parole.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Hamilton's and his victims ages are not in dispute. The District Court sentenced Hamilton to 100 years of imprisonment with 75 years suspended and parole ineligibility for the first 25 years for both of his convictions. This sentence is neither illegal nor exceeding the statutory parameters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b645 Second, we review the District Court's factual findings for clear error. While Hamilton waived any objection to the inadequacy of the District Court's factual findings, we must still review those findings to determine if they were clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shults\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 34. We turn first to a statement made by the District Court that Hamilton referred to numerous times in his appellate briefs: \"So when I look at these things, I have to not only protect society, but I have to protect society\n   from you which benefits you also. So as far as I'm concerned, with sex offenders, where the maximum penalty is 100 years, we're going to do 100 years every single time.\" The District Court's statement here, if read alone, would indicate the Court ignored the facts of Hamilton's case when issuing his sentence and deciding whether to apply the mandatory minimum sentence exception. It would indicate that the Court's factual findings were clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Warclub\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 23. In our analysis, however, we decline to read the statement in a vacuum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v. Humphrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3254334\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/346/150/\">\n    2008 MT 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3254334\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/346/150/\">\n    346 Mont. 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3254334\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/346/150/\">\n    194 P.3d 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reading a district court's statements \"in context\" with the record to ascertain their meaning).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b646 Unlike many other sentencing statutes-including other sections of Montana's incest sentencing statute-\u00a7 45-5-507(5)(a), MCA (2011), states a precise sentence for offenses that fall under its purview: \"imprisonment in a state prison for a term of 100 years.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 45-5-507(3), MCA (\"[A] person convicted of incest shall be punished by life imprisonment or by imprisonment in the state prison\n   <em>\n    for a term not to exceed 100 years\n   </em>\n   ....\") (emphasis added); \u00a7 45-5-507(4), MCA (stating that if certain age requirements are met between the offender and victim, or if the offender inflicts bodily injury upon anyone while committing incest, \"the offender shall be punished by life imprisonment or by imprisonment in the state prison\n   <em>\n    for a term of not less than 4 years or more than 100 years\n   </em>\n   ....\") (emphasis added). In\n   other words, while other sentencing statutes provide for a range of penalties, \u00a7 45-5-507(5)(a), MCA (2011), provides the sentencing court with no other options unless it finds that an exception to the minimum statutory sentence applies. The District Court pointed this out during Hamilton's sentencing hearing: \"This is the incest statute, right here is the penalty if the victim is under 12 years of age. It's really different than most penalties, most sex offense penalties. For instance, you know, it doesn't have it up to 100 years, it just says 100 years.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b647 We raise this point to give context to the District Court's statement-without an exception, this statute does, in fact, require the District Court to sentence an offender to \"100 years [of imprisonment] every single time.\" Moreover, the record indicates the District Court weighed the evidence, seriously and substantially considering whether the exception should be applied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   You know, although Dr. Scolatti said the exception applied, it didn't track in my mind. You know, I understand the part about getting the treatment and I understand those things, but I don't know that it's better for society. Although, I had a long talk with myself both before today, because I look at the end of the 25 years,\n   when you get out on parole, whether you will be a better person or not, so when you look at the big, big, big picture, are we doing a better thing for society or not? I just can't quite carry myself to say that that's the appropriate thing to do. You know, there is a balancing act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b648 Therefore, we hold that the District Court's findings of fact supporting Hamilton's sentence and its decision not to apply an exception were not clearly erroneous. While the District Court's statement that \"we're going to do 100 years every single time\" weighs against this conclusion, when reviewing the record in its entirety, the Court's findings of fact were not clearly erroneous. Hamilton's sentence fits within the statutory parameters. Accordingly, we affirm Hamilton's sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b649\n   <em>\n    3.

The State concedes that the oral and written sentences conflict and that remand is necessary to confirm the written judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b651 We take this opportunity, however, to distinguish and explain review of a conflicting written judgment and oral pronouncement from the other sentencing issues in this case which we have determined are waived. Two considerations are involved when we review a conflicting written judgment and oral pronouncement of sentence: (1) whether the defendant was afforded an adequate opportunity to respond to the additional portions of the sentence; and (2) whether the additional portions of the written judgment substantively increase either the defendant's loss of liberty or the defendant's sacrifice of property.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8. We will review these conflicts, even where the defendant never objected to them below, because when a court's written judgment conflicts with its oral pronouncement of a sentence, were the written judgment to control, then the defendant would effectively be \"sentenced\n   <em>\n    in absentia\n   </em>\n   , violating his statutory right to be present....\"\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 33. As such, \"in the event of a conflict between the oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment and commitment, the oral pronouncement controls.\"\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b652 At Hamilton's sentencing hearing, the District Court orally\n   pronounced that Hamilton's sentences would run concurrently. The District Court's written judgment following the sentencing hearing was silent on the matter. Where the judgment is silent, \u00a7 46-18-401, MCA, compels sentences for multiple\n   offenses to run consecutively. Hamilton was never afforded the opportunity to respond to the increased sentence, which was essentially imposed\n   <em>\n    in absentia\n   </em>\n   in violation of his right to be present. The District Court's written and oral judgments conflict and we therefore remand this case to the District Court with instructions to amend its written judgment to indicate the sentences will run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b653 Hamilton's sentences are affirmed, except that we reverse and remand for the District Court to correct the written judgment to reflect the sentences will run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   BETH BAKER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   JIM RICE, J.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
