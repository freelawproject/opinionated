GameStop appeals a superior court order that reversed the Board of Tax Appeals (Board). The superior court ruled that the Department of Revenue had correctly assessed retail sales tax on certain transactions where customers made a trade of video game hardware and software or where a customer purchased store merchandise with store credit earned from a prior trade-in of property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 We hold that (1) video game hardware and video game software are not \"property of like kind\" under RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) and WAC 458-20-247(5), (2) GameStop's records do not properly identify \"separately stated trade-in property\" as required by RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i), and (3) the single transaction requirement of WAC 458-20-247(4) is invalid to the extent it conflicts with RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i). Accordingly, we reverse the Board's decision amending GameStop's retail sales tax assessments and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 GameStop Inc. and SOCOM LLC are wholly-owned affiliates of GameStop Corporation. Through these two affiliates, GameStop operates approximately 82 retail stores in Washington. GameStop is a retailer of new and used video game software, hardware, and accessories, as well as computer software and other merchandise. GameStop offers its customers a trade-in program in which a customer may trade in used merchandise and elect to receive either cash or store credit for the value of the used merchandise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 When a customer chooses to receive store credit, the credit may be used on an immediate purchase of GameStop merchandise, or the value of the traded-in property may be placed on a stored-value card as a credit to be used at a later date. The store credit may be used only for the purchase of new or used GameStop merchandise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 When a customer uses his or her store credit on an immediate purchase of merchandise, GameStop's sales documents identify the specific merchandise the customer traded in. But when a customer uses the store credit at a later date, GameStop's sales documents state only the amount of store credit applied toward the purchase and do not identify the merchandise that had been traded in. Nonetheless, GameStop can determine what specific merchandise was traded in through its computerized business records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Washington imposes retail sales tax on each retail sale of tangible personal property. RCW 82.08.020(1)(a). However, \"separately stated trade-in property of like kind\" is excluded from the calculation of retail sales tax.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 The Department promulgated WAC 458-20-247 (Rule 247) to aid in its enforcement of this retail sales tax exclusion. Rule 247 provides that the delivery of trade-in property and the purchase of other merchandise must \"be components of a single transaction.\" WAC 458-20-247(4). Rule 247 also states that \"property of like kind\" is defined as property within the same generic classification. WAC 458-20-247(5). Rule 247 specifically states that a trade of computer hardware for computer software is not an exchange of property of like kind. WAC 458-20-247(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 GameStop concluded that a number of its trade-in transactions fell within the retail sales tax exclusion in RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i). From 2006 through 2010, GameStop did not charge retail sales tax on transactions where: (1) a customer traded in video game software and used the store credit toward the purchase of video game hardware, (2) a customer traded in video game hardware and used the store credit toward the purchase of video game software, and (3) a customer used store credit from a prior trade-in on a later purchase of merchandise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 In 2012, the Department audited GameStop for the January 2006 through December 2010 tax periods. The Department concluded that GameStop improperly claimed the trade-in exclusion on transactions where a customer traded in video game software and used the store credit toward the purchase of video game hardware (and vice versa), as well as transactions involving the use of store credit from a prior trade-in on a later purchase. The Department assessed GameStop approximately $3,200,000 in additional taxes and interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 GameStop appealed the assessment to the Department's Appeals Division.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department denied GameStop's appeal, and GameStop then appealed to the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11 The Board held an evidentiary hearing. Michael Nichols, GameStop's Treasurer and Senior Vice President of International Finance, testified that when a customer accepted store credit for the value of their traded-in merchandise, the customer could use the store credit toward a future purchase at GameStop. Nichols also testified that video game consoles perform functions, such as playing DVDs and music, as well as streaming content from the Internet. Nichols also stated that video games did not perform similar functions as game consoles. Following\n   the hearing, the Board entered its final decision, which included findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12 The Board decided that the transactions at issue were entitled to the retail sales tax exclusion under RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i), reasoning that video game hardware and video game software were \"property of like kind\" under RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) and Rule 247(5). Clerk's Papers (CP) at 28. It determined that video game hardware and video game software fell within the general classification of \"gaming components\" and that \"[g]aming hardware (consoles and controllers) and gaming software (video games) are interdependent components of an integrated system\" that are bound together in their function and use. CP at 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13 Further, the Board decided that purchases made with store credit that had been earned from a prior trade-in were \"separately stated\" for purposes of RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i). Noting that RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) and Rule 247(4) require the consideration for a trade-in of like kind property be separately stated in the transaction, the Board reasoned that GameStop met this requirement. Because GameStop's sales documents separately identified the new or used merchandise purchased, as well as the store credit derived from the prior trade-in of property, the Board considered GameStop's record system compliant with RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) and Rule 247(4). Finally, the Board concluded that a purchase of merchandise with store credit that was earned in a prior trade-in was part of a single transaction under RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) and Rule 247(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14 The Board ordered that the retail sales taxes assessed to GameStop be amended because the transactions at issue were entitled to the trade-in retail sales tax exclusion under RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i). The Department filed a petition in superior court seeking judicial review of the Board's final decision. The superior court entered an order reversing the Board's order. GameStop appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 15 The Department argues that the Board erred in ordering the Department to amend GameStop's retail sales tax assessments because (1) the Board misapplied the law by concluding that video game hardware and video game software are \"property of like kind\" under RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) and Rule 247(5), (2) the Board misinterpreted the law by concluding that the retail sales tax exclusion prescribed by RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) and Rule 247(4) applies to transactions where a customer purchases store merchandise by redeeming store credit earned from a prior trade-in of used merchandise, and (3) the Board misinterpreted the law by concluding that store credit from a prior trade-in is \"separately stated trade-in property\" under RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because we hold that video game hardware and video game software are not \"property of like kind\" under RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) and Rule 247(5) and that GameStop did not comply with the \"separately stated trade-in property\" requirement of RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i), we reverse the Board's decision amending GameStop's retail sales tax assessments. We disagree with the Department's other arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Thus, we reverse the Board's decision and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   I.

However, the administrative law judge ruled that software and hardware are not property of like kind under Rule 247 because software and hardware do not serve the same purpose nor are they property of the same general class. Determination No. 91-044, at 6. \"Hardware is generally the mechanical and electronic parts of a computer; software (programs) is generally the instructions that command the hardware.\" Determination No. 91-044, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 27 Here, during the Board's evidentiary hearing, Nichols testified that video game consoles perform a number of functions, including playing DVDs and music, as well as streaming Internet content. Nichols also stated that video game software cannot perform those same functions. In its final decision, the Board determined that video game hardware and video game software were \"property of\n   like kind\" under RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) and Rule 247(5) because they fall within the same general classification of \"gaming components.\" The Board reasoned that because video game hardware and video game software are components of an integrated system, they necessarily performed the same function and use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 28 We hold that video game software and video game hardware are not property of like kind because software and hardware do not perform the same function or use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) does not define the term \"property of like kind.\" Rule 247(5) states that property of like kind is tangible personal property with the same generic classification. To determine whether tangible personal property has the same generic classification, we look to the \"nature of the property and its function or use.\" WAC 458-20-247(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 29 Although video game software and video game hardware are employed together, they do not perform the same function or use. Video game hardware contains a computer system that is made up of mechanical and electronic parts and includes a computer processing unit, graphics processing unit, and memory. On the other hand, video game software provides commands to the hardware and directs its operation so that a video game may function. The use of video game hardware does not require the use of video game software.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 30 In addition, video game software performs the discrete function of allowing a video game to play on a console. A console can be used for a number of other independent functions, like Internet streaming. Moreover, video game software and video game hardware are a subcategory of computer software and computer hardware, and Rule 247(5) explicitly provides that computer hardware and computer software do not have the same function and purpose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the legislature has never changed RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) in response to Rule 247(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 31 Because video game software and video game hardware are not within the same generic classification, they are not \"property of like kind.\" Thus, the Board misapplied the law in determining that video game software and video game hardware are property of like kind for purposes of RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) and Rule 247(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   III.

RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"Selling price\" includes \"sales price.\" \"Sales price\" means the total amount of consideration, except separately stated\n   trade-in property of like kind, including cash, credit, property, and services, for which tangible personal property, extended warranties, digital goods, digital codes, digital automated services, or other services or anything else defined as a \"retail sale\" under RCW 82.04.050 are sold, leased, or rented, valued in money, whether received in money or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 34 To determine the plain meaning of RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i), it is helpful to examine the grammatical structure of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bunker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4010275\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/169/571/#p578\">\n    169 Wash.2d at 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=238%20P.3d%20487\">\n    238 P.3d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, \"except separately stated trade-in property of like kind\" is a parenthetical phrase offset by commas. \"A comma serves many functions, but its purpose always is to set a phrase apart from the rest of the sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    E. Gig Harbor Improvement Ass'n v. Pierce Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1195539\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/106/707/#p713\">\n    106 Wash.2d 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 713,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20P.2d%201009\">\n    724 P.2d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). Because this parenthetical phrase is set off by commas, it acts independently, providing an exception to \"the total amount of consideration\" for the sales price. As a result, \"the total amount of consideration\" includes \"cash, credit, property, and services.\" The statute unambiguously identifies what is included in the sales price (cash, credit, property, and services), and thus subject to taxation, and what is not (separately stated trade-in property of like kind).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 35 When a GameStop customer trades in used merchandise and chooses to receive store credit for the value of the used merchandise, the customer may either use the credit immediately or at a later date. When a customer chooses to use his or her store credit on the purchase of store merchandise at a later date, GameStop's sales documents state the amount of store credit previously earned, but not the specific merchandise traded in. The Board determined that purchases made with store credit were separately stated amounts under RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i), even where GameStop's sales documents did not separately identify the property that was traded in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 36 The Board's interpretation of RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) as merely requiring that \"sales documents separately identify the consideration derived from the trade-in property\" is divergent from the plain meaning of the statute. CP at 26. The statute does not state \"except separately stated trade-in\n   <em>\n    value\n   </em>\n   .\" Rather, \"except separately-stated trade in\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   of like kind\" includes only the property traded in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 37 Moreover, the Board's interpretation of RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) defeats the purpose of the separately stated requirement. The parties agree that the \"separately stated\" requirement's purpose is to facilitate the Department's audit of a taxpayer's records. GameStop does not dispute that the sales documents at the time of the sale do not separately state the traded in property. Nonetheless, it argues that it has fulfilled the separately stated requirement because the trade-in property is listed at the time of the trade-in transaction. But if a GameStop customer were to trade in a combination of games and a console for credit and then apply a portion of that credit towards a subsequent purchase of merchandise, GameStop's record system would not be able to attribute the specific credit used to the games or the console traded-in.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 38 Because the traded-in merchandise is not separately stated on the subsequent sales receipts as required by RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i), it is unknown which portions of the credit used were traded in game-for-game or console-for-game. This ambiguity in GameStop's records prevents an accurate accounting of transactions involving store credit. As such, GameStop's record system does not comport with RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   IV. SINGLE TRANSACTION\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 39 The Department also argues that the Board erred in ordering the Department to amend GameStop's retail sales tax assessments because the tax exclusion does not apply because the purchase of merchandise with store credit that was earned in a prior trade-in is not part of a \"single transaction\" under Rule 247(4). GameStop contends that we need not resolve whether there was a single transaction because Rule 247(4)'s single transaction requirement conflicts with RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i). We agree with GameStop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 40 RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) defines the term \"sales price\" as \"the total amount of consideration, except separately stated trade-in property of like kind, including cash, credit, property, and services, for which tangible personal property ... [is] sold.\" Rule 247(4) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Property traded in must be consideration delivered by the buyer to the seller. ... This does not require simultaneous transfers of the property being traded in and the property being purchased, but it does require that the delivery of the trade-in and the purchase be components of a single transaction. Sales documents, executed not later than the date the trade-in property is delivered to the seller, must identify the property purchased and the trade-in property ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 41 By its plain language, RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) excludes \"separately stated trade-in property of like kind\" from the calculation of retail sales tax. RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) does not state when the trade-in property must be delivered or when the purchase of like-kind property must take place. In addition, RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) makes no mention of the transaction requirements for the trade-in. As a result, the plain meaning of RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) is subject only to one interpretation-that a trade-in of personal property is not subject to any timing requirements. Accordingly, RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) is unambiguous insofar as it relates to the timing requirements of the trade-in transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 42 The Department states that Rule 247(4)'s interpretation of RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i) is entitled to considerable deference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rule 247(4) implements and interprets RCW 82.08.010(1)(a)(i), and it requires that a trade-in and subsequent purchase of property be part of a single transaction that takes place on the same day. Although we give great deference to the Department's interpretation of its regulations, a Department cannot enforce regulations that effectively amend a statute.\n   <em>\n    Pierce Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734995\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/144/783/#p836\">\n    144 Wash.
