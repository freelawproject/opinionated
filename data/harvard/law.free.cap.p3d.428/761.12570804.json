We reaffirm that in Hawai'i state courts, the traditional \"notice\" pleading standard governs.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Only the factual and procedural backgrounds relevant to the issues on certiorari are discussed below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Homeowner's Answer and Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In response to Bank of America's complaint seeking foreclosure (\"Complaint\") of Homeowner's property (\"Property\"), Homeowner filed her Answer and Counterclaim on September 28, 2012, denying all of the allegations in the Complaint, except those pertaining to her personal background, her September 24, 2007 execution of a promissory note made payable to Countrywide Bank, FSB (\"Note\"), and the recordation of a mortgage on the Property that secured the Note (\"Mortgage\"). She also asserted the following defenses in her Answer: (1) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, (2) assumption of risk and contributory negligence, (3) fraud, based on Homeowner's reasonable belief that Bank of America was not the real party-in-interest and owner of the Note and Mortgage through any claimed assignment by Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\"MERS\"), and (4) illegality, insofar as Bank of America was not the owner and holder of the Note and Mortgage and therefore not entitled to foreclose on the Mortgage. She also contended that there was no valid interim assignment of the Mortgage to Bank of America and no valid negotiation for value of the Note to Bank of America. She further asserted MERS could not be a lawful beneficiary of the Mortgage if it lacked possession of the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Homeowner also asserted the following defenses in the event the Note and Mortgage had been transferred into a trust and securitized: (1) the claimed assignment of the Note and Mortgage into the trust may have violated the ninety-day closing date; (2) the claimed Mortgage assignment to Bank of America in October 2011 would be void as a violation of the express terms of the trust; (3) the purported assignment by which Bank of America claimed ownership of the Note and Mortgage may violate the trust provisions for the closing-date rule; (4) the purported transfers or assignments of the Mortgage after the closing date of the trust would be void in violation of the express terms of the trust and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20860\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; (5) the purported transfers may violate New York trust law and would therefore be void; (6) the Note\n   may never have been transferred into the trust; (7) MERS was not a lender, banker, or servicer and therefore any transfers by MERS were void; (8) the purported transfers into and out of the trust violated the Internal Revenue Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20860\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (9) the claimed assignments into and out of the trust may have violated the Pooling and Service Agreement (\"PSA\"), together with the Underwriting Agreement for the trust; (10) if there were transfers into a trust under the PSA, the transfers were not performed according to the terms of the trust and were therefore void; (11) the Note and Mortgage may never have been deposited or transferred into the trust; and (12) if the transfers were made into and out of a securitized trust, the signatures may have been by unauthorized persons and therefore void as forgeries, which would render the purported transfers fraudulent and void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Homeowner asserted four counts in the counterclaim filed along with her Answer: (1) wrongful foreclosure; (2) declaratory relief; (3) quiet title; and (4) unfair and deceptive trade acts and practices (sometimes \"UDAP\") under HRS \u00a7 480-1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the first count of her counterclaim, alleging wrongful foreclosure, Homeowner incorporated by reference the defenses in her Answer, and alleged that Bank of America's conduct in commencing the foreclosure action was willful, malicious, and without just cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the second count of her counterclaim, seeking declaratory relief, Homeowner incorporated by reference the allegations in the wrongful foreclosure count. She asserted she was entitled to declaratory relief pursuant to HRS \u00a7 632-1 that (1) Bank of America was not the owner of the Mortgage and Note; (2) Bank of America was not entitled to foreclose on the Mortgage and Note; and (3) MERS was not the mortgagee on the Mortgage but rather was a \"sham and fraud\" that \"acted only as a strawman.\" She also requested that the court determine the identity of the mortgagee and award her costs and attorney's fees pursuant to HRS \u00a7 607-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the third count of her counterclaim, requesting the quieting of her title, Homeowner again incorporated by reference the allegations in the wrongful foreclosure count. She asserted she was entitled to have her legal title to the Property quieted against Bank of America's claims pursuant to HRS \u00a7 669-1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and that she was entitled to recover her costs and attorney's fees pursuant to HRS \u00a7 607-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, in the fourth count of her counterclaim, alleging unfair and deceptive trade acts and practices, Homeowner again incorporated by reference the allegations in the wrongful foreclosure count. She alleged she was a consumer with respect to the Mortgage and Note, and she asserted the acts and conduct of Bank of America, its agents and predecessors, and MERS constituted an unfair and deceptive trade practice by \"either or both mortgage lenders, mortgage servicers, mortgage holders, claimants, debt collectors, and/or finance companies.\" Homeowner claimed she paid about $55,593 to Bank of America based on erroneous information and billings, and on the assumption that Bank of America was the rightful owner of the Mortgage. She maintained Bank of America and MERS were therefore subject to liability under HRS \u00a7\u00a7 480-2 and 480-13 for injuries and damages of not less than $1,000, or for treble damages, plus attorney's fees and costs. Additionally, Homeowner asserted she was entitled to injunctive relief to enjoin the unlawful practices of Bank of America, its agents and predecessors, and MERS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Dismiss Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On October 22, 2012, Bank of America filed a Motion to Dismiss Defendant Grisel Reyes-Toledo's Counterclaim (\"Motion to Dismiss Counterclaim\"). As to the wrongful foreclosure count, Bank of America asserted Homeowner did not describe any foreclosure that had actually occurred or what was wrongful about the alleged foreclosure, and that therefore the count should be dismissed. As to the declaratory judgment count, Bank of America alleged the involvement of MERS in loan transactions has been repeatedly approved by this court and that there was no allegation that MERS exceeded its traditionally approved role in Homeowner's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As to the quiet title count, Bank of America alleged that Homeowner failed to state a claim because she did not assert she had fully paid off the underlying obligation or is able to tender the full amount before seeking relief. Finally, Bank of America asserted that although the unfair and deceptive trade acts and practices count incorporated by reference the allegations in the wrongful foreclosure count, Homeowner did not describe the alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices in any detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In her Memorandum in Opposition to Bank of America's Motion to Dismiss Counterclaim, Homeowner argued that all counts of her counterclaim, including the wrongful foreclosure count, were sufficient to survive a HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. She argued if she were to prove the facts alleged in her counterclaim, which incorporated the allegations in her Answer, she would be entitled to relief against Bank of America. Homeowner also asserted that\n   <em>\n    Bain v. Metro Mortgage Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4024205\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/175/83/\">\n    175 Wash.2d 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=285%20P.3d%2034\">\n    285 P.3d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) supports her claim that MERS is merely a registration system and not a holder of the Note. Additionally, Homeowner maintained sufficient facts were pled for both the declaratory judgment and quiet title counts pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Amina v. Bank of New York Mellon\n   </em>\n   , Civil No. 11-00714 JMS/BMK,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203283513\">\n    2012 WL 3283513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Haw. 2012), in which the court held that a borrower need not tender payment or allege that a note and mortgage were satisfied to quiet title against a party who is not a mortgagee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In its Reply Memorandum, Bank of America asserted that if Homeowner believed Bank of America lacked authority to foreclose, then her arguments were defenses, not affirmative claims for relief. Bank of America also asserted that a claim for wrongful foreclosure cannot arise before a foreclosure occurs. Bank of America alleged that to the extent Homeowner's other counts relied upon allegations set forth in the wrongful foreclosure count, they should also be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On February 12, 2013, the circuit court entered an order granting Bank of America's Motion to Dismiss Counterclaim (\"Order Dismissing Counterclaim\"). Homeowner filed a motion for reconsideration contending she had sufficiently pled her \"compulsory\" counterclaim as Bank of America was not the mortgagee, had no right to bring a foreclosure action, and was liable to her for over $160,000 based on her UDAP counterclaim. In the alternative, she moved for entry of final judgment and a HRCP Rule 54(b) certification allowing immediate appeal of the order Dismissing Counterclaim. She also requested a stay pending appeal pursuant to HRCP Rule 62(d) and (h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After Bank of America filed its opposition, on December 31, 2013, the circuit court denied Homeowner's Motion for Reconsideration and Rule 54(b) Certification (\"Order Denying Defendant Grisel Reyes-Toledo's Motion for (1) Reconsideration of the February 12, 2013 Order Dismissing Counterclaim; (2) HRCP Rule 54(b) Certification; and (3) HRCP Rule 62(d) and (h) Stay Pending Appeal Filed on February 22, 2013\") (\"Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

As previously discussed, HRCP Rule 8(a) is devoid of any mention of facts, specificity, or plausibility. Moreover, when the HRCP require a pleading to have specificity, they expressly state so. For example, HRCP Rule 9, titled \"Pleading Special Matters,\" offers examples of when specificity is required; HRCP Rule 9(b), titled \"Fraud, mistake, condition of the mind,\" requires that \"[i]n all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.

Thus, we hold that a mortgagor may bring a wrongful foreclosure claim before a foreclosure decree is entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Therefore, to assert a wrongful foreclosure claim, the foreclosing plaintiff must have failed to establish its standing as required by\n   <em>\n    Reyes-Toledo I\n   </em>\n   and the mortgagor must have suffered an \"injury in fact\" and damages as a result. As explained above, a mortgagor need not wait for a foreclosure decree to assert a wrongful foreclosure claim. If a party with no authority or standing files a foreclosure action, no foreclosure decree would result, yet the mortgagor would have spent time and incurred expenses to defend against such a lawsuit. Allowing a mortgagor to bring a wrongful foreclosure counterclaim without awaiting an actual foreclosure benefits judicial economy and efficiency, as a foreclosure defendant should not have to institute a separate legal action after the pending foreclosure case is decided. Accordingly, a mortgagor should be able to assert a counterclaim for wrongful foreclosure based on the underlying facts of the pending foreclosure case. However, we emphasize this does not mean a mortgagor must assert the wrongful foreclosure claim as a compulsory counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Here, it remains an issue of fact whether Bank of America attempted to foreclose on Homeowner's Property without standing to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reyes-Toledo I\n   </em>\n   , 139 Hawai'i at 371,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314812\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/139/361/\">\n    390 P.3d at 1258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A foreclosing plaintiff's burden to prove entitlement to enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of standing in foreclosure actions as '[s]tanding is concerned with whether the parties have the right to bring suit.' \" (citation omitted) ). As a result of defending against Bank of\n   America's lawsuit, Homeowner alleged she incurred costs and expenses. Thus, the ICA erred when it concluded Homeowner did not yet have a claim for wrongful foreclosure against Bank of America.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   We next address whether Homeowner's wrongful foreclosure count was properly dismissed by the circuit court, which the ICA affirmed applying the incorrect \"plausibility\" pleading standard. By incorporating the defenses in her Answer into her wrongful foreclosure count, Homeowner asserted Bank of America was not the real party-in-interest, owner, holder, or holder in due course of the Note and Mortgage. She also asserted there was \"no valid negotiation for value of [her] promissory note to [Bank of America].\" She argued that, therefore, \"[Bank of America]'s conduct in commencing this case was willful, malicious, without just cause,\" and she was entitled to \"general, special, and punitive damages in an amount to vest this Court with jurisdiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Taking Homeowner's allegations as true, as we must in evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the wrongful foreclosure count within her counterclaim satisfies HRCP Rule 8(a) and our traditional notice pleading standard. There is an issue of fact regarding whether Bank of America had standing prior to commencing the lawsuit, and Homeowner has provided notice through her allegations that, if not, Homeowner has been injured, establishing a claim for damages. Thus, Homeowner's wrongful foreclosure count should not have been dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Declaratory Judgment Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Homeowner's declaratory judgment count, which incorporated by reference the allegations set forth in her wrongful foreclosure count, asserted she was entitled to declaratory relief under HRS \u00a7 632-1. On remand, it appears the ICA based its analysis on the\n   <em>\n    Pavsek\n   </em>\n   standard, and seemed to assume as true the assertions with respect to the parties and assignment documents contained in Bank of America's Complaint, as opposed to the Counterclaim filed by Homeowner. Additionally, the ICA focused solely on issues regarding MERS raised in\n   <em>\n    Bain\n   </em>\n   , and disregarded Homeowner's remaining assertions in her declaratory judgment count of her counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   As Homeowner argues, the declaratory judgment count also asserted: (1) Bank of America was not the owner and holder of the Mortgage and Note; (2) Bank of America was not entitled to foreclose on the Mortgage and Note; (3) MERS was not the mortgagee on the Mortgage but rather was a \"sham and fraud\" and MERS \"acted only as a strawman\"; (4) the court should decide who is the mortgagee on the Mortgage and the Note; and (5) Homeowner can recover costs and attorney's fees pursuant to HRS \u00a7 607-14. Applying HRCP Rule 8(a) 's notice pleading standard, Homeowner's declaratory judgment count provided sufficient notice of her claim and should not have been dismissed pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(b)(6). Taking the allegations asserted by Homeowner as true, it does not appear beyond doubt that Homeowner could not prove a set of facts entitling her to relief. Thus, the ICA erred in affirming the circuit court's dismissal of the declaratory judgment count within Homeowner's counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Quiet Title Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Homeowner also incorporated by reference the allegations in her wrongful foreclosure count into her quiet title count. Stating she was the owner of the Property, she sought to quiet title to the Property against Bank of America's adverse claim, asserting Bank of America was not the mortgagee. Accepting Homeowner's allegations as true, she has satisfied HRCP Rule 8(a) 's pleading requirements by asserting that she has a substantial interest in the Property, and that her interest in the Property is greater than Bank of America's.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ka'upulehu Land LLC v.

If Bank of America is indeed not the mortgagee, Homeowner's quiet title\n   count states a claim upon which relief can be granted.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the ICA erred in affirming the circuit court's dismissal of the remaining three counts of Homeowner's counterclaim because the assertions satisfied our traditional notice pleading standard.

In the first appeal, Homeowner appealed this judgment. In a summary disposition order, the ICA affirmed. As noted, on certiorari in\n    <em>\n     Reyes-Toledo I\n    </em>\n    , we held: (1) genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether Bank of America was entitled to enforce the Note at the time it commenced the foreclosure proceedings, precluding summary judgment as to Bank of America's standing to institute the proceedings; (2) the assignment of the Mortgage was insufficient to establish Bank of America's standing to institute foreclosure proceedings; and (3) the foreclosure judgment was a final appealable judgment, and thus the ICA had appellate jurisdiction over the Order Dismissing Counterclaim.
