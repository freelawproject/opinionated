Parejo contends the ISRB abused its discretion and violated his right to due process by relying on the 2011 sexually violent predator evaluation to indefinitely deny parole. After oral argument, the ISRB filed a motion to dismiss the petition as moot because the ISRB granted parole. Although the inability to provide relief to Parejo renders his personal restraint petition technically moot, we address the ISRB's interpretation of RCW 9.95.115 because it is likely to reoccur and to provide guidance. We hold under the plain and unambiguous language of RCW 9.95.115, the ISRB is not prohibited from releasing a person on parole unless the person is subject to civil commitment as a sexually violent predator under chapter 71.09 RCW. Chapter 71.09 RCW governs whether a person is subject to commitment as a sexually violent predator. Contrary to the interpretation of the ISRB, a prefiling forensic psychological evaluation does not mean a person is subject to civil commitment as a sexually violent predator under chapter 71.09 RCW. Because Parejo is no longer under lawful restraint, we deny his personal restraint petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    1978 Conviction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 On March 20, 1978, a jury convicted Manuel Parejo of rape in the first degree while armed with a firearm and kidnapping in the first degree while armed with a firearm.

If you qualify under the law, you will be sent to court for trial. If the court finds you to be a Sexually Violent Predator, you could be sent to a treatment program at a secure state facility.

Dr. Logan concluded 61-year-old Parejo \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     meets\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the criteria for civil commitment as a sexually violent predator as described in RCW 71.09.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    2012 ISRB Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 10 The ISRB held a parole hearing on April 18, 2012. At the beginning of the hearing, an ISRB member states that under RCW 9.95.115, when a forensic psychological evaluation finds a person meets the criteria as a sexually violent predator, the ISRB \"no longer ha[s] the discretion to make a release decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [W]e saw Mr. Parejo back in January of 2011 and the board found him conditionally parolable at that time to a neutral reentry plan[.] We rather expected, I think, that [DOC] would request a forensic psychological examination and that has occurred and was completed back in November by Dr. [Logan].... It's the board's understanding, as we have been advised by our Assistant Attorney General, that when we receive a forensic psychological evaluation that finds that a person is - does meet the criteria, that we no longer have the discretion to make a release decision. ... As a consequence we have previous cases where we found a person conditionally parolable, then changed that decision and found them not parolable based on that forensic and as I say, it's our understanding that the statute takes away any discretion on our part.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 11 The attorney representing Parejo argued the ISRB's interpretation of RCW 9.95.115 was contrary to the language of the statute and the procedures under chapter 71.09 RCW.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [T]he fact that this board has made a decision and then proceeds to say that well, our hands are now tied, when we're going to have to essentially revoke parole ... doesn't even allow an individual like Mr. Parejo a chance to challenge this, whereas in the [chapter] 71.09 [RCW] process, at least you have the crucible of a fact-finding process.... [B]ut here you have a situation where we have to accept that this particular report, which I think is\n   quite frankly, you know, it has no credibility, controls the release of someone who has done everything that the parole board has asked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 12 The ISRB member reiterated the ISRB had no discretion to consider parole after receiving the forensic psychological evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   You're preaching to the choir,... as we've read the statute, it appears to be - it doesn't appear to give the board any discretion once that dertermina- once that forensic psychological has been, that finding has been made by a psychologist. So I don't like it either. Because we would much prefer to have the discretion to decide what weight to place on that information in the way that I think you have argued, in that it's one piece of evidence amongst many, and it does have the effect of precluding an opportunity for a trial to determine, to make that determination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 13 On June 28, 2012, the ISRB issued its Decision. The ISRB reiterates the reasons it previously decided to conditionally parole Parejo:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Parejo had completed all programming available in the prison setting .... In addition, he had been active with the Interaction Transition (IT) group within the prison and had been accepted to live at the IT House, if released. The Board found that these behaviors were strong indicators that Mr. Parejo had been rehabilitated. The Board further noted that Mr. Parejo had saved a substantial sum to assist in his successful transition to the community, had strong community support from his family and had employment waiting for him. These circumstances were sufficient for the Board to find that it was the appropriate time to conditionally parole Mr. Parejo to a Mutual Re-Entry Plan (MRP) and begin the process of transitioning him back to the community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Decision states that after the ISRB concluded Parejo should be released, the ESRC \"ordered a forensic psychological evaluation to determine whether Mr. Parejo met criteria for civil commitment under Chapter 71.09 RCW.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 14 The ISRB cites the requirements of RCW 9.95.009(3) and .100 but rescinds the previous Decision to conditionally parole Parejo based solely on the 2011 forensic psychological evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Little has changed with Mr. Parejo since our last hearing, except that Mr. Parejo has rejoined the Max Benefits group, as the Board had recommended. The primary difference since our last hearing comes from the receipt of Dr. Logan's forensic psychological evaluation, in which Dr. Logan found that Mr. Parejo met the criteria for civil commitment under Chapter 71.09 RCW.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 15 The ISRB found Parejo is not parolable and added 36 months to his minimum term. The ISRB requested the ESRC complete a new forensic psychological evaluation before the next parole hearing.

Dr. Schlosser performed several risk assessment tests. The tests showed \"[m]oderate level of risk with factors that can be managed realistically in the community.\" On June 28, 2013, Dr. Schlosser issued a 14-page evaluation. Dr. Schlosser concluded to a \"reasonable degree of professional certainty\" that Parejo \"does not have a mental abnormality\" and does not meet the criteria for civil commitment as defined by chapter 71.09 RCW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    2013 ISRB Parole Hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 17 The ISRB held a parole hearing on October 1, 2013 and issued a Decision on November 20, 2013.

The Decision states that \"[l]ittle has changed since the Board's last hearing with Mr. Parejo. The Board still has two competing [forensic psychological evaluations].\" The ISRB notes the 2011 forensic psychological evaluation from Dr. Logan showed Parejo meets the sexually violent predator criteria, while the 2013 forensic psychological evaluation from Dr. Schlosser showed Parejo was a moderate risk to reoffend and did not meet the sexually violent predator criteria.

We dismissed the personal restraint petition because Parejo did not meet his burden to show that the ISRB acted willfully and unreasonably or that its decision was arbitrary and capricious.
