The State charged Mr. Curby with strangulation of a household member, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-509\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6-2-509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(i) (LexisNexis 2017). The district court set a jury trial for August 10, 2017 and ordered that all discovery be completed by July 20, 2017. Mr. Curby filed a demand for discovery, requesting the State provide him with \"[a]ny relevant written or recorded statements made by [Mr. Curby]\" and \"[a]ny and all exculpatory evidence for [Mr. Curby] or evidence which aids [Mr. Curby] in the preparation of the defense.\" On July 12, 2017, the district court re-set the jury trial for August 8, 2017, but ordered that all other deadlines in the previous order-including the discovery deadline-remain in full force and effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b64] On July 20, 2017, the discovery deadline, the State provided Mr. Curby with over 1,500 recorded telephone conversations between Mr. Curby and a woman named Serena Jacobson. Those telephone conversations occurred while Mr. Curby was in jail pending trial. Mr. Curby filed a motion to preclude the State from using any of those phone calls in its case. He argued the State should have provided the recordings to him much earlier than it did, and its failure to do so violated its obligations under Wyoming Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1)(A)(i)(1) and\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   . After a hearing, the district court determined the State's disclosure of the telephone calls did not violate its discovery obligation under Rule 16 or its obligations under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b65] The trial began, as scheduled, on August 8, 2017. The State presented testimony of the victim, law enforcement officers, several medical providers, and hospital employees. The State also introduced many exhibits including photographs of the victim and the hospital records associated with treatment of her injuries. It also introduced some of the recorded telephone conversations. At the conclusion of the State's case-in-chief, Mr. Curby's counsel informed the district court that four pages of State's Exhibit 19, which consisted of a medical report by the sexual assault nurse examiner, had not been disclosed to the defense prior to trial. Counsel argued that the State's conduct violated the discovery rules and sought dismissal of the charges with prejudice or a mistrial. The State represented that the four pages in question were inadvertently attached to State's Exhibit 19 and conceded those documents should be excluded from the evidence considered by the jury. The State pointed out the documents were merely cumulative to witness testimony and other reports presented at trial and asserted a more drastic remedy was unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b66] The district court agreed that the documents were cumulative to other evidence presented at trial and, therefore, were not prejudicial. The court determined it would exclude the records and it instructed the jury to disregard those records and any testimony discussing them. With that remedy, the district court concluded the circumstances did not rise to a level necessitating a mistrial or dismissal with prejudice. The jury found Mr.\n   Curby guilty of strangulation of a household member, and the district court sentenced him to not less than three nor more than five years of imprisonment. Mr. Curby filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b67] If the State improperly suppresses exculpatory evidence, that conduct implicates a defendant's constitutional right to due process.\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

While Mr. Curby may have preferred to receive the recordings earlier, this does not result in a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation.

Further, in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   , we held the State did not violate\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   when it disclosed favorable evidence to the defendant on the second and third days of trial.\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 17-18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430718\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/131/348/\">\n    131 P.3d at 353-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b612] Mr. Curby suggests his situation is different from those we have previously considered because it \"is much more labor intensive [to listen to telephone call recordings] than going through physical documents that can be more easily skimmed and prepared.\" He goes on to conclude that, \"[t]herefore, pure availability of evidence is not determinative of a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation.\" Mr. Curby has provided no authority to support his conclusions in this regard. Without support to the contrary, we find no reason to depart from our well-established precedent on this matter. We must conclude the State did not suppress the recordings and, consequently, did not violate\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   when it provided the telephone call recordings to Mr. Curby twenty days before trial commenced. Because Mr. Curby has failed to demonstrate the recordings were suppressed, we need not discuss the other\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b613] Mr. Curby also argues the State violated\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   when it submitted to the jury a four-page medical report authored by the sexual assault nurse examiner as part of State's Exhibit 19 that had not been disclosed to the defense before trial. He does not claim that the district court improperly handled the issue when it removed that report from evidence and instructed the jury to disregard it, nor does he disagree with the district court that the report was cumulative of other evidence. Instead, he asserts that the inadvertent inclusion of this report in an exhibit violated\n   <em>\n    Brady.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b614] Mr. Curby's argument regarding this claim is puzzling. Mr. Curby brought to the district court's attention that the report had not been disclosed but had been entered into evidence. The prosecutor acknowledged the report was admitted in error. The district court struck the report from State's Exhibit 19 and instructed the jury to disregard the report and any testimony associated with the it. We presume the jury followed that instruction.\n   <em>\n    Bruce v.

As discussed above, Mr. Curby must show the State suppressed the evidence, the evidence was favorable to Mr. Curby, and the evidence was material. As with the phone calls, even if the report had not been previously disclosed to Mr. Curby, it was disclosed at trial in time for Mr. Curby's counsel to make use of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430718\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/131/348/\">\n    131 P.3d at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . More significantly, Mr. Curby makes no argument whatsoever that this report was favorable to him. A review of the report in question reveals the information is not favorable or exculpatory to Mr. Curby. In fact, in his brief, Mr. Curby specifically states: \"The evidence was favorable to\n   <em>\n    the State\n   </em>\n   as the report made conclusions to a reasonable degree of medical certainty and was critical as to what [Mr. Curby] had done to the victim.\" Mr. Curby goes on to argue: \"The information contained within the report\n   <em>\n    was material to the guilt of Mr. Curby\n   </em>\n   , as it provided evidence of the crime of strangulation and the harm inflicted during the incident.\" Because this evidence was not favorable to Mr. Curby, it cannot be the subject of a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation.\n   <em>\n    Bagley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205331\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/667/#p675\">\n    473 U.S. at 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205331\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/667/#p675\">\n    105 S.Ct. at 3379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1196 ) (\"The holding in\n   <em>\n    Brady v.

The State did not suppress any evidence from Mr. Curby. Instead, the State disclosed the telephone call recordings twenty days before trial and disclosed the medical report in question at trial. Further, the medical report was not favorable to Mr. Curby, and it was not considered by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b617] Affirmed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
