The Wyoming State Bar was represented by Bar Counsel, Mark W. Gifford. Respondent Stuwert B. Johnson attended and was given the opportunity to make an opening statement, testify on his own behalf and make closing remarks.\n   <sup>\n    1\n   </sup>\n   A quorum of the board was in attendance. Bar Counsel called two witnesses: Respondent and Brandi Robinson, Clerk of the Board of Professional Responsibility. Bar Counsel Exhibits BC-1, BC-2 and BC-3 were received into evidence; Respondent introduced no exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Based upon the exhibits received into evidence, the testimony of the witnesses and with due consideration given to the statements of counsel, the Board FINDS, CONCLUDES and RECOMMENDS as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   1. Respondent was admitted to practice in Wyoming in 1993. He is a resident of Utah, where he was admitted to practice in 1992. Respondent is presently an active member in good\n   standing of the Wyoming State Bar, having filed his annual license fee statement and having paid his annual license fee on December 15, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   2. On February 23, 2016, the Honorable Joseph M. Bean, Second Judicial District Court Judge, Weber County, Utah, issued an Order of Interim Suspension of Respondent. On November 14, 2017, Judge Bean issued an Order Imposing Sanctions that continued Respondent's suspension for an additional 18 months, bringing the total period of suspension to more than 38 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   3. The Utah Order Imposing Sanctions followed a disciplinary hearing held before Judge Bean on August 28, 29, 30 and September 5, 2017. The disciplinary proceeding encompassed numerous complaints that had been filed against Respondent, as a result of which Respondent was found to have committed numerous violations of Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.15, 1.16, 8.1 and 8.4 of the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct. Wyoming's Rules are substantially similar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   4. In total, the Utah court found that Respondent violated 32 counts of the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct, including 10 counts involving criminal conduct or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   5. A true and accurate copy of Judge Bean's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order was received in evidence as Exhibit BC-1. A true and accurate copy of Judge Bean's Order Imposing Sanctions was received in evidence as Exhibit BC-2. A true and accurate copy of the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct was received in evidence as Exhibit BC-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   6. Respondent is the prior recipient of an Order of Public Censure issued by the Wyoming Supreme Court on August 19, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See Board of Professional Responsibility v. Johnson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6857547\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/355/1234/\">\n    355 P.3d 1234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wyo. 2015). Evidence presented at hearing revealed that Respondent\n   had yet to pay the $500.00 administrative fee and costs in the amount of $50.00 ordered by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   7. Prior to his 2016 suspension in Utah, Respondent had an extensive history of professional discipline in that state, including a 2001 public reprimand for violation of Rules 1.3 (diligence), 1.4 (communication), 1.16 (declining or terminating representation), and 8.4 (misconduct); a 2002 suspension (stayed to six months of unsupervised probation) for violation of Rules 1.1 (competence), 1.2 (scope of representation), 1.3 (diligence), 1.4 (communication) and 8.4 (misconduct); a one-year probation in 2008 for violation of Rules 1.15 (failure to maintain a trust account) and 8.4 (misconduct); and a 2014 public reprimand for violation of Rules 1.1 (competence) and 8.1 (failure to respond to disciplinary counsel).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   8. Rule 19(d) of the Wyoming Rules of Disciplinary Procedure requires Bar Counsel to file a formal charge against a member of the Wyoming State Bar upon receiving notice that the attorney has been publicly disciplined in another jurisdiction. Bar Counsel filed a formal charge in the instant proceeding on February 13, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   9. Rule 19(a) provides, \"Except as otherwise provided by these rules, a final adjudication in another jurisdiction of misconduct constituting grounds for discipline of an attorney shall, for purposes of proceedings pursuant to these rules, conclusively establish such misconduct.\" Judge Bean's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order and Order Imposing Sanctions constitute a final adjudication of such misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   10. On March 28, 2018, Respondent filed a Response to the Formal Charge in which he admitted the facts regarding sanctions imposed by the Utah State Bar but urged a lesser sanction in Wyoming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   11. On May 23, 2018, an order was entered in the present reciprocal discipline proceeding granting Bar Counsel's motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the Utah court's findings of misconduct by Respondent. The order held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the final adjudication of the Third Judicial District Court, Salt Lake County, Utah, dated October 18, 2017, shall, for purposes of the present proceeding, conclusively establish Respondent's misconduct, and that the sole purpose of the hearing in this matter will be to develop the record relative to the factors that must be applied to determine the appropriate sanction for Respondent's misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   12. The Board was troubled by the nature and extent of the misconduct that led to Respondent's suspension in Utah, particularly in light of Respondent's prior disciplinary history. Respondent's misconduct ran the gamut from negligent representation to trust account violations to ignoring a subpoena issued by an agency of the Utah state government. His criminal conduct included five DUI arrests in a 10-month period as well as a plea of guilty to a bad check charge relating to his trust account. Such conduct casts grave doubt with respect to Respondent's character and fitness to practice law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   13. The Board found much of the testimony offered by Respondent at the sanction hearing distressing, at best. Respondent's testimony and argument revealed he did not comprehend the seriousness of his misconduct. He made light of his lengthy disciplinary history, characterizing it as not unusual for someone who has practiced law for as long as he has. He testified that a 2014 conviction for issuing a $2,500 bad check from his trust account (a Class A misdemeanor originally charged as a Third-Degree felony) was the result of someone \"hacking\" his trust account. Further questioning revealed he never raised the hacking as a defense and never resolved who or how the \"hacking\" was achieved. Respondent seemed similarly untroubled by his failure to pay the $500 administrative fee and $50 in costs associated with his 2015 public censure, claiming that he thought it had been paid by his assistant. His further testimony was that he had little contact from\n   the State Bar regarding the fee. In Bar Counsel's rebuttal, Board Clerk Brandi Robinson testified about extensive contacts she initiated with Respondent in an attempt to collect the fees; all to no avail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   14. The misconduct committed by Respondent violated duties owed to clients, to the public, and to the legal profession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   15. Respondent's state of mind with respect to such misconduct ranged from negligent to intentional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   16. Respondent's misconduct caused serious or potentially serious injury to his clients, to the public and to the legal profession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   17. The Board considered the aggravating factors under ABA Standard 9.0, finding as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (a) prior disciplinary offenses;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (b) dishonest motive;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (c) a pattern of misconduct;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (d) multiple offenses;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (e) bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (f) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (g) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (h) vulnerability of the victim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (i) substantial experience in the practice of law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (j) indifference in making restitution; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (k) illegal conduct, including that involving the use of alcohol.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   18. The Board considered mitigating factors under ABA Standard 9.0; finding as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (a) personal and emotional problems.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   19. The Board considered Respondent's alcoholism and rehabilitation efforts as a potential mitigating factor. Evidence revealed that Respondent is affected by a dependency on alcohol. The Board does not find the remaining factors necessary to consider his alcoholism as a mitigating factor under ABA Standard 9.32 (Factors Which May Be Considered in Mitigation) that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (2) the chemical dependency or mental disability caused the misconduct;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (3) the Respondent's recovery from the chemical dependency or mental disability is demonstrated by a meaningful and sustained period of successful rehabilitation; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (4) the recovery arrested misconduct and recurrence of that misconduct is unlikely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Accordingly, the Board does not find ABA Standard 9.32(i) is meant and does not consider it a mitigating factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   20. The Board also considered 9.33(k) (imposition of other penalties or sanctions) but did not find it a substantial mitigating factor under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   21. Based upon the evidence presented at hearing, arguments of Respondent and Bar Counsel, and due consideration given to aggravating and mitigating factors, the Board finds the misconduct proved warrants a different level of discipline than imposed by Utah. Accordingly, the Board finds that disbarment is the appropriate sanction for Respondent's misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusions of Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   22. Rule 1.1, Wyo.R.Prof.Cond., provides, \"A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   23. Rule 1.3, Wyo.R.Prof.Cond., provides, \"A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   24.

Rule 1.5, Wyo.R.Prof.Cond., provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (a) A lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses. The factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (4) the amount involved and the results obtained;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   26.

Rule 19(d), Wyo.R.Disc.Proc., provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Upon receiving notice that an attorney subject to these rules has been publicly disciplined in another jurisdiction, Bar Counsel shall obtain the disciplinary order and prepare and file a formal charge against the attorney as provided in Rule 13. If Bar Counsel intends either to claim that substantially different discipline is warranted or to present additional evidence, notice of that intent shall be given in the formal charge. If the attorney intends to challenge the validity of the disciplinary order entered in the foreign jurisdiction, the attorney must file with the BPR Clerk an answer and a full copy of the record of the disciplinary proceedings which resulted in the imposition of that disciplinary order within 21 days after service of the formal charge or such greater time as the BPR Chair may allow for good cause shown. At the conclusion of proceedings brought under this Rule, the BPR shall issue a report and recommendation that the same discipline be imposed as was imposed by the foreign jurisdiction, unless it is determined by the BPR that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (1) The procedure followed in the foreign jurisdiction did not comport with requirements of due process of law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   (2) The proof upon which the foreign jurisdiction based its determination of misconduct is so infirm that the BPR cannot, consistent with its duty, accept as final the determination of the foreign jurisdiction;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (3) The imposition of the same discipline as was imposed in the foreign jurisdiction would result in grave injustice; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   (4) The misconduct proved warrants that a substantially different form of discipline be recommended by the BPR.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   31. Rule 19(a) provides, \"Except as otherwise provided by these rules, a final adjudication in another jurisdiction of misconduct constituting grounds for discipline of an attorney shall, for purposes of proceedings pursuant to these rules, conclusively establish such misconduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   32. Rule 15(b)(3)(D), Wyo.R.Disc.Proc., lists the factors to be considered in determining lawyer sanctions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   (D) In imposing a sanction after a finding of misconduct by the respondent, the BPR shall consider the following factors, as enumerated in the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   (i) Whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the profession;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   (ii) Whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   (iii) The actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   (iv) The existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   33. The American Bar Association's \"Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions\" read \"The purpose of lawyer discipline proceedings is to protect the public and the administration of justice from lawyers who have not discharged, will not discharge, or are unlikely properly to discharge their professional duties to clients, the public, the legal system, and the legal profession.\" ABA Standard 3.0 lists the factors to be considered in imposing a sanction after a finding of lawyer misconduct, and mirrors the language of Rule 15(b)(3)(D), W.R.D.P.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   (a) the duty violated;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   (b) the lawyer's mental state;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   (c) the potential or actual injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   (d) the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   34.

The preamble to the ABA Standards includes the following discussion regarding mental state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   The mental states used in this model are defined as follows. The most culpable mental state is that of intent, when the lawyer acts with the conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result. The next most culpable mental state is that of knowledge, when the lawyer acts with conscious awareness of the nature or attendant circumstances of his or her conduct both without the conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result. The least culpable mental state is negligence, when a lawyer fails to be aware of a substantial risk that circumstances exist or that a result will follow, which failure is a deviation of a care that a reasonable lawyer would exercise in the situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   40. Under the ABA Standards, \"injury\" is defined as \"harm to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession which results from a lawyer's misconduct. The level of injury can range from `serious' injury to `little or no' injury; a reference to `injury' alone indicates any level of injury greater than `little or no' injury.\" \"Potential injury\" is defined as \"harm to a client, the public, the legal system or the profession that is reasonably foreseeable at the time of the lawyer's misconduct, and which, but for some intervening factor or event, would probably have resulted from the lawyer's misconduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   41.
