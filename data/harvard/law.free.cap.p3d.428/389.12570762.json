(Aventis) and Sanofi-Aventis US, LLC (Sanofi) appeal from the trial court's order granting summary judgment to the Department of Revenue (DOR). They contend that the trial court erred by interpreting the preferential business and occupation (B&amp;O) tax on warehousing and reselling prescription drugs to apply only to wholesalers that sell either to retailers or health care providers, and not to wholesalers that sell to other wholesalers. They also argue that DOR's interpretation of the tax is unconstitutional and that their buyers met the requirements of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 We conclude that the prescription drug wholesaler B&amp;O tax rate applies only to wholesalers who sell either to retailers that hold a pharmacy license or to health care providers and that the plaintiffs' buyers did not fall into either of these categories. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Aventis, a Delaware corporation registered to do business in Washington since 1968, closed its tax account in 2006 and transferred all its business activities and employees to Sanofi, a Delaware limited liability company registered to do business in Washington since 2005. Aventis and Sanofi both engaged in the business of purchasing, warehousing, and selling prescription drugs. Both were registered with the United States Federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and licensed as pharmacy wholesalers by the Washington State Pharmacy Quality Assurance Commission (PQAC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Aventis sought a refund for B&amp;O taxes it paid from January 2002 through December 2005 and Sanofi sought a refund for B&amp;O taxes it paid from December 2006 through June 2012. Both corporations claimed that the preferential B&amp;O tax rate of .138 percent for warehousing and reselling prescription drugs should apply to their sales rather than the general B&amp;O tax rate of .484 percent that they had paid. Because identical issues apply to both plaintiffs, we refer to them collectively as \"Sanofi\" for simplicity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 After Sanofi filed its refund request, DOR issued Excise Tax Advisory 3180.2013 (ETA 3180), which laid out specific requirements sellers and buyers of prescription drugs needed to meet to claim the preferential rate. DOR determined that Sanofi met the seller requirements but that the majority of its buyers, other drug wholesalers, failed to meet the buyer requirements. Accordingly, DOR denied the majority of Sanofi's refund request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 At issue in this case are Sanofi's sales to three buyers: AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, McKesson Corporation, and Cardinal Health Corporation. The prescription drug tax and ETA 3180 both distinguish between sales from prescription drug wholesalers to other wholesalers and sales from wholesalers to retailers. Accordingly, whether Sanofi's buyers were wholesalers or retailers is an important issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 All three of Sanofi's buyers had licenses issued by the DEA and PQAC as pharmaceutical wholesalers, but none held a pharmacy license. They all distributed prescription drugs to both retailers and hospitals. Two of them also filed B&amp;O tax returns for \"retailing\" during the relevant period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 Sanofi appealed DOR's denial of its refund request to the superior court on grounds that its activities fell within the purview of the preferential prescription drug tax. Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the superior court granted DOR's motion. Sanofi appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I.

STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 Sanofi contends that its sales to wholesalers qualify its activities as \"warehousing and reselling drugs for human use pursuant to a prescription\" under the prescription drug tax, RCW 82.04.272. It claims that the statute includes sales from wholesaler to wholesaler so long as the chain of sales culminates in a sale to a person selling at retail or to a health care provider. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A. STATUTORY LANGUAGE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Sanofi maintains that sales of drugs between wholesalers meet the statutory requirements\n   for the preferential rate as long as the chain of sales culminates in a sale to a retailer or health care provider. It contends that the prescription drug tax expressly contemplates these sales by including buying of drugs \"from a manufacturer or another wholesaler.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 RCW 82.04.272(1) provides: \"Upon every person engaging within this state in the business of warehousing and reselling drugs for human use pursuant to a prescription; as to such persons, the amount of the tax shall be equal to the gross income of the business multiplied by the rate of 0.138 percent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 The statute defines \"[w]arehousing and reselling drugs for human use pursuant to a prescription\" to mean:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [T]he buying of drugs for human use pursuant to a prescription from a manufacturer or another wholesaler, and reselling of the drugs to persons selling at retail\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   or to hospitals, clinics, health care providers, or other providers of health care services,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   by a wholesaler or retailer who is registered with the federal drug enforcement administration and licensed by the pharmacy quality assurance commission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   RCW 82.04.272(2)(b). The prescription drug tax rate is a preferential rate to the general wholesaler tax rate of 0.484 percent. RCW 82.04.270.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17 Per the statutory definition, to obtain the preferential rate Sanofi must (1) buy drugs for human use pursuant to a prescription, (2) from a manufacturer or another wholesaler, (3) resell to persons selling at retail or to health care providers,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (4) be a wholesaler or retailer, (5) be registered with the DEA, and (6) be licensed by the PQAC. RCW 82.04.272(2)(b).

RCW 82.04.272(2)(b). It then applies a preferential rate to persons engaging in the business of warehousing and reselling prescription drugs. RCW 82.04.272(1). Sanofi's proposed interpretation of the statute would omit from the definition the requirement that the drugs be resold \"to persons selling at retail or [to health care providers].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 20 Sanofi's claim that the chain of sale must merely culminate in a sale to a retailer or health care provider is unpersuasive.

This argument reads the entire definition of \"warehousing and reselling\" of prescription drugs out of the statute and we do not find it persuasive. Although the tax states that it applies to \"persons\" engaged in the business of \"warehousing and reselling drugs for human use pursuant to a prescription,\" the meaning of that defined term is precisely the issue the parties dispute in this case. Focusing on \"person\" does not change the analysis of this term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   B. ETA 3180\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 22 DOR adopted ETA 3180, an excise tax advisory specifying particular requirements for both the seller and buyer in a given prescription drug transaction for the preferential rate to apply.

The only sales that could fall into this narrow category are sales to healthcare providers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Any retail sale of prescription drugs that is neither to a health care provider, nor made by a holder of a pharmacy license, would be unlawful pursuant to RCW 18.64.020.

For example, RCW 82.04.260(11) set the B&amp;O tax rate for Washington persons \"in the business of manufacturing commercial airplanes, or components of such airplanes, or making sales, at retail or wholesale, of commercial airplanes or components of such airplanes, manufactured by the seller.\" RCW 82.04.260(4) provided the B&amp;O tax rate for those \"in the business of slaughtering, breaking and/or processing perishable meat products and/or selling the same at wholesale only and not at retail.\" RCW 82.04.260(12)(c) set a B&amp;O tax rate for persons \"in the business of selling at wholesale\" various types of timber products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 35 A survey of these various B&amp;O tax schemes shows that the legislature frequently words different B&amp;O tax statutes differently for different types of businesses, intending different interpretations. In the commercial airplane business, it specifically applies the special rate to both wholesalers and retailers, whereas in the perishable meat product business, it specifically applies the special rate to only wholesalers and not retailers. As to timber, it applies the special rate to wholesalers and does not mention retail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 36 Given the many different examples of B&amp;O tax schemes the legislature has created, no specific one helps us to understand the meaning of the prescription drug tax. The commercial airplane statute is clear that retail sales are to be included, while the perishable meat products statute is clear that they are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 37 The prescription drug tax clearly applies only to wholesalers, but the parties dispute whether it applies to all wholesalers\n   or only to a subset that sell to retailers and health care providers. Contrary to Sanofi's characterization, the other B&amp;O tax schemes do not treat all participants in each business as a \"single, taxable class.\" Reply Br. of Appellant at 8. Rather, the other statutes make a number of policy-based distinctions between types of sales in various industries. The other B&amp;O tax statutes cited by Sanofi do not help to interpret the prescription drug tax. We apply the statute's plain meaning, as discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 38 The plain meaning of the prescription drug tax unambiguously requires buyers to be either retail sellers or health care providers. Accordingly, we do not consider the statute's legislative history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   III. CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A. DUE PROCESS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 39 Sanofi next contends that an interpretation that makes its tax liability contingent on subsequent transfers outside its control, such as sales made by its customers, would violate the due process clauses of the United States and Washington Constitutions. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 40 DOR contends that Sanofi raises its due process arguments for the first time on appeal and does not amount to a claim of manifest error affecting a constitutional right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 41 RAP 2.5(a) states that we \"may refuse to review any claim of error which was not raised in the trial court.\" However, this rule \"allows an appellant to raise for the first time a 'manifest error affecting a constitutional right.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

This class does not include persons that do not engage in this business as defined by RCW 82.04.272(2)(b). As discussed above, prescription drug wholesalers who sell to other wholesalers do not meet this definition. Accordingly, they are not members of any class created by RCW 82.04.272 and are taxed as general wholesalers under RCW 82.04.270.\n   <em>\n    Associated Grocers\n   </em>\n   does not control the present case because RCW 82.04.272 does not create a single class and differentiate between its members.

SANOFI'S BUYERS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 57 Sanofi contends that, even if we adopt DOR's interpretation of the prescription drug tax relating to buyer requirements, its buyers meet those requirements. It contends that its three buyers sold prescription drugs \"at retail,\" to health care providers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Because hospitals use drugs in the treatment of patients without reselling them, Sanofi claims they are \"retail\" purchasers. Accordingly, Sanofi claims that the prescription drug tax applies to it because it sold drugs to retailers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 58 \"Sale at retail\" and \"sale at wholesale\" are defined terms in Washington's B&amp;O tax scheme. \"Sale at retail\" means \"every sale of tangible personal property ... to all persons irrespective of the nature of their business ... other than a sale to a person who: (i) Purchases for the purpose of resale as tangible personal property in the regular course of business without intervening use by such person.\" RCW 82.04.050(1)(a). \"Sale at wholesale\" means \"[a]ny sale, which is not a sale at retail.\" RCW 82.04.060(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 59 DOR regulations specifically designate that retailing B&amp;O tax and retail sales tax do not apply to charges to patients \"for tangible personal property used in providing medical services to the patient, even if separately billed.\" WAC 458-20-168(7)(a). Charges for \"drugs physically administered by the hospital staff\" are subject to the hospital B&amp;O tax, while charges for drugs \"sold to persons or their caregivers, either for self-administration or administration by a caregiver other than the seller\" are subject to retailing B&amp;O tax and retail sales tax. WAC 458-20-168(7)(a). Regulations also specify that \"[s]ales of medical products to consumers such as doctors, hospitals, or patients are subject to retailing business and occupation (B&amp;O) tax and the retail sales tax.\" WAC 458-20-18801(302).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 60 Both parties agree that sales from Sanofi's buyers to health care providers are sometimes sales \"at retail.\" However, DOR contends that health care providers are treated differently for the purposes of the prescription drug wholesaling B&amp;O tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 61 When interpreting statutes, \"[a] general statutory provision must yield to a more specific statutory provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Ass'n of Wash.

RCW 82.04.272(2)(b), the specific statute at issue in this case, provides that the preferential rate applies to sales to \"persons selling at retail or to hospitals, clinics, health care providers, or other providers of health care services.\" If all sales to health care providers are sales \"at retail\" under this statute, the clause providing for sales to different types of health care providers is superfluous and unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 63 However, as both parties state, only\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   sales to health care providers are \"at retail,\" since many health care providers resell prescription drugs to patients. It makes sense, then, that the legislature intended the specific statute to alleviate the confusion caused by the general statutes and regulations by overriding them with a specific provision for health care providers. It spelled out that sales to retailers or to health care providers both allow wholesalers to claim the preferential rate, but sales to buyers who resell to health care providers do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 64 We read the specific statute at issue in this case to override the general classifications of sales to health providers as \"retail\" sales and not to contain surplus language. Accordingly, Sanofi's buyers' sales to health care providers may be \"retail sales\" for many statutory and regulatory purposes, but the buyers are not \"persons selling at retail\" for purposes of RCW 82.04.272 and do not qualify Sanofi for the preferential tax rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   V. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 65 Because Sanofi has not met the requirements of the prescription drug tax, the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment to DOR.
