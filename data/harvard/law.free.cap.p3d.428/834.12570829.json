She kept various animals on the property including 13 horses, 7 cows, 9 cats, and some goats. In the fall of 2011, after securing a job in Wyoming, Cozzens needed a caretaker for her animals and property during the winter months until she could make other arrangements. In early October, Cozzens posted an internet ad for a caretaker to perform various animal and property care for an estimated 2-3 hours per day in\n   return for rent-free housing in her home. Mills responded to the ad from Florida and he and Cozzens subsequently negotiated an agreement by email. Mills would drive his motorhome to Montana from Florida and would then perform various daily, weekly, and monthly tasks specified on a list that Cozzens would subsequently provide. In return, Cozzens would allow Mills to live in her home rent-free, stock-up on necessary supplies, and set up an expense account with a third-party vendor to allow Mills to obtain other necessary supplies at Cozzens's expense. Cozzens would also pay for various utilities, including electricity and propane, while Mills would pay for desired internet service. The parties generally discussed the possibility of Mills performing various handyman projects for additional payment on a by-job basis if interested, but reached no agreement about any specific projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Over the next two months prior to Mills's arrival in Montana, he and Cozzens exchanged dozens of emails and text messages reflecting tension between them about the terms of their agreement and their respective assumptions and expectations in regard thereto. Because she was in a bind, Cozzens stuck to the agreement despite what she later characterized as \"red flags.\" After some confusion about a start date, Mills arrived in Lewistown on December 16, 2011. While showing Mills around the property, Cozzens showed him an office she described as \"off limits\" to him which would serve as her room when she periodically returned to Lewistown over the winter. The office contained personal property belonging to Cozzens as well as various items owned by her boyfriend, Deb Greenough. On December 18, 2011, Cozzens left for Wyoming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Over the following weeks and months, Mills and Cozzens exchanged emails and text messages almost daily. The messages were friendly and, at times, flirtatious. Mills provided few details regarding his work on the property and did not advise Cozzens of any problem. In turn, Cozzens did not make any specific inquiry, make any extraordinary request, or give Mills any additional direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 However, in February 2012, Mills requested that Cozzens\n   reimburse him for $1,387.50 in out-of-pocket expenses incurred for cat supplies, goat feed, and hay delivery. Though upset because she had not contemplated that Mills would incur out-of-pocket expenses for such items, Cozzens had her mother compensate Mills for those expenses but directed him to thereafter advise her in advance of any contemplated out-of-pocket expenses. Cozzens and Mills exchanged a number of terse emails over the following week which culminated in Cozzens apologizing to Mills. Cozzens reminded Mills that, though she liked him and felt that they could be friends, theirs was a \"business relationship first and foremost\" and that they would need to reevaluate if Mills felt that their arrangement was inequitable. Mills acknowledged that he understood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 On March 4, 2012, Cozzens returned to Lewistown to check on her animals and property. Mills became upset when she told him that she would only be staying for 1-2 days. He asserted that he had made his intentions about her clear and wanted to know why she was ignoring him. Cozzens later testified that she felt that she needed to terminate her dealings with Mills after he became argumentative when she told him that she loved her boyfriend. When Cozzens prepared to leave the following morning, Mills gave her a belated Valentine's Day gift in a box containing a bow and a sexually suggestive note. Cozzens testified that she was mortified when she later opened the box because the gift and note were inappropriate and unwarranted. Following a subsequent negative downturn in their communications, Cozzens notified Mills that she was going to move her animals and directed him to vacate her property by May 1, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 On April 21, 2012, Mills sent Cozzens a lengthy email and a 48-page document entitled \"Quit Notice,\" which he also copied to Cozzens's mother, father, and sister. The email accused Cozzens of dehumanizing and disrespecting Mills and claimed that Cozzens owed him $12,353.51 for previously performed labor, out-of-pocket expenses, and relocation costs. The email further informed Cozzens that, \"[a]s a result of consultations with both my former wife and a local attorney, I have removed goods from your mother's\n   property as security against your unpaid debt.\"\n   <em>\n    Inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the attached \"Quit Notice\" specified Mills's hourly rates for labor and \"literary efforts\" (i.e. time spent corresponding with Cozzens) and an itemized list of the services and\n   tasks for which he claimed entitlement to payment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The notice further declared:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Because I am informing you of my actions, and because I have deposited the goods with an attorney to be held for your collection following full payment or auction pursuant to the settling of a Civil Court case, my actions do not constitute theft....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   After I have been paid, the return of your held property can be negotiated with my Montana attorney; you will also have to pay her fee, and the cost of the storage unit in which the goods are deposited. If I am not paid, in full, ... by close of business April 20, 2012, my attorney will instruct you formally as to the more time-consuming and costly process you will be deemed to have insisted upon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The email and attached notice did not identify, or provide contact information for Mills's purported Montana attorney. Upon receipt of the email, Cozzens contacted the Fergus County Sheriff's Office and reported the matter to Deputy Randy Poser. Deputy Poser subsequently called Mills and left a voice message request for a return call. Mills did not return the call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 9 Upon her return to Lewistown, Cozzens documented in excess of $28,000 worth of property missing from her home following Mills's departure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon additional investigation, law enforcement obtained a warrant for Mills's arrest on suspicion of theft. Officers were unable to arrest Mills until they found him in Musselshell County on July 3, 2011. During a post-arrest interview, Mills admitted to taking property from Cozzens's home but claimed that he took the property and placed it in a storage unit \"through the auspice\" of an unidentified Montana lawyer. Upon further investigation, including a report from a Roundup woman who had hired Mills to perform work and later discovered property in her rented storage unit that did not belong to her, investigating officers obtained and executed search warrants on Mills's motorhome and the Roundup storage unit where they found most of the property reported missing from Cozzens's home. A number of items\n   of missing property, including Cozzens's photo albums and yearbooks, were not recovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 10 Prior to trial on charges of felony and misdemeanor theft regarding the separate property of Cozzens and Greenough, Mills moved for dismissal on the asserted ground that the State could not prove that he acted with the purpose to deprive the owners of the property within the meaning of \u00a7 45-6-301(1)(a), MCA, because, as alleged by the State, he seized and held the property only for the purpose of securing a claimed contract debt. The District Court denied the motion on the ground that the question of whether Mills acted with the requisite mental state for the charged offenses was a question of fact for jury determination. The matter proceeded to trial and the jury found Mills guilty of both counts of theft as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11 After the verdicts, Mills again moved for dismissal, or judgment as a matter of law, on the asserted ground that the undisputed evidence that he took the property under a claim of civil right, even if mistaken, precluded proof that he acted with the requisite purpose to deprive the owners of the property. Again finding the matter within the province of the jury, the District Court denied the motion and ultimately sentenced Mills on the felony to a five-year term of commitment to the Montana Department of Corrections, all time suspended, with a concurrent thirty-day jail commitment on the misdemeanor, with credit for time served. Mills timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 12 The denial of a motion to dismiss is a question of law reviewed de novo for correctness.\n   <em>\n    State v.

As pertinent here, \"a person acts purposely with respect to a result ... if it is the person's conscious object to ... cause that result.\" Section 45-2-101(65), MCA. \"Deprive\" means \"to withhold property of another ... with the purpose to restore it only upon payment of ... compensation.\" Section 45-2-101(20)(a)(iii), MCA. \"When a particular purpose is an element of an offense, the element is established [even though] the purpose is conditional, unless the condition negat[e]s the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense.\" Section 45-2-101(65), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 16 In\n   <em>\n    Ferrel\n   </em>\n   , after lawfully picking up a check issued by a third party for delivery to her employer, the defendant ranch employee, upon learning of her employer's intent to terminate her employment, withheld the check from the employer on the condition that the employer pay her on an unrelated debt (the value of a garden) that she claimed the employer owed as a result of the termination of her employment.\n   <em>\n    Ferrel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2505120\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/208/456/#p463\">\n    208 Mont. at 457-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2505120\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/208/456/#p463\">\n    679 P.2d at 225-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We first noted that \"literal application\" of \u00a7 45-2-101(20)(a)(iii), MCA (defining \"deprive\" as \"withhold[ing] property of another with the purpose\" of \"restor[ing] it only upon [the other's] payment\n   of reward or other compensation\"), would potentially subject a person to criminal liability who seized or withheld property of another as payment or security on a debt under a lawful claim of civil right.\n   <em>\n    Ferrel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2505120\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/208/456/#p463\">\n    208 Mont. at 465-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2505120\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/208/456/#p463\">\n    679 P.2d at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (referencing various hypothetical claim of right scenarios). Without distinguishing the broader language of \u00a7 45-2-101(20)(a)(iii), MCA, from that of \u00a7 45-2-101(20)(a)(i), MCA, we summarily concluded that, for purposes of \u00a7 45-2-101(65), MCA (defendant's conditional purpose precludes proof of a proscribed purpose if the \"condition negat[e]s the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the [statute] defining the offense\"), the evil or harm \u00a7 45-6-301(1)(a), MCA, \"seeks to prevent is [limited to] the\n   <em>\n    permanent\n   </em>\n   deprivation\" of all or part of the property of another.\n   <em>\n    Ferrel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2505120\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/208/456/#p463\">\n    208 Mont. at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2505120\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/208/456/#p463\">\n    679 P.2d at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Then, noting that the defendant's only purpose was to conditionally take and withhold the property to leverage payment from the owner under an asserted claim of right, we dismissed the theft charge, holding that, while Ferrel \"may have committed a civil trespass,\" she \"did not commit a crime as defined\" by \u00a7\u00a7 45-6-301(1)(a) and 45-2-101(20)(a)(iii), (65), MCA.\n   <em>\n    Ferrel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2505120\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/208/456/#p463\">\n    208 Mont. at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2505120\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/208/456/#p463\">\n    679 P.2d at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In regard to the new mental state \"purposely,\" the MPC provided that a defendant's \"[i]gnorance or mistake as to a matter of fact or law is a defense if ... the ignorance or mistake negat[e]s the purpose ... required to establish a material element of the offense.\" MPC \u00a7 2.04(1)(a). The MPC explained that \u00a7 2.04(1) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   states the general principle governing whether and when ignorance or mistake of fact or law will afford a defense to a criminal charge. The matter is conceived as a function of the [requisite mental state] otherwise required for [an] offense. Such ignorance or mistake is a defense\n   <em>\n    to the extent that it negat[e]s\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    the requisite mental state\n   </em>\n   ].... The effect of this section therefore turns upon the [requisite mental state] for each element of the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   MPC \u00a7 2.04(1), Explanatory Note (emphasis added). As to offenses that require proof of specific purposes (e.g., theft, et al.), the MPC provided that, \"[w]hen a particular purpose is an element of an offense, the element is established although such purpose is conditional,\n   <em>\n    unless the condition negat[e]s the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense\n   </em>\n   .\" MPC \u00a7 2.02(6) (emphasis added). The MPC explained that \u00a7 2.02(6)\"is in accord with present law in that it\n   <em>\n    declines to give defensive import\n   </em>\n   to the fact that the actor's purpose was conditional\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   the condition negat[e]s the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the ... offense.\" MPC \u00a7 2.02(6), Explanatory Note (emphasis added). Read in conjunction with MPC \u00a7 2.02(6), the claim-of-right defense encompassed within MPC \u00a7 223.1(3)(b) is factually subsumed in the broader ignorance or mistake-of-law defense contemplated by MPC \u00a7 2.02(6). Thus, except as to the substitution of a requirement for proof of a specific proscribed purpose for proof of specific intent, the MPC clearly carried forward with the modern offense of theft the essence of the good-faith claim-of-right defense previously available as a defense to the common-law and derived statutory formulations of larceny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23 Though our 1973 Criminal Code does not expressly recognize \"ignorance or mistake\" of law or \"claim of right\" as defenses to theft, express recognition of a claim-of-right defense was unnecessary due to the inclusion of the essence of MPC \u00a7\u00a7 2.04(1)(a) and 223.1(3)(b) and related provisions. Theft, as defined by \u00a7\u00a7 45-6-301(1) and 45-2-101(20)(a)(iii), (65), MCA, largely derives without significant\n   substantive change from MPC \u00a7\u00a7 2.02(2)(a), 2.04(1)(a), 223.0(1), 223.2, and 2.04(1)(a). \"Purposely,\" as defined by \u00a7 45-2-101(65), MCA includes the essence of MPC \u00a7\u00a7 2.02(6) and 2.04(1)(a) providing that a conditional purpose does not preclude proof of a proscribed purpose\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   the condition negates the evil or harm proscribed by the statute defining the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 24 The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Montana Constitution Article II, Section 17, and \u00a7 26 -1-403(2), MCA, independently require the state to prove every factual element of a charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    In re Winship\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054393\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/358/#p361\">\n    397 U.S. 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 361-64,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054393\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/358/#p361\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1071-73,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054393\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/358/#p361\">\n    25 L.Ed.2d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, like MPC \u00a7 2.02(1), \u00a7 45-2-103(1), MCA, generally requires the state to prove that the defendant acted with the requisite criminal mental state for each element of a charged offense.

As in\n   <em>\n    Ferrel\n   </em>\n   , Mills thus asserted that his conduct at most constituted a civil trespass rather than a crime. However, as\n   previously shown,\n   <em>\n    Ferrel\n   </em>\n   erroneously concluded that \u00a7 45-6-301(1), MCA proscribes only the purpose to permanently deprive an owner of property, thereby precluding jury consideration of whether he truly held such a belief in good faith. To that extent, and in accordance with our similar holding in\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ferrel\n   </em>\n   is hereby overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 28 The State's charging affidavit asserted that Mills had no legal authority to remove the subject property from Cozzens's home under the circumstances. The affidavit stated facts, that if proven, were sufficient to constitute theft, as defined by \u00a7\u00a7 45-6-301(1)(a) and 45-2-101(20)(a)(iii), MCA. The issue as to whether Mills acted under a good-faith claim of right that, if true, would negate proof of the requisite mental state for the theft was a question of fact for jury determination at trial. We hold that the District Court correctly denied Mills's pretrial motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 29 As to Mills's post-trial motion, it is beyond genuine material dispute on the trial record that he conditionally took property valued in excess of $28,000 from Cozzens's home to secure an unliquidated debt under an unspecified claim of right. It is similarly beyond genuine material dispute that Mills had no ownership interest in the property, that the parties had no agreement granting Mills a security interest in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   property, and that neither their actual agreement nor Cozzens otherwise authorized or contemplated such action. Nor was there any evidence to support a cognizable possessory lien claim. Thus, sufficient evidence existed upon which the jury could have reasonably concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Mills purposely took or withheld the property to leverage a payment on a disputed contract debt with knowledge that he had no lawful authority to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 30 As to his asserted contrary good-faith belief, there is no evidence that, even if mistaken, Mills actually believed that he had any legal basis to remove property from Cozzens's home other than belief in a general, self-help right to take non-specific property owned by Cozzens as collateral on the unliquidated claim. Indeed, on appeal, Mills asserts that after researching the law he engaged in \"self-help\" and held several of Cozzens's personal items as collateral until she paid him for his work and out-of-pocket expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Regardless of Mills's claimed general self-help right, sufficient evidence existed upon which the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that he purposely took property from Cozzens's home to leverage payment on an unliquidated debt with knowledge that he had no lawful authority to do so.

While Mills's proposed Instruction No. 1 was a correct statement of the law, it was encompassed within the District Court's instruction that the State must prove that he \"purposely or knowingly obtained or exerted unauthorized control over the [subject] property.\" Mills's proposed Instruction No. 17 was not\n   supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 35 Mills's proposed Instruction Nos. 2 and 4 were not correct statements of the law. As previously shown, a correct statement of the law is that a person does not act with the purpose to deprive another of property if the person had a good-faith claim of a civil-law right to take or withhold specific identifiable property to satisfy or secure a claimed debt. A defendant is entitled to such instruction only if supported by evidence sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant acted under such reasonable good-faith belief in contrast to a mere belief in a general self-help right to take or withhold non-specific property of the debtor to satisfy or secure the claimed debt. Thus, the District Court did not err in refusing Mills's proposed instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 36\n   <em>\n    Inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the District Court instructed the jury on: (1) the elements of theft as defined by \u00a7 45-6-301(1)(a)-(b), MCA ; (2) that \"the State is not obligated to prove that Mr. Mills knew his conduct was prohibited by the theft statute\" ( \u00a7 45-2-103(5), MCA ); (3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   on the definition of \"purposely\" as defined by \u00a7 45-2-101(65), MCA ; (4) on the definition of \"deprive\" as defined by \u00a7 45-2-101(20)(a)(i) and (iii), MCA ; and (5) on the provision of \u00a7 45-2-101(65), MCA stating that \"[w]hen a particular purpose is an element of an offense, the element is established although such purpose is conditional, unless the condition negat[e]s the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense.\" Without express reference to a claim of right, the court's instructions constituted a minimally sufficient statement of applicable law, particularly given that even a correct claim-of-right instruction was not supported by the evidence. Thus, the instructions given by the court, as at issue here, were minimally sufficient to fully and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law and to allow Mills to argue any theory of defense supported by the evidence. On the evidentiary record in this case, we hold that the District Court did not erroneously fail to instruct the jury on the claim-of-right defense to theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 37\n   <em>\n    3.

Mills asserts that the court erroneously overruled his objection resulting in substantial prejudice. In response, the State acknowledges that though \"some of Marty's testimony could be considered an opinion applying the law to the facts, none of his legal\n   conclusions had any bearing on\" whether the State satisfied its burden of proving the essential elements of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.

The State further elicited Marty's \"legal opinion\" as to what the terms of the Mills-Cozzens contract were. Marty gave testimony as to whether Mills's asserted claim against Cozzens was a secured or unsecured claim, that prejudgment seizure of debtor assets is not an available legal remedy on an unsecured claim, and that unsecured creditors generally have no prejudgment remedy against debtor assets except under extraordinary situations under circumstances not at issue. Marty ultimately testified that Mills's asserted claim was not legitimate and that there was no valid construction lien, federal migrant worker law, bailment, or other legal right Mills could rely on to remove property from Cozzens's home. Marty's opinion testimony clearly constituted conclusions of law and application of law to facts.

The parties had a simple and limited contractual relationship-Mills would perform listed animal and property caretaking tasks in return for free rent and paid utilities. Nowhere in the multitude of email and text communications between Mills and Cozzens was there any mention or other indication that Mills believed that he had such a right to remove property from Cozzens's home in the event of a future dispute over payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 43 However ill-advised, neither party anticipated that Mills would incur out-of-pocket expenses-Mills would perform his assigned tasks using a stock of supplies built up by Cozzens and then obtain other necessary materials and supplies from a third-party vendor on an expense account set up by Cozzens. When Mills surprised Cozzens with a $1,387.50 reimbursement bill for unanticipated costs, Cozzens arranged payment but clearly demanded that Mills keep her apprised of any other unanticipated costs that might arise. Cozzens further reminded Mills about their limited agreement and gave him the opportunity to withdraw or renegotiate. Mills did neither. No mention or notice of any outstanding need or claim by Mills arose until after his angry, hurt, and vengeful reaction to Cozzens personally rebuffing him and giving him notice of termination of their contractual relationship with notice to vacate her property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 44 Regardless of whether Mills may have had a cognizable or good-faith belief that he was entitled to additional compensation from Cozzens, the record is completely devoid of any evidence or indication that Mills actually believed that he had any cognizable security interest, possessory lien interest, or other legal right to remove specific, identifiable property from Cozzens's home as security for payment on their contract. Mills's belief consisted of nothing more than a patently trumped-up claim to a general self-help right to non-specific property owned by Cozzens. Belying any claim of good faith, the amount and value of the property taken from Cozzens's home had no proportional relationship to the claimed debt. Further belying a good-faith claim, Mills also took various items of property of only \"sentimental value\" to Cozzens with the admitted hope that she would \"spend [her] family's money to see [it] again.\" Uncharacteristic of a commercial transaction, Mills left no contact information for Cozzens, made no subsequent\n   attempt to contact her to resolve the matter, and did not return a call from the investigating law enforcement officer who called for an explanation. Even after his arrest, Mills persisted in asserting that he acted under the advice of an unidentified lawyer. However, at trial, Mills finally admitted that he in fact had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   consulted with a lawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 45 The jury was thus faced with an underlying debt claim that was dubious at best, Mills's naked assertion of a general self-help right, based on nothing more than unattributed internet \"research,\" and conduct wholly inconsistent with a good-faith belief in a civil legal right. Against that backdrop, Marty's legal opinion testimony focused on a point not seriously disputed by Mills-that he did not actually have a legal right to remove property from Cozzens's home. Rather, his defense was that he believed in good faith that he did, thus negating the State's proof of the requisite mental state for theft. Though having some tangential relevance on whether Mills acted in good faith, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Rather than evidence of a cognizable good-faith claim of right, Mills's mere belief in a general self-help right to offset or secure a claimed contract debt with non-specific property of the debtor was no more than a defense based on ignorance of the law. Under these circumstances, there was no reasonable possibility that Marty's testimony materially contributed\n   to Mills's conviction to any significant extent. The tainted evidence was at most merely cumulative of independently admissible evidence of Mills's guilt on the essential elements of the charged offenses of theft.

Finally, we hold that the District Court erroneously allowed the State to present inadmissible expert legal opinion testimony but that the error was harmless under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 48 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   JIM RICE, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   LAURIE McKINNON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   BETH BAKER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   INGRID GUSTAFSON, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    <em>\n     Inter alia\n    </em>\n    , the list referenced sorting Cozzens's CD collection \"so that you can actually play what you want to hear when you want to hear it,\" fixing the base of a paper towel holder, unraveling a \"Gordian Knot\" of nylon rope on the deck, removing delivery stickers from bathroom mirrors, tidying the great room, and tending the mailbox.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Cozzens listed 29 pieces of art, miscellaneous silverware, a photo printer, photo albums, and yearbooks.
