Recognizing that this question is purely one of law, the parties sensibly agreed to stay discovery and filed cross-motions for summary judgment at the outset of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 The plaintiffs\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   argued that the Hospital Lien Statute \"requires a hospital to pay its proportional share of an injured person's attorney fees and costs when a hospital lien is paid due to the efforts of the injured person or his or her attorney.\" The defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   countered that the statute contains no such language, and that the statute operates instead \"to establish a priority system as to entitlement to settlement funds to allow hospitals to get paid.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 The district court concluded that the hospitals' interpretation was correct, as it was \"the only\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   [interpretation] that ma[de] sense given the context of the statute read as a whole.\" More specifically, the district court granted summary judgment to the hospitals, finding that \"even giving [the] [patients] the benefit of the doubt concerning ... [their] tortured (albeit possible) interpretation of Subsection (1)(a), ... [o]nly [the hospitals'] interpretation reconciles the [Hospital Lien] [S]tatute\n   <em>\n    as a\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    whole\n   </em>\n   .\" The patients appealed. We are in full agreement with the district court's conclusions and therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 Because the parties have stipulated that the focal issue in this case is the interpretation of the Hospital Lien Statute, the facts in this matter are not at issue. This proposed class action involves persons injured in car accidents who filed personal injury claims against the third parties at fault. All had hospital liens placed on any potential recovery from those claims, and all reached settlement agreements, paying their attorney fees by way of a contingent fee on the recovery. In each case, the patient used the settlement proceeds to pay attorney fees and associated costs and then the entirety of the asserted hospital lien, retaining the remaining balance, if any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 The patients contend that the hospitals failed to pay their \"fair share\" of the attorney fees (including court costs and other necessary expenses) the patients incurred in generating the settlement proceeds. And they further contend that, under the Hospital Lien Statute, the hospitals should be required to reimburse them for the proportion of those attorney fees that the hospitals should have been required to pay in order to equitably share the costs of obtaining the settlement proceeds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court disagreed with the patients' interpretation of the statute and granted summary judgment to\n   the hospitals. We agree with the district court that the reading of the plain language of the statute as a whole yields the hospitals' interpretation and find that the language is not ambiguous. But even if the language were ambiguous, the substantive terms canon would negate the patients' interpretation. We also conclude that the common fund doctrine offers the patients no relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 We have jurisdiction under Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 \"A district court's interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we ... review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    Harvey v.

In order for the sentence to make sense, \"that portion\" must be defined, so the sentence requires a complement to \"that portion.\" The complement clarifies what is meant by \"that portion.\" In this sentence, the complement is \"of the judgment going or belonging to the patient.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complement is also followed by a postmodifier, \"less the amount paid by the patient ... for attorney fees ... incidental to obtaining the judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Postmodifiers usually come after a complement in a noun clause, and refer back to the head noun (\"portion\") in the clause. So both the complement and the postmodifier refer back to the noun \"portion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b617 The prepositional phrase, \"less attorney fees,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   acts, along with its postmodifiers, as a postmodifier in this sentence. As used here, \"less\" is a preposition meaning minus or without. It also modifies its nearest reasonable referent (the noun the complement finishes defining), \"portion.\" Its function is to specify or clarify that the funds available on which the hospital may assert its lien do not include the portion of the judgment used to pay attorney fees. In other words, the complement and the postmodifier clarify that the lien can be asserted on the entirety of the judgment that belongs to the patient after subtracting the attorney fees. So, the lien may be asserted on the patient's entire judgment after attorney fees are subtracted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b618 When read in conjunction with subsection 1(a), subsection 1(b) is a clear legislative statement that \"[n]o reduction of the asserted lien amount [defined in subsection 1(a) ] is allowed\" except for the attorney fees reduction as described in subsection 1(a). UTAH CODE \u00a7 38-7-1(b). In other words, the hospital's lien has priority over any other lien holder and the patient once the attorney fees have been paid. These two subsections work in harmony to create a priority for the enforcement of liens on the judgment. First, the attorney's lien\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   is enforceable (and any paid attorney fees are reimbursed), next the hospital's lien is enforceable up to the remaining amount of the judgment, and then any proceeds remaining are subject to other liens (such as insurance subrogation) and may be used as compensation to the victim. Section 1(b) makes clear that\n   <em>\n    no other\n   </em>\n   reduction from the judgment is allowed with the exception of attorney fees until the hospital is able to enforce its asserted lien. This interpretation is the only one\n   <em>\n    plausible\n   </em>\n   under the text of the act as a whole, rendering the statute unambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Utah Pub.

We have not held that the common fund doctrine applies to cases with enforceable liens of a creditor on a judgment awarded to the debtor and the legislature has not incorporated this doctrine into the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b623 Likewise, the patients' argument that the doctrine would avoid unjust enrichment because the hospitals \"otherwise would bear none of the litigation costs\" is inapposite. The relationship between a hospital and a patient is generally a contractual one-either expressed through signing the forms upon admission and consenting to treatment or implied through receiving emergency treatment even without signing the forms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Emergency Physicians Integrated Care v.

When hospitals have provided medical services to patients in accordance with the law, they are entitled to payment from the patients. This establishes a debtor-creditor relationship between the patients and the hospitals. The Hospital Lien Statute is just one mechanism that hospitals may use to recover the debt owed for treatment-an amount that would be owed regardless of whether a lawsuit against a tortfeasor ensued. To expect a creditor to help pay attorney fees for a lawsuit when they are entitled to collect on the debt owed them-regardless of whether a suit is filed or the outcome-is unrealistic and illogical. Since the relationship between the hospital and the patient is one of creditor and debtor, the hospital is not responsible for recouping the costs of litigating a personal injury claim. The hospital is owed the full amount of its bill regardless of the outcome of the litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b625 The plain language of the Hospital Lien Statute creates a priority for the distribution of the proceeds in third-party liability cases. The hospitals' interpretation is the only plausible interpretation of the statute when read as a whole. Furthermore, even if the statute were ambiguous, we are not persuaded by the patients' proportional sharing arguments and reject them because we\n   would have to incorporate substantive terms that are not present in the language of the statute. Also, we reject the patients' assertion that the common fund doctrine is a public policy consideration that justifies their rationalization for adopting proportional sharing. We affirm the district court in its grant of summary judgment to the hospitals.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The named plaintiffs in this proposed class action are all persons who were involved in car accidents, received medical care at one or more of the healthcare institutions named in this suit, and filed personal injury claims against the third parties at fault for the accidents.

Hospital lien laws can balance the competing interests of injured patients, hospitals, attorneys, and other parties who may have an interest in proceeds arising out of personal injury claims. First, by affording hospitals direct and prioritized interest in funds collected by personal injury patients, the statute encourages the treatment of accident victims who may have no other means to pay. Second, because the statute grants hospitals a secured interest in those funds, it reduces the amount of litigation that may otherwise have to occur to obtain collection of the healthcare debt. Third, because legal services are often required to resolve personal injury claims and make the victim financially whole, prioritizing attorney fees incentivizes attorneys to provide legal services under a contingency fee agreement to clients that may otherwise not be able to retain attorneys.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Carol A.
