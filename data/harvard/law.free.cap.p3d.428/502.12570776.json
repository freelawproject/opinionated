He demanded money, and the employee gave him what there was in the cash register. A jury convicted Montes Flores of armed robbery and other charges. We affirm, holding that it did not matter that the victim of the robbery did not see him use his hand to simulate a weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Montes Flores entered a convenience store before dawn one morning, selected some sunflower seeds and a bottle of water and paid for them at the front counter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   His transaction complete, Montes Flores looked toward the front door, then turned again in the direction of the assistant manager behind the counter. Sliding his hand beneath his shirt and under the waistband of his pants, Montes Flores leaned forward and demanded, \"Give me all your money, I have a gun.\" Not immediately understanding, the victim responded, \"Excuse me?\" After Montes Flores repeated his statement, the victim quickly opened the register and began to pull money from the drawer. Montes Flores told him to put the money in a bag. As soon as the victim handed him the bag, Montes Flores walked out of the store and drove off in a stolen SUV. Surveillance cameras captured the robbery in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Police arrested Montes Flores after he crashed the SUV not far away. The State charged him with armed robbery, theft of a means of transportation and criminal damage caused in connection with the theft of the SUV. The State also alleged aggravating circumstances and that Montes Flores had historical prior felony convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The jury found Montes Flores guilty as charged. At sentencing, he admitted two historical prior felony convictions. The superior court sentenced him to concurrent terms of incarceration, the longest of which was 14 years. Montes Flores timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution, and Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") sections 12-120.21(A)(1) (2018), 13-4031 (2018), and -4033(A)(1) (2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The theory of the prosecution was that he used his hand to simulate a deadly weapon. Montes Flores argues the statute is unconstitutionally vague\n   because it is unclear whether it applies to a robber who uses his hand, not an object, to simulate a weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 We review the constitutionality of a statute\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    State v.

When the emergency operator inquired whether the victim had seen\n   a gun, he stated he had not, but explained he had seen the robber place \"his hand in his waistband.\" Surveillance video likewise shows that Montes Flores moved his hand under his shirt and inside his waistband as he leaned across the counter toward the victim. In addition, at a settlement conference nearly five months before trial, the prosecutor asserted that the State would prove that Montes Flores used a simulated deadly weapon and threats of force to commit the robbery. The prosecutor's recitation of the requisite elements of the charge referenced \u00a7 13-1904(A)(2), not subsection (A)(1). Moreover, the State alleged in the joint pretrial statement that Montes Flores \"committed an armed robbery by simulating a deadly weapon and coercing the cashier to give him the cash from the drawer.\" The use of the verb \"simulate\" meant that the State was not going to try to prove that Montes Flores committed armed robbery while in possession of (\"armed\" with) a simulated deadly weapon under \u00a7 13-1904(A)(1), but that he simulated a deadly weapon during the robbery, in violation of \u00a7 13-1904(A)(2). Thus, Montes Flores had actual notice before trial that the State intended to prove he used or threatened to use a simulated deadly weapon in violation of \u00a7 13-1904(A)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 20 Further, Montes Flores has not shown any prejudice from the purported change in the charge.

Instead, he only argues that his lawyer focused in closing argument on the absence of an actual weapon and failed to address any threatened use of a simulated weapon. Although defense counsel asserted the State had failed to show that Montes Flores \"presented\" a deadly simulated weapon to the victim, she also argued that a robbery does not become armed robbery when the robber claims to have a gun and places his hand underneath his shirt if he does not expressly threaten to use a weapon. Thus, Montes Flores's counsel argued the State failed to prove he committed armed robbery under either (A)(1) or (A)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 21 On this record, Montes Flores had actual notice of the charges against him and so suffered no prejudice from the Rule 13.5(b) violation and no infringement of his rights under the Sixth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freeney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4050747\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/223/110/#p114\">\n    223 Ariz. at 114, \u00b6 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4050747\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/223/110/#p114\">\n    219 P.3d at 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Montes Flores argues there was no evidence he simulated a weapon; he contends his hands were never hidden beneath his clothing. But the store surveillance video, which was admitted in evidence and played for the jury, belies Montes Flores's description of his conduct at the convenience store. The video shows that in committing the robbery, Montes Flores slipped his hand under his shirt and the waistband of his pants, then shifted his obscured hand slightly toward the center of his waistband. By shifting his hand beneath his shirt and waistband, he created the appearance that he was clutching an object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 26 Montes Flores further argues, however, that there was insufficient evidence the victim was threatened by his words and acts. While the victim responded to Montes Flores's demand by opening the cash register and handing him the money, he testified he did not \"feel threatened\" by Montes Flores. And, although the victim saw Montes Flores's hand in his waistband, the video shows that at the moment Montes Flores shifted his hand beneath his shirt and waistband as if to simulate a weapon, the victim was not looking at him, but was looking instead in the direction of the cash register.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 27 Montes Flores offers no legal authority in support of his contention that a conviction under \u00a7 13-1904(A)(2) for using or threatening to use a simulated deadly weapon requires proof the victim of the robbery felt threatened by or even perceived the simulated weapon. The statute itself contains no reference to the victim's reaction to the defendant's threat or use of a weapon.

That statute, like \u00a7 13-1904(A), does not reference the victim's perception of or reaction to the use of a weapon, and we have held that when a defendant uses a deadly weapon to commit an assault under \u00a7 13-1203(A)(2), the State need not prove the victim was placed in reasonable apprehension of harm\n   <em>\n    by a deadly weapon\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, the record contains sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that Montes Flores took property from the victim's immediate presence and against his will, and while committing that robbery, threatened to use a simulated deadly weapon.
