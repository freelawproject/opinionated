He argues that the superior court erred by designating two arresting officers as victims and thus allowing the officers to refuse pretrial defense interviews under Arizona's Victims' Bill of Rights. Matthews further argues that the court erred by declining to instruct the jury (1) that passive resistance is a lesser-included offense of resisting arrest, and (2) regarding excessive force by law enforcement officers. We hold that multiple arresting officers can be victims of a single charge of resisting arrest under Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 13-2508(A)(1), and that such victims retain the right to refuse pretrial defense interviews. We further hold that passive resistance is not a lesser-included offense of resisting arrest through physical force, and that the evidence did not support Matthews's requested excessive force instruction. Accordingly, and for reasons that follow, we affirm Matthews's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In May 2016, two Phoenix Police officers patrolling a south Phoenix neighborhood recognized Matthews walking down the street. Knowing that he had an outstanding warrant, the officers turned their patrol car around to stop him, and one of the officers called out to Matthews and made eye contact with him, but he continued walking. Once the officers drew closer, Matthews stopped and sat on a small electrical box, but when one of the officers told Matthews there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest, Matthews abruptly stood up. The officers grabbed Matthews by his arms, but he nevertheless tried to leave. The officers pinned Matthews against a wall, but Matthews kept his arms in front of him and lunged back and forth. The officers ordered him to stop resisting, but he continued to struggle, so they brought him to the ground. One officer placed his knee on Matthews's back, and the officers together were able to pull his arms behind his back to handcuff him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Matthews had been shot in the back about two months earlier and was still undergoing rehabilitation. After the arrest, Matthews had to be taken to the hospital for injuries related to the gunshot wound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The State charged Matthews with one count of resisting arrest \"by using or threatening to use physical force against the peace officer(s).\" Following a jury trial, he was convicted as charged, and the superior court sentenced him to three years' imprisonment. Matthews timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4033(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Jurden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311121\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/526/\">\n    239 Ariz. 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311121\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/526/\">\n    373 P.3d 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). In 2012, the Legislature amended A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2508 to add \"passive resistance\" as a means by which a person can resist arrest. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2508(A)(3) ; 2012 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 265, \u00a7 1 (50th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess.). \"Passive resistance\" is defined as \"a nonviolent physical act or failure to act that is intended to impede, hinder or delay the effecting of an arrest.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2508(C). Matthews argues that this addition to the statute demonstrates a legislative intent to make resisting arrest a victimless crime, and thus that the arresting officers in this case should not have been designated as victims. But the statutory amendment did not remove subsection (A)(1), under which Matthews was charged and which\n   <em>\n    Sorkhabi\n   </em>\n   held was an offense against an officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sorkhabi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"946308\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/202/450/#p452\">\n    202 Ariz. at 452-53, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"946308\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/202/450/#p452\">\n    46 P.3d at 1073-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And passive resistance was not at issue in this case-Matthews was not charged with it, nor did the evidence suggest he should have been. We will not infer that the amendment providing an additional way to commit resisting arrest changed the statute's meaning so as to supersede\n   <em>\n    Sorkhabi\n   </em>\n   's holding.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blevins v. Gov't Emps. Ins.

Because Matthews was charged and convicted under (A)(1), which the amendment left untouched,\n   <em>\n    Sorkhabi\n   </em>\n   remains controlling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 Matthews's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Jurden\n   </em>\n   is similarly unavailing. In that case, the Arizona Supreme Court analyzed whether the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits multiple resisting arrest convictions that arise from a single uninterrupted course of conduct.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311121\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/526/\">\n    239 Ariz. at 527, \u00b6 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311121\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/526/\">\n    373 P.3d at 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court determined that resisting arrest is an event-directed crime (as opposed to a victim-directed crime), which permits only one conviction per single event of resisting arrest even if that event involves multiple officers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311121\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/526/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311121\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/526/\">\n    at 527-28, 532, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311121\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/526/\">\n    373 P.3d at 544-45, 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Contrary to Matthews's contention,\n   <em>\n    Jurden\n   </em>\n   is not inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Sorkhabi\n   </em>\n   because the number of charged offenses does not dictate the number of victims resulting from the charged offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Citing\n   <em>\n    Jurden\n   </em>\n   , he argues that unlike the assault statute, \u00a7 13-2508 is not meant to protect the officer, but rather to punish those who interfere with State authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311121\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/526/\">\n    239 Ariz. at 531, \u00b6 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311121\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/526/\">\n    373 P.3d at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Under \u00a7 13-2508(A)(1), resisting arrest involves using or threatening force against an officer. Under (A)(3), resisting arrest includes \"[e]ngaging in passive resistance,\" which subsection (C) defines as \"a nonviolent physical act or failure to act that is intended to impede, hinder or delay the effecting of an arrest.\" But committing resisting arrest using physical force against the officer under (A)(1) means the person cannot have committed resisting arrest by passive resistance under (A)(3), because using or threatening force is not \"nonviolent.\" Therefore, resisting arrest by passive resistance is not a lesser-included offense of resisting arrest under (A)(1), but instead is merely an alternative way to commit resisting arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16 Furthermore, the evidence did not support an instruction on passive resistance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Matthews did not contest that he physically struggled with the police. In fact, he testified that while he was \"screaming and stuff,\" he was trying to \"[g]et [the officer's] knee off of [his] back.\" And\n   Matthews did not present any evidence that he engaged in nonviolent physical acts-for example, he did not run away without making physical contact or make his body limp to make it difficult for the officers to effect the arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Cir. 1990) (noting the \"passive act of going or remaining limp\"). Accordingly, the court did not err by declining to give Matthews's requested passive resistance instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 17 Matthews next contends that the court erred by declining to instruct the jury that an officer may not use excessive force while making an arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3881(B). An officer's use of physical force is \"excessive\" if it goes beyond that which is \"immediately necessary to effect the arrest or detention.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-409(1). As noted in the Revised Arizona Jury Instructions (\"RAJI\"), an excessive force instruction under \u00a7 13-3881(B) is appropriate only when the defendant claims his resistance was justified by an officer's excessive use of force. RAJI Stat. Crim. 38:81, Use Note (4th ed. 2017);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-404(B)(2) (resisting arrest may be justified as a response to an officer's use of excessive force).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 18 The superior court instructed the jury on \u00a7 13-3881(A), which provides that \"[a]n arrest is made by an actual restraint of the person to be arrested,\" but declined Matthews's request to instruct on subsection (B), which clarifies that \"[n]o unnecessary or unreasonable force shall be used in making an arrest, and the person arrested shall not be subjected to any greater restraint than necessary for his detention.\" The court reasoned that, based on Matthews's arguments and the evidence presented at trial, an instruction on excessive force would be irrelevant and confusing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 19 Matthews did not explicitly argue at trial that the officers used excessive force, nor did he present a justification defense. Instead, Matthews's counsel asserted during opening statement and closing argument that Matthews did not intend to avoid arrest, suggesting that the alleged \"resistance\" was actually an involuntary reflex to the severe pain caused by an officer's knee pressing against the bullet wound on Matthews's back. Matthews therefore did not argue that his resistance was excused by excessive force; rather, he argued that he did not resist in the first place. Although Matthews testified that an officer pressed his knee against his back after he had warned the officers about his wound, and that he had to be taken to the hospital for his wound, such evidence does not show that the officers used \"unnecessary or unreasonable force\" within the meaning of the statute; it merely shows that the force the officers used-regardless of its reasonableness-caused Matthews severe pain. Moreover, other evidence indicated that Matthews's movements, even before the officers made physical contact with him, suggested he was trying to get away, and not simply responding to allegedly excessive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 20 Matthews's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
