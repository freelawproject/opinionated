Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    236 Or. 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    385 P.2d 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963). That decision set out the common-law rule that a party may not appeal from a voluntarily-requested judgment. For reasons we explain below, we conclude that the judgment was appealable and remand the case to the Court of Appeals. We are not asked to-and we do not-express any view on the merits of plaintiff's appeal or on the reviewability of the issues raised by plaintiff in his appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff worked as a driver for defendant Driver Resources, LLC. The other two defendants are related companies. In November 2013, plaintiff filed a class-action complaint against defendants, on behalf of himself and other similarly situated drivers. At issue was defendants' compliance with Oregon's wage and hour laws, as set out in ORS chapters 652 and 653. In January 2014, defendants filed a petition to compel arbitration, on the basis of an agreement that plaintiff had signed with one defendant. Plaintiff responded to the petition by arguing that the agreement was unconscionable, and therefore that arbitration should not be compelled. The trial court granted defendants' petition, requiring plaintiff to proceed to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff made several attempts to obtain appellate review of the trial court's order compelling arbitration. First, plaintiff filed an interlocutory appeal, arguing that the order compelling arbitration was appealable under ORS 19.205(2), which allows interlocutory appeals of court orders affecting substantial rights. The Court of Appeals dismissed that appeal on the grounds that the order compelling arbitration was not appealable. Second, in December 2014, plaintiff asked the trial court to amend its order compelling arbitration to state that the order presented \"a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion\" for the purposes of ORS 19.225, a statute that gives the Court of Appeals discretion to hear interlocutory appeals in cases involving class actions in which\n   the trial court makes such a finding. The trial court denied that motion. Finally, in March 2015, plaintiff moved to dismiss all of his claims with prejudice. Plaintiff explained to the court that the order compelling arbitration effectively precluded any recovery by plaintiff, because plaintiff was unemployed and could not afford to pay the arbitrators, and that the purpose of the dismissal was to allow plaintiff to appeal the judgment and obtain review of the order compelling arbitration. Plaintiff's counsel stated, \"If we do not convince the Court of Appeals or if we get AWOP'd and nobody wants to hear it or write an opinion on it, then the case is over, my client loses, it's done.\" The trial court, without expressing a view on plaintiff's factual contentions, granted the motion to dismiss and entered a general judgment of dismissal with prejudice, one that made clear that the dismissal was at plaintiff's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff filed an appeal from that judgment in the Court of Appeals. Defendants moved to dismiss the appeal on two grounds. First, defendants argued that this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   prevented appeal of a voluntary dismissal. Second, defendants argued that plaintiff's attempt to appeal an order granting a motion to compel arbitration is barred by ORS 36.730, which governs certain appeals in cases involving arbitration. They contended that that statute creates an exception to ORS 19.205(1), which generally permits appeal of a general judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Appellate Commissioner rejected defendants' second argument, determining that ORS 19.205(1), in combination with ORS 19.245, provided a statutory basis allowing plaintiff to appeal the general judgment of dismissal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Appellate Commissioner\n   held that\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   prevented plaintiff from taking an appeal and entered an order dismissing the appeal on that ground. Plaintiff petitioned for reconsideration of the Appellate Commissioner's decision by the Court of Appeals. That petition was denied. Plaintiff then filed a petition for review of the dismissal of the appeal in this court, which we allowed.\n   ORS 19.205(1) provides that \"[u]nless otherwise provided by law, a limited judgment, general judgment or supplemental judgment, as those terms are defined by ORS 18.005, may be appealed as provided in this chapter.\" In this case, plaintiff attempts to appeal a general judgment. ORS 19.245(1) provides that, subject to exceptions that do not apply here, \"any party to a judgment may appeal from the judgment.\" Those statutes authorize plaintiff to appeal the general judgment of dismissal entered here, unless some other rule of law prevents the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As they did before the Court of Appeals, defendants argue that two separate legal rules bar plaintiff's appeal in this case. First, defendants argue that this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   prevents plaintiff from appealing.\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   announced a common law rule \"that a party may not appeal from a judgment which he voluntarily requested.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    236 Or. at 416-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    385 P.2d 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, defendants argue that a provision of the Oregon Uniform Arbitration Act, ORS 36.730, bars plaintiff's appeal. That statute permits interlocutory appeals of orders \"denying a petition to compel arbitration,\" ORS 36.730(1)(a), or \"granting a petition to stay arbitration,\" ORS 36.730(1)(b), but contains no analogous provision permitting an interlocutory appeal of an order granting a petition to compel arbitration. Defendants draw from that omission the inference that an order compelling arbitration is not subject to an interlocutory appeal and that any challenge to such an order must come in a post-arbitration appeal from a judgment that follows the arbitration decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We first turn to\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   , which was the basis for the Appellate Commissioner's order dismissing plaintiff's appeal. As to\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff's arguments are twofold. Plaintiff first argues that revisions to Oregon's statutes concerning judgments and appealability, most notably in Oregon Laws 2003, chapter 576, section 85, have displaced the common-law rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   . Presently, as noted, ORS 19.205(1) provides that \"[u]nless otherwise provided by law, a limited judgment, general judgment or supplemental judgment * * * may be appealed as provided in this chapter.\" In addition, ORS 19.245(1) entitles \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   party to a judgment\" (emphasis added) to take an appeal. Plaintiff\n   argues that by enacting those explicit and comprehensive statutes permitting any party to a judgment to appeal that judgment, the legislature abrogated the\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The flaw in plaintiff's argument is that there is no material difference between the text of the statutes that plaintiff relies upon and the text of the equivalent statutes when\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   was decided.\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   19.020 (1963), the analogous provision to ORS 19.245, stated that \"[a]ny party to a judgment or decree, other than a judgment or decree given by confession or for want of an answer, may appeal therefrom.\" And\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 19.010(1) (1963), the predecessor of ORS 19.205(1), provided that \"[a] judgment or decree may be reviewed on appeal as prescribed in this chapter.\" Thus, although there are modest differences between\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 19.010(1) (1963) and current ORS 19.205(1), none appear to have been intended to displace the\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   rule. In fact, the most significant change cuts in the other direction. ORS 19.205(1), unlike\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 19.010(1) (1963), begins with the caveat \"[u]nless otherwise provided by law.\" Since common-law rules, like that announced in\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   , form part of the law, that addition indicates that the enactment of ORS 19.205 did not, and was not intended to, abrogate\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   . Neither party has presented any legislative history-nor has our own review disclosed any-that suggests otherwise. As a result, we conclude that the rule set out in\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   remains good law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff's second argument is that, even if\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   does apply generally, it has an exception that is applicable to this case. In\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   , this court suggested that the rule against appeal of a voluntary nonsuit might not apply \"[i]f the plaintiff takes a nonsuit because of\n   <em>\n    a ruling which precludes recovery\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    236 Or. at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    385 P.2d 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Plaintiff argues that this exception applies to his case because the cost and limitations involved in arbitrating his claims mean that, as a practical matter, he cannot afford to proceed with the arbitration. Plaintiff also recognizes that, because the dismissal was with prejudice, if he loses on appeal he cannot refile his action. Defendants counter by arguing that the exception to\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   will apply only if plaintiff can show that recovery through arbitration is impossible. Defendants assert that plaintiff has not\n   presented sufficient evidence that the ruling compelling arbitration precludes his recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To determine the scope of the exception, we first examine\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   itself and then review our later cases that followed it and applied its rule. The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   was an automobile passenger who suffered injuries in a collision. He brought an action against both the driver of the car in which he was riding, Robinson, and the driver of the other car, Prindel. Both defendants raised defenses against the plaintiff's claims. The plaintiff demurred to both defenses, but the trial court ruled against him. At the close of the plaintiff's case, the trial court granted Robinson's motion for an involuntary nonsuit on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to prove the elements of the claim against him.\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    236 Or. at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    385 P.2d 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff did not want to continue the case against Prindel alone, presumably for tactical reasons, so he moved for a voluntary nonsuit against Prindel, which was granted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    at 415-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    385 P.2d 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff then appealed both judgments and also filed a new, separate action against Prindel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    at 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    385 P.2d 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Both Robinson and Prindel moved to the dismiss the appeals against them. This court allowed the appeal of the judgment pertaining to Robinson to go forward.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the court dismissed the appeal with respect to Prindel, invoking \"the general rule that a party may not appeal from a judgment which he voluntarily requested.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    at 416-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    385 P.2d 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted, the court allowed that the rule might not apply \"[i]f the plaintiff takes a nonsuit because of a ruling which precludes recovery\" but found that that situation was not presented in the case before it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    385 P.2d 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   was designed to address a particular abuse of the legal system.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 417 n. 1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    385 P.2d 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As Oregon law operated at the time, a plaintiff could end her action with a voluntary nonsuit.\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   ORS 18.230 (1963).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   That nonsuit ended the case, but without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   ORS 18.250 (1963).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the plaintiff could, if she chose, refile the same claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Presently, under the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure, a plaintiff can still voluntarily dismiss her action without prejudice-the equivalent of a nonsuit-but can also opt to do so\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   prejudice, as provided by ORCP 54 A(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The practice that the\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   court sought to prevent can be summarized as follows: A plaintiff who had obtained an unfavorable ruling on a preliminary issue could move for a nonsuit and appeal the resulting judgment, obtaining review of the ruling. Should the plaintiff win the appeal, her action would be revived with the preliminary issue\n   resolved in her favor. Should the plaintiff lose the appeal, however, she could simply refile her action.\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    236 Or. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   417 n. 1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    385 P.2d 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Francisco v.

Hence the rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   : If a plaintiff sought a voluntary nonsuit, she could not appeal the resulting judgment.

As in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , the analysis did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   turn on whether the plaintiff's recovery on the voluntarily dismissed claim had been precluded by a prior ruling of the trial court at the time of the dismissal. What mattered was that the plaintiff would be barred from\n   <em>\n    further\n   </em>\n   litigation of the dismissed claim by\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   if the appeal were unsuccessful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Having examined our cases, we turn to the task of clarifying the exception to the\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   rule. That exception was initially articulated, very briefly and in a hypothetical statement, as one that would apply \"[i]f the plaintiff takes\n   a nonsuit because of a ruling which precludes recovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    236 Or. at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n    385 P.2d 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That statement, however, was made in a case in which\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   bar the plaintiff from refiling his claim and in the context of statutes that did not provide for voluntary dismissals with prejudice, or the equivalent, in actions at law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Read literally, as defendants propose,\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   's articulation of the exception would suggest that we should examine the record to discern whether, as a factual matter, plaintiff still had some possibility of recovery on the claims that he moved to dismiss. But that is not how our subsequent cases have applied the exception, and that literal reading cannot be squared with the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   or the result in\n   <em>\n    Sheets\n   </em>\n   . Nor is defendants' limited view of the exception necessary to advance the purpose of the\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   rule. That rule was imposed only to prevent a plaintiff from both obtaining appellate review of a preliminary issue and retaining the ability to refile the same claim, should the plaintiff lose on appeal. A dismissal of all claims\n   <em>\n    with prejudice\n   </em>\n   fully prevents plaintiffs from employing that strategy. For those reasons, we hold that\n   <em>\n    Steenson\n   </em>\n   does not bar appeal when there is a judgment on all claims and any voluntarily dismissed claims were dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Applying that rule to these facts is straightforward. This case involves a dismissal with prejudice of all of plaintiff's claims. Plaintiff cannot refile those claims after this appeal. To the contrary, having voluntarily foregone the possibility of recovery through arbitration, plaintiff's action is at an end if he does not prevail on appeal. He is in a similar position to the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , who were willing to\n   accept nonsuit of another, related, claim in order to obtain an appeal. In this case, had plaintiff not dismissed his claims with prejudice, he could have pursued them in arbitration. Plaintiff gave that up. Plaintiff's acceptance of that cost-his \"willingness to forego litigation,\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2151428\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/279/139/\">\n    279 Or. at 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2151428\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/279/139/\">\n    566 P.2d 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -distinguishes this case from an interlocutory appeal. For that reason, any\n   dispute over whether plaintiff\n   <em>\n    correctly\n   </em>\n   judged that he would be unable to prevail on his claims through arbitration, or would\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   have been unable to afford arbitration, is irrelevant. Plaintiff's appeal falls within the exception because, as in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sheets\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff's only opportunity to obtain relief is on appeal; plaintiff dismissed his claims with prejudice and cannot refile them if he is unsuccessful on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We turn to defendants' second argument, that ORS 36.730 creates an exception to the general rule of ORS 19.205(1) that a party can appeal a general judgment and prohibits plaintiff from pursuing his appeal. ORS 36.730(1) allows the interlocutory appeal of orders \"denying a petition to compel arbitration\" or \"granting a petition to stay arbitration.\" But ORS 36.730(1) contains no provision permitting an interlocutory appeal of an order granting a petition to compel arbitration. Defendants argue that because of that omission, plaintiff's appeal must be dismissed. We disagree. As we have discussed above, this case does not involve an interlocutory appeal. Instead, the trial court entered a judgment dismissing plaintiff's action with prejudice and plaintiff appealed that judgment. This appeal is therefore from a general judgment and is statutorily authorized by ORS 19.205(1) and ORS 19.245(1). Nothing in ORS 36.730(1) prevents plaintiff from appealing the final, general judgment in his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We allowed review to consider only whether plaintiff's appeal was correctly dismissed, and we have concluded that it was not. The learned Appellate Commissioner pointed out in his order, however, that certain of defendants' arguments may more appropriately be directed to what issues the Court of Appeals may properly review on appeal rather than the appealability of the judgment. Those arguments, as well as the merits of plaintiff's assignments of error, are\n   properly considered in the first instance by the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The order of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Under ORAP 7.55, as authorized by ORS 2.570(6), the Appellate Commissioner for the Court of Appeals has authority to \"rule on motions and issue orders in procedural matters in the Court of Appeals.\" ORS 2.570(6).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    <em>\n     Former\n    </em>\n    ORS 18.230 (1963) provided that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    \"A judgment of nonsuit may be given against the plaintiff:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    \"(1) On motion of the plaintiff, at any time before the issues have been joined and the trial of the facts has commenced, unless a counterclaim has been pleaded as a defense; but if the issues have been joined and the trial of the facts has commenced the allowance of the motion shall be subject to the discretion of the court.\"\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    <em>\n     Former\n    </em>\n    ORS 18.250 (1963) stated: \"When a judgment of nonsuit is given, the action is dismissed; but such judgment shall not have the effect to bar another action for the same cause.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Nor was that a mere possibility-as noted, in\n    <em>\n     Steenson\n    </em>\n    itself the plaintiff had filed a new action against Prindel while the appeal of his voluntarily non-suited claim against Prindel was pending.\n    <em>\n     Steenson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n     236 Or. at 416\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4848654\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/236/414/\">\n     385 P.2d 738\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    In fact, the plaintiff acknowledged that his recovery was not precluded.
