Defendant correctly identifies a potential incongruity between our analysis, which listed among the circumstances giving rise to the officer's objectively reasonable perception of danger his \"specific basis to believe that defendant might be carrying a gun,\" and the text of footnote 2 of the opinion, which emphasized that the officer's knowledge that defendant was licensed to carry a concealed handgun \"plays no role in our legal analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568846\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/422/240/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568846\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/422/240/\">\n    at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377 n. 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568846\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/422/240/\">\n    422 P.3d 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We accordingly allow the petition for reconsideration and modify our opinion as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Footnote 2 in the original opinion at page 377 is replaced with a new footnote 2:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   In this case, the officer believed that defendant might be carrying a firearm after learning during the background check that defendant was licensed to carry a concealed handgun. For purposes of our legal analysis, however, it does not matter why the officer perceived a risk that defendant might be carrying a gun during field sobriety tests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The petition for reconsideration is allowed.
