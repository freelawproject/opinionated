On appeal, Defendant contends that under his interpretation of the aggravated fleeing statute, the evidence was insufficient to prove that he endangered the life of another person and, therefore, insufficient to support his conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant\n   further contends that he was entitled to an instruction on the lesser included misdemeanor offense of resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer, which he did not receive. Because we are persuaded that a conviction under the aggravated fleeing statute requires a finding of actual endangerment and the direct and circumstantial evidence at trial was insufficient to support such a finding, we need not address whether Defendant was entitled to a lesser included instruction. Accordingly, we reverse Defendant's conviction for aggravated fleeing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {2} On September 19, 2014, shortly before 3:00 a.m., Officer Capraro was patrolling an area of Las Cruces, New Mexico when he saw a Pontiac Vibe parked nearby and observed a man get out of the driver's side of the car. The man spotted Officer Capraro's police cruiser, ran over to it, and told Officer Capraro that someone had threatened him with a knife and forced him out of his vehicle. Officer Capraro engaged his lights and siren and pursued the vehicle. The car sped away, made a right turn, and the officer lost sight of it. Officer Capraro drove over seventy miles per hour in his attempt to catch up with the vehicle. The roads were wet from a recent rain storm. Officer Capraro subsequently found the vehicle crashed and abandoned in a residential area. The car was determined to have gone onto the sidewalk and hit a sign before coming to a stop. Defendant was ultimately apprehended by a police canine unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {3} Defendant was indicted on one count of armed robbery and one count of aggravated fleeing a law enforcement officer. After a jury trial, Defendant was acquitted of armed robbery, but convicted of aggravated fleeing, a fourth degree felony. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {4} Defendant makes two arguments on appeal. First, Defendant contends that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain his conviction for aggravated fleeing because the State failed to establish that he drove in a manner that endangered the life of any individual. Second, he argues that he was entitled to an instruction on the lesser included misdemeanor offense of resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer. Because we reverse on the first issue, we need not reach Defendant's second argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {5} In order to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support Defendant's conviction for aggravated fleeing, we must first address the contrasting interpretations of the aggravated fleeing statute presented by the parties. Defendant contends that \"[t]he statute and jury instructions in this case required the State to establish that [Defendant] actually endangered the life of another person during the pursuit.\" Defendant contends that an interpretation other than one that requires actual endangerment \"would transform virtually all fleeing into aggravated fleeing\" and would \"fail to give effect to the statutory language requiring that the fleeing be both careless and 'in a manner that endangers the life of another person.' \" Conversely, the State argues that the fleeing statute is intended to protect the public from the danger of high speed chases, and a defendant's culpability should be based on the decision to flee \"and to do so by driving carelessly and dangerously.\" The State contends that \"the Legislature intended that willful, careless driving 'in a manner that endangers the life of another' means careless driving that could result in harm to another person\" and that actual endangerment is not required. According to the State, to interpret the statute as Defendant suggests would be to \"assign culpability based on serendipity[,]\" rather than a defendant's conduct and state of mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Principles of Statutory Construction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {6} Our goal when interpreting statutes is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

A violation of Section 30-22-1.1(A) is a fourth degree felony. Section 30-22-1.1(B). Driving in a manner that endangers another person is an essential element of the aggravated fleeing statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UJI 14-2217 NMRA (\"[T]he state must prove to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt ... [that t]he defendant drove willfully and carelessly in a manner that endangered the life of another person[.]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {8} We view the aggravated fleeing statute as evincing legislative intent to more severely punish people who jeopardize the safety of others while fleeing from law enforcement officers. Historically, conduct intended to thwart the efforts of an arresting officer constituted the misdemeanor crime of resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NMSA 1978, \u00a7 30-22-1 (1981). As noted by our Supreme Court, \"[t]he legislative decision to create the crime of aggravated fleeing suggests a hierarchy of criminal liability based on the aggravated nature of a defendant's conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Padilla\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Padilla II\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784682\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/310/\">\n    2008-NMSC-006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784682\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/310/\">\n    143 N.M. 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784682\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/310/\">\n    176 P.3d 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This aggravated nature exists specifically \"when the person flees in a manner that endangers the lives of others[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784682\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/310/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Importantly, the Legislature chose not to repeal any portion of Section 30-22-1 upon the enactment of 30-22-1.1. Instead, the resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer statute remains in effect and criminalizes conduct related to vehicular flight from law enforcement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-22-1(C) (\"Resisting, evading or obstructing an officer consists of ... willfully refusing to bring a vehicle to a stop when given a visual or audible signal to stop, whether by hand, voice, emergency light, flashing light, siren or other signal, by a uniformed officer in an appropriately marked police vehicle[.] ... Whoever commits resisting, evading or obstructing an officer is guilty of a misdemeanor.\"). The logical inference to be drawn from the Legislature's decision not to repeal any portion of Section 30-22-1 is that an individual may flee from law enforcement, even in a vehicle, without triggering prosecution under the aggravated fleeing statute, so long as the fleeing individual does not endanger others in the process.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is to this conduct that we look to determine whether Defendant endangered another person within the meaning of the aggravated fleeing statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {13} Even when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the guilty verdict, we conclude that the State has not presented sufficient evidence to prove that Defendant endangered another person as required by the statute. The State did not present any evidence that Defendant's flight from police actually endangered another person. Rather, the State contends that Defendant's \"driving at least [seventy] miles per hour through a residential area, on a wet and slippery road, with at least one curve in it[;] ... crash[ing] the car into a traffic sign[;] rendering the car inoperable[;] and [getting] out of the car and [leaving] it in the middle of the roadway\" were dangerous actions that \"created a potential for harm to the public.\" There was not, however, any evidence presented that Defendant encountered any other motorists on the roadway. As such, no reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant endangered another person within the meaning of the aggravated fleeing statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-22-1.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {14} Moreover, to the extent the State contends Officer Capraro was placed in danger through his pursuit of Defendant, we again conclude that there was insufficient evidence presented for a reasonable jury to have found actual endangerment of the officer as a result of Defendant's driving. The evidence presented established that Officer Capraro lost sight of Defendant shortly after engaging his emergency equipment and later found the car Defendant had been driving crashed and abandoned. While the State asserts that the officer's pursuit of Defendant at seventy miles per hour on rain-slicked roads supports Defendant's conviction for aggravated fleeing, the State's argument is just another means of asserting that potential danger is sufficient. However, it is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {15} This is not to say that endangerment requires that a fleeing motorist pass within inches of another vehicle or that an accident is avoided only through extraordinary evasive maneuvering by another driver. When a jury returns a verdict based on evidence indicating actual endangerment, that verdict should not be disturbed. However, when, as here, the record is completely devoid of evidence of actual endangerment to passengers or other motorists, the verdict cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {16} For the foregoing reasons, we reverse Defendant's conviction for aggravated fleeing a law enforcement officer, contrary to Section 30-22-1.1. As a result, we do not reach Defendant's argument that he was entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser included misdemeanor offense of resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {17}\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   JULIE J.
