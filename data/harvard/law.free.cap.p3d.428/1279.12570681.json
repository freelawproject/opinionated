A.A.'s mother, Jessica Wrigley, I.W., a minor child, and the Estate of A.A. (collectively the Wrigleys) appeal the trial court's grant of partial summary judgment, which dismissed all of the Wrigleys' negligence-based claims against the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   relating to the death of A.A. The Wrigleys also appeal the trial court's denial of their motion for leave to amend their complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 The Wrigleys argue that DSHS owed A.A. a duty of care under (1) former RCW 26.44.050 (2012), (2) the shelter care order, and (3) the special relationship doctrine. The Wrigleys also argue the trial court abused its discretion when it denied their motion for leave to file an amended complaint because DSHS cannot show it would have been prejudiced by such an amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 On cross-appeal, DSHS argues that (1) the Wrigleys' claims fail as a matter of law based on a lack of proximate cause and (2) the trial court abused its discretion when it refused to strike opinions offered by the Wrigleys' expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that DSHS owed the Wrigleys a duty of care under former RCW 26.44.050. Consequently, we reverse the order granting DSHS's motion for partial summary judgment and dismissing the Wrigleys' claim under former RCW 26.44.050. In the unpublished portion, we decline to address the issue of duty under the shelter care order and the special relationship doctrine under RAP 9.12, because it was not called to the attention of the trial court. We also hold that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied the Wrigleys' motion to amend their complaint to add a general negligence theory. Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of any other negligence-based claims, because the trial court should have granted the Wrigleys leave to amend their complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 On the cross-appeal, we do not reach the issue of proximate cause because we hold that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied the Wrigleys' motion to amend. Finally, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to strike the opinions offered by the Wrigleys' expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Substantive Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Jessica Wrigley\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Viles met in December 2004, and Jessica became pregnant with A.A. in February 2005. After she became pregnant, Jessica claims Viles' behavior toward her changed; for example, he became more controlling and verbally abusive. She asserts his behavior began to escalate and he began threatening and abusing her physically, even threatening to kill her several times. According to Jessica, Viles used methamphetamine, cocaine, ketamine, and heroin and abused alcohol throughout their brief relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 On August 26, 2005, Jessica sought a protection order, which the court granted on September 10. A.A., their son, was born on October 19. On November 7, Jessica sought renewal and modification of the protection order because Viles had been loitering outside of her home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Viles' violent behavior and abuse of drugs and alcohol predated his relationship with Jessica and continued after their relationship ended. From 1998-2001, Viles was held in juvenile detention at various times for assaultive behavior and suicidal threats. In February 2000, Viles was taken into mental protective custody after making suicidal threats. Viles' mother, Rose Viles, informed law enforcement that Viles \"ha[d] problems with his violent tendencies.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 530. Viles was again taken into mental protective custody in July 2000 after he attempted suicide. In August 2000, Viles was incarcerated at the Psycho Social Rehab Center in Pocatello, Idaho, where he had to be physically restrained after assaulting an inmate. Viles \"became combative and began throwing the chair around and yelling and screaming\" when law enforcement confronted him. CP at 536. Then, in September 2000, Viles' mother called law enforcement due to a domestic disturbance between Viles and her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 In 2001, Viles pled guilty to battery. In 2002, he pled guilty to minor in possession and was accused of rape. The alleged victim completed a computer voice stress analysis that concluded she was being truthful; Viles would not participate in the stress test due to advice from his counsel. In June 2002, law enforcement was called to a physical altercation between Viles and his girlfriend, Jami Carranza. In October 2002, Viles' grandfather, Roy Viles,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   reported a domestic disturbance between him and Viles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 In September 2003, law enforcement was called because of a domestic disturbance between Viles and Carranza. During the investigation, Viles admitted to pushing Carranza. After a physical altercation with law enforcement, Viles pled guilty to disturbing the peace. In May 2004, Carranza reported to law enforcement that Viles had arrived at her home intoxicated, gotten into an argument, and drove away drunk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 In October 2005, Roy reported another domestic disturbance between Viles and him. Roy reported that Viles had physically threatened him and was using drugs. In January 2006, Viles was stabbed with a screwdriver during a fight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13 In January 2007, Viles pled guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor when he provided alcohol to and harbored a 15 year old runaway female. Viles admitted to law enforcement he had marijuana in his home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14 In January 2009, Ramon Garcia, Carranza's fiance, reported Viles breaking into a shed in his back yard. Viles was charged with unlawful entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 15 In December 2011, William Viles\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Ashley Eskelson called law enforcement to report Viles had come to their home and threatened to \"break [William's] neck.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   CP at 586-88. This incident occurred one month before DSHS placed A.A. with Viles, described below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 16 Jessica married Jared Wrigley on November 30, 2007. In 2010, the Wrigleys, including A.A., moved from Idaho to Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 17 A.A.'s first contact with DSHS occurred at age five in the summer of 2011, when his Catholic Community Services individual mentor made four reports to DSHS concerning the possible abuse and neglect of A.A. by the Wrigleys. Child Protective Services (CPS) assigned the case to Kim Karu for investigation. After Karu's investigation, CPS transferred their case to Family Voluntary Services (FVS) at the end of August 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 18 On September 29, FVS employee, Rachel Whitney, made a routine health and safety visit, traveling to Jessica's home after\n   she discovered A.A. did not attend school. After arriving at the their home, she observed A.A. shaking, his eyes tearing, his lips and mouth area appeared red, and she observed bruising on his jaw and cheek that had not been there during her visit a week earlier. Jessica explained that she had put hot pepper sauce in A.A.'s mouth, which caused the observable redness, because he called her a name. Whitney asked A.A. what happened and he said that when his mother \"opened his mouth with her fingers to put in the hot sauce he screamed because it hurt so bad.\" CP at 139. A.A. also said that his father spanked him with his hand or belt for wetting the bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 19 Whitney noted that Jessica appeared aggravated. Jessica stated to Whitney that she wanted to put A.A. up for adoption. Whitney recommended putting A.A. into a voluntary out-of-home placement for two weeks and Jessica agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 20 CPS assigned the case to Jennifer Gorder, and Gorder interviewed A.A. the next day at his school. A.A. stated that he was spanked by his father with a belt for wetting his pants. Gorder noted and photographed bruises on A.A.'s spine, side, face, and above his buttocks. Gorder noted that the bruises on A.A.'s back and forearm were linear, which indicated they may have been made with a belt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 21 At an October 4 family team decision meeting, Jessica informed CPS that she had a restraining order against Viles because of threats he made against her. Jessica told the social workers that Viles had threatened to cut her head off, had tried to run over her, had dragged her upstairs by her hair, and had a reputation for violence in Pocatello.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 22 On October 5, DSHS filed a dependency petition regarding A.A., based on Gorder's investigation. The dependency petition informed the court of the restraining order between Jessica and Viles. Both A.A. and his younger brother, I.W., were removed from Jessica's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 23 Gorder, meanwhile, located Viles, who showed interest in having custody of A.A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Viles communicated the same desire to Whitney. Gorder ran a \"Purpose Code C\" background check on Viles through National Crime Information Center (NCIC), which requests criminal history information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. According to Gorder, Viles' background check did not raise concern. DSHS Centralized Services Administrator, Christopher Parvin, reviewed Viles' Idaho Repository Case History. Parvin was responsible for overseeing all DSHS background check programs. Parvin asserted that none of the information, crimes, or infractions contained in Viles' case history were disqualifying under the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, Public Law 105-89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 24 On October 11, Viles agreed to shelter care for A.A., and the hearing regarding Jessica was set for October 25. The shelter care hearing was continued over the next three months. During that time, Viles continued to make it known, both personally and through his attorney, that he wanted A.A. placed with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 25 A.A.'s case was reassigned to CPS social worker Don Watson. Watson conducted an initial investigation regarding the placement of A.A. with Viles, calling several references Viles provided, and speaking with Viles directly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 26 On October 24, Watson called Jessica to obtain additional information about Viles and she told him that Viles had an extensive criminal history, had been arrested for providing alcohol to minors, had a restraining order against him, and that A.A. had never met him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 27 On January 25, 2012, Watson entered a note in the file that included Jessica's concerns about A.A. being placed with Viles due to his history of domestic violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 28 On January 30, the court heard Viles' motion to have A.A. released from shelter care and placed with him in Idaho. Viles' attorney asserted that \"[t]here was absolutely no allegations about [Viles] in the [dependency] petition. The only problem was that he hadn't had contact with the child,\" and Viles had been addressing that. CP at 293-94. DSHS, through an Assistant Attorney General (AAG), indicated that because A.A. was not dependent and therefore not within the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC), DSHS could not \"make a fully informed recommendation\" as to A.A.'s placement. CP at 299-300. The AAG indicated, however, that besides the lack of parenting relationship, \"the Department has no other concerns.\" CP at 300.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 29 The AAG and CPS social worker Watson did not provide to the court all of the background information Watson had gathered. Neither the AAG nor Watson informed the court about Viles' prior arrests or Jessica's allegations of violence and concerns regarding placement of A.A. with Viles. Jessica did not appear at the hearing. The Wrigleys' attorneys did not fully relay the concerns she had expressed to Watson to the court. They advised the court that Jessica's \"separation from Mr. Viles and apparently at least some of their relationship was pretty rocky.\" CP at 306. They also stated that they had heard from Jessica that Viles was violent, and that she had \"grave concern regarding [A.A.'s] well-being.\" CP at 304. In addition, the court heard testimony from A.A.'s therapist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 30 At the conclusion of testimony, the court ordered A.A. released from shelter care and placed with Viles \"for a [30 day] visit,\" and allowed Viles to take A.A. home that day. CP at 203-04. The court set another hearing date for late February, directing that both Watson and A.A.'s therapist should check in on A.A. during the intervening weeks. Watson and A.A.'s therapist checked in with A.A. several times, but there was no indication Viles had abused or neglected A.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 31 When Jessica learned A.A. had been placed with Viles, she \"called Mr. Watson hysterical\" and reminded him again of the incidents in which Viles had been violent with her or threatened her. CP at 880. She told him that because of A.A.'s behavioral problems, if A.A. was with Viles, \"he would be dead within six months.\" CP at 880. She stated she did not want A.A. \"to be placed with Mr. Viles.\" CP at 238. Watson told Jessica about the upcoming February hearing date at which she could voice her concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 32 On February 21, the court held a hearing on whether A.A. should continue placement with Viles. Watson and A.A.'s therapist reported their contacts with A.A. and Viles. Jessica did not attend the hearing. Jessica's attorney suggested they were in agreement with dismissing the dependency petition, which would leave A.A. in Viles' custody. The court specifically made a finding that placement with Viles was in A.A.'s best interest and dismissed the dependency petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 33 Viles beat A.A. to death eight weeks later-he was only six and half years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 34 The Wrigleys filed their amended complaint for damages against DSHS and others on December 16, 2014. The complaint pled wrongful death, negligent investigation, outrage, loss of consortium, negligent misrepresentation, survival action, negligent training/supervision, and publication of private facts. The complaint did not plead general common law negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 35 DSHS moved for partial summary judgment on all negligence claims. The Wrigleys responded in part by submitting a declaration by Sonja Ulrich with expert testimony on DSHS's compliance with its standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 36 On August 5, the court provided an oral ruling on the motion. The trial court order granting in part and denying in part defendants' motion for partial summary judgment made findings of fact and conclusions of law, in part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Based on these records, the Court finds that the following facts are not disputed:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   1. Defendants removed [A.A.] from the home of Jessica and Jared Wrigley based on allegations of abuse and neglect made against the Wrigleys;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   2. The only allegations of abuse and neglect made under RCW 26.44 regarding [A.A.] were related to the Wrigley home;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   3. There is no evidence that the investigation of the allegations related to the Wrigley home was faulty;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   4. DSHS never received any report of abuse or neglect made pursuant to RCW 26.44 regarding Anthony Viles; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   5. Plaintiffs do not allege any negligence-based claims other than those that arise under RCW 26.44.050.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Based on the above undisputed facts, the Court found the following facts were disputed, but construed them in favor of the Plaintiffs for purposes of summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   1. At the January 30, 2012 placement hearing (\"Placement Hearing\"), DSHS offered testimony of social worker Donald Watson that only highlighted positive aspects of the potential placement of [A.A.] with Anthony Viles. Argument by DSHS's representative, Assistant Attorney General, Meghan Collins, also only highlighted positive aspects of the potential placement of [A.A.] with Anthony Viles;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   2. At the Placement Hearing, DSHS took the lead in offering testimony related to [A.A.]'s potential placement with Anthony Viles;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   3. DSHS had more information than it provided to the court at the Placement Hearing; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   4. Social worker Donald Watson's understanding of his authority to conduct an investigation related to [A.A.]'s placement in Anthony Viles' home evolved over time. Social worker Watson believed he did not have authority to utilize tools available via the ICPC process to conduct a more thorough investigation. Information that would have been available to Mr. Watson through a more thorough investigation include: Mr. Viles' juvenile conviction for battery, the restraining order between Jessica Wrigley and Anthony Viles, allegations regarding Anthony Viles' anger issues, and parenting assessment completed as part of custody litigation in which Anthony Viles was a party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   5. In addition, Mr. Watson did not conduct a follow-up investigation regarding the parenting assessment or the restraining order between Mr. Viles and Mrs. Wrigley-information that Mr. Watson was aware of in November 2011, prior to [A.A.]'s placement with Anthony Viles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Based on the foregoing undisputed facts and construing disputed facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, the Court makes the following Conclusions of Law:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   1. Assuming the existence of a duty owed to Plaintiffs by Defendants under RCW 26.44, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendants breached that duty; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   2. Assuming the existence of a duty owed to Plaintiffs by Defendants under RCW 26.44, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendants' breach was the proximate cause of Plaintiffs' injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Based on the above ... undisputed facts and disputed facts and Conclusions of Law, NOW THEREFORE, it is HEREBY Ordered that State Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is GRANTED as to all of Plaintiffs' negligence-based claims including Plaintiffs' claims for Wrongful Death, all Survival Actions, Negligent Investigation, Negligent Training and Supervision, and Loss of Consortium, as Defendants did not owe a duty to Plaintiffs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   CP at 1597-98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 37 Of import, the trial court found, \"Plaintiffs do not allege any negligence-based claims other than those that arise under RCW 26.44.050.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   CP at 1597.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 38 DSHS filed a second motion for summary judgment on all remaining claims, noted for September 16, 2016. The remaining claims included outrage, negligent misrepresentation, and publication of private facts under former RCW 74.13.500 (2009).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 2, the court held a scheduling conference to discuss the impending trial date of October 3. The court continued the trial date because of other trials and conflicts. On September 9, the Wrigleys moved for leave to file an amended complaint to add a claim of general negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 39 At the hearing on the motion to amend, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   THE COURT: So, Mr. Preble, you've been part of this case, even though Mr. Moffitt has been the lead. You signed off on the amended complaint almost two years ago. And the State filed their motion originally in the spring, the one that I heard in July. Why did you not seek leave to amend to add the separate theory for negligence sooner? I remember asking Mr. Moffitt on summary judgment, \"So your whole negligence theory is based upon this statute?\" and he said, \"Yes.\"\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   So why not do it sooner?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   MR. PREBLE: That was, I guess, an error on our part. That was something that had not been obvious to me, and I was not aware of his statement to you. However, I would note that inexcusable neglect is not a basis for denying a motion to amend, according to case law. I don't know that I would call it an excusable neglect, but --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   THE COURT: I didn't ask him why he hadn't had another theory; I just asked him to confirm his complaint, your complaint, was solely - the negligence theory was based solely on the specific statute that the State was addressing in their motion, and he confirmed that that was the case. And then I was surprised to see a motion to add a different theory, because I thought, \"Why didn't that come up when the court was hearing about the negligence topic on summary judgment this summer?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   MR. PREBLE: It should have. It should have. That's all I can say, and I'm regretful. ... [W]e did not concede there was not negligence. The facts were all out there. We said these things were negligent. We just did not include the general negligence claim, which we should have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Sept. 16, 2016) at 19-22. The court orally held as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Of course Civil Rule 15 says leave is given freely if justice so requires, and the case law indicates that the court considers whether there's unfair prejudice in thinking about whether justice requires allowing the amendment of the complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   In specifically considering the context I understand of the specifics of the case, whether there's been undue delay in presenting the new claim. And, in this case, having looked at several of the cases that have reviewed trial courts deciding on motions to amend, I think the facts are very important. This is a case that was filed in 2014. The complaint was amended in late 2014. The parties have been engaged in discovery and motion practice for quite some time, and the court heard comprehensive motion for summary judgment this summer on the negligence claim under the statute that had been pled. And but for the court's schedule and another case that was\n   older, this case would be going to trial in a few weeks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   And all of that is part of the context, and, ultimately, I am going to deny the motion to amend and find that justice does not require the adding of this. I don't find that there is a justification for why this claim could not have been brought sooner. And, over the summer, it was clear that the negligence focus, the legal theory of the plaintiffs, had been throughout the entire case the statutory theory, and the plaintiffs confirmed that in July. And I'm finding that there is prejudice to the defendant if the court allows at this late stage in the case an amendment of this sort. So I'll deny the motion to amend.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   VRP (Sept. 16, 2016) at 36-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 40 In addition to denying the Wrigleys' motion to amend, the court also granted DSHS's motion for summary judgment on all remaining claims and dismissed the Wrigleys' amended complaint for damages.

Former RCW 26.44.050.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 49 Turning first to the definitions of ordinary English, the basic definition of \"occurrence\" is \"something that takes place\"; \"the action or process of happening.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1561 (2002). \"Possible,\" in the present context, is defined as \"that [which] may or might be the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1771. Title 26.44 RCW does not define the term \"report.\" \"Report\" could simply be defined as \"something that gives information.\" WEBSTER'S ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 1925. Alternatively, it could be defined in a more legal sense as \"[a] formal oral or written presentation of facts or a recommendation for action.\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1492 (10th ed. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 50 The requirement to investigate under former RCW 26.44.050 is not triggered by a \"report of abuse or neglect,\" but by a \"report concerning the possible occurrence of abuse or neglect.\" Under its ordinary definitions, the latter phrase can mean a report showing abuse or neglect that may or may not occur; that is, a report suggesting a reasonable possibility of abuse or neglect in the future. Under its ordinary definitions, the phrase also can mean a report of past abuse or neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 51 \"Abuse or neglect\" is defined by former RCW 26.44.020(1) (2012), to include\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, or injury of a child by any person under circumstances which cause harm to the child's health, welfare, or safety, excluding conduct permitted under RCW 9A.16.100 ; or the negligent treatment or maltreatment of a child by a person responsible for or providing care to the child. An abused child is a child who has been subjected to child abuse or neglect as defined in this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 52 \"Negligent treatment or maltreatment,\" in turn, is defined by former RCW 26.44.020(16) to include\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   an act or a failure to act, or the cumulative effects of a pattern of conduct, behavior, or inaction, that evidences a serious disregard of consequences of such magnitude as to constitute a clear and present danger to a child's health, welfare, or safety, including but not limited to conduct prohibited under RCW 9A.42.100.... [E]xposure to domestic violence as defined in RCW 26.50.010 that is perpetrated against someone other than the child does not constitute negligent treatment or maltreatment in and of itself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 53 These definitions simply define \"abuse\" and \"neglect.\" They work equally well whether the phrase, \"concerning the possible occurrence of abuse or neglect,\" is restricted to incidents that have already occurred or whether that phrase also looks to the possibility of abuse or neglect in the future. Former RCW 26.44.050.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 54 Former RCW 26.44.030 (2013), however, speaks more directly to the question. This statute requires individuals in listed roles who have \"reasonable cause to believe that a child\n   <em>\n    has suffered\n   </em>\n   abuse or neglect\" to report the incident to DSHS or law enforcement. Former RCW 26.44.030(1) (emphasis added). The past tense makes clear that mandated\n   reporting extends only to abuse and neglect that has already occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 55 RCW 26.44.050 is phrased differently. It simply says that DSHS must investigate when it receives a report of\n   <em>\n    the possible occurrence\n   </em>\n   of abuse or neglect. If this referred only to reports of past abuse and neglect from mandated reporters, then its use of \"must investigate\" would conflict with the detailed prescriptions in former RCW 26.44.030(11) directing family assessments in response to some mandated reports and investigations in response to others. To avoid this conflict, former RCW 26.44.050 must be interpreted to apply also to reports other than those mandated by former RCW 26.44.030. This conclusion also explains the role of the introductory clause of former RCW 26.44.050, \"[e]xcept as provided in RCW 26.44.030(11).\" For these reasons, former RCW 26.44.030 does not restrict the reference to \"possible occurrence of abuse or neglect\" in former RCW 26.44.050 to past occurrences. Nor does it restrict the information triggering the duty to investigate under former RCW 26.44.050 to reports mandated by former RCW 26.44.030.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 56 To this point, the examination of the terms in the provisions to be interpreted fairly leads to one conclusion: the phrase in former RCW 26.44.050, \"report concerning the possible occurrence of abuse or neglect,\" is ambiguous. It may refer either to abuse or neglect that has already occurred or, in addition, it may also include abuse or neglect which is reasonably possible in the future. The determination of plain meaning, however, does not stop at this point, but also examines \"the context of the statute in which that provision is found, related provisions, and the statutory scheme as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Gorre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12440903\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/184/30/#p37\">\n    184 Wash.2d at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=357%20P.3d%20625\">\n    357 P.3d 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Tingey v.

As part of the very proceeding to place A.A. with Viles, Jessica informed CPS about Viles' extensive criminal history, his arrest for providing alcohol to minors, his threat to cut Jessica's head off, his attempt to run over her, his dragging her up the stairs by her hair, the restraining order against him, and her concerns about A.A. being placed with Viles due to his history of domestic violence. Most strikingly, after the initial 30 day placement with Viles was ordered, Jessica called the CPS social worker and reminded him again of the incidents in which Viles had been violent with her or threatened her and told him flatly that if A.A. was with Viles, \"he would be dead within six months.\" CP at 880. Wrigley's claim does not, as in\n   <em>\n    M.M.S.\n   </em>\n   , place a duty on DSHS to research its archives of past dependencies. Instead, it simply requires DSHS to properly take into account information that was presented directly to it as part of the placement proceeding at issue.\n   <em>\n    M.M.S\n   </em>\n   . does not restrict that duty to investigating reports of past abuse or neglect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 64 Further, the fact that the reports triggering the dependency proceeding were of abuse by Jessica does not erode the responsibility of DSHS to protect the child in making the placement decision. As shown, DSHS received information showing not only the \"possible occurrence\" of abuse or neglect, but a direct threat of harm to A.A. if placed with Viles. DSHS failed to investigate that threat. That failure violated the duty to investigate imposed by former RCW 26.44.050.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 65 To conclude, the phrase \"reports concerning the possible occurrence of abuse or neglect\" in former RCW 26.44.050 contemplates both reports of incidents that have already occurred and reports suggesting a reasonable possibility of future abuse or neglect if the placement decision is made. The record contains evidence, noted above, that DSHS received reports showing a palpable\n   danger to A.A. if he were placed with Viles. The record contains evidence that not only did DSHS fail to adequately investigate those reports, but at the motion on placement with Viles, it also did not provide all material information it had gathered to the dependency court, including information about Viles' prior arrests or Jessica's allegations of violence or her concerns regarding placement of A.A. with Viles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 66 Therefore, we hold the superior court erred in granting partial summary judgment to DSHS on the Wrigleys' negligence claim under former RCW 26.44.050.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 67 A majority of the panel having determined that only the foregoing portion of this opinion will be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports and that the remainder shall be filed for public record in accordance with RCW 2.06.040, it is so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Unpublished Text Follows\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Duty Under the Shelter Care Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 68 The Wrigleys argue DSHS had a duty under the shelter care order to prevent placement of A.A. with his biological father.

Again, the amendment would have done no more than state an alternative theory of negligence, and the underlying facts or circumstances relied on by the Wrigleys are the proper subject of relief. DSHS should not have been shocked or astonished-that is, surprised-when the Wrigleys sought leave to amend after the Wrigleys' statutory negligence claims were dismissed on summary judgment and the case was continued by the trial court.

ER 702 largely establishes when expert testimony may be utilized at trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   ER 703 permits an expert to base his or her opinion on evidence not admissible and to base his or her opinion on facts or data perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. ER 704 permits an expert to testify on an ultimate issue the trier of fact must resolve. Finally, ER 705 indicates that an expert need not disclose the facts on which his or her opinion is based, although the court may require their disclosure and the expert may be subject to cross-examination on them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   \u00b6 90 With these standards in mind, we turn to the admissibility of the expert testimony Ulrich provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   \u00b6 91 DSHS first argues the trial court erred in failing to strike Ulrich's declaration that related to DSHS's noncompliance with procedures set forth in the ICPC. DSHS claims the ICPC\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   did not apply to Viles as the biological parent because A.A. had not been found dependent and cites\n   <em>\n    In re Dependency of D.F.-M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001103\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/157/179/\">\n    157 Wash.

In\n   <em>\n    D.F.-M.\n   </em>\n   , Division One of our court held that the ICPC, which applies to placements in foster care, does not apply to parental placements.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001103\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/157/179/\">\n    157 Wash.

Still, Ulrich expressly acknowledged in her declaration that the ICPC would not apply to the issues involved in this case. Ulrich instead used the ICPC to provide a comparative analysis and discuss \"why an adequate assessment was not completed in this case.\" CP at 1574. Ulrich stated in her declaration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   ICPC is a systematic process intended for use in out-of-state placements for children and families involved in the dependency process. ICPC, as it is intended, does not technically apply in this case, as [A.A.] was not yet a dependent of the State of Washington. However, it is important to note that ICPC also does not\n   <em>\n    prevent\n   </em>\n   the Department from using their available safety and risk assessment tools and fulfilling their legal obligation to assess and plan for the safety of the child in their care and custody. The file review of the case involving [A.A.] revealed that CA [ (Children's Administration) ] staff did not properly use the safety or risk assessment tools as intended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   CP at 967.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   \u00b6 92 Ulrich had 23 years of experience in the area of safety and risk assessment in child welfare and child protection, training and experience as a forensic child interviewing specialist, and was the regional lead for the State of Washington on child safety and child welfare. She also performed independent work interviewing children involved in custodial disputes and had myriad other training and experience in the field. This knowledge, skill, experience, and training qualified Ulrich as an expert on the area of safety and risk assessment in child welfare and child protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   \u00b6 93 Her opinion that the ICPC provided a useful template for DSHS to fulfill their legal obligation to assess and plan for the safety of A.A., who was in their care and custody, would be helpful to the trier of fact insofar as it relates to proper evaluation of risk to child safety and child welfare. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to strike Ulrich's opinion because the protocols generally used in the ICPC are at least minimally relevant to the issue of standard of care in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   \u00b6 94 Next, DSHS argues the trial court erred in failing to strike Ulrich's opinions regarding DSHS's failure to contact Idaho to obtain any records regarding Viles. DSHS claims there is no statute, regulation, policy, or standard that would have required DSHS to do so. Although this much may be true, DSHS had responsibility for the safety and wellbeing of A.A., since he was in their care and custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   \u00b6 95 The information Jessica provided to DSHS regarding Viles' history of domestic violence, history of drug abuse, reputation for violence in his community, and her sincere apprehension that Viles would abuse or neglect A.A. if placed in Viles' home provided a sufficient basis on which Ulrich could form an opinion regarding DSHS's failure to assess the risks of placement with Viles. Ulrich stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   For example, the Department could have asked for a domestic violence assessment, anger management assessment, or a chemical dependency assessment of Mr. Viles. All of these formal assessments, completed by a professional in Idaho, would have led the Department to be able to identify any potential areas of risk and/or safety that they needed to plan for prior to deciding about the appropriateness of transitioning [A.A.] to the home of Mr. Viles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   CP at 971. Ulrich's testimony would have been helpful to the trier of fact insofar as DSHS may have failed to adequately assess the risk and safety of placing A.A. with Viles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   \u00b6 96 We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to strike Ulrich's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   \u00b6 97 We hold that DSHS owed the Wrigleys a duty of care under former RCW 26.44.050, and we reverse the order granting DSHS's motion for partial summary judgment and dismissing the Wrigleys' claim under former RCW 26.44.050. We decline to address the issue of duty under the shelter care order and the special relationship doctrine under RAP 9.12, and we hold the trial court abused its discretion when it denied the Wrigleys' motion to amend their complaint to add a general negligence theory.

The majority reasons that the mother's allegations against the father constitute a report of possible abuse or neglect of a minor child triggering a duty by DSHS to investigate under RCW 26.44.050. The majority reasons that the phrase \"report concerning the possible occurrence of abuse or neglect\" of a minor child in RCW 26.44.050 is ambiguous, and that the phrase \"may refer either to abuse or neglect that has already occurred or, in addition, it may include also abuse or neglect which is reasonably possible in the future.\" Majority at 1288. The majority concludes that legislative intent is ill served by confining RCW 26.44.050 to reports of past abuse or neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   \u00b6 101 The majority's holding expands the scope of DSHS's duty to investigate any report of abuse or neglect of anyone, not just a duty to investigate a report of abuse or neglect of the minor child at issue. I respectfully disagree with the majority's holding that DSHS has a duty of care to the mother to investigate the father under RCW 26.44.050 based on her allegations. For the reasons explained below, I would affirm the superior court's order granting DSHS's partial summary judgment motion and dismissing the negligence claims. I join the majority as to the remaining issues addressed in the majority opinion except for the issue of whether the trial court erred by not striking the mother's expert. I do not reach that issue because DSHS does not have a duty to investigate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   \u00b6 102 I agree with the majority's presentation of the facts, but for clarity the following material facts are outlined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   \u00b6 103 Following reports of abuse of A.A. by his mother, Jessica Wrigley, and his stepfather, Jared Wrigley,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   DSHS filed a dependency petition. Anthony Viles, A.A.'s father, filed a motion with the juvenile court to have A.A. placed with him in Idaho. In relevant part, Jared's attorney stated that Jared was aware of Viles' violent past, he had concerns, and he wanted a \"better investigation done before [A.A.] is moved.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 304-05. Jessica's attorney stated that Jessica had \"no strong position either way.\" CP at 305. After hearing arguments and considering the record, the court granted Viles' motion, ordered A.A. to be released from shelter care, and placed A.A. with Viles \"for a visit\" for 30 days. CP at 312.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   \u00b6 104 In mid-February, Jessica contacted social worker Don Watson and expressed her concerns regarding A.A.'s placement with\n   Viles, telling Watson about Viles' history of violence toward her and him providing alcohol to a minor. She also told Watson that because of A.A.'s behavioral issues, A.A. \"would be dead within six months\" if he were placed with Viles. CP at 880.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   \u00b6 105 Jessica informed DSHS that she previously had a restraining order against Viles because of threats he had made against her, and that he had an extensive criminal history and a reputation for violence. The record also shows that Jessica informed DSHS that Viles had threatened to cut her head off, tried to run over her, and dragged her upstairs by her hair. Further, DSHS knew that Viles had been arrested for harboring a minor runaway and had been convicted of providing alcohol to a minor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   \u00b6 106 Ultimately, the court did not enter a dependency order, and instead found that placement with Viles was in A.A.'s best interest.

When considering whether a clear and present danger exists, evidence of a parent's substance abuse as a contributing factor to negligent treatment or maltreatment shall be given great weight. The fact that siblings share a bedroom is not, in and of itself, negligent treatment or maltreatment.
