In accordance with the jury's recommendation the Honorable James M. Caputo sentenced Mack to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Mack appeals from this conviction and sentence, and raises four propositions of error in support of his appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 During the late afternoon on April 17, 2014, Appellant fatally shot Keondrea Love in the head. Before the crime, Appellant and Love met by chance at an informal convenience store, the Candy Lady's, near their apartment complex. Appellant had a .38 revolver, which he habitually carried. Love was unarmed. Appellant and Love began to argue about the price of haircuts they had given one another. As they walked through the complex the argument escalated, and Appellant shot Love just above his left ear; the bullet exited just above the right ear, slightly in front of the entry wound. Appellant later claimed he thought Love had a gun. The encounter was captured on surveillance video. The video showed Love walking, looking ahead, while Appellant walked about three feet behind him with his left arm fully extended. Love fell, and Appellant brought his arm down and ran away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 In Proposition I Appellant claims the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not act in self-defense. A person may use deadly force in self-defense if a reasonable person in his circumstances and from his viewpoint would reasonably have believed he was in imminent\n   danger of death or great bodily harm.\n   <em>\n    Davis v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6984224\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/268/86/\">\n    2011 OK CR 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 95,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6984224\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/268/86/\">\n    268 P.3d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 114-15. An aggressor, or a person who voluntarily enters a situation armed, cannot claim self-defense.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Once a defendant raises self-defense, the State must overcome the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987180\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/255/425/\">\n    2011 OK CR 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987180\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/255/425/\">\n    255 P.3d 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 432. Through video and an eyewitness account, the State showed that after an argument Appellant, armed with a revolver, followed Love and shot him in the head from behind. Appellant claimed that Love threatened him; he believed Love was armed, and he shot when he thought Love was about to turn and pull a weapon. He argued that this story was supported by the location and trajectory of the wound. On appeal, Appellant essentially repeats these claims, asking this Court to substitute its judgment for that of the jury. We will not do so. Jurors heard the conflicting evidence, and concluded Appellant was not acting in self-defense. We presume jurors resolve conflicts in favor of the prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Sufficient evidence supports the jury's conclusion that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant did not act in self-defense.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, any rational juror could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant did not act in self-defense, and committed first degree murder.\n   <em>\n    Easlick v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9229221\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/90/556/\">\n    2004 OK CR 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9229221\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/90/556/\">\n    90 P.3d 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 559. This proposition is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In Proposition II Appellant claims the trial court should have\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   instructed jurors on imperfect self-defense. At Appellant's request, jurors were properly instructed on self-defense. They rejected that defense. Thus, Appellant's claim that he had a right to instruction on his defense is answered; he claimed self-defense, and he was given the defense instructions. Appellant now argues that instructions on imperfect self-defense should have been included, although he did not raise that defense or request such instructions. We review for plain error.\n   <em>\n    McHam v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8994603\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/126/662/\">\n    2005 OK CR 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8994603\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/126/662/\">\n    126 P.3d 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 670. Plain error is an actual error, that is plain or obvious, and that affects a defendant's substantial rights, affecting the outcome of the trial.\n   <em>\n    Barnard v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980777\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/290/759/\">\n    2012 OK CR 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980777\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/290/759/\">\n    290 P.3d 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 764.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 If imperfect self-defense was ever recognized as a separate legal doctrine in Oklahoma, our current jurisprudence does not do so. Put simply, this is not a thing. It is not recognized as a separate defense in either Oklahoma statutes or case law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Historically, the phrase \"imperfect self-defense\" referred to a defense which did not justify a homicide, but which might reduce the grade of offense to manslaughter. Rollin M. Perkins,\n   <em>\n    Criminal Law\n   </em>\n   1013 (2d ed. 1969). Appellant implicitly recognizes this. He suggests that heat of passion manslaughter is similar to, but not the same as, imperfect self-defense, arguing that imperfect self-defense \"amounts to self-defense but for some legal technicality.\" For example,\n   <em>\n    Wood v. State\n   </em>\n   , discussing manslaughter, notes that a killing done in \"passion resulting from fright or terror ... may be closely akin to a killing in self-defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Wood v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1971%20OK%20CR%20232\">\n    1971 OK CR 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10563486\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/486/750/#p752\">\n    486 P.2d 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 752.\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   further describes manslaughter as a killing where the offender believed he was in great danger and \"acting in self-defense was not himself free from blame.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Appellant suggests that this language in\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   refers to the doctrine of imperfect self-defense.\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   does not delineate a separate defense of imperfect self-defense. Instead, it describes some conditions which satisfy elements of manslaughter.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McHam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8994603\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/126/662/\">\n    2005 OK CR 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8994603\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/126/662/\">\n    126 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   668 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   , finding that heat-of-passion\n   manslaughter instruction may be warranted where self-defense mitigated but did not negate culpability). Similarly,\n   <em>\n    Davis v. State\n   </em>\n   held that where a jury \"might conclude that the defendant's self-defense claim is 'imperfect,' \" and sufficient to mitigate but not negate culpability, a court might instruct on heat-of-passion manslaughter.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6984224\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/268/86/\">\n    2011 OK CR 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 109,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6984224\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/268/86/\">\n    268 P.3d at 117-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This language unmistakably explains that some form of manslaughter instruction may be appropriate where a self-defense claim fails. It does not create or recognize imperfect self-defense as a separate defense and explicitly rejects the idea of any separate instruction on imperfect self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Appellant admits that there is no uniform instruction for imperfect self-defense. He argues that trial courts should use either the heat-of-passion manslaughter instruction or the instruction on manslaughter by resisting criminal attempt, or fashion an instruction from the manslaughter instructions and the facts. Appellant fundamentally misunderstands the law. Appellant suggests that this Court once required an instruction on imperfect self-defense whenever self-defense instructions would be given.\n   <em>\n    Morgan v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1975%20OK%20CR%2089\">\n    1975 OK CR 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10473691\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/536/952/#p956\">\n    536 P.2d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 956,\n   <em>\n    overruled by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walton v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1987%20OK%20CR%20227\">\n    1987 OK CR 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10405505\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/744/977/#p978\">\n    744 P.2d 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 978-79.\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   explicitly discussed instructions for various degrees of\n   <em>\n    manslaughter\n   </em>\n   when self-defense instructions were given; it was overruled in\n   <em>\n    Walton\n   </em>\n   when this rule was found to be too inflexible. Oklahoma does not recognize \"imperfect self-defense\" as a separate defense. The trial court could not have instructed on it. There is no error, and thus no plain error. This proposition is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 In Proposition III Appellant claims trial counsel was ineffective.

Even in states which explicitly recognize the doctrine as a defense, a successful claim of imperfect self-defense results in a conviction for some form of manslaughter.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     People v.
