The Trial Court and the Department Did Not Comply with ICWA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 13 In this case, the trial court first inquired about the applicability of ICWA at a termination hearing regarding J.A.\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   orally ordering termination of parental rights. For purposes of ICWA, this was the second child-custody proceeding involving J.A. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2023.107\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the trial court should have made that inquiry at the first hearing after the petition in dependency and neglect was filed and again at the start of the termination proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 14 Mother responded that (1) both she and the father of J.A. and J.L. had Native American blood and (2) she and her family had been \"kicked off the tribe.\" The trial court ordered her to file a relative affidavit identifying her tribal connections. The court did not ask her about J.A. and J.L.'s father's Indian heritage. And, although the court asked the boys' father about his heritage at the termination hearing involving J.L. and S.M., it never inquired whether any participant knew or had reason to know S.M. was an Indian child. (S.M. has a different father than her brothers; S.M.'s father was not identified, and his parental rights were terminated after service by publication.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15 At a subsequent hearing, mother indicated that she had Indian heritage through her biological family. She indicated her tribe was either \"Sangre de Cristo de Pueblo in Taos,\" Aztec, or Kiowa. Mother, an adoptee, did not know about registered tribal affiliation, but she asserted that her biological mother would have that information. Mother's counsel indicated that he would provide information on mother's biological parents to the Department as soon as he received it from mother. The Department stated that it believed ICWA did not apply, but did not describe what efforts it had made to determine whether any of the children was an Indian child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 16 The federally recognized tribes include the Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma and the Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico, which is located in the Sangre de Cristo mountains.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to Receive Services From the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%204915\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 4915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jan. 17, 2017). So mother's disclosures gave the court reason to believe the children were Indian children. But the record contains no evidence that the Department sent notice to either of these tribes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 17 The Department asserts that mother did not provide a relative affidavit identifying her biological parents. It is true that the Department should try to provide sufficient information for the tribe to make the determination as to whether the child is a member or eligible for membership.\n   <em>\n    L.L.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 37. But the lack of complete information does not relieve the Department of its duty to send notice with the information it has.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2023.111\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3) (notice shall include direct lineal ancestors\n   <em>\n    if known\n   </em>\n   ). Thus, we must remand the case to the trial court so the Department may comply with the notice requirements of ICWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 18 At the termination hearing, mother's counsel stated that he had spoken with mother's adoptive family and determined that \"the ICWA relationship that [mother] had brought to the [c]ourt's attention was not viable.\" But he did not elaborate, so we don't know the basis for his representation. Moreover, it was for the Kiowa and Pueblo of Taos tribes, not mother's adoptive family, to determine whether the children were members or eligible for membership.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    L.L.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    B.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8403661\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/138/299/#p303\">\n    138 P.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (statements, actions, or waiver of a parent cannot overcome otherwise sufficiently reliable information). So counsel's statement did not relieve the Department of its duty to notify the tribes of the child-custody proceeding, and, absent further information from the tribes, did not support a finding by the trial court that the children were not Indian children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 19 The Department contends that the written advisement of rights mother signed shortly after the shelter hearing served as the court's initial inquiry. The advisement form stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   If you, your child or children are a registered member [sic] of a [N]ative American Indian tribe or are eligible to become a member of a [N]ative American Indian tribe, you may be entitled to additional rights and protections under the Indian Child Welfare Act. You must advise the court of this in order to receive these additional rights and protections.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 20 But the 2015 Guidelines directed courts to \"ask[ ] each party to the case, including the guardian ad litem and the agency representative, to certify on the record whether they have discovered or know of any information that suggests or indicates the child is an Indian child.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2010%2C146\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. at 10,152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A written advisement form provided to one participant falls far short of meeting this requirement.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2023.107\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (codifying the duty of inquiry). So we reject the Department's contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 21 We recognize that the 2015 Guidelines, unlike the regulations promulgated in 2016, were not binding on the trial court. But, as recognized by both the 2015 Guidelines and the 2016 Guidelines, early identification of ICWA applicability promotes proper implementation of ICWA at an early stage, protects the rights of Indian children and their families, prevents delays, and avoids sometimes tragic consequences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Guidelines at 11;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2010%2C146\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. at 10,148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 22 Regardless, as discussed above, the termination proceeding was subject to the 2016 Guidelines and regulations. And, more importantly, the Department failed to send notice to the appropriate tribes when mother identified a reason to believe the children were Indian children. Under these circumstances, the record does not support the trial court's finding that ICWA does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   III. Instructions on Remand\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 23 We remand the case to the trial court for the limited purpose of directing the Department to send appropriate notice to the Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma and the Pueblo of Taos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 24 The trial court must afford the tribes a reasonable amount of time to respond to notices sent and must proceed in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201912\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Section 1912(a) provides that no foster care placement hearing or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the tribe. This section further provides that a tribe shall be granted\n   twenty additional days to prepare for such proceeding if the tribe so requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 25 After receiving responses from the tribes or, if no response is received from one or more of the noticed tribes, after the expiration of the time frame under section 1912(a) or a reasonable additional time deemed appropriate by the trial court, the court shall enter factual findings and legal conclusions regarding the application of ICWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 26 If the trial court determines that either of the children is an Indian child, within seven days of the issuance of the trial court's order making such determination, the Department must file notice with this court along with a copy of the trial court's order, and the appeal shall be recertified to permit a division of this court to issue an opinion vacating the termination judgment and remanding the case to the trial court with directions to proceed in accordance with ICWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 27 If the trial court determines that the children are not Indian children, within seven days of issuance of the trial court's order making such determination, the Department must file notice with this court along with a copy of the trial court's order, and the appeal shall be recertified. Within seven days of recertification, the Department must file either (1) a supplemental record consisting of the trial court's order on remand, a transcript of the proceedings on remand, and any notices sent and responses received; or (2) a supplemental designation of record of the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 28 Additionally, within fourteen days of recertification, mother may file a supplemental brief, not to exceed ten pages or 3500 words, limited to addressing the trial court's ICWA determination.
