Apodaca appeals his convictions for one count of aggravated kidnapping, a first degree felony; one count of aggravated robbery, a first degree felony; and one count of obstruction of justice, a second degree felony. He contends the trial court erred in concluding that his incriminating statements to police were voluntary and thus admissible at trial as impeachment evidence. He also contends that his aggravated robbery conviction should be reversed because a jury instruction improperly stated the applicable mental state. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Criminal Episode\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 A codefendant (Codefendant) was one of the State's key witnesses against Apodaca. Codefendant testified at trial that in November 2012 he purchased a small number of oxycodone pills from a sixteen-year-old drug dealer (Victim) and snorted those drugs. He testified that later the same day, he contacted Apodaca and, referring to Victim, said, \"I know this kid we can rob. We can scare him pretty good.\" Codefendant explained that he called Apodaca \"[b]ecause [Apodaca] had a ride,\" and Apodaca told Codefendant that \"he would come through\" by picking up Codefendant. Codefendant further testified that he suggested Apodaca \"find someone who's got a gun ... 'cause if [Victim] sees there's a gun, he's going to ... give [the drugs] up without a fight.\" Apodaca responded that he would \"bring one of his homies.\" When Codefendant later met with Apodaca, another man carrying a gun (Shooter) was already in the car Apodaca was driving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Codefendant testified at trial that he, Shooter, and Apodaca had a plan: after Victim got in the car to sell them drugs, they would \"just pull out the pistol and scare him, make him give the pills up, and then kick him out of the car.\" As this happened, Codefendant would feign surprise and \"act like [he] didn't know what was going on.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 To carry out their plan, Codefendant called Victim and arranged to buy a larger quantity of oxycodone pills from him. Apodaca then drove Codefendant and Shooter to Victim's girlfriend's residence to meet Victim. Codefendant went inside the residence and persuaded Victim to come out, telling\n   him \"[t]hey wanted to do [the deal] in the car.\" Victim got in the backseat behind Apodaca, and Codefendant got in the backseat behind Shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Soon after Victim began counting the oxycodone pills, Apodaca, \"out of nowhere,\" shifted the car into gear and sped off. Immediately after the car pulled away, Shooter pistol-whipped Victim in the head with a .22 caliber revolver and then pointed it at Victim's head. Shooter demanded, \"Give us those fucking pills.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Victim refused. Meanwhile, Codefendant leaned against the door, screaming, \"Just give them the pills.... I don't want to die.\" Victim attempted to open the car door while the car was traveling at approximately forty miles per hour, but the door was locked and would not open. Victim \"told them to let [him] out\" of the car three or four times, but his pleas went unanswered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Victim also testified at trial that he heard Apodaca say, \"Fucking shoot him.\" Similarly, Codefendant testified that Apodaca said, \"Pop his ass.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But on cross-examination, Codefendant expressed uncertainty about who said this and admitted that it \"could have been\" Shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Shooter then shot Victim in the stomach. Although Victim tried to get the gun from Shooter, Shooter ultimately shot him three more times in the leg. Apodaca stopped the car, and Codefendant exited the car and pulled Victim out. When Victim was removed from the car, he no longer had the oxycodone pills and never received payment for them. Apodaca and Shooter sped away, swerving in and out of traffic and \"blow[ing] through\" several red lights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 When the police eventually searched Apodaca's car, the rear floor mats were missing, and the backseat looked as though it had been wet. The police saw blood stains under the rear driver's side seat as well as on the back of the driver's seat and headrest. Once the police apprehended Apodaca, they interviewed him and charged him with several crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    The Motion to Suppress\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Before the case went to trial, Apodaca moved to suppress the statements he made during his interview with the police, asserting that the police violated his Fifth Amendment rights when they continued to question him after he had invoked his constitutional right to remain silent. Apodaca also asserted that the police obtained his statements through coercive inducement and that, as a result, his statements were involuntary and could not be used against him for any purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 In response, the State stipulated that it would not introduce Apodaca's statements in its case-in-chief. But the parties disagreed about whether the State could use Apodaca's statements to impeach his credibility if he testified inconsistently at trial. According to the State, Apodaca's statements were not coerced or involuntarily made, and therefore it could use those statements for impeachment purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Apodaca's interview with two police detectives had three distinct segments. The first was the conversation between the first detective and Apodaca in the police squad car. The second segment took place while a second detective transported Apodaca from the squad car to the interview room. The third segment involved the conversation between Apodaca and both detectives in an interview room at the police station. The first and third segments of the interview were recorded; the second was not. Because there was no record of the second segment, the trial court heard testimony from the second detective and Apodaca before ruling on the motion to suppress. This portion of the proceeding occurred on the second day of trial outside the presence of the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    The First Segment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 The first detective began by telling Apodaca that he would advise Apodaca of his rights. Apodaca responded, \"After you give me my rights though don't ask me no questions cuz [I'm] answering no questions bro.\" The detective informed Apodaca of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and explained that he would not interrogate Apodaca but rather would give him \"the opportunity to tell ... [his] side.\" Apodaca asked, \"What's that gonna do for me?\" He also repeatedly asked to know the charges against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 The detective relayed that Codefendant identified Apodaca as the car's driver but did not identify who the front passenger was. Apodaca denied shooting anyone and stated that he had done nothing wrong, to which the detective again said, \"This is the opportunity for you to give me your side.\" Apodaca wanted to know whether he was \"going to jail [that night] no matter what.\" The detective did not know and said he could ask. Apodaca then stated, \"How can I not go to jail, you guys got to start making me feel more comfortable, cuz I could help anybody as long as I'm gonna get something in the process. I can help you with a lot of things if I get something in the process,\" and he indicated that if the police wanted him to \"give ... somebody up,\" then they had to give something to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 The detective told Apodaca he knew Victim was shot in Apodaca's car. When Apodaca asked again for the charges, the detective said he was unsure but thought Apodaca would be charged with aggravated assault. The detective then asked why Apodaca would not talk, to which he responded, \"Cuz I'm not gonna incriminate myself or tell you about anyone else until I get someone [to] tell me you ain't going to jail.\" The detective told Apodaca he could not do that, but he encouraged Apodaca to talk with him instead of the other detectives because he understood Apodaca's background and his \"hard life.\" Apodaca reiterated that he was not going to incriminate himself \"unless [he was] getting some deals.\" The detective responded that he could not \"give deals,\" only inquire. The detective then asked Apodaca how many people were in the car, and Apodaca responded, \"How about you ask them what's it gonna take for me not to go to jail and maybe I can tell them these things if they're gonna guarantee me to not go to jail.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 After a pause in the interview, during which the detective inquired about Apodaca's charges, the detective identified kidnapping and aggravated robbery among the possible charges, and told Apodaca, \"There's no way that you're not going to jail tonight.\" Apodaca asked if he could talk to his girlfriend, and the detective said he would ask. Apodaca queried about whether their interaction was being recorded, and the detective answered, \"Yeah ... I have to record our conversation.\" Apodaca asked whether the detective could turn off the recorder. The detective responded, \"You want me to turn [the recorder] off?\" Apodaca then stated, \"Maybe I'll talk to you a little more, it has to be off.\" Apodaca then implied that the State would add charges against him because he did not give a statement. The detective told him, \"No dude that's not how we work.... It's not up to us okay? ... It's up to the prosecuting [attorneys] to make a decision.... All we do is recommend the charges from what we've come up with in our investigation that's all we can do.... They make the final decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 Near the end of the first segment, Apodaca indicated that he understood the charges and, when asked whether he was sick or injured, Apodaca said, \"I'm pretty sick to my stomach and I'm gonna need my methadone soon in the morning.... [W]hen I don't have that I can't even function.\" Apodaca also recognized he faced incarceration, stating, \"I'm gonna do some time in jail ... so I'm figuring ... I got six months ... without my family I can do that even though I didn't do shit.\" Apodaca then proposed, \"I could set [Codefendant] up, I could buy some drugs from him for you guys.... Would that get me out of jail?\" The detective responded by explaining that the authorities wanted to know what happened in the car and who was\n   there. Apodaca then suggested that Codefendant must have been confused when he said Apodaca was in the car or that Codefendant was the shooter and was trying to divert blame by accusing someone else. The first segment ended with Apodaca's transfer from the police car to the interview room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    The Second Segment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 Apodaca and the second detective each testified about what transpired during the unrecorded second segment. According to Apodaca, he invoked his rights upon arrest and said he did not want to speak. He then changed his mind and waived his rights during the third segment because the second detective told him during the second segment that if he explained what had happened, the detective would \"write the DA and ... make sure that [Apodaca would be] out by Christmas Day.\" Apodaca testified that he understood this as a \"guaranteed\" promise that he would be treated with leniency if he cooperated. He also testified that if he had not been promised that he would be out within one month and by Christmas, he would not have waived his rights and spoken with the police. He added that he told the police \"what [he] thought they wanted to hear.\" Apodaca also testified that, during the second segment, he told the detectives he was going to need his medication and they told him, \"[J]ust talk to us; and then we'll make sure you get that.\" Apodaca explained that, without his medication, he would experience heroin withdrawal symptoms, including pain in his legs, back, and head, and that he \"would sweat, shak[e].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 In contrast to Apodaca's testimony, the second detective testified that \"no deal was ever made\" during the second segment of the interview and that he did not give Apodaca \"any definite answers about jail or Christmas.\" According to the detective, when he met Apodaca in the forensics area of the police station, he \"struck up a conversation\" with Apodaca about tattoos. Apodaca got upset when he overheard the detective tell another employee that Apodaca might be charged with attempted homicide and obstruction of justice, and Apodaca \"began to question\" the detective about why he would face those charges. Apodaca was \"concerned about going to jail\" and \"did not want to snitch.\" The detective told Apodaca that \"cooperation was a good thing,\" \"it always look[ed] better to cooperate,\" and \"now was a good time to cooperate if he was willing to do it.\" In response to Apodaca's concern that \"his cooperation would not get back to the prosecutors in charge of his case,\" the detective reassured Apodaca that if he wanted to cooperate, the detective \"would let the prosecution know that he decided to cooperate and take responsibility.\" Although Apodaca proposed other ways that the detective could pursue the investigation, he agreed to speak more with the detective in the interview room. The detective testified that when he said he was giving his word to Apodaca, he was reassuring him that he would pass along to the prosecuting attorneys information about Apodaca's cooperation. The detective testified that he followed through and did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    The Third Segment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 The transcript of the third segment began in the interview room. The following exchange ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [Apodaca]: I just hope that prosecuting attorney sees how much I'm giving up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [Detective]: I guarantee they will.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [Apodaca]: I just hope I get out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [Detective]: Hey you've got my word alright.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [Apodaca]: That would be the shit if I was out by Christmas man.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [Detective]: No I hear ya.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After this exchange, Apodaca began making incriminating statements. When Apodaca articulated the suspicion that the detective already knew \"everything,\" the detective said that he did but was giving Apodaca \"a chance to let [him] know [what happened] as well.\" The detective then stated, \"I said you guys were in trouble you know that it's a matter of how we deal with it from here ... and I think it always looks better if you cooperate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b620 Although Apodaca made additional incriminating statements, he was reluctant to identify the shooter, explaining, \"I guess I have to go to jail because ... cuz I can't do that man. It's gonna be me on the paperwork snitching on my homeboy.... I can't man\n   cuz my friends gonna read it when he gets caught and he's gonna tell everybody.\" Apodaca also expressed concern that he would \"be in jeopardy\" when he was released, and the detective reassured him, \"When you get out ... [and] [i]f you feel like you're in jeopardy you need to call me and I will take care of it.\" Apodaca stated, \"I'm still getting in jail whether I say his name or not.... Unless I get a better offer ... I can't say anything.\" The detective asked, \"Do you think it's gonna look a little bit worse if you don't go to jail and everybody else does?\" Apodaca said there was \"no benefit\" to naming the shooter, and when the detective remarked that Apodaca's child is \"not gonna have dad for a little while,\" Apodaca agreed and said \"at least for a year.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b621 At this point, the first detective entered the room and resumed questioning. The first detective urged Apodaca to think about Apodaca's child having an involved father in his life, but he also stated that he could not speak on behalf of the district attorney's office and could not \"promise [Apodaca] anything.\" The detective reminded Apodaca that he grew up in \"the same kind of life,\" and continued, \"I can't guarantee what's going to happen in court, but I, I could tell you that it's gonna be helpful to know that you're being cooperative, and that's all we're trying to do here is give you the opportunity to do so.\" When Apodaca asked whether his cooperation would \"make [him] go home faster,\" the detective responded, \"I can't promise you something that I can't guarantee.... I can tell you this it's gonna come out a lot better for you if you're truthful.\" The detective then said, \"I want you to tell me the truth of what you witnessed and I guarantee you that [the prosecutors are] gonna look at that hard and they're gonna realize that you're being helpful with this investigation ... and you being with ... your son it's gonna be ... better for you than for you to be sitting in a cell for the rest of your life.\" The detective reiterated, \"I can't guarantee any of this stuff [you're] asking.\" Apodaca then made more incriminating statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    The Parties' Arguments and the Trial Court's Ruling\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b622 Apodaca argued to the trial court that his statements were elicited in violation of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and could be used against him for impeachment purposes only if they were voluntarily and freely given and without compulsion or coercion. He then argued that his \"complete shift\" regarding cooperation between the first segment and the third segment was explained by police inducement, in the form of a promise that he would get out of jail by Christmas. Because he was induced into making the statements, Apodaca asked the court to find that they were involuntary and therefore could not be admitted for any purpose. The prosecutor countered that there was no inducement and that the evidence showed \"no Christmas promise that was made to [Apodaca].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b623 The court concluded that Apodaca's statements were obtained in violation of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   and could not be used in the State's case-in chief. However, based on the testimony and the parties' arguments, the court found that \"there was no coercion or duress associated with the statements made by Mr. Apodaca.\" The court further explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   And really on the spectrum of this idea of trickery or coercion-the suggestion that somebody has-engages in voluntary conversations doesn't rise to the level of what might otherwise be duress or coercion, nor is a promise to pass on information associated with Mr. Apodaca's cooperation, which is what this Court understands that testimony to be-an inducement for which somehow would obviate the voluntary nature of freely given information by Mr. Apodaca.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The court concluded that it would allow the State to use Apodaca's statements for impeachment purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    The Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b624 Apodaca was tried by a jury on one count of aggravated kidnapping, one count of aggravated robbery, one count of obstructing justice, and four counts of felony discharge of a firearm. The aggravated robbery count and the discharge of a firearm counts were based on accomplice liability, meaning that the\n   State sought to hold Apodaca criminally liable for Shooter's acts of robbing Victim and discharging the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b625 In opening statements, defense counsel set the foundation for a compulsion defense. Counsel explained to the jury that it would hear that Apodaca was offered drugs in exchange for giving Shooter and Codefendant a ride. According to defense counsel, Apodaca did not know that Shooter had a gun and was surprised when Shooter pulled it out and announced that they were going to rob Victim. Apodaca was \"afraid of\" and \"intimidat[ed]\" by Shooter, and when he was \"ordered to drive ... that's what he did.\" Defense counsel also told the jurors that \"if [Apodaca's] life was threatened and he was told that he had to participate or he himself was going to get hurt, [they] will hear that the law provides that in certain circumstances you're allowed to do exactly what [Apodaca] did: drive that car.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b626 Victim and Codefendant both testified against Apodaca. Although Apodaca had planned to testify in his own defense, he changed his mind and elected not to testify \"in light of the ... suppression ruling.\" As defense counsel explained to the court, \"if [Apodaca] testifies, he's subjecting himself to impeachment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b627 Relatedly, Apodaca withdrew his request for a compulsion instruction. In closing statements, defense counsel argued that the State had not met its burden of proof and urged the jury to disregard Codefendant's testimony. Defense counsel questioned the accuracy and credibility of the State's witnesses by highlighting inconsistencies in their statements, Victim's allegedly imperfect perception of a stressful event, and Codefendant's motivations and shifting stories. In addition, defense counsel cast blame on Shooter, arguing Apodaca was not a party to Shooter's crimes. Defense counsel asserted that Apodaca \"didn't assist anyone,\" \"was doing what he was told, [and was] found in the circumstances that he didn't want to be in.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b628 The court instructed the jury regarding the concepts of accomplice liability and culpable mental states. The court also provided the jury with definitions of the terms \"intentionally\" and \"knowingly.\" Relevant to this appeal, Instruction 36 explained the elements of the crime of aggravated robbery. That instruction directed the jury that, if it found all the other elements of the offense, it could find Apodaca guilty of aggravated robbery so long as it found that he \"a. Intended that [Shooter] commit the crime of Aggravated Robbery; or b. Was aware that his conduct was reasonably certain to result in [Shooter] committing the crime of Aggravated Robbery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b629 After the court submitted the case to the jury, the jury sent a note to the court asking:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   If someone assists in detaining an individual and was knowing about plans to scare said individual to give up their personal property, that is aggravated kidnapping, but if they only assisted in the act of detainment under threat for their own life, does that still leave them at fault as it being intentional on the party in question?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Does action under duress change intent?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The court responded, \"The Court refers you to jury instruction[ ] 9, what evidence is, or is not, instruction[ ] 29 on a defendant's mental state, instructions 33 and 34 on accomplice liability and instruction 43 on intentionally and knowingly.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b630 The jury acquitted Apodaca of all four counts of felony discharge of a firearm, but it convicted him of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated robbery, and obstructing justice. Apodaca appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b631 First, Apodaca contends that the trial court \"incorrectly concluded that [his] statements to police were voluntary and, therefore, admissible as impeachment evidence.\" \"The ultimate determination of voluntariness is a legal question; accordingly, we review the district court's ruling for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Threats and Promises\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b640 Apodaca contends that his statements \"were involuntary because the officers made impermissible threats and promises that caused [him] to confess.\" In so arguing, Apodaca relies on two alleged promises that he believes constituted improper inducement. First, Apodaca asserts that, in exchange for his cooperation, the second detective promised that he \"would convince the prosecutor to release [him] by Christmas.\" Second, Apodaca asserts that the first detective \"also made statements that appeared to guarantee leniency.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   1. The Alleged Christmas Promise\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b641 Much of Apodaca's argument on appeal centers on the alleged Christmas promise. Apodaca explains that during the first segment of his interview with the detectives, he \"would not talk ... unless they offered him a deal.\" He then explains that his \"position shifted dramatically between the first and third segments\" of the interview, asserting that the \"record supports that [he] agreed to waive his rights and speak to police [during the third segment] because he had struck a deal with [the second detective]\" during the second segment. According to Apodaca, \"[i]t appears from the record that the deal was that [the detective], in exchange for [his] cooperation, would convince the prosecutor to release [him] by Christmas.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b642 The State counters that \"there were conflicting accounts of the conversation\" between Apodaca and the second detective during the second segment and that the \"trial court's ruling of no coercion shows that the court believed [the detective] and disbelieved Apodaca.\" The State also argues that the only promise the detective made-that \"he would relay any of Apodaca's cooperation to the prosecuting attorney\"-was \"a non-coercive promise.\" We agree with the State on both points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b643 After hearing argument from counsel and testimony from Apodaca and the second detective, the trial court concluded that \"there was no coercion or duress associated with\" Apodaca's statements. The court explained that \"a promise to pass on information associated with Mr. Apodaca's cooperation, which is what this Court understands that testimony to be,\" does not rise to the level of an inducement that would \"obviate the voluntary nature of freely given information by Mr. Apodaca.\" The court's statements indicate that it credited the detective's testimony regarding the nature of his promise to Apodaca-that he told Apodaca that he \"would let the prosecution know that [Apodaca] decided to cooperate.\" The court thereby implicitly rejected Apodaca's testimony that the detective promised him that he would be out of jail by Christmas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b644 Apodaca's argument on appeal regarding the first alleged promise requires this court to set aside the trial court's implicit finding that the only promise the detective made was that he would pass along to the prosecutors information regarding Apodaca's cooperation. But \"because a trial court is in a better position to judge credibility and resolve evidentiary conflicts,\" an appellate court will not set aside the trial court's factual findings absent clear error.\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Yet Apodaca asserts that \"the first and third segments of the interrogation support Apodaca's, not [the detective's], recollection of the second segment\" and substantiate his claim that the detective promised to write the prosecutors and make sure that Apodaca was out of jail by Christmas. Apodaca's recounting of evidence that would have supported an alternate finding does not establish that the trial court's finding was against the clear weight of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12345815\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/405/781/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, we conclude Apodaca has not shown clear error in the trial court's finding that the second detective offered only to pass along information about Apodaca's cooperation to the prosecutors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b646 Given this conclusion, we consider only whether that promise is coercive. It is not. As our supreme court has explained, \"the mere representation to a defendant by officers that they will make known to the prosecutor and to the court that he cooperated with them ... [has] been recognized as not coercive.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, the detective promised only that he would inform the prosecutors of Apodaca's cooperation. Thus, we agree with the trial court that the second detective's promise, standing alone, was not coercive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   2. The Alleged Guarantee of Leniency\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b647 As for the second alleged promise, Apodaca asserts that the first detective \"appeared to guarantee leniency.\" In support, Apodaca relies on the following statement that the detective made when trying to persuade him to reveal the identity of the shooter: \"I guarantee you that [the prosecutors are] gonna look at that hard and they're gonna realize that you're being helpful with this investigation ... and you being with your girl and your son it's gonna be ... better for you than for you to be sitting in a cell for the rest of your life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b648 We do not read the first detective's statement as guaranteeing leniency to Apodaca in return for his cooperation. At most, the detective guaranteed that the prosecutors would be aware of and consider Apodaca's cooperation and his helpfulness to the investigation when handling his case. Further, the statement came after Apodaca began making incriminating statements and was the latter portion of the detective's response to Apodaca's question, \"So do you think this will make me go home faster ...?\" In his initial response to this question, the detective told Apodaca, \"I can't promise you something that I can't guarantee.\" The detective then urged Apodaca to be truthful so that things would \"come out a lot better for [him].\" On its face and in context, the detective's statement does not guarantee Apodaca a certain result. Instead, the context shows that the detective was suggesting to Apodaca that cooperating would be his best option; such a suggestion is not coercive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10384497\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/779/221/#p225\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (indicating that it is not coercive for officers to tell a defendant that \"full cooperation would be his best course of action\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b649 Moreover, the record demonstrates that the first detective told Apodaca multiple times that he could not make promises or guarantees about his incarceration. For example, during the first segment when Apodaca said he would not incriminate himself unless someone told him that he was not going to jail, the first detective said he could not do that or \"give deals.\" And during the third segment, the same detective stated that he could not speak on behalf of the district attorney's office and could not \"promise ... anything.\" Because the detective did not guarantee leniency to Apodaca, and because the only promise made to Apodaca was not coercive,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46, the detectives' alleged use of threats and promises does not weigh in favor of a conclusion of coercion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   B. The\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   Violation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b650 Apodaca contends that the first detective's \"disregard of [his]\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights had the coercive effect of demonstrating to [him] that invoking his rights would not end the interrogation.\" \"[A]\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   violation alone is insufficient grounds for suppressing statements offered to impeach the defendant's testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

While Apodaca drove and ignored Victim's pleas to let him out of the car, Shooter pointed a gun at Victim's head and Shooter (and possibly Apodaca) demanded Victim turn over the pills. Apodaca eventually stopped the car to let Victim out but only after Shooter shot Victim four times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b681 In the second version, as elicited from Codefendant on cross-examination,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Codefendant\n   arranged a drug deal with Victim and never intended to rob him. The anticipated transaction turned into a robbery when Shooter pulled out a gun and demanded Victim's pills. But this is where the divergence between the two versions ends. Although Apodaca asserts there is evidentiary support for defense counsel's opening statements that Apodaca \"was shocked when [Shooter] pulled out the gun\" and that he \"drove away because he was afraid of [Shooter] and [Shooter] told him to drive,\" no evidence supports that assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b682 Instead, Codefendant testified that he did not hear Shooter order Apodaca to drive, and neither Codefendant nor Victim described Apodaca as a fearful (or even passive) participant. While both witnesses equivocated about whether it was Shooter or Apodaca who demanded the pills and suggested that Victim be shot, both witnesses described Apodaca as actively involved. It was Apodaca, after all, who shifted the car into gear and sped away while Victim was still counting the pills in the backseat, and it was Apodaca who did not unlock the doors or stop the car in response to Victim's multiple pleas. And Apodaca drove the car away after Codefendant and Victim exited it. Further, when defense counsel tried to elicit testimony from Apodaca's girlfriend and Codefendant that Shooter was someone to be afraid of, both witnesses rejected the suggestion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b683 Thus, Apodaca's contention that he was an unwilling participant in the aggravated robbery-a contention on which his claim of prejudice depends-fails because it lacks evidentiary support.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
