He appeals his convictions, contending the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress because his confession to police was made in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. He also contends the district court exceeded its discretion when it rejected his guilty plea. Finally, he contends he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel. We conclude Gardner knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel and his confession was therefore not in violation of his constitutional rights. Gardner failed to preserve his challenge to the rejected guilty plea, and he has not shown that his counsel's performance was deficient or that the deficient performance, if any, was prejudicial. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Victim and her mother reported to police that Gardner had raped Victim and that she was pregnant with his child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   During an interview at the Children's Justice Center, Victim disclosed that Gardner raped her no less than eleven times in a span of six months. Officers interviewed Victim about these allegations. They also interviewed Gardner's son, who reported he had observed Gardner sexually abusing Victim and that Gardner told him that he would kill him if he ever disclosed what he saw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Based on these allegations, the police determined they needed to question Gardner. Two officers (First Officer and Second Officer) were in the interrogation room with Gardner. Gardner received\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and he affirmed that he understood them. Gardner then asked why he was being questioned, and First Officer said it was about Victim. Gardner immediately asked for his attorney. First Officer asked if it was the same attorney who had represented him in connection with prior charges, and Gardner responded in the affirmative. Before the officers could leave to try to reach his attorney, Gardner \"immediately launched into a monologue concerning an assault [against him] purportedly involving [Victim's] mother.\" He also explained, unprompted, that Victim's mother had threatened to report to the police that Gardner had sexually abused Victim. He spoke to the officers for nearly three minutes without the officers asking any questions or responding in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 First Officer again asked if Gardner wanted his attorney and, when Gardner answered in the affirmative, left to try to contact the attorney. Gardner continued to speak to Second Officer, unprompted, until First Officer returned. When First Officer returned, he told Gardner that he could not reach Gardner's attorney and that he was not going to ask Gardner any questions. Despite saying this, First Officer then added, \"This thing is, what you just have to think about, is that is there a possibility that this child she's carrying is yours?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gardner attempted to respond, but the officers cut him off and left the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Gardner sat alone in the interrogation room for almost five minutes before opening the door and asking Second Officer to return. Both officers returned and did not ask any questions, and Gardner explained that the reason he wanted his attorney present was to \"corroborate his story concerning the alleged assault perpetrated on him by [Victim's] mother.\" He further explained that he did not need his attorney present, because \"there [was] no way that baby was [his].\" First Officer again left to try to reach Gardner's attorney, and Gardner continued to talk to Second Officer, who offered to take a statement from Gardner with respect to the alleged abuse by Victim's mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 When First Officer returned, he informed Gardner that his attorney did not want to represent him in connection with these new allegations but that his attorney generally advised him to remain silent. First\n   Officer said that Gardner's silence would not matter, because they had enough evidence to arrest him for rape.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the officers explained that the interrogation was over because he was being arrested, Gardner asked them to remain in the room and talk with him and then posed questions about DNA testing. After discussing the different means of testing DNA, Gardner stated, \"I'm taking responsibility for me. I did it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 After his arrest, Gardner filed a motion to suppress his confession, alleging that the officers violated his Fifth Amendment rights in obtaining it because the officers continued to question him after he had invoked his right to counsel. The court denied the motion because it determined that, from the beginning of the interview, Gardner's \"actions clearly showed he was willing to talk to the Officers independent of counsel.\" Without being asked any questions, Gardner explained that he had problems with Victim's mother, and later-after again being asked if he wanted his attorney present before he continued to talk with the officers-Gardner \"continu[ed] into a story involving [Victim] and her mother.\" The court found that only after this exchange did First Officer \"initiate a question by asking [Gardner] to think if there was a possibility the child [Victim] was carrying was his.\" The court further found that even when the officers attempted to end the interrogation on two occasions, Gardner reinitiated the conversation with respect to Victim and her mother. The second time, after the officers explained that they had enough evidence to arrest him,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gardner asked them to stay and then confessed to the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 The court concluded that he \"knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel during interrogation.\" In support of this conclusion, it found that Gardner had \"experience in the criminal justice system\" as a convicted sex offender and that \"during this particular interrogation, [Gardner] was due in court on an unrelated crime.\" The court further found that, being familiar with his rights, Gardner \"chose to speak without his attorney present after the Officers clearly warned him that he was not obligated to do so\" and there was \"no dispute that the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning ... was adequate.\" The court therefore denied Gardner's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 On the first day of trial, Gardner attempted to enter an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to one count of rape in exchange for dismissing the remaining charges and being sentenced that same day. The court said it was not \"pleased with the deal or the timing of it,\" because it was a significant reduction in charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court explained that, under Utah law, it could refuse to accept a plea deal so long as the refusal was not arbitrary. The court asked the State why it offered the deal, and the State responded that, by making the deal, it would be \"exchanging a sure thing for something that is not completely certain.\" The court was \"extremely reluctant to accept the\n   plea\" in light of Gardner's stipulation that he was the father of Victim's child, the evidence presented in the motion to suppress and the State's opposition, and the fact that an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea meant that Gardner would not be admitting guilt even to the one charge of rape. Accordingly, the court gave the State and Gardner time to negotiate a different deal, but instead, the State withdrew the deal completely. The court said, \"All right,\" and Gardner stated, \"Hold on.\" The court explained to Gardner that it would not have accepted the original offer \"unless [Victim] was extremely reluctant or refused to testify,\" and because that was not the case, they would \"continue with the trial.\" Gardner did not raise an objection but instead responded, \"Thank you, Your Honor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 The jury convicted Gardner on all eleven counts of rape. Gardner appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Gardner contends the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress his confession because he was denied the right to counsel during the interrogation. We review a district court's ruling on a motion to suppress for correctness, and we review its factual findings in support of its ruling for clear error.\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 1993) (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 Gardner also contends the district court exceeded its discretion when it rejected \"the plea agreement reached by the parties.\" Gardner asserts that this issue was preserved below when the court explained its hesitation in accepting an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea to one count of rape and then asked the parties to take time to negotiate a different plea. But this does not constitute preservation because Gardner did not challenge the \"rejection\" before the district court. To preserve an issue for appeal, Gardner must have raised it before the court in such a way that the court had an opportunity to rule on it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Brocksmith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%2076\">\n    2018 UT App 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9. Here, after the State withdrew the plea deal, Gardner's only response was: \"Hold on.\" The court again explained why it would not have accepted an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea to one rape charge and Gardner responded, \"Thank you, Your Honor.\" Because Gardner did not challenge the court's rejection of the plea deal, the issue was not preserved, and on appeal Gardner should have argued that an exception to the preservation rule applies to allow us to reach the merits of his argument.\n   <em>\n    State v. Algaza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6862549\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/352/107/\">\n    2015 UT App 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6862549\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/352/107/\">\n    352 P.3d 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that when a defendant does not preserve claims before the district court, the defendant \"must establish plain error, ineffective assistance of counsel, or exceptional circumstances to warrant [appellate] review\" (quotation simplified) ). Because he has failed to argue the applicability of an exception, we do not reach this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 Finally, Gardner contends his counsel was constitutionally ineffective in numerous respects. \"When a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised for the first time on appeal, there is no lower court ruling to review and we must decide whether the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Then Gardner asked why he was being questioned, and First Officer responded that it was about Victim. Gardner immediately asked for his attorney, and the officers asked if he wanted the same attorney who was representing him in other matters. Gardner responded in the affirmative.

Indeed, he had been convicted of similar sexual charges before. He was also \"due in court on an unrelated crime\" on the day of the interrogation. In addition, the officers spoke very little to Gardner prior to his confession, and Gardner, unprompted and uninterrupted, offered many statements related to Victim's accusations. The district court noted that Gardner's characterization of the interrogation as a \"conversation or a talk\" between Gardner and the officers was a \"complete mischaracterization.\" We agree. The officers left Gardner alone in the interrogation room while attempting to contact his attorney, and Gardner called them back to talk. He explained he wanted his attorney for one purpose-to corroborate that he has problems with Victim's mother-but that he did not need his attorney to address Victim's accusations. The officers asked no questions and let Gardner continue speaking uninterrupted. When Gardner asked questions specifically about the accusations, the officers refused to respond and said they were respecting his invocation of the right to counsel. By the time Gardner confessed, he had been in the interrogation room for just twenty minutes and had been offered food and a beverage. Although First Officer asked Gardner to think about whether there was a possibility the baby was his, Gardner had already initiated discussion of the matter for which he was being interrogated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b620 Under the circumstances of this case, Gardner knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to an attorney and therefore his confession following this waiver was not in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights.

Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621 Gardner contends his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for numerous reasons not apparent in the record.
