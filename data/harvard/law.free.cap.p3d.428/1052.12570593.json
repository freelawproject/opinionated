Attempting to exclude the interview he had given to the police, Mr. Fullerton filed a motion to suppress on the grounds that the interview violated his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and that the confession he gave was not voluntary. The district court denied Mr. Fullerton's motion, and he challenges that ruling on appeal. Additionally, Mr. Fullerton raises four challenges to expert testimony provided in his case and alleges that the prosecutor violated his due process rights during closing arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 We decline to consider Mr. Fullerton's challenges to the expert testimony because three of them were unpreserved, and he received the only remedy he requested from the trial court on the fourth. We likewise determine that his due process challenge is unpreserved and do not reach that issue. Conversely, we do consider Mr. Fullerton's appeal of the denial of his motion to suppress. We conclude that his confession was voluntary and that he was not in custody for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   and therefore affirm the district court on these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 However, we take this opportunity to clarify that because\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   is a matter of federal jurisprudence, our courts must be in lockstep with the United States Supreme Court on whether an individual is in custody for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . We therefore rebuke sole reliance on the factors we set forth in\n   <em>\n    Salt Lake City v. Carner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10430795\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/664/1168/\">\n    664 P.2d 1168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1983), for this determination and clarify the role these factors play going forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In the early evening of July 23, 2008, Mr. Fullerton was entrusted with the care of N.L., his girlfriend's three-month-old son.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A short time later, Mr. Fullerton entered the bedroom where N.L.'s step-grandfather was watching television and announced that something was wrong with N.L.-the baby was limp and struggling to breathe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Mr. Fullerton called 911 and attempted to resuscitate N.L. The responding officer performed CPR on N.L. until paramedics arrived and transported him to Dixie Regional Medical Center. There, Dr. Adrianne\n   Walker discovered that N.L. had suffered a subdural hematoma, brain swelling, and likely retinal hemorrhaging. Dr. Walker informed Detective Adam Olmstead of the St. George City Police Department that she suspected N.L. had been violently shaken, but further medical investigation was needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 After speaking with Dr. Walker, Detective Olmstead had another officer call Mr. Fullerton and ask him to come to the police station for questioning. Mr. Fullerton's father drove him to the police station and waited in the parking lot. Officer Joe Watson told Mr. Fullerton that he was not under arrest and directed him to an interview room. Captain Barry Golding arrived and closed, but did not lock, the door of the interview room. After a short introduction, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Q. I need to make sure you understand a couple of things, okay? One, you're not under arrest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   A. I know that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Q. You know that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q. Okay. ... but we need to figure out what happened, okay? What I want to clarify with you is that you understand your father is out back. You come in here voluntarily. We want to talk to you. You're free to leave at any time. Do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A. Yeah. I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Q. So if you tell me you want to walk, that's okay. We'll deal with that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A. Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Captain Golding then told Mr. Fullerton that he wanted \"to talk and talk and talk until we figure this thing out, okay?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b67 Detective Olmstead arrived, and for the following ninety minutes either he or Captain Golding questioned Mr. Fullerton. The officers were never in the interrogation room at the same time. They were dressed in plain clothes and came and went from the interview room several times. As far as Mr. Fullerton knew, the door remained unlocked at all times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At no point did the officers physically restrain Mr. Fullerton or raise their voices. Nor did they recite to Mr. Fullerton the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b68 The officers initially couched their questioning in friendly, non-accusatory terms such as \"something happened in there where the baby went unresponsive. And that's ... the time frame ... we need to kind of lock down, okay?\" However, Mr. Fullerton offered an evolving version of events: he simply rolled the baby over and the baby stopped breathing; perhaps a stranger entered the room while he was in the bathroom; he had dropped the baby; he had a \"freeze\" related to his Parkinson's Disease and \"fumbled\" the baby. As the inconsistencies in his story became apparent, the officers took on a more accusatory tone. Mr. Fullerton then stated that he had \"pushed on [N.L.'s] back\" and \"something cracked.\" He said, \"But now I'll probably go to jail and everything else.\" Detective Olmstead neither confirmed nor refuted this statement. Detective Olmstead left and Captain Golding entered the room and said that Mr. Fullerton's story still could not account for N.L.'s injuries. He eventually told Mr. Fullerton, \"We know that you're accountable; we know that you're responsible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b69 Mr. Fullerton repeatedly denied \"shaking\" N.L. but eventually confessed that he had \"tossed him around\" and repeatedly \"flip-flopped him over\" with enough force that the baby was lifted off the bed and landed on his head. He said that N.L. then rolled over, closed his eyes, and became unresponsive. Shortly after this admission, Captain Golding said, \"But you remember when I told you about-that you weren't in custody? That your father brought you in? We need-we need to decide what to do at this point, okay?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Fullerton was then officially arrested and charged with child abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b610 Meanwhile, N.L. was flown to Primary Children's Medical Center, where he later died. Dr. Karen Hansen, a pediatrician at Primary Children's, diagnosed N.L. with subdural\n   and subarachnoid hemorrhages on both sides of his brain, brain swelling, retinal hemorrhages, and retinal (macular) folds in both eyes. After learning of N.L.'s death, the State charged Mr. Fullerton with child abuse homicide, a first-degree felony. Before trial, Mr. Fullerton moved to suppress his police interview on the grounds that officers did not give him the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and allegedly used impermissible interrogation tactics. The district court denied the motion. A jury found Mr. Fullerton guilty and he was sentenced to a term of five years to life in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b611 Mr. Fullerton appeals his conviction, claiming that the district court incorrectly denied his motion to suppress, improperly allowed certain expert testimony, and that he was denied due process of law as a result of prosecutorial misconduct.

We begin by discussing the relevant standards for determining when a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning is necessary.

Mr. Fullerton never makes arguments about other objective factors, such as the false friend technique, threats or promises, or the absence of counsel or family. Additionally, Mr. Fullerton does not discuss any of the subjective factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b642 A review of the other factors suggests that the confession was indeed voluntary. The interrogation was relatively short, lasting only ninety minutes. Although Captain Golding implied that Mr. Fullerton may receive better treatment from a judge if he told the truth, Captain Golding did not overtly threaten Mr. Fullerton with a harsher sentence or make any promises of leniency. At no time until the end of the interview did Mr. Fullerton request to speak with his attorney or family members. The officers were persistent in challenging Mr. Fullerton's evolving account of events, but \"we think it eminently reasonable that police officers challenge criminal suspects' questionable explanations in their pursuit of the truth and their efforts to solve crimes.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Additionally, there is no evidence that Mr. Fullerton suffered from any pre-existing mental defects which would make him more susceptible to suggestive questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b643 Given the weight of these other factors, we disagree that any alleged police misrepresentations here were sufficient to render the confession involuntary. Therefore, we affirm the district court's decision to admit Mr. Fullerton's testimony as voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b644 Mr. Fullerton also asserts that his confession was unreliable and thus inadmissible as evidence. He cites no constitutional provision, rule of evidence, or Utah case law to support this proposition; and it is unclear from his briefing what he believes provides a basis for this claim. Instead, he relies exclusively on\n   <em>\n    Aleman v.

CHALLENGES TO EXPERT TESTIMONY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b645 Mr. Fullerton raises four challenges to statements made by one of the State's medical experts, Dr. Hansen: (1) he did not receive notice of Dr. Hansen's testimony that crying is a common trigger for inflicted rotational injury; (2) the \"common trigger\" testimony does not support a medical diagnosis; (3) Dr. Hansen's opinion that Mr. Fullerton's admitted actions could have caused N.L.'s injuries violated a pretrial order preventing similar testimony; and (4) Dr. Hansen improperly suggested that \"I don't believe that we've been told exactly what happened to N.L. yet.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b646 This court has consistently held that \"a defendant who fails to preserve an objection at trial will not be able to raise that objection on appeal unless he is able to demonstrate either plain error or exceptional circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

If Mr. Fullerton believed that sustaining his objection was an insufficient remedy, he had a duty to ask the judge to do more.\n   <em>\n    State v.

CHALLENGE TO CLOSING ARGUMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b648 Mr. Fullerton claims that the prosecutor violated his due process rights by saving his criticism of a witness's memory for closing arguments instead of raising them on cross-examination, thereby denying Mr. Fullerton the ability to bring in the witness's prior consistent statements under Utah Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) and fostering a false impression of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b649 Defense counsel did not object to the closing argument at the time and only raised the objection in a motion for new trial. As already discussed, an objection not preserved at trial cannot be raised on appeal unless the proponent can show plain error or exceptional circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. As\n   <em>\n    State v. Larrabee\n   </em>\n   further explained, \"with\n   respect to appellate review of closing arguments ... we will not examine the State's closing argument if the defendant failed to timely object to it.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6955221\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/321/1136/\">\n    2013 UT 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6955221\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/321/1136/\">\n    321 P.3d 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Four of these issues were unpreserved at the district court level, and Mr. Fullerton does not argue that an exception to preservation applies. Mr. Fullerton objected to the fifth alleged issue, thereby preserving his challenge. However, the district court sustained his objection and he asked for no additional remedy at trial. He therefore can ask for no other remedy on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b653 We affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    \"In reviewing the trial court's ruling [on a motion to suppress], we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the trial court's findings.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.
