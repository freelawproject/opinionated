We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Carmona sued Badger Creek Associates LLC (Badger Creek) for personal injuries she sustained when she slipped and fell on ice in a common stairway at the Badger Creek Apartments in Salt Lake City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Badger Creek carried liability insurance through Travelers. The insurance policy included an indemnity provision (the Coverage C provision), which stated that Travelers would \"pay medical expenses\" up to $5,000 \"for 'bodily injury' caused by an accident\" on Badger Creek's premises and that it would \"make these payments regardless of fault.\" This provision explicitly excluded payments to \"any insured.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 When Carmona learned of this provision, she moved to amend her complaint to add Travelers as an additional defendant. In her proposed amended complaint, Carmona alleged that \"Travelers owed [her] a contractual duty to pay medical bills\" for her injuries, that Travelers knew about her injuries and had \"failed to disclose the coverage to [her],\" and that Travelers had \"failed to pay those [medical] bills, without justification.\" The district court found that Carmona's motion to amend was futile and denied the motion. Specifically, the court determined that \"Utah case law is\n   <em>\n    clear\n   </em>\n   regarding parties seeking to sue a tortfeasor's insurer\" and that \" 'a plaintiff\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   direct his action against the actual tortfeasor, not the [tortfeasor's] insurer.' \" (Alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Campbell v. Stagg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10457826\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/596/1037/#p1039\">\n    596 P.2d 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1039 (Utah 1979) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Thereafter, Carmona filed a second lawsuit against Travelers alone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Carmona claimed that, because she suffered bodily injury as a result of the accident on Badger Creek's premises, she was \"a third-party or intended beneficiary\" under the Coverage C provision. According to Carmona, \"Travelers owed [her] a contractual duty to pay medical bills\" for her injuries, and \"Travelers had refused to investigate and/or pay the claim.\" Carmona also asserted that Travelers had breached the Coverage C provision and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \"by failing to investigate or pay the claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Travelers moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), arguing that Carmona's claims were barred by res judicata and that Carmona lacked standing\n   to pursue claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because she was not a party to the insurance contract. The district court granted Travelers' motion, finding that Carmona \"is not an intended third-party beneficiary to the insurance contract between Travelers and Badger Creek.\" The court stated that \"there is no statute and nothing about the insurance contract that would give [Carmona] privity of contract and standing to sue Travelers directly.\" In addition, the court granted Travelers' motion on res judicata grounds, finding that \"the elements of claim[ ] preclusion and issue preclusion have been met in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Carmona now appeals from the district court's grant of Travelers' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Carmona raises two issues on appeal. First, she contends that the district court erred when it ruled that her claims against Travelers were barred by res judicata. Second, Carmona contends that the district court erred when it ruled that she was not an intended third-party beneficiary to the insurance contract between Travelers and Badger Creek. Because we agree with the district court that Carmona was not an intended third-party beneficiary to the contract, we need not rule on the district court's resolution of the res judicata issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 We review the grant of a motion to dismiss for correctness, giving no deference to the district court's decision.\n   <em>\n    Lilley v.

Indeed, other jurisdictions have determined that plaintiffs in Carmona's position may qualify as third-party beneficiaries to insurance contracts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Donald v.

And, importantly, there is nothing in the Coverage C provision affirmatively suggesting that Travelers and Badger Creek intended that the contract directly benefit people injured on Badger Creek's property. Rather, the provision provides for limited coverage in favor of Badger Creek for certain small claims.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ron Case Roofing &amp; Asphalt Paving, Inc. v.

Specifically, the Coverage C provision is an indemnity provision through which Travelers promises to compensate Badger Creek for the payment of up to $5,000 in medical expenses paid on behalf of individuals injured on Badger Creek's premises. Pursuant to the policy, \"[Travelers] will pay those sums that [Badger Creek] becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' ... to which this insurance applies.\" While injured parties may be indirectly benefited by this provision, the provision is intended to benefit Badger Creek, not the unknown potential plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Broadwater v.

Rather, the standard under Utah law is whether the contract \"affirmatively\" demonstrates a \"clear\" intention to directly benefit the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    SME Indus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499715\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/28/669/\">\n    2001 UT 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 47,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499715\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/28/669/\">\n    28 P.3d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The fact that the Coverage C provision provides for payment regardless of fault does not affirmatively demonstrate the parties' clear intention to benefit individuals injured on Badger Creek's premises. Instead, the provision helps Badger Creek avoid costly litigation by allowing for hassle-free payment of small claims regardless of its fault, with the prospect of reimbursement or partial reimbursement from Travelers. Thus, the purpose of the provision based on the plain language of the contract is to indemnify Badger Creek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 Carmona also asserts that Travelers violated its duty of good faith and fair dealing by denying her claim. The district court does not appear to have directly addressed this claim, but we nevertheless conclude that it fails as a matter of law. \"Utah law clearly limits the duty of good faith to first parties to insurance contracts. Consequently, only a first party can sue for breach of that duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Sperry v.
