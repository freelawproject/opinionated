Fox and James R. Mize that occurred on July 29, 2015, near Sunnylane Road and Indian Hills Road in Norman, Oklahoma. Mr. Mize was traveling northbound on Sunnylane Road in a tractor-trailer owned by his employer, Van Eaton Ready Mix, Inc., when he made a left turn onto Van Eaton's property. According to the traffic collision report, Mr. Mize made an improper turn in front of oncoming traffic. Mr. Fox, who was travelling southbound on Sunnylane Road on a motorcycle, collided with Mr. Mize's tractor-trailer and was declared dead at the scene from a head injury. The report provided that Mr. Fox made no improper driving action and that neither driver appeared to be speeding at the time of the collision. Mr. Mize held a Class \"A\" commercial driver's license subject to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations\n   (FMCSR), and Van Eaton stipulated that Mr. Mize was acting in the course and scope of employment at the time of the collision. Mr. Mize was taken from the scene to Norman Regional for a blood test, which showed he was under the influence of a prescription narcotic banned by the FMCSR at the time of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 Plaintiff, Donna Fox, filed this lawsuit as the personal representative of Ronald J. Fox's estate and brought claims against Mr. Mize for negligence and negligence per se. Plaintiff brought the same claims against Van Eaton under the theory of respondeat superior. Plaintiff also included direct negligence claims against Van Eaton for negligent hiring, training, and retention, and negligent entrustment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff contends Van Eaton had a duty to prohibit Mr. Mize from operating its commercial motor vehicle while under the banned narcotic and that Van Eaton knew or should have known Mr. Mize was taking the narcotic. Plaintiff alleges Van Eaton knew Mr. Mize was taking the substance because it was prescribed to Mr. Mize as a result of an on-the-job injury he suffered for which he filed a workers' compensation claim against Van Eaton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 Van Eaton filed a partial motion to dismiss, arguing the direct claims of negligent hiring and negligent entrustment were unnecessary, superfluous, and contrary to public policy because Van Eaton had already admitted to being Mize's employer for purposes of vicarious liability. The district court denied Van Eaton's motion as to the negligent entrustment claim and granted Van Eaton's motion as to the negligent hiring claim. Van Eaton filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied by the district court. Plaintiff amended her Petition to conform to the district court's partial dismissal so that the remaining claims included her negligence and negligence per se claims against Mr. Mize, the respondeat superior claim against Van Eaton, and the direct claim against Van Eaton for negligent entrustment. Thereafter, Van Eaton filed an application to certify the district court's order for immediate interlocutory appeal. The district court granted the application for immediate interlocutory appeal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    12 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 952(b)(3). Van Eaton timely filed a Petition for Certiorari to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 On December 4, 2017, we granted certiorari review in this case to address a recurring issue in the state and federal district courts across the state; that is, whether an employer's stipulation that an employee was acting in the course and scope of employment at the time of a collision bars a plaintiff's negligent entrustment claim against the employer. State district courts have reached inconsistent results,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the federal district courts of this state are likewise split on the issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth below, we\n   conclude that an employer's stipulation that an employee was acting in the course and scope of employment at the time of a collision does not, as a matter of law, bar a plaintiff's negligent entrustment claim against the employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 A motion to reconsider does not technically exist as part of Oklahoma's statutory scheme of pleading.\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Van Eaton argues that, as a matter of law, any theory of direct liability against an employer, including negligent entrustment, must be dismissed when the employer stipulates that an employee was in the course and scope of employment at the time of the accident.

First, Van Eaton argues that if both a respondeat superior and a negligent entrustment claim are allowed to proceed simultaneously, the employee driver will be prejudiced if evidence of his prior bad acts is allowed to be heard by the jury. In\n    <em>\n     McCarley v. Durham\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1954%20OK%2035\">\n     1954 OK 35\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10501969\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/266/629/\">\n     266 P.2d 629\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , this Court found it was not error to admit evidence of a pre-accident record to prove knowledge in a negligent entrustment action, even though the evidence might have been inadmissible against the driver to prove negligence in causing the accident.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Green v. Harris\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9119206\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/70/866/\">\n     2003 OK 55\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 18,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9119206\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/70/866/\">\n     70 P.3d 866\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 870. The trial courts of this state regularly determine when relevant evidence is inadmissible because its \"probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, needless presentation of cumulative evidence, or unfair and harmful surprise.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n     12 O.S. 2011\n    </extracted-citation>\n    \u00a7 2403. Parties to a case may also request, and the trial court can give, a limiting instruction explaining what a jury may or may not infer from a particular piece of evidence.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Tansy v. Dacomed Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994%20OK%20146\">\n     1994 OK 146\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , n.7,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10347797\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/890/881/#p890\">\n     890 P.2d 881\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 890. The case before us has yet to be tried to a jury. Van Eaton's argument in this regard is an evidentiary issue to be dealt with in the first instance by the trial court if and when the case goes to trial; it does not require dismissal of the negligent entrustment claim as a matter of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    \u00b6 11 In that same vein, Van Eaton also argues that because punitive damages could be awarded for the respondeat superior claim, the Plaintiff cannot assert an additional punitive damages claim against Van Eaton for her negligent entrustment claim. Again, as this Court has noted, \"[w]hen recovery against the employer for an act of his servant is rested on prior knowledge of the servant's propensity to commit the very harm for which damages are sought, the basis of liability invoked is not respondeat superior but rather the employer's own negligence in not discharging the unfit servant.\"\n    <em>\n     Dayton\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1980%20OK%20193\">\n     1980 OK 193\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 17,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10443471\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/621/1155/#p1161\">\n     621 P.2d at 1161\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Whether the employer's prior knowledge rises to the level of gross negligence is a fact issue to be determined in the course of the litigation.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10443471\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/621/1155/#p1161\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    In contrast, punitive or exemplary damages may be assessed against an employer under the doctrine of respondeat superior if\n    <em>\n     an employee's conduct\n    </em>\n    \"would serve to justify an exemplary damages award against the employee as an individual tortfeasor.\"\n    <em>\n     Thiry v.

Thus, an employer's exposure to punitive damages \"could differ significantly based on whether the focus of the punitive damages inquiry was the wrongful [or] negligent conduct of the agent or the negligent conduct of the employer.\"\n    <em>\n     Chamberlain v. Thomas\n    </em>\n    , No. 5:11-cv-01430-HE,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204355908\">\n     2012 WL 4355908\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *1 (Sept. 24, 2012).

In\n    <em>\n     Jordan\n    </em>\n    , a customer went into a convenience store, and an altercation ensued between the customer and an employee of the store. The customer sued the employee for battery and alleged that the convenience store was vicariously liable for the acts of its employee under the doctrine of respondeat superior. The customer also alleged the convenience store was negligent in hiring and retaining the employee because the store knew or should have known the employee had violent tendencies. The store stipulated the altercation occurred while its employee was acting in the course and scope of employment, and we said that \"[w]hen an employer stipulates that an employee is acting within the scope of employment at the time of the altercation and punitive damages are available against it under a theory of respondeat superior, an additional claim for negligent hiring exposes the employer to no additional liability.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 21,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11987596\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/935/289/\">\n     935 P.2d at 294\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    \u00b6 14 The facts in\n    <em>\n     Jordan\n    </em>\n    are distinguishable from the case at bar because\n    <em>\n     Jordan\n    </em>\n    involved a battery claim against the employee and a negligent hiring claim against the employer. Because the Plaintiff in this case did not appeal the district court's dismissal of the negligent hiring claim, we need not determine whether a negligent hiring claim should be treated differently than a negligent entrustment claim.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    Upon consideration, we conclude that an employer's liability for negligently entrusting a vehicle to an unfit employee is a separate and distinct theory of liability from that of an employer's liability under the respondeat superior doctrine. An employer's stipulation that an accident occurred during the course and scope of employment does\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    , as a matter of law, bar a negligent entrustment claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    \u00b6 15 At the motion to dismiss stage, a court must \"take all factual allegations in the petition as true and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom.\"\n    <em>\n     Cates\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20OK%209\">\n     2018 OK 9\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 7,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565557\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/412/98/#p102\">\n     412 P.3d at 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . \"If relief is possible under any set of facts that can be gleaned from the petition, the motion to dismiss should be denied.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 7,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565557\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/412/98/#p102\">\n     412 P.3d at 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

As it pertains to Van Eaton's argument, the Court in\n     <em>\n      Howell\n     </em>\n     , found that the Oklahoma version of Federal Rule 8(e)(2) was very similar \"with one important exception.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     , \u00b6 11,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10364670\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/818/444/#p447\">\n      818 P.2d at 447\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . The Court found that the Oklahoma rule, \u00a7 2008(e)(2), contained additional language that \"clarifie[d] the intent of the legislature that a litigant be allowed not only to plead inconsistently, but also be allowed to rely on inconsistent theories or defenses throughout trial.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     ;\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      also\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Specialty Beverages v.
