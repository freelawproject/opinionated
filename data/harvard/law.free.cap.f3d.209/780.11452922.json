Riley appeals the take-nothing judgment of the district court in his ERISA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> suit against Defendant-Appellee Administrator of the SuperSaver 401K Capital Accumulation Plan for Employees of Participating AMR Corporation Subsidiaries (\u201cthe Plan\u201d). Riley claims that the Plan failed to pay benefits owed and breached its fiduciary duty by failing to provide complete and accurate information about the Plan. The Plan filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of Riley\u2019s action and an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 502(g) of ERISA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court granted the Plan\u2019s motion in part by rejecting Riley\u2019s claims against the Plan, but denied the part of the Plan\u2019s summary judgment motion that sought attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Riley has appealed the adverse judgment on the substance of his ERISA claims; but the Plan neither cross-appealed the district court\u2019s denial of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees nor briefed that issue to us, so it is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-16\">MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b811-17\">We have carefully reviewed the facts as revealed by the record on appeal, the appellate briefs and record excerpts of the parties, and the Memorandum Opinion and Order of the district court, in the context of the applicable law as briefed to us by the parties and as set forth in the district court\u2019s opinion. As a result of our review, we are satisfied that the district court\u2019s clear and deta\u00f1ed analysis of this case is correct and that the ultimate ruling on the merits of Riley\u2019s claims is free of error. Consequently, we would merely waste judicial resources by writing further on the issues raised by Riley. We therefore affirm the take-nothing judgment of the district court for essentially the reasons set forth in its Memorandum Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-19\">ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b811-20\">As the Plan did not appeal or brief the question of its entitlement to attorneys\u2019 fees under ERISA, that issue is not before us. We are nevertheless constrained to observe that \u2014 even under the deferential abuse of discretion standard of review\u2014 the district court\u2019s ruling on that point could not have been sustained had it been appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-21\">The court began correctly by invoking the five-factor test we established in <em>Iron Workers Local No. 272 v. Bowen</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as quoted in <em>Dial v. NFL Player Supplemental Disability Plan</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The <em>Bowen </em>factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4R\">1. The degree of the opposing parties\u2019 culpability or bad faith;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>2. The ability of the opposing parties to satisfy an award of attorneys\u2019 fees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-4\">3. Whether an award of attorneys\u2019 fees against the opposing parties would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances; .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\">4. Whether the parties requesting attorneys\u2019 fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a significant question regarding ERISA itself; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-6\">5. The relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">After quoting all five of the <em>Bowen </em>factors, however, the district court stated, \u201c[i]n the instant cause, the Court\u2019s analysis begins and ends with the degree of Riley\u2019s culpability or bad faith.\u201d Thus the court never reached the remaining four <em>Bowen </em>factors. Yet, nothing in <em>Bowen, Dial, </em>or other precedents on point can be read to endow the single factor of culpability or bad faith with exclusive powers of control. By ending its inquiry after considering only that one factor and ignoring the rest, the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Irrespective of whether we might agree or disagree with the district court\u2019s analysis of that one factor (indeed had it been before us <em>de novo, </em>we might well have disagreed with the district court,' given Riley\u2019s dogged pursuit-of the claim in the face of little or no legal or factual bases, as demonstrated by his failure to address a number of the Plan\u2019s winning contentions at summary judgment), the deferential abuse of discretion standard of review would have prevented us from substituting our conclusion for the trial court\u2019s on that one factor. It is nevertheless conceivable that the results of an examination of all remaining factors might have outweighed the absence of culpability or bad faith by demonstrating that Riley had the ability to satisfy ah award of'attorneys\u2019 fees, that such an award would deter other retirees and plan participants from pursuing legally and factually meritless claims, that the Plan\u2019s recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees would benefit all participants and beneficiaries by recouping Plan ' assets spent defending such litigation, and that the relative merits of the Plan\u2019s position was (as is obvious) clearly superior to Riley\u2019s. Had the court considered all the <em>Bowen </em>factors (and any relevant non <em>-Bowen </em>factors as well) and reached conclusions favorable to the Plan, the court in its discretion might well have awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to the Plan despite the absence of bad faith on Riley\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">Albeit <em>dicta </em>under these circumstances, we are constrained to write and publish this analysis to dispel any mistaken belief among the courts of this circuit or potential ERISA litigants that alone the factor of culpability and bad faith somehow supplants the other <em>Bowen </em>factors and conclusively determines the outcome of the attorneys\u2019 fees issue. To the contrary, <em>Bowen </em>makes clear that (1) the list of five factors to be considered in an ERISA \u00a7 502(g) attorneys\u2019 fees case is a non-exhaustive, <em>ejusdem generis </em>list (\u201c[A] court should consider <em>such factors as </em>the following [five factors].... [I]n any individual case, however, <em>other considerations may be relevant as </em>well\u201d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (2) none among the five listed factors is entitled to greater weight \u2014 much less unilaterally determinative powers \u2014 than any of the others (\u201cNo one of these factors is necessarily decisive, and some may not be apropos in a given case, but together they are the nuclei of concerns that a court should address in applying Section 502(g).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">In sum, when considering a request for attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 502(g) of ERISA, the court should consider and explicate the five <em>Bowen </em>factors, and should do so without giving predominance or preclusive effect to any one of them; and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>court should also consider relevant non-<em>Bowen </em>factors, if there are any.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">For the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s clear and comprehensive opinion, the judgment of that court is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-11\">.
