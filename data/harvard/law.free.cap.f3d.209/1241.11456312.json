The district court found that Means\u2019s claim was procedurally barred. Means maintains that the claim was not procedurally barred, or, in the alternative, that he met the burden of showing actual innocence to overcome that bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">A district court\u2019s grant or denial of a habeas corpus petition is .reviewed <em>de novo. See Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 119 S.Ct. 2373, 144 L.Ed.2d 777 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-11\">Under \u00a7 2254, federal district courts have jurisdiction to entertain habeas petitions only from people who are \u201cin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3). The Supreme Court has held that a petitioner is not in custody and thus cannot challenge a conviction when the sentence imposed for that conviction has expired. <em>See Maleng v. Cook, </em>490 U.S. 488, 490-91, 109 S.Ct. 1923, 1925, 104 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989). But we have held that the Court in <em>Maleng </em>permitted currently incarcerated petitioners to challenge a sentence enhanced by an expired sentence. <em>See White v. Butterworth, </em>70 F.3d 573, 574 (11th Cir.1995), <em>corrected, </em>78 F.3d 500 (11th Cir.1996). \u201cIn order to meet the</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-1\">\u2018in custody\u2019 requirement, the petitioner is deemed to be challenging the current sentence that has been enhanced by an expired conviction, rather than directly challenging the expired conviction.\u201d <em>Van Zant v. Florida Parole Commission, </em>104 F.3d 325, 327 (11th Cir.1997). In this way a petitioner can challenge the expired sentence. <em>See id. </em>However, a petitioner who challenges an expired state sentence that was used to enhance his current federal sentence must bring his suit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Birdsell v. State of Alabama, </em>834 F.2d 920 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-2\">Means claims that he intended to bring his petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. It is true that federal courts must look beyond the labels of motions filed by pro se inmates to interpret them under whatever statute would provide relief. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990). However, \u00a7 2255 designates the United States Attorney as the proper defendant in such an action. Therefore, we conclude that we do not have jurisdiction to entertain this action and that it should have been brought as a \u00a7 2255 petition. Accordingly we remand this action to the district court with instructions to serve notice of this petition on the United States Attorney and thereafter to construe this action as a \u00a7 2255 petition. The State of Alabama shall be permitted to participate in this action as an amicus curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-3\">VACATED and REMANDED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1272-12\">.
