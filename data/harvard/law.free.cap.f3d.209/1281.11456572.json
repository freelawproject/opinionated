Preston appeals the judgment of the tax court that certain payments made by Preston were not deductible as alimony under \u00a7 215 of the Internal Revenue Code. Among other things, Preston argues that payments to his former spouse and others for his children\u2019s expenses were deductible as alimony based upon <em>Commissioner v. Lester, </em>366 U.S. 299, 81 S.Ct. 1343, 6 L.Ed.2d 306 (1961). We affirm the tax court\u2019s determination that these payments were child support under I.R.C. \u00a7 71(c) and, as a result, nondeductible to Preston under \u00a7 215. As to Preston\u2019s other arguments, we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-22\">I.R.C. \u00a7 215<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> permits a taxpayer to deduct from gross income payments made to a spouse under a divorce or separation instrument that are includible in the re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>eeiving spouse\u2019s gross income as alimony pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 71 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 71(c), however, excludes from alimony \u201cthat part of any payment which the terms of the divorce or separation instrument fix (in terms of an amount of money or a part of the payment) as a sum which is payable for the support of children of the payor spouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">Forest Preston and Diane Sowell were married in 1974 and during their marriage had two children, Ashley and Barron. In March 1992, Sowell filed a petition for divorce. On April 3, 1992, the Superior Court of Muscogee County, Georgia, issued a temporary order, which stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-6\">[Preston] shall pay for the support of [Sowell] and the two (2) minor children of the parties and the following household and family expenses until further Order of the Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-7\">(d) The medical and dental expenses of [Sowell] and the children and prescription drug expenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7kt\">(e) The children\u2019s school tuition, supplies and activities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-17\">(f) The cost of clothing for [Sowell] and the children (the amount to be agreed upon by [Sowell] and [Preston]; and if the parties are not able to agree, the matter shall be brought before the Court).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-18\">In addition to making the payments above enumerated, [Preston] shall pay to [Sowell] the sum of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,000.00) per month, commencing April 1, 1992, with a payment of FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500.00), and the payment of an additional FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500.00) on the 15th of April, 1992, and continuing with like payments during each calendar month thereafter until further Order of the Court....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-19\">On September 9, 1993, the Superior Court issued a final order granting the parties a divorce, which supplanted the temporary order. The final order re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>quired, among other things, that Preston pay his son Barron\u2019s private school tuition for the 1993-94 school year and his daughter Ashley\u2019s car insurance until she reached 18 years of age. It also required Preston to pay Sowell an additional $1600 per month as \u201cchild support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">In his income tax returns for the years 1992 and 1993, Preston claimed alimony deductions for payments made to Sowell and others for expenses of the children pursuant to the temporary order. For instance, in 1992, he deducted, among other payments, a $406 payment made to \u201cDr. Hudson\u201d for \u201cdoctor bill-children,\u201d a $136 payment to Sowell for \u201cchildren\u2019s dental bill,\u201d and a $1,109 payment to \u201cPacelli High\u201d for \u201cAshley\u2019s tuition.\u201d Additionally, in his 1993 and 1994 returns, Preston claimed alimony deductions for amounts paid pursuant to the final order for Barron\u2019s tuition and Ashley\u2019s car insurance. He did not claim alimony deductions for any amounts paid pursuant to the final order\u2019s directive to pay $1600 per month in \u201cchild support.\u201d The tax court denied the deductions, ruling the payments were nondeductible child support, not alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">The question is whether, under \u00a7 71(e), the payments were \u201cfix[ed] (in terms of an amount of money or a part of the payment)\u201d by the temporary or final order, as applicable, as sums \u201cpayable for the support of children.\u201d Preston relies on <em>Commissioner v. Lester, </em>366 U.S. 299, 81 S.Ct. 1343, 6 L.Ed.2d 306 (1961) <em>(overruled by </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 71(c)(2)), for the argument that, in essence, the payments were not child support under \u00a7 71(c) because the temporary or final order did not fix a <em>dollar amount </em>for the payments. In <em>Lester, </em>the divorce decree provided for a periodic, fixed payment to the taxpayer\u2019s former spouse and children, which would be reduced by a percentage upon the death, marriage or emancipation of the minor children. The Supreme Court construed the entire amount of the payments to be alimony income to the receiving spouse and deductible to the taxpayer, indicating that the divorce decree \u201cmust expressly specify or \u2018fix\u2019 a sum certain or percentage of the payment for child support before any of the payment is excluded from the [receiving spouse\u2019s] income.\u201d The Court reasoned that the payments were properly taxable to the spouse because she had discretion to spend them as she desired. <em>See Lester, </em>366 U.S. at 303-06, 81 S.Ct. 1343. Although the ultimate holding of <em>Lester </em>was overruled by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 71(c)(2), which treats as child support the payment amounts that would be reduced on the happening of certain contingencies relating to the children, the reasoning in <em>Lester </em>cited by Preston remains persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">Preston\u2019s payments, however, were not general support payments as in <em>Lester. </em>Rather, the payments were earmarked by the temporary or final order for the specific expenses of the children as they arose. The reasoning underlying Lester-that the receiving spouse must report income where he or she has discretion in spending the payments received-is inapplicable. <em>See Sperling v. Commissioner, </em>726 F.2d 948, 951-53 (2nd Cir.1984) (holding that <em>Lester </em>applies only to general payments between spouses, not to separate payments \u201cearmarked for specific, [child] support-related purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-8\">Under \u00a7 71(c), the child support component of each of Preston\u2019s payments was indeed \u201cfix[ed] ... in terms of a part of the payment\u201d by the temporary or final order. Each of the individual payments of the children\u2019s expenses was payable exclusively for the support of the children. Therefore, the child support component of each payment was fixed at <em>100% </em>by the applicable order. Consequently, under \u00a7 71(c), the payments did not constitute income to Sowell, and Preston was not entitled to deduct them from his income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>pursuant to \u00a7 215. We affirm the tax court\u2019s denial of the claimed deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-4\">Likewise, we affirm the tax court\u2019s judgment that the following payments by Preston were not deductible as alimony under I.R.C. \u00a7 215:</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">(1) $2,048 in 1994 on Sowell\u2019s life insurance policy. The payment was made to pay off a loan of unspecified origin against the policy. It was not a premium payment, which would be deductible under some circumstances. <em>See Rev. Rul. </em>70-218, 1970-1 C.B. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">(2) $1,647 in 1994 for Sowell\u2019s dental bill. The final divorce decree did not require that Preston pay this bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">(3) $2,204 and $566 in 1992 and 1993, respectively, for Sowell\u2019s car expenses. Cash payments to a third party on behalf of a spouse qualify as alimony, assuming all other requirements are satisfied. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 71(b)(1); Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.71-lT(b), Q &amp; A # 6. Preston, however, has not demonstrated that he paid cash to Preston Oil on behalf of Sowell for her car expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-8\">(4) The payments ($5,000 in 1993 and $12,000 in 1994) stemming from the award of $180,000 of \u201calimony\u201d in the final order. Under Georgia law, Preston would still be liable for these payments in the event of Sowell\u2019s death. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 71(b)(1)(D) (excluding from the definition of \u201calimony\u201d payments not terminated by the death of the payee); <em>Winokur v. Winokur, </em>258 Ga. 88, 365 S.E.2d 94, 96 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">(5) The payments for Sowell\u2019s legal fees pursuant to the final order. The payments would not terminate in the event of So-well's death. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 71(b)(1)(D); <em>Winokur, </em>365 S.E.2d at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-10\">(6) Payments to finance Sowell\u2019s car (totaling $669 in 1993 and $3,447 in 1994). The payments would survive Sowell\u2019s death. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 71(b)(1)(D); <em>Stone v. Stone, </em>254 Ga. 519, 330 S.E.2d 887, 888-89 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-11\">The tax court committed reversible error, however, in overlooking the government\u2019s concession that certain payments for the support of Sowell made pursuant to the temporary order were deductible. Under Georgia law, a taxpayer\u2019s liability to make payments under a temporary order entered in a divorce proceeding ceases upon the death of the spouse, and therefore the payments are not disqualified by I.R.C. \u00a7 71(b)(1)(D) from being considered alimony. <em>See Butler v. Hicks, </em>229 Ga. 72, 189 S.E.2d 416, 419 (1972). The government conceded that the following payments pursuant to the temporary order were deductible:</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-12\">(1) Monthly payments to Sowell totaling $10,000 in 1992 and $7,000 in 1993;</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-13\">(2) Utility bills for the family residence, namely, for electricity ($2,125 in 1992 and $2,492 in 1993), water ($524 in 1992 and $478 in 1993), the telephone ($783 in 1992 and $1,384 in 1993), gas ($470 in 1992 and $788 in 1993), and cable television ($514 in 1992 and $403 in 1993);</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-14\">(3) A $426 doctor\u2019s bill in 1993 for the spouse;</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-15\">(4) One half of the payments for pest control ($188 in 1992 and $255 in 1993), lawn care ($343 in 1992 and $315 in 1993) and homeowner\u2019s insurance ($274 in 1992 and $60 in 1993) for the family residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-16\">(5) Payments for health insurance for Sowell and the children ($3,133 in 1992 and $2,222 in 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-17\">Accordingly, on remand, the tax court should modify its decision to reflect the government\u2019s concessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-18\">Finally, Preston questions the government\u2019s tactic of taking an inconsistent position in litigation against Sowell with respect to the characterization of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>payments. The government, however, is permitted to assert inconsistent positions against taxpayers on different sides of a transaction to protect the treasury against \u201cwhipsaw\u201d by taxpayers who themselves assert inconsistent positions. <em>See Centel Communications Co. v. Commissioner, </em>920 F.2d 1335, 1339-40 (7th Cir.1990). There is no indication in the record that, in either litigation, the government is doing anything other than ensuring that the income at issue will not elude taxation entirely. There is no indication that the government has already collected tax from Sowell on the payments it now argues are nondeductible to Preston. Indeed, although the government does not deny that it is asserting an inconsistent position in the litigation against Sowell, it represents \u201c[t]his is not to say that the IRS will seek to collect and retain taxes from taxpayers on both sides of the transaction.\u201d In view of the government\u2019s representation, we find no merit in Preston\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1312-13\">.
