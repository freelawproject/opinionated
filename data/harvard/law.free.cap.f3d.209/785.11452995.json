SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Bos Daily, L.C., Desert View Dairy, L.C., and Rio Grande Dairy, L.C. (collectively \u201cDairy Producers\u201d) appeal a summary judgment in favor of the United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Dairy Producers, who operate farms in El Paso County, Texas, contest the district court\u2019s interpretation of two repealed statutory sections, the Dairy Price Reduction Program of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446e(h)(2) (1996) and the Dairy Refund Provisions of <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1446e(h)(8) (1996).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 1446e, the USDA supported the domestic dairy industry by acting as a buyer of last resort for storable dairy products<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, to offset the cost of the program, assessed producers on the milk they produced, then refunded part or all of that assessment to those producers that did not increase their mar-ketings from year to year. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1446e.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">In 1995, Dairy Producers marketed a portion of their milk production in Mexico. They did not report this milk for purposes of the assessment, and they applied for and received a refund by not including the milk in their overall 1995 marketings. When USDA learned of the milk marketed in Mexico, it requested a return of the refund and assessed Dairy Producers for that milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Dairy Producers sought administrative relief, arguing that milk marketed outside the United States is not relevant to either program. Failing to achieve an administrative remedy, Dairy Producers sought relief in district court, which entered summary judgment in favor of USDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>employing the same standards as did the district court. <em>See Urbano v. Continental Airlines, Inc., </em>138 F.3d 204, 205 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1000, 119 S.Ct. 509, 142 L.Ed.2d 422 (1998). The district court found the contested statutory language to be unambiguous. If, using traditional tools of statutory construction, a statute is unambiguous, we give effect to that unambiguous interpretation. <em>See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., v. NRDC, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>Rublee v. Fleming, </em>160 F.3d 213, 215 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-13\">Section 1446e provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-14\">(a) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-15\">During the period beginning on January 1, 1991, and ending on December 31, 1996, the price of milk produced in the 48 contiguous States shall be supported as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-16\">(g) Excess purchases</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-17\">(1) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-18\">In order to offset any cost to the Commodity Credit Corporation associated with the purchase ... of milk and the products of milk in excess of 7,000,000,-000 pounds ... the Secretary shall, if necessary, provide for a reduction to be made in the price received by producers for all milk produced in the 48 contiguous States and marketed by producers for commercial use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-19\">(2) Calculation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-20\">...

The relevant USDA Regulations reflect this interpretation. <em>See </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1430.340-.341 (1998). Dairy Producers disagree, arguing that the language should be considered to read \u201cmilk produced <em>and marketed for commercial use </em>in the 48 contiguous States.\u201d The parties likewise dispute the meaning of \u201cmarketings\u201d in subsection (h)(3), which provides a refund of the subsection (h) assessment for those producers that do not increase their mar-ketings above that of the preceding year.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">A literal reading of the contested subsection (h)(1) phrase unambiguously favors USDA\u2019s interpretation, because Dairy Producers\u2019 interpretation requires relocating a portion of the statutory text. Dairy Producers therefore argue that their interpretation is supported by a holistic interpretation including subsection (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">In that subsection, an additional assessment is structured to offset costs from predicted excess government purchases of dairy products. The predicted excess cost is offset by a \u201creduction to be made in the price received by producers for all milk produced in the 48 contiguous States and marketed by producers for commercial use.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446e(g)(l) (1996). Thus, this reduction applies to the same group affected by the contested subsection (h) reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-16\">The amount of the subsection (g) reduction, however, is calculated using \u201cthe total quantity ... of milk the Secretary estimates will be produced and marketed in the United States for commercial use in such following calendar year.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446e(g)(2)(B). Thus, for purposes of the subsection (g) <em>calculation, </em>Dairy Producers\u2019 milk marketed in Mexico is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-17\">This distinction does not alter the unambiguous nature of the subsection (h) language. Because the subsection (g) assessment is meant to predict and directly offset excess USDA purchases of milk products, the calculation of the amount of that assessment does not include milk products predicted to be marketed outside the United States. The subsection (g) assessment is still levied on such milk, however, because, as subsection (a) notes and USDA persuasively argues, \u00a7 1446e supported the production of all milk produced in the continental United States wherever it might be sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-18\">By setting a price floor for milk products sold within the contiguous states, the USDA gave producers the option, irrespective of whether they exercised it, of making milk into products that would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>purchased by the USDA. Therefore, consideration of subsection (g) does not alter the plain meaning of the subsection (h) language. Further, the use of the phrase \u201cproduced and marketed in the United States\u201d in subsection (g) demonstrates that when it wanted to, Congress knew how to designate solely milk marketed in the United States. <em>See Russello v. United States, </em>464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-17\">Dairy Producers further contend that USDA has taken inconsistent positions on this issue when interpreting similar text in related statutory provisions. Not only do Dairy Producers fail to produce any credible evidence of such inconsistency,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but they fail to refute USDA\u2019s evidence that it has consistently interpreted the disputed statutory language to include milk marketed outside the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-18\">A previous price reduction program instructed the Secretary of Agriculture to \u201cprovide for a reduction to be made in the price received by producers for all milk produced in the United States and marketed by producers for commercial use.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(d)(2)(A) (1988). In language identical to that currently adopted by USDA, its regulations implementing this reduction included marketing outside the United States. <em>See </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1430.341(j)(2)(ii) (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-19\">When Congress enacted \u00a7 1446e(h) in 1990, it used language identical to that the Secretary had previously interpreted as applying to milk marketed outside the United States. This implicit Congressional acceptance is consistent with our conclusion that USDA\u2019s interpretation of the disputed statutory provisions is correct. <em>See United States v. Rutherford, </em>442 U.S. 544, 554 n. 10, 99 S.Ct. 2470, 61 L.Ed.2d 68 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-20\">We therefore decide that the language \u201call milk produced in the 48 contiguous States and marketed by producers for commercial use,\u201d \u00a7 1446e(h)(l), and \u201cthe producer did not increase marketings,\u201d \u00a7 1446e(h)(3), required Dairy Producers to include milk marketed in Mexico in determining the price reduction for which Dairy Producers were assessed pursuant to \u00a7 1446e(h)(l), and should have been included in determining whether Dairy Producers qualified for a \u00a7 1446e(h)(l) assessment refund pursuant to \u00a7 1446e(h)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The district court awarded USDA interest on Dairy Producers\u2019 debts. Because USDA regulations permit the agency to waive such interest on debts that are appealed, <em>see </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1403.10(b), Dairy Producers argue that such interest may not be assessed without a hearing. Not only did Dairy Producers fail to make this argument before the district court, but the argument is made without legal citation and has no merit. That an agency has discretion to waive interest logically does not mean that such agency must conduct a hearing before <em>not </em>waiving that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-9\">. These provisions were repealed in 1996. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 104-127, tit. I, \u00a7 141(g), 110 Stat. 915 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b816-10\">. While cows produce more milk in the spring, and less in the fall, demand for milk follows an opposite trend. Therefore, sufficient fall supplies equate to excess spring supplies. Milk perishes too quickly to store, but it can be stored by conversion into butter, powder, and cheese. In the Agricultural Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 1051, Congress began to support the domestic dairy industry by becoming the buyer of last resort at fixed prices for butter, powder, and cheese.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b818-21\">. Dairy Producers\u2019 argument concerning the Dairy Termination Program, which allowed farmers to contract out of the dairy producing business, is irrelevant. Permanently exporting one's cattle is markedly different from exporting milk produced by that cattle. The former permanently removes the government\u2019s burden of support, while the latter indirectly takes advantage of the price floor that support maintains.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
