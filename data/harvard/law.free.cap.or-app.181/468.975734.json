J.</author>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The State Office for Services to Children and Families (SCF) appeals from judgments denying its petitions to terminate mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights to their child, D. SCF argues that it presented clear and convincing evidence that mother and father are unfit and that termination is in D\u2019s best interest. ORS 419B.504; ORS 419B.500; ORS 419B.521(1). On <em>de novo </em>review, ORS 419A.200(5)(b), we agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We begin by setting out background facts and the facts leading to D being taken into SCF custody. We describe additional facts in connection with the relevant discussion of factors supporting termination. Mother has four children, two with father. Mother\u2019s oldest child, A, is in foster care in Washington. At the time of trial in July 2000, a petition for termination of mother\u2019s parental rights to A, who was then nine years old, had been filed in Washington. Her second child, C, lives with his biological father, and mother has no contact with him. Her third child, D, and her first with father, is the subject of this termination proceeding and has been in foster care since she was 13 months old. Her fourth child, J \u2014 her second child with father \u2014 has been in foster care in Washington since October 1999, when he was three months old.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">D was born on September 24, 1997. Although mother had had a histoiy of housing instability, she and father lived in the same apartment for approximately two years, including most of the time D was in mother\u2019s and father\u2019s custody. Mother and father separated briefly beginning in late October 1998. The circumstances of this separation are somewhat obscure. Mother and D went to mother\u2019s brother\u2019s apartment to drop off some things she had been keeping for her brother. Mother and father had had an argument before mother left for her brother\u2019s apartment. When she arrived at her brother\u2019s apartment, she met a man, Flannery, who also lived in the apartment. Flannery told mother that her brother had said that father did not treat her well and that he, Flannery, could do better. Mother explained that she decided at that time to move in with Flannery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>because she felt that father had withdrawn his affection from her in favor of D and that father monopolized child\u2019s attention. Mother later explained that \u201cI was being selfish. I wanted my daughter to myself. I didn\u2019t want to share her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Mother lived with Flannery for approximately three weeks. D lived with them for part of the time. Mother\u2019s brother and his wife also lived in the apartment. Mother knew that her brother was a convicted sex offender prohibited from having contact with minors. However, brother lived in the apartment while mother and D lived there. Although mother testified that her brother moved out because she and D moved in, the trial court found mother\u2019s testimony on this point to be not credible, and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Shortly after mother moved out, father obtained a restraining order prohibiting mother from having contact with D. In his application for the restraining order, father alleged that mother had hit him and D. At trial, however, father said that there had never been domestic violence in his household. Father explained that he had not filled out the application for the restraining order but had let a friend fill it out and thought that the contents of the application were \u201cnone of my business.\u201d Father apparently used the restraining order to convince mother to give him custody of D for a few days, but he later agreed to let mother take D with her to live with Flannery again.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">On November 9, 1998, father called the Portland Police Department and asked to have D removed from mother\u2019s custody and given to him. Officer Hurley responded to the call. Hurley described the neighborhood of the apartment where mother was living as an area that is known to police for drug and gang activity. The apartment complex was subsequently closed down as a chronic crime site. When Hurley arrived at the apartment where mother was living, mother told her that father had had the restraining order dismissed on November 6. Hurley confirmed with the Clackamas County Sheriffs Office that the order had been dismissed, but she testified that she was still concerned about D\u2019s safety. Hurley\u2019s first concern was about mother\u2019s brother\u2019s access to D. She was also troubled by D\u2019s condition that night. Although it was a very cold night, mother brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>D outside for an extended time wearing only a light sleeper. Although Hurley asked mother several times to take D inside out of the cold, mother refused to do so. Later on, mother could find no clean or warmer clothes for D or any diapers. Mother told Hurley that she had brought six diapers when she had taken D back from father three days before and had not bought any more.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">D was dirty and her clothes were dirty and smelled bad. Hurley testified that, when she changed D\u2019s clothing and diaper later at the police station, she saw that \u201c [h] er feet were so dirty that they were almost black. It was very obvious that this child had not been bathed in a long time. Her face was dirty. Her hands were dirty. * * * She had dirt under her toes and fingernails.\u201d Mother gave Hurley a bottle to take with her that appeared to have mildew in it. Hurley contacted SCF and, at the direction of D\u2019s caseworker, took D into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Also on November 9, father was arrested in connection with the dismissed restraining order. Father took the position at trial that it was not his idea to try to get D back that night. He said that some of his sister\u2019s friends came to his house, saw that he was unhappy, and decided that he needed to get his child back; according to father, he just went along with what they told him.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">After D was removed from their custody, both mother and father entered into several service agreements with SCF. Although mother and father did participate in many of the services identified in the agreement, SCF found that mother and father were not making any significant changes as a result of the services. We disagree with the dissent that mother and father \u201cfully\u2019 participated in services. 181 Or App at 496 (Edmonds, J., dissenting). Based on that failure and on a October 1999 psychological evaluation by Dr. Ewell, which we discuss in some detail below, 181 Or App at 479-80, SCF decided to seek termination of mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights to D. In May 2000, SCF filed petitions to terminate their parental rights. Although the petitions alleged both unfitness, ORS 419B.504, and neglect, ORS 419B.506, SCF pursues only the unfitness ground on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Our task on <em>de novo </em>review is to determine whether clear and convincing evidence in the record supports the conclusion that mother and father are presently unfit to parent D as a result of conduct or conditions that are seriously detrimental to D and that the integration of D into mother\u2019s and father\u2019s home is improbable within a reasonable time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change. ORS 419B.504; <em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Stillman, </em>333 Or 135, 145-46, 36 P3d 490 (2001). The standard of clear and convincing evidence requires a showing that it is highly probable that mother and father are not presently able, and will not be able within a reasonable time, to meet D\u2019s physical and emotional needs. <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Johnson, </em>165 Or App 147, 156, 997 P2d 231 (2000). If that standard is satisfied, we must then decide whether termination is in D\u2019s best interest. ORS 419B.500; <em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Hammons, </em>170 Or App 287, 297,12 P3d 983 (2000), <em>rev den </em>331 Or 583 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Stillman, </em>generally, a court may terminate parental rights for the purpose of freeing a child for adoption if \u201cthe court finds that termination is in the best interest of the child.\u201d 333 Or at 144. The court further observed that the \u201cspecific bases\u201d for termination are set out in ORS 419B.502 to ORS 419B.508. <em>Id. </em>One of those statutes, and the statute relevant here, is ORS 419B.504. Under ORS 419B.504, parental rights may be terminated if we conclude that parents are \u201cunfit by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child\u201d and that \u201cintegration of the child into the home of the * * * parents is improbable within a reasonable time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change.\u201d ORS 419B.504 provides a nonexclusive list of factors that the court must consider in determining whether a parent is unfit and in determining whether the circumstances making the parent unfit are unlikely to change. <em>Stillman, </em>333 Or at 147 (\u201cstatutory examples [in ORS 419B.504] are just that \u2014 examples\u201d). The statutory factors relevant to this case are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">\u201c(1) Emotional illness, mental illness or mental deficiency of the parent of such nature and duration as to render the parent incapable of providing proper care for the child for extended periods of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>\u201c(2) Conduct toward any child of an abusive, cruel or sexual nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">\u201c(4) Physical neglect of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\u201c(5) Lack of effort of the parent to adjust the circumstances of the parent, conduct, or conditions to make the return of the child possible or failure of the parent to effect a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social agencies for such extended duration of time that it appears reasonable that no lasting adjustment can be effected.\u201d ORS 419B.504.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In the petitions for termination, SCF advanced several considerations for determining mother\u2019s and father\u2019s unfitness, several of which overlap with the statutory considerations set out above. With respect to mother, SCF asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">\u201ca) Lack of effort or failure to obtain and maintain a suitable or stable living situation for the child so the return of the child to the parent is possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">\u201cb) Failure to present a viable plan for the return of the child to the parent\u2019s care and custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">\u201cc) Failure to learn or assume parenting and housekeeping skills sufficient to provide for the safe and proper raising of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-11\">\u201cd) An emotional illness, mental illness or mental deficiency of such nature and duration as to render the parent incapable of providing care for extended periods of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-12\">\u201ce) Failure to protect the child from physical and sexual abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-13\">\u201cf) Failure to effect a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social agencies for such extended duration of time that it appears reasonable that no lasting adjustment can be effected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">SCF asserted the same conduct or conditions with respect to father, with the addition of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>\u201cMack of effort to adjust the parent\u2019s circumstances, conduct or conditions to make return of the child to the parent possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Although we will address individually many of the factors stated in the statute and asserted by SCF, we stress that the overall determination is whether mother and father are \u201cunfit by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child.\u201d ORS 419B.504. Accordingly, our concern is whether, considered together, conduct and conditions established by the evidence are seriously detrimental to D. That a single factor, standing alone, would not support termination is not determinative of whether mother and father are unfit. D is exposed to all of the proven conduct and conditions together, and our unfitness determination is similarly based on consideration of that combination of conduct and conditions and on whether that combination is seriously detrimental to D.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Moreover, we conduct our inquiry not in the abstract but with emphasis on the practical effect of mother\u2019s and father\u2019s conduct and conditions on D:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-4\">\u201cORS 419B.090 demonstrates the broader context of the two inquiries under ORS 419B.504. That statute declares that it is the \u2018policy of the State of Oregon to recognize that children are individuals who have legal rights.\u2019 ORS 419B.090(2)(a). Those rights include the right to \u2018[p]ermanency with a safe family.\u2019 ORS 419B.090(2)(a)(A). * * * Consistent with the foregoing legislative policy, the focus of both parts of the test for termination under ORS 419B.504 is on the detrimental effect of the parent\u2019s conduct or condition on the child, not just the seriousness of the parent\u2019s conduct or condition in the abstract.\u201d <em>Stillman, </em>333 Or at 146.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">We first consider evidence related to any mental or emotional illness or disorder that might render mother or father incapable of caring for D. ORS 419B.504(1); <em>see State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. DeVore, </em>108 Or App 426, 816 P2d 647 (1991). Under ORS 419B.504(1), a diagnosis of a mental or emotional illness or disorder standing alone is not enough; there must also be evidence that the illness or disorder renders the parent \u201cincapable of providing proper care for the child for extended periods of time.\u201d <em>See also Johnson, </em>165 Or App at 158-59 (stating that the statute requires more than a diagnosis).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Some of the evidence about each parent\u2019s mental and emotional condition overlaps. Several health care providers testified about mother\u2019s and father\u2019s mental and emotional conditions and the effect of those conditions on mother\u2019s and father\u2019s ability to provide proper care for D. Deborah Baker, a marriage and family therapist, conducted a couples evaluation of mother and father at the request of SCF. She testified that their relationship was \u201cnarcissistic borderline.\u201d Baker explained that, in a narcissistic borderline relationship, one partner \u2014 in this case mother \u2014 focuses on her own needs to the exclusion of the needs of others, while the borderline partner \u2014 in this case father \u2014 has strong needs to regulate intimacy and engages in patterns of pulling people closer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>him but then withdrawing from them. Baker further testified that the dynamics of such a relationship could have a negative effect on parenting because, in narcissistic borderline relationships, the needs of the parents can take precedence over the needs of the child, restrict empathy with the child, and lead to limited thinking in evaluating a child\u2019s best interests. The evidence of mother\u2019s and father\u2019s behavior provides examples of such a condition. As we will discuss, mother\u2019s and father\u2019s seeming inability to connect with D and their occasional indifference to D is indicative of this condition. With respect to mother, Baker noted that an example of the manifestation of this condition was that mother would play Nintendo between six and thirteen hours a day. Mother said that she believed that D was safe during that time because she kept her in a high chair. Baker also noted that father suffered from depression, for which he was taking medication, and that this condition negatively affected his parenting activities. Overall, Baker stated, \u201cI did not see very much empathy during the evaluation. Neither parent at that time could seem to show any concerns about [D\u2019s] needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">In July 1998, Dr. Perry Dudley, a psychologist, evaluated mother and father at the request of the Washington Department of Social and Health Services. Dudley diagnosed mother as presenting with post-traumatic stress disorder related to past sexual abuse, borderline intellectual functioning, and \u201cpersonality disorder not otherwise specified with cluster B features.\u201d Dudley explained that a \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d is a disorder in how a person thinks or relates inter-personally and that, in mother\u2019s case, her personality disorder included anger control problems and difficulty seeing things from others\u2019 perspectives, inhibiting impulses, and exercising self-control. Dudley further testified that, given mother\u2019s diagnoses, it would probably be difficult for her to benefit from treatment and parenting training. Dudley diagnosed father with a \u201cmixed personality disorder\u201d with primarily avoidant and antisocial features. Dudley further testified that father could not answer a number of standardized questions about parenting skills. Dudley characterized father\u2019s prognosis for improvement as \u201cpoor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In October 1998 and April 1999, Sharon Brewer, a licensed counselor, conducted \u201canger management parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>assessments\u201d of mother and father. Brewer reported that, although father resisted taking the assessment, she was ultimately able to conclude that he had significant problems with anger management and depression. Brewer further testified that some of the results of father\u2019s assessment indicated that he was at a high risk for physically abusing a child. Brewer explained that typical child abuse potential scores for the kind of assessment she conducted are in the 40 to 150 range, while father\u2019s score was 287. She also stated that therapy for father would likely take several years.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Finally, in October 1999, SCF requested that Dr. James Ewell conduct a comprehensive psychological evaluation of mother and father, as well as a \u201cparent/child interaction observation.\u201d Ewell was unable to evaluate father because father refused to cooperate. After Ewell had conducted the parent/child observation, father left Ewell\u2019s office; Ewell was later told that father had decided not to complete the evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Ewell diagnosed mother with mild mental retardation; post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic; adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct; and \u201cpersonality disorder not otherwise specified.\u201d Ewell explained that a personality disorder like mother\u2019s \u201chas a significant impact usually on parenting, a significant major impact. Individuals who are personality disordered, by definition, tend to lead rather chaotic, traumatic lives where there is upheaval, instability. And that, of course, flies in the face of what a child needs as far as consistency, predictability and love in [his or her] life.\u201d Ewell concluded that mother was not an appropriate placement for D, that the prognosis for change was very poor, and that he could not recommend any forms of intervention to remedy that prognosis. Ewell explained why his evaluation was so negative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">\u201cWhen I then talked to her and tried to engage her in conversations related to parenting and how she might interact with the child, I talked to her about her family life and how she understood the children, and her history, I was very surprised at the lack of insight that I saw from a person who had gone through programs of intervention. I would have expected for someone who had gone through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>such programs for there to be a deeper understanding and insight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\">\u201cIn addition to that lack of understanding and insight, it was clear to me that she was quite angry. She did not feel she needed much more intervention. I believe she said possibly some family counseling or some marital counseling. But she did not seem to, from my opinion, grasp the severity of her circumstance and the need for fairly intense long-term intervention. The fact that she did not grasp that or did not seem to be very amenable to treatment is also a negative prognostic indicator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">\u201cA third reason that it is so bleak is that at least one of the conditions diagnosed, that a limited cognitive ability doesn\u2019t change with intervention. That stays pretty much the way it is. And when an individual, in addition to the limited intellectual ability, has these other forms of maladjustment that I have also described, the entire picture is very negative. And in this case it led me to conclude that I could not come up with other programs that I thought would be likely to be helpful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Ewell also testified that he was \u201cconcerned * * * that there would be a strong risk of some emotional traumatization to the child because of [mother\u2019s] conditions and how those negatively [affect] her ability to parent and also as a result of what I understand to be a fairly continuous upheaval, turmoil, lack of progress in terms of stabilizing her life.\u201d Finally, Ewell stated that his evaluation indicated that mother did not have the ability to provide the stable and nurturing environment necessary to children.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">We have affirmed the termination of parental rights when the parent is diagnosed with mental or emotional problems that make the affected individual unfit to parent. <em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Frazier, </em>152 Or App 568, 600, 955 P2d 272, <em>rev den </em>327 Or 305 (1998). There is clear and convincing evidence in this record that mother and father suffer from mental and emotional deficiencies. Although the deficiencies suffered by mother and father are different, each parent\u2019s deficiencies render him or her presently unfit to parent D. As noted above, the trial court in this case, in a very thoughtful and detailed opinion, denied the petitions to terminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights. In reaching that disposition, the court concluded that, although mother and father were not model parents and, in fact, had serious deficiencies as parents, the state had not proved that mother and father were presently unfit to parent D. In our view, however, the trial court erred in overlooking the consistent opinions of the experts who evaluated mother\u2019s and father\u2019s conditions and the many persons who worked with mother and father that these parents were not presently capable of caring for D and that the prognosis for mother and father acquiring minimally adequate parenting skills was not good. The persons who evaluated and worked with these parents did so in a variety of capacities over a significant period of time and represented a number of different social service entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">The evidence of mother\u2019s and father\u2019s conduct is consistent with the opinions of those who worked with and evaluated mother and father and expressed reservations about their present fitness as parents and their ability to change. This conduct demonstrates how the mental and emotional deficiencies, identified by those who worked with and evaluated them, make them unfit parents. For example, each parent seemed to view D as a means of satisfying his or her own emotional needs: mother explained that she moved in with another man because father had withdrawn his affection from her in favor of D and because she wanted D to herself, while father misused the restraining order process in order to regain custody of D. As another example, there is evidence that, at least at times, mother has neglected the health of this child and one of her other children.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">There is also considerable evidence of instability in mother\u2019s and father\u2019s lives. It appears that, since November 1998, when D was removed from the home, until the time of trial, they had been homeless, living in homeless shelters (one of which they were asked to leave), and apparently living somewhat of a nomadic existence, moving frequently in and out of the homes of relatives and friends. Mother\u2019s and father\u2019s relationship also appears to be unstable. Although they apparently remained together as a couple, father testified that mother left him on a monthly basis. Mother admitted that she did leave father for affairs, but not as frequently as he claimed. As explained by Baker, a marriage and family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>therapist who evaluated them, the process of breaking up and reuniting \u201ccreates a lot of problems in the home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The record here also includes considerable evidence of how mother\u2019s and father\u2019s conduct and conditions have had or pose a risk of a seriously detrimental effect on D. Many of the experts who evaluated mother and father, and many of the social service workers who worked with mother and father, expressed serious concerns about D being left in mother\u2019s and father\u2019s care. Jenny Keys, a parent mentor who worked with mother and father concerning their parenting of D and her younger sibling for 10 months beginning in March 1999, was very concerned about their ability to provide minimal care for D. She indicated that, in addition to being concerned about inappropriate actions by mother and father in their interaction with D, she was very concerned for D\u2019s safety. At the time that her work with mother and father ended in December 1999, Keys recommended that mother\u2019s and father\u2019s visits with the children be closely supervised. She stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">\u201cI have extreme concern for the safety and well being of [\u00b6] and J]. During the ten months that I have worked with this family I have seen limited improvement in parenting skills and, in fact, have seen a sharp decrease in [father\u2019s] behavior, demeanor, parenting abilities, etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">During a psychological evaluation that took place after mother and father had taken parenting classes and participated in sessions with a parenting mentor, Ewell reported that both parents, especially father, were very emotionally distanced from D and that they displayed \u201c[v]ery few parenting skills.\u201d Ewell described father\u2019s demeanor during the evaluation as \u201crough\u201d and \u201cangry.\u201d Ewell stated that D seemed confused by her father\u2019s behavior and avoided approaching him. He further stated that D was \u201cwithdrawn\u201d from both parents. He characterized the emotional distance displayed between mother and father and D as \u201cremarkable\u201d and \u201calarming.\u201d Ewell explained that he asked mother\u2019s and father\u2019s caseworker to come into the room during his observation because he was concerned that there was a danger to D. According to Ewell, who said that he had done about a thousand such evaluations, this rarely happens during an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>observation. In his written report, Ewell summarized his parent/child observation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">\u201cThe most salient feature of this parent/child observation was the fact that neither [mother nor father] expressed much affection toward their daughter. Neither parent attempted to structure the visitation, or encourage their daughter\u2019s enjoyment. [Father] was extremely withdrawn and self-isolating. In fact, he appeared quite menacing and \u2018scary.\u2019 He complained frequently about his back pain. [Mother] did not respond to him. Much of the interaction was spent in silence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">\u201cDuring this observation, very few parenting skills were noticed. [D\u2019s] behavior was appropriate, so there was no need for either parent to intervene. Their lack of emotional spontaneity and encouragement was alarming. They did very little to reassure their daughter, or attempt to amuse her. Rather profound deficits would be suggested by the materials gathered during this observation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">As late as June 2000, Donna Schafte, a parent educator at Clark College in Vancouver who had taught mother and father in a 10-week parent-training program, stated that, in her opinion, before D could go home, mother and father would need a \u201c[t]remendous amount of support. I would almost say a live-in, someone there consistently to begin [with].\u201d She said that someone from a social services agency would need to be with them all the time. Schafte emphasized that both parents displayed significant anger problems and that, consequently, she would have fear for children living in their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">As is evident from the comments of the social services workers who have worked with mother and father and the experts who have evaluated them, a major component of mother\u2019s and father\u2019s lack of ability to provide adequate parenting relates to their inability to identify risks to D and protect her. The incident where mother went to live at her brother\u2019s home is an example of their extremely poor judgment regarding D\u2019s safety. Mother acknowledged that her brother was a convicted sex offender, for what she characterized as \u201csex abuse on a girl.\u201d However, she insisted that, when she went to live in his home, he moved out. The trial court did not believe mother, nor do we. Mother also said that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>she did not believe her brother was a sex offender. When father was asked if he was concerned about D living in mother\u2019s brother\u2019s home, he said \u201cnot really. That\u2019s her uncle.\u201d He also expressed the view that the brother was falsely accused and that he did not pose a risk to D.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Although not determinative, a parent\u2019s conduct with respect to children who are not the subject of a petition to terminate may be pertinent to a parent\u2019s fitness. The negative effect of mother\u2019s and father\u2019s mental and emotional deficiencies on their ability to care for D is also demonstrated by the behavior they exhibit in interacting with their younger child, J. During supervised visits, father would pick up J \u2014 then an infant \u2014 by his arms or by one arm. Father tried to feed six-week-old J a bottle by placing him in a car seat and propping his bottle up in the seat. Moreover, the addition of J to their family seems to have placed an additional burden on mother\u2019s and father\u2019s already overtaxed ability to parent D. Parent mentor Keys stated that, after J was born, mother and father struggled to divide their attention between the two children and that mother had a hard time focusing. Father would generally focus on J during visits while excluding D.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Mother\u2019s behavior with her oldest child, A, also underscores her parenting deficiencies. A was removed from mother\u2019s home at three weeks of age after community health nurses informed SCF that A was losing weight at such an alarming rate that his life was in danger. After several weeks in the hospital, A was released back into mother\u2019s custody. After about six months, mother voluntarily placed A with her mother. After her mother disappeared with A for several weeks, SCF took A into custody and placed him in foster care, citing employment and housing instability and parenting deficiencies. Although mother participated in some parenting training programs regarding her care for A, her SCF caseworker at that time, Walter Wickline, testified that he never became comfortable returning A to her care. Wickline explained that mother \u201ccame to be a new mom with far more barriers than many young women that I met.\u201d He further explained that mother could talk about parenting skills that she had learned, but she could not apply them in dealing with A.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Antonia Rathburn, a child therapist, testified about therapy sessions she had with mother and A beginning in December 1998. Rathburn explained that mother could not adjust her interaction with A to his true level and instead insisted on directing A\u2019s actions as if he were more mature. Rathburn testified that mother appeared to be unable to learn from A\u2019s responses and modify her approach to suit his developmental age; instead, she proceeded to forcibly instruct him, causing him increasing distress. Rathburn testified that mother was unable to put her own needs on hold and attend to A. According to Rathburn, mother entirely lacked skills in reading A\u2019s emotions and communicating her understanding to him and this induced anxiety in and damage to A.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">In summary, mother has been diagnosed with a number of mental conditions: borderline intellectual functioning, a personality disorder that includes anger control and impulsivity problems, mild mental retardation, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, and adjustment disorder. There is evidence that those conditions negatively affect mother\u2019s parenting skills: she is incapable of appreciating risks to D\u2019s safety and places D in unsafe situations, she has subjected D to chaotic and dangerous living conditions, and she neither understands nor pays sufficient attention to D\u2019s physical and emotional needs. Those effects establish that mother\u2019s mental and emotional conditions render her incapable of providing proper care for D for extended periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Father has been diagnosed or assessed with a mixed personality disorder with avoidant and antisocial personality features, anger management problems, depression, and a high child-abuse potential score. There is evidence that those conditions negatively affect father\u2019s parenting skills: he withdraws emotionally from D, he has shown limited concern about D\u2019s needs, he has demonstrated little understanding of basic parenting skills, and he does not appear to appreciate the risks that mother\u2019s conduct poses to D. Although father\u2019s mental and emotional conditions, and the effects of those conditions, differ from mother\u2019s, they are also sufficient to establish that father\u2019s mental and emotional conditions render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>him incapable of providing proper care for D for extended periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">We conclude that the evidence is clear and convincing that, because of their mental and emotional deficiencies, mother and father are not presently capable of providing proper care for D, that their conduct and condition have constituted a serious detriment to D in the past, and that the overwhelming bulk of the testimony from service providers indicates that there is a continuing risk of serious detriment to D in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The nature of mother\u2019s and father\u2019s unfitness here, however, is not such that it could not be overcome with sufficient effort. Thus, a critical issue in this case concerns the efforts that mother and father have made, the effectiveness of those efforts, and the prognosis for mother and father becoming capable of providing proper care for child in a \u201creasonable time.\u201d ORS 419B.504. In assessing this issue, we first consider a factor set out in ORS 419B.504(5) and relied on by SCF in connection with father here \u2014 \u201cMack of effort of the parent to adjust the circumstances of the parent, conduct, or conditions to make the return of the child possible.\u201d The evidence regarding father on this point is not entirely negative. Father did attend parenting classes and counseling visits with D and, in some cases, traveled a significant distance to do so. More telling, however, is evidence demonstrating that father\u2019s participation was grudging and, at times, even hostile. Schafte, a parent educator who led one of the parenting classes that mother and father attended, stated that these parents were one of the most difficult couples she had taught in 28 years, due to their resistance to being in class. She further testified that father refused throughout the parenting class sessions to wash his hands at the beginning of class, which was a class protocol intended to minimize the spreading of disease. Father tended to be quiet and withdrawn during class and did not turn in optional homework that Schafte assigned. Mark Niskanen, a Washington social worker who worked with mother and father, testified that on one occasion, when D called her foster parent \u201cmommy,\u201d father told Niskanen that he was going to jump over the counter separating them and \u201cbeat the crap out of\u2019 Niskanen.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Keys, a parent mentor who attended visits between mother and father and D at SCF, testified that, beginning in July 1999, father refused to work with her during the visits. Keys said that, when she tried to make parenting suggestions, father would make inappropriate comments and then increase the behavior that she had asked him to change or entirely disengage from interacting with child. During the last few months of her work with mother and father, Keys said father either focused on the other child, J, or on nothing at all. Staenke, another SCF worker who supervised visits between mother and father and D from November 1998 to October 1999, testified that father sometimes fell asleep during the visits or left during the middle of visits to go outside to smoke. Charmin Sadamori, an SCF caseworker who worked with mother and father beginning in early 1999, testified that, because of father\u2019s depression, she thought counseling would help him with his parenting skills. However, father was \u201cpretty resistant\u201d to obtaining counseling; Sadamori would make counseling appointments for father, but he would not show up. Another of mother\u2019s and father\u2019s caseworkers, Carrie Nash, testified that, while they were discussing visitation with D, father walked off as she was speaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Father himself admitted that he did not like people telling him how to parent and that that feeling made him less cooperative than he should have been. Father also testified that he stopped going to individual counseling because he just wanted to stop going. When asked about whether he sometimes did not participate with D during visits, father responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">\u201cAll these people \u2014 all I can say is all these people can say anything they want. Everybody has their own opinion. Everybody can do as they want. But there is a lot of times that, yeah, I do. I would just sit there and don\u2019t do nothing. That\u2019s my time. Eventually I come out of it. I start playing with my daughter or my kids, you know. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">\u201c* * * I am to the point where I go to these visits, I don\u2019t feel like visiting with the kids. Big deal. I show up anyway.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>When asked by the trial court about the reasons why he had been provided with parenting training and other services, father stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\">\u201cI\u2019m not here to satisfy myself. I am here to satisfy other people, to prove other people are wrong. I think this whole thing is wrong, but that\u2019s not for me to say. The only thing I can do is do what I have been told, jump through the hoops, do everything that I am told, and hope to hell something good comes out of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The state is required to make reasonable efforts to assist parents in making the adjustments necessary to enable them to become minimally adequate parents. ORS 419B.504(5); <em>Frazier, </em>152 Or App at 582. Whether the state has made reasonable efforts to provide services depends on the particular circumstances. <em>Id. </em>This factor also requires us to evaluate the effort expended by the parent and, in particular, whether the parent ignored or refused to participate in services. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Oseguera, </em>96 Or App 520, 526-27, 773 P2d 775 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">As discussed above, in this case, mother and father were offered a variety of counseling and parent-training services. One of the social workers who worked with mother and father testified that they had \u201creceived more services than any other case I have ever had.\u201d Father does not argue, nor do we believe, that the services offered to him did not constitute \u201creasonable efforts.\u201d However, we find that father demonstrated a \u201clack of effort\u201d to take advantage of those services and adjust his circumstances. He refused to participate in a psychological evaluation requested by SCF, he resisted reasonable hygiene protocols in parenting classes, he was withdrawn during parenting classes and visits with D, he fell asleep or left during visits, and he testified that, in his opinion, participating in services offered by SCF was \u201cjumping] through hoops.\u201d Mere physical presence is not sufficient to satisfy the \u201ceffort\u201d referred to in ORS 419B.504(5). The service providers who testified in this case consistently indicated that father was uninterested in, or even hostile to, their efforts. Father\u2019s own actions and words indicate that, at most, he was \u201cgoing through the motions\u201d with respect to offered services. The fact that father disliked the intervention of the social service agencies in his life and did not think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>it was necessary cannot excuse his lack of effort and progress in making himself available as a parent. We conclude that the state proved by clear and convincing evidence a lack of effort on father\u2019s part to adjust his circumstances and conduct to make return of D possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">SCF did not rely on lack of effort with respect to mother. 181 Or App at 475-76. Despite that difference, both mother and father \u2014 mother in spite of her efforts and father, at least in part, because of his lack of effort \u2014 have \u201cfail [ed] * * * to effect a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social agencies for such extended duration of time that it appears reasonable that no lasting adjustment can be effected.\u201d ORS 419B.504(5). SCF alleged that mother and father have failed \u201cto learn or assume parenting * * * skills sufficient to provide for the safe and proper raising of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">As noted above, there is clear and convincing evidence in this record that, at the time D was taken into custody, mother and father were not displaying adequate parenting skills. The evidence in this record further demonstrates that mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parenting skills have not improved to any appreciable extent despite extensive efforts by social services providers. As discussed above, mother and father have participated in numerous services offered by SCF and its Washington counterpart, some related to D and others related to their second child, J, and mother\u2019s first child, A. Several service providers testified at trial. As an overall matter, the testimony of those witnesses is remarkably consistent: Although mother and, to a lesser extent, father participated regularly and actively in the services that were offered to help them develop the skills to be better parents, neither one was able to demonstrate an improvement in applied parenting skills as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Despite all of the services that these parents received, every service provider who testified continued to express reservations about allowing mother and father to parent D unsupervised. For example, as noted above, parent educator Schafte said that, even though mother and father had completed a 10-week parenting class that she had taught, she would fear for D if she were returned to mother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>and father\u2019s home and would recommend that someone from a social service agency be in the home at all times. Linda Mulherin, a Washington home support specialist, worked with mother and father from January to July 2000. She observed that \u201cthe connection isn\u2019t there\u201d between mother and D and that mother and father seemed to be using the visits with D to meet their own needs, not D\u2019s needs. She said that she noticed no improvement in the interactions between parents and D during the time she was observing the visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Father appears not to have learned what kinds of interaction are appropriate with a child his daughter\u2019s age. Despite explanations from service providers about why it is inappropriate, father continued to \u201cplay\u201d with child by grabbing her by the arms, \u201cpretending\u201d to punch her, and pulling her chair to startle her. Father did not respond to a parent mentor\u2019s concern that it was unsafe for him to swing D around unprotected in her car seat. Moreover, father does not seem to understand the importance of being nurturing and affectionate to D. During supervised visits, father provided inconsistent affection to D, often withdrawing his attention entirely or focusing on his younger child and refusing to interact with D. On several occasions during supervised visits, father called D \u201cshit for brains.\u201d Not surprisingly, D has become increasingly wary of father and, ultimately, not interested in interacting with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Several service providers testified that, although mother could repeat back what she had learned about parenting, she could not apply that information. Although mother would state that her parenting skills had improved, she would deny that there had been anything wrong with her parenting to begin with. Furthermore, mother characterized herself at times as a \u201cperfect parent.\u201d When confronted with the report that D was not in good shape when she was taken into care by the police, she denied that that report was true. Mother is unable to interact with D on an age-appropriate level, continually subjecting D to expectations that are unrealistic for her age. Despite warnings from service providers, mother continues, during supervised visits, to fail to understand D\u2019s mental and physical capabilities or what mother should do to protect D from injuring herself. Mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>has not been able to apply what she has been taught in parenting class to provide a developmental-age-appropriate environment and toys for D; instead, mother selected toys that were developmentally too advanced or too fragile for D. Counselor Brewer assessed mother\u2019s motivation for treatment as \u201cfair to poor.\u201d As noted above, Ewell, who did a psychological evaluation of mother, described her prognosis for improvement as \u201cvery poor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Both parents seem to be unable to understand the emotional effects of their behavior on D and continue, despite contrary instruction, to put their emotional needs above those of D, to use D as a bargaining piece in their own relationship, and to inappropriately bring up their own relationship problems in front of D. Father\u2019s misuse of the restraining order process is an example of how these parents use D for their own purposes, instead of putting her needs ahead of their own. As discussed above, neither parent fully recognizes the danger from exposing D to mother\u2019s brother, a convicted sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In mother\u2019s case, although she has participated relatively compliantly in social services, she continues to demonstrate inadequate parenting skills. Despite extensive parenting training and other services she has received, mother continues to be unable to interact with D on an age-appropriate basis, to protect D from dangerous situations, and to subject D to inappropriate emotional demands. In father\u2019s case, his failure to improve his parenting skills may be attributable in part to his refusal to fully participate in some of the offered services. 181 Or App at 486-89. SCF has, however, offered father an extensive array of services and education, and his parenting skills have not improved as a result. Father continues to engage in unsafe and threatening behavior with respect to D and fails to understand why it is important to nurture D and show her affection. Despite parenting training and other services, child is afraid of father. Finally, like mother, father subjects D to inappropriate emotional demands by using her as a bargaining piece in their relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">To summarize, we conclude that the state established by clear and convincing evidence that mother and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>father suffer from a number of mental and emotional conditions that make them unable to provide proper care for D. 181 Or App at 477-86. In addition, mother and father have failed, despite extensive efforts of social service agencies, to effect a lasting adjustment to their parenting skills such that it appears they can safely care for D. 181 Or App at 486-91. In addition, the state established by clear and convincing evidence that father has demonstrated a lack of effort to adjust his circumstances and conduct to make a return of D possible. 181 Or App at 486-89. Taken together, 181 Or App at 476, the conduct and conditions proved in this record are seriously detrimental to D such that mother and father are unfit.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The most difficult question presented by this case is whether \u201cintegration of the child into the home of the * * * parents is improbable within a <em>reasonable </em>time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change.\u201d ORS 419B.504 (emphasis added). A \u201creasonable time\u201d is defined as \u201ca period of time that is reasonable given a child\u2019s emotional and developmental needs and ability to form and maintain lasting attachments.\u201d ORS 419A.004(21). Consequently, we must consider all of the circumstances of each individual case, including the mother\u2019s and father\u2019s conditions and conduct, their impact on the child, and the child\u2019s individual needs. As discussed above, mother and father have a number of conditions and have engaged in conduct that shows that they are not presently capable of taking proper care of D. There is also evidence of the extensive services that mother and father have been provided and the minimal, if any, improvement in their parenting skills that has resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The evidence indicates that, at the time of trial, at which time she was three years old, D seemed to be functioning reasonably well. At that time, she had spent well over half of her life in foster care. There was evidence, however, from the expert witnesses, that further instability and delay in establishing a permanent home for D would be damaging to her. Dr. Ewell testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">\u201cWell, you mentioned that there have been several, two or three anyway, different placements for this child already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>in her young life. One placement is considered very disruptive to a child. I don\u2019t believe that anyone in the field of psychology or studying child development sees placement in foster care as a good thing for a child\u2019s development. It is seen as the lesser of evils.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\">\u201cWhen a child has multiple placements in foster care and then is returned home and that fails, the likelihood of the child developing severe forms of pathology in his or herself increases. In the adults that I evaluate where I find high levels of maldisturbance or maladjustment, I often find histories themselves of having been placed in substitute care as a child or having significant changes in care providers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">\u201cSo given that this child has already experienced two or three different placements, I would say it would be very risky for this child to have another move. And that that move, from a psychological perspective, should only take place if it is a virtual certainty or guarantee that she will be moving to a more stabilized, adjusted, healthy environment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Considering all of the circumstances here, we conclude that integration of D into mother and father\u2019s home is improbable within \u201ca reasonable time.\u201d These parents have received extensive social services over an extended time with little, if any, improvement to show for it. Their trial testimony indicates that they continue not to appreciate the effects on D of their self-centered, destructive, and unsafe behavior, nor do they understand the skills needed to safely parent a child of this age. In addition, mother\u2019s and father\u2019s mental and emotional conditions and father\u2019s resistance to intervention are unlikely to change. We conclude that mother and father are unfit under ORS 419B.504.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\"> We turn to the question of whether termination of parental rights is in this child\u2019s best interest. ORS 419B.500. \u201cWhere a parent is unable or unwilling to rehabilitate himself or herself within a reasonable time so as to provide a [wholesome and healthful] environment, the best interests of the child(ren) generally will require termination of that parent\u2019s parental rights.\u201d <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Geist, </em>310 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>176,189, 796 P2d 1193 (1990). In this case, there is substantial and uncontroverted testimony from social service providers and psychologists that indicates that there is nothing that can be done to enable mother and father to become adequate, safe parents within a reasonable time. We accordingly determine that it is in D\u2019s best interest that mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights be terminated and that child be freed for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-15\"> ORS 419B.504 was amended in 2001. Or Laws 2001, ch 686, \u00a7 24. The parties do not argue that this amendment affects this case. All references in this opinion are to the 1999 version of ORS 419B.504.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-5\"> The dissent states that, to avoid termination of parental rights, parenting skills must be only \u201cminimally adequate.\u201d 181 Or App at 505 (Edmonds, J., dissenting). We agree that parents need not establish that they meet some kind of model parenting standard in order to avoid termination. However, the dissent makes two related points that require discussion. First, the dissent states that \u201cminimally adequate\u201d parenting for purposes of this cas\u00e9is equivalent to parenting at the skill level mother and father demonstrated before D was taken into SCF custody. <em>Id. </em>However, we do not necessarily know that their parenting was adequate before SCF took custody of D. There is minimal evidence in the record as to the adequacy of the care that mother and father provided to D before SCF\u2019s intervention. As we will discuss, there is evidence of at least mother\u2019s difficulties with caring for her other children before SCF intervened in this case. There is evidence in the record, as the dissent cites, that might indicate that mother and father engaged in at least some positive interaction with D. <em>Id. </em>at 505-06. That SCF did not intervene earlier cannot, however, in our view, be taken to mean that SCF believed, or that we must accept, that mother and father were functioning at a \u201cminimally adequate\u201d parenting level before child was taken into custody. Unfortunately, it is likely true that there are many parenting situations that would justify termination even before SCF intervenes. In our view, our role on <em>de novo </em>review is simply to evaluate the evidence presented of mother\u2019s and father\u2019s conduct and conditions under the statutory standard and determine their fitness at the time of the termination hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Second, the dissent states that \u201ctransiency, incapacity to parent at an optimal level, poverty, or instability alone are not proper grounds for termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505. To the extent that the dissent means that any conduct or condition must also have a \u201cserious detriment\u201d to a child in order to support termination, we agree. However, we note, as did the Supreme Court in <em>Stillman, </em>that the legislature amended ORS 419B.504 after <em>State v. McMaster, </em>259 Or 291, 486 P2d 567 (1971), to expressly include at least some of those kinds of conduct as grounds for termination \u2014 grounds that require establishment of \u201cserious detriment\u201d as well, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>nonetheless are designated in the statute as grounds for termination. <em>Stillman, </em>333 Or at 151-52.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b534-5\">EDMONDS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Apm\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In this termination of parental rights case, the majority holds, on <em>de novo </em>review, that the State Office for Services to Children and Families (SCF) has presented clear and convincing evidence that father\u2019s and mother\u2019s parental rights should be terminated. The trial court held to the contrary in, as the majority aptly describes it, \u201ca very thoughtful and detailed opinion.\u201d 181 Or App at 480. The trial court had the benefit of viewing the witnesses in court and hearing live testimony. Moreover, my own review of the record does not persuade me that SCF has carried its burden of proof. For those reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The majority and the trial court do not disagree significantly about the facts that led to the juvenile court taking jurisdiction over the child involved in this case. The child, D, was born on September 24,1997, is mother\u2019s third child, and is mother\u2019s first child with father. Mother\u2019s oldest child, A, is in foster care in Washington. Her second child, K, lives with his father, and mother has no contact with him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the first 14 months of her life, D lived with parents. Although Washington State child protective service workers were involved with the family for that period of time, they found no cause to remove D from the home during that time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Reports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>about the family from that time period characterize the home as minimally adequate and D as being well cared for.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">In November 1998, mother and father had a disagreement. Mother left the family home with D, presumably to return some belongings to her brother, who lived in an apartment with his wife and another man, Flannery. While at her brother\u2019s apartment, which mother had planned to take a few hours, she became involved with Flannery, whom she had just met. She called father and told him that she intended to keep D with her and would not be returning home. She then moved in with her brother, his wife, and Flannery. Mother\u2019s brother is a convicted sex offender, and mother knew that fact. Mother and father thereafter engaged in a series of phone calls and contacts over the next two and a half weeks. D was with father part of that time. Mother testified at trial that, during that time, she was very careful about any unmonitored contact between D and her brother. The trial court found that testimony not credible, and I would defer to its finding because of its opportunity to view the witnesses and because of inherent contradictions in mother\u2019s testimony about that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">On November 4, 1998, while parents were separated, father obtained a court order restraining mother from having contact with him and granting him temporary custody of D. After father obtained the restraining order, parents had a conversation in which mother encouraged father to have the order vacated. Father agreed, and the order was vacated by the court. Mother had physical custody of D at that point. However, in an effort to get D back a few days later, father called the police, relying on the provisions of the vacated order. When the officer arrived, mother, with D, met the officer outside of the brother\u2019s apartment. As they conversed, the officer became concerned about D\u2019s condition. Even though it was a cold evening, D was dressed in a thin sleeper. Although the officer asked mother several times to take D inside, mother declined to follow the officer\u2019s suggestion. D also was very dirty and smelly, and it appeared that she had not been bathed in a long time. Her only bottle had mildew in it. Mother explained that she had not taken very many of child\u2019s possessions (among them, only six diapers) when she last left the family home. The officer contacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>SCF, and it directed her to take D into protective custody. Father was then arrested for misusing the restraining order. Thereafter, the juvenile court assumed jurisdiction over D, and parents became involved in a series of programs designed to enable them to regain custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The return of custody to parents never occurred. Although they fully participated in the programs required by SCF and in other forms of therapy on their own initiative, SCF came to believe that parents were unfit and were unable to apply what they had learned from the various programs. It sought termination of their parental rights on April 28, 2000. Trial on the matter began on July 14, 2000,19 months after D was taken into custody. After hearing the evidence, the trial court ruled that SCF had not carried its burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Because the trial court\u2019s reasoning and resulting conclusion is so starkly juxtaposed to that of the majority, I set it out in its entirety. The trial court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">\u201cThere is no question that both Mother and Father have deficiencies as parents. The episodic failings of both parents, as observed by various monitors of their visits with [D], make this clear. The dysfunctional families they came from, the lack of nurture they received as children, the absence of any positive parenting models in their lives and their intellectual and cognitive limitations make this also understandable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">\u201cThis case originated with a single documented incident of neglect of this child, by Mother. This occurred in November of 1998 coincident with the parents briefly separating under conditions showing poor judgment on Mother\u2019s part. The child was very dirty, her bottle was unsanitary and she had a diaper rash. There was <em>no indication of abuse, </em>as distinct from neglect, of the child and there was absolutely no evidence presented of any abuse even occurring. The child has been in foster care for the ensuing 21 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">\u201cThe State has offered <em>no </em>evidence that this single incident of neglectful conduct, by Mother alone, was representative of how these parents had cared for this child during the previous fourteen months. The <em>evidence is in fact persuasively to the contrary.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>\u201cDuring the fourteen months these parents had custody of this child the family had regular contact with Parrot Creek people and child protective workers from Oregon and Washington. The evidence was that the <em>family home was clean </em>and the <em>child was clean </em>and adequately cared for. The parents testified that they took the child to regular pediatrician appointments and <em>everyone agrees the child was healthy and developing </em>appropriately. The State offered no evidence from the child\u2019s pediatrician, nurses, neighbors, or anyone, that these parents were in any way neglectful of the child, or engaged in any conduct or created any condition that was seriously detrimental to the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\">\u201cThe State\u2019s response to the photographs [of child, parents and their home during the first 14 months of child\u2019s life] admitted as Respondents Exhibit 102 is that \u2018they don\u2019t show anything.\u2019 The State\u2019s response to its failure to show any significant deficiency in the parents\u2019 care of this child during these fourteen months is <em>\u2018We don\u2019t know what kind of care was being provided\u2019 </em>and We don\u2019t need to wait for the child to be damaged\u2019 before stepping in. The poignancy of the latter statement cannot make up for the emptiness of the preceding statement given the State\u2019s burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">\u201cThe State\u2019s case for termination seems to be primarily based on the parents\u2019 psychological evaluations and the concerns of visitation monitors about the parents\u2019 ability to parent this child. Further ancillary support for termination is seen by the State in the parents\u2019 unstable living situation and their failure to \u2018adequately benefit\u2019 from the services SCF has provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">\u201cStarting with the implication of the psychological testimony; simply put the <em>evidence does not establish the presence of an \u2018Emotional illness, mental illness or mental deficiency </em>of the parent(s) of such nature and duration as to render the parent(s) incapable of providing proper care for the child for extended periods of time.\u2019 The predictive value of these assessments, in addition to their inherent limitations, is inadequate to support the State\u2019s position. <em>State ex rel Juvenile Department v. Johnson, </em>165 Or App 147, 158-59[, 997 P2d 231] (2000). The prognosis of poor parenting and the State\u2019s argument that \u2018we all know that as children get older they become more challenging\u2019 does not provide the necessary immediacy of the claimed incapacity. <em>State ex rel Juvenile Department v. Wyatt, </em>34 Or App 793, 797 [, 579 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>P2d 889] (1978). The magnitude of this evidence is also significantly tempered by the <em>seemingly adequate parenting performed by these parents for the first fourteen months of their child\u2019s life.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">\u201cThe next broad category of evidence is that related to particular observed parenting deficiencies demonstrated during visits and the failure to sufficiently \u2018learn\u2019 skills through the services provided. Addressing first the issue of whether the parents benefitted from the services provided, the evidence is conflicting. Some witnesses felt there was improvement over time, particularly with Mother, though concerns continued to exist. Others felt there was no \u2018real\u2019 progress made. The parents believe they benefitted from these programs and <em>my review of the evidence convinces me that they made efforts to benefit from the programs they participated in and that they were at least modestly successful.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">\u201cGiven the functional limitations these parents have, perfection in parenting is not attainable, but neither is it required. To be allowed to retain their relationship with their child the parents must only be minimally adequate. All of us would be desirous of a society where every child received parenting and nurture at a level to which every parent should aspire, but the superimposition of such an utopian vision on a populace as diverse as ours would come at a price none of us should be willing to pay. SCF certainly should do all they are able to help parents, and thus help their children, to become the best parents they can be. SCF cannot, however, despite the most laudable motives, impose standards on parents that are not contemplated by constitutional, statutory and public policy considerations, <em>see State v. McMaster, </em>259 Or 291 [, 486 P2d 567] (1971).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">\u201cThe use of service agreements is a helpful means of directing a parent\u2019s effort and gauging their commitment to their child. These agreements should create standards that are reasonably objective so that compliance or noncompliance is reasonably determinable. The service agreements signed by the parents in December of 1998 * * * are generally in that form and similar to the program established in Washington in connection with Mother\u2019s older son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">\u201cDespite the seeming uniformity of expectations of these parents, as early as May of 1999 the Juvenile Court Judge in this County noted that <em>Washington authorities felt the parents were in compliance, but SCF felt they were not. </em>In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>looking at the agreement, the only areas the parents had not previously complied with, is the requirement of stable housing and, arguably, the requirement of a verifiable source of income, although it is clear Father worked at least part time throughout the pendency of this matter. I fear that the conflict in the agencies\u2019 assessments of compliance is a product of SCF\u2019s expectations that these parents would be unable to comply, and not grounded in an objective assessment of the parent\u2019s actual commitment to this child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\">\u201cWith regard to housing stability, the parents did live in a shelter facility in Vancouver, which was set up to accommodate children, for an extended period of time. No efforts were made to place the child with parents there on a trial basis and SCF did not provide any assistance in securing other housing. SCF points out the problem in providing housing assistance services without the parents moving back to Oregon, but oddly there seems to be little recognition of the parents\u2019 dilemma in trying to navigate the demands of two child protective agencies in two different states. One is left to wonder why jurisdiction over this child was not transferred to Washington so that a more unified approach to this family might be undertaken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201cRegardless of how the past compliance is characterized, at present <em>the parents have met all six requirements of the December 1998 service agreements. </em>Admittedly the stability of their current residence and employment is still unsettled, but this is not a situation where the parents have never been able to maintain a stable household. Though their living arrangements have been somewhat chaotic when they have not had custody of this child, when they did have custody of the child they lived in the same adequate residence for more than fourteen months. It is also significant to note that a history of unstable employment and living conditions cannot provide the sole basis for termination, although it may be considered where a child has a special need for stability. <em>State ex rel SCF v. Ettinger, </em>143 Or App 418, 424[, 923 P2d 1290], <em>rev den </em>324 Or 395 (1996) (Here there is no evidence of circumstances creating a special need for stability in this child, beyond our obvious desire that all children have reasonable stability in their lives.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">\u201cIn their subjective measuring of these parents\u2019 compliance with the service plan, <em>SCF seems to give no weight to the parents\u2019 efforts and commitment toward obtaining the return of this child. </em>The parents\u2019 interest in their child is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>very important consideration. <em>State ex rel Juvenile Department v. Harden, </em>51 Or App 681, 687[, 626 P2d 944] (1981). For 20 months despite their recognized intellectual and social skills deficits, <em>these parents participated regularly in programs required by two states </em>and religiously attended two visits a week with this child. They constantly traveled from Washington to Oregon and Oregon to Washington to meet their obligations despite the difficulties this presented for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\">\u201cI have the unsettling impression that the SCF workers never really believed that these parents would be able to mount the sustained, albeit somewhat imperfect, effort they mounted here. It appears to me that by the time of the second service agreement SCF had already committed to termination. The tone of the second service agreement, of autumn 1999, and its subjective focus on outcomes instead of discrete tasks is suggestive of a precursor for termination of parental rights, <em>not an effort toward assisting the parents toward reunification with their child.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">\u201cAt the time of these second service agreements Ms. Nash warned Parents about the seriousness of the situation given the length of time the child had been in foster care. After then being rebuffed by Ms. Nash as to Mother\u2019s view that \u2018they had done everything asked of them\u2019 and so should get their kids back, Mother made the observation \u2018you\u2019re going to take our kids and there is nothing we can do.\u2019 Given the context of this case and the efforts undertaken by Parents herein, this statement was chillingly prescient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\u201cMs. Nash testified that the agency determined to move forward with termination based upon Dr. Ewell\u2019s evaluation. It appears more likely that Dr. Ewell\u2019s evaluation was requested because SCF had determined to proceed with termination proceedings. It is interesting to note that the evaluation was received by the agency less than a month after Mother had signed the service agreement and prior to Father signing. It is also interesting to note from the Introduction to Dr. Ewell\u2019s report that Ms. Nash had already painted a particularly bleak and hopeless picture of the parents for Dr. Ewell before he began any independent evaluation. It also appears that Dr. Ewell\u2019s evaluation fell on a day that the parents also had to be in Court in Vancouver in connection with another child. This may explain (or may not, the evidence is unclear) why Father refused to do the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>lengthy individual evaluation and why Mother rushed through the MMPI without even reading the questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\">\u201cI have above stated my assessment of the legal implications of the psychological evidence presented. As a final observation about the inherent limitations of these evaluations I note that Dr. Ewell found \u2018[mother\u2019s] overall abilities, problem solving skills and capabilities to manage stress are extremely low. There is little evidence of a commitment to following through with personal responsibilities.\u2019 While I am sure that in some contexts that observation may be true, <em>in this case these parents have remained committed to following through with their obligations for twenty months, while juggling the myriad demands of agencies in two states under circumstances of greater stress than most of us ever deal with.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">\u201cGetting back to the specific incidents observed during visits that are proffered as demonstrating the risk these parents represent to this child, I found the evidence <em>decidedly uncompelling. </em>Suffice it to say that the subjective interpretation of a number of witnesses about what clues the child was giving to the parents and the witnesses\u2019 subjective interpretations of the parents\u2019 expectations of the child is not very helpful in this context. Certainly the ability to understand clues from your child as to [the child\u2019s] needs and [the child\u2019s] developmental stages is an important part of parenting, but the <em>deficiencies perceived here are not so severe as to implicate the standards set forth by statute for the termination of parental rights.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201cThe principal criticism of Mother <em>vis a vis </em>her observed visits with the child are that she seemed to \u2018direct the child\u2019s play\u2019 too much, she expected \u2018more of the child developmentally than was appropriate,\u2019 she would \u2018press the child to repeat words or phrases when the child was distracted or interested in something else\u2019 and that she lacked \u2018insight\u2019 as to the importance of the various skills that had been taught to her in parenting programs. Ms. Jenny Keys, the parent mentor, testified that the Mother did \u2018improve over time\u2019 and \u2018seemed to try to emulate\u2019 the witnesses \u2018modeling.\u2019 These observations and the generalized \u2018concerns\u2019 the various witnesses spoke of, are not sufficient to warrant termination of parental rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201cThe criticisms of Father are somewhat more varied. His personal hygiene issues and his sometimes angry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>sometimes disengaged, sometimes defiant attitudes toward SCF have made for less than harmonious relations. Had Father adopted a more congenial approach toward SCF, no doubt his life and that of the SCF workers would have been easier during this past 20 months, but ultimately of course, this is not a personality contest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\">\u201cIn addition to the general concerns about the father\u2019s gruff manner and periodic remoteness from the child during the visits, there seem to be three incidents which the State points to as emblematic of his unfitness. These are the \u2018shit for brains\u2019 comments to the child, the \u2018punching motion\u2019 exchanges with the child and the swinging in the car seat episode.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">\u201cI will start with the least significant, the car seat episode. The description of the incident seems remarkably benign, yet the SCF workers acted as though the child was placed in great peril. There was no indication that the child was frightened, that the child almost fell out, that the seat was being so violently swung or at such height that there was some <em>real </em>potential for injury to the child, or that the Father would not have been able to react to protect the child if something unexpectedly happened. <em>From, the testimony presented it seems that this was simply an incident of this Father playing with his child, making the child laugh, having positive interaction with the child, though not perhaps in a fashion free from all possible risk, and being then told by the SCF workers to knock it off.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">\u201cThis episode tells us more about the relationship between SCF and Father than about Father\u2019s parenting. The real problem the SCF workers had with Father over the car seat swinging was that Father did not do what they told him to do and did not react well to their threats to curtail visits. Father\u2019s small and somewhat childish rebellion resulted, in my view, in an exaggerated perception of the safety implications of this play. The most astonishing dynamic evidenced by this incident, and SCF\u2019s interpretation of it, is the apparent incapacity of the SCF workers to understand that Father might have some modestly legitimate frustration with their agency\u2019s domination of his life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">\u201cFrom Father\u2019s perspective, as he testified, he \u201chas done nothing wrong for this to be happening.\u2019 This observation cannot be dismissed as the product of an unenlightened mind, it is in fact, strictly speaking, true. The child was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>taken by SCF because of a situation created solely by Mother, and one which Father was attempting to remove the child from. <em>There has been no evidence presented by the State, and I assume if SCF had some evidence it would have been presented, that Father was deficient in any way as a parent during the fourteen months before his child was taken away from him. </em>The evidence suggests that instead of being sensitive to this position of Father and attempting to defuse his anger and frustration through empathy, SCF appears to have adopted, and retains, the view that Father\u2019s attitude demonstrates a lack of insight justifying their continued retention of the child and now justifies termination of his parental rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\">\u201cCertainly it was not appropriate for Father to let his anger and frustration at times color his visits with his child. No doubt because of Father\u2019s compromised cognitive, developmental and emotional makeup this created more of a challenge than would be present for others, but the entire context, when considered, significantly mitigates these failings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">\u201cFather acknowledges that he made the \u2018shit for brains\u2019 remarks, saying he was only kidding. This was certainly an ill advised and inappropriate joke, but as appalling as it may be, the fact is that remarks far more wounding are made to children by their parents every day without SCF intervention. That fact does not excuse Father\u2019s remarks, but as an isolated incident this evidence adds little to the State\u2019s claim for termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">\u201cThe pretended punching is ambiguous in its implications. This may have been something that was part of Father\u2019s interactions with the child for the first fourteen months of her life. This behavior may well seem odd or strange to many people, but there is no indication that it was accompanied by any malevolent intentions or feelings. This \u2018pretended punching may or may not have occasionally created confusion for the child. The sad reality is that the entire artificial construct of these brief twice weekly visits, with various monitors observing every move and utterance, creates a climate of awkwardness, anxiousness, defensiveness and potential confusion. This is not to say that these visits do not serve an important, but limited, purpose. It is only to say that it is not particularly helpful to isolate a few parenting blemishes at such visits without keeping in mind the context.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u201cIn sum, SCF has seemingly expected these people to become someone other than whom they are. The Parents have personal limitations that have been discussed at length and which will always exist. The question is whether these limitations and deficiencies preclude these parents from being minimally adequate parents for this child. <em>The State has failed to prove that these parents cannot, and would not, he minimally adequate parents for this child.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">This case is governed by the provisions of ORS 419B.504 (1999). That statute provides, in part, that the rights of a parent may be terminated \u201cif the court finds that the parent or parents are unfit by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child and integration of the child into the home of the parent or parents is improbable within a reasonable time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change.\u201d ORS 419B.504 (1999), as relevant to this case, also provides that, \u201c[i]n determining such conduct and conditions,\u201d the court shall consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">\u201c(1) Emotional illness, mental illness or mental deficiency of the parent of such nature and duration as to render the parent incapable of providing proper care for extended periods of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">\u201c(4) Physical neglect of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">\u201c(5) Lack of effort of the parent to adjust the circumstances of the parent, conduct or conditions to make the return of the child possible or failure of the parent to effect a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social agencies for such extended duration of time that it appears reasonable that no lasting adjustment can be effected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">ORS 419B.504 was interpreted by the Oregon Supreme Court in <em>SOSCF v. Stillman, </em>333 Or 135, 36 P3d 490 (2001). <em>Stillman </em>holds that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">\u201c[flirst, the court must address a parent\u2019s fitness: The court must find that the parent is \u2018unfit by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child.\u2019 That, in turn, requires a two-part inquiry: The court must find that: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>(1) the parent has engaged in some conduct or is characterized by some condition; and (2) the conduct or condition is \u2018seriously detrimental\u2019 to the child. Second \u2014 and only if the parent has met the foregoing criteria \u2014 the court also must find that the \u2018integration of the child into the home of the parent or parents is improbable within a reasonable time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change.\u2019 That second part of the test for termination requires the court to evaluate the relative probability that, given particular parental conduct or conditions, the child will become integrated into the parental home \u2018within a reasonable time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stillman, </em>333 Or at 145-46.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The focus in this case is on the first part of the inquiry defined by <em>Stillman. </em>In order to terminate parents\u2019 parental rights because the parents are \u201cunfit,\u201d the statute requires us to find that they have engaged in some conduct or have some condition that is \u201cseriously detrimental\u201d to D. It is not enough for SCF to demonstrate that the juvenile court properly exercised jurisdiction over D in 1998 or that it should continue to exercise jurisdiction. In <em>State v. McMaster, </em>259 Or 291, 303, 486 P2d 567 (1971), as well as in <em>Stillman, </em>the court emphasized that \u201cwe do not believe the legislature contemplated that parental rights could be terminated because the natural parents are unable to furnish surroundings that would enable the child to grow up as we would desire all children to do.\u201d <em>McMaster, </em>259 Or at 303. In other words, transiency, incapacity to parent at an optimal level, poverty, or instability alone are not proper grounds for termination. Rather, the statute does not authorize termination so long as the parents\u2019 fitness to parent at the time of trial is minimally adequate. In the context of this case, that means that father and mother must be able to parent D at the skill level they demonstrated for the 14-month period before November 9,1998.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Washington state\u2019s child protective services agency-made a conscious decision not to remove D from parents\u2019 home during the first 14 months of her life. A sampling of its family assessment reports of parents during that period includes the following entries. For September 26, 1997, the evaluator wrote, \u201c[Mother] is at the best she has ever been. She appeared bonded with the baby, was breast feeding. She had consistent and early pre-natal care with clean UA\u2019s.\u201d On April 16, 1998, on a scale of \u201cGreat, Good, Mixed, Poor, and Uncertain,\u201d mother received grades of \u201cMixed\u201d for participation and understanding of concepts. For May 8, 1998, the evaluator observed mother giving physical affection to D, setting clear limits (not to go too far away from mother, not to pull hair), talking to D, having eye contact with her \u201cat least every few min[utes],\u201d and putting herself at D\u2019s level. The evaluator concluded, \u201cthere was a lot of positive interaction-hugs, eye contact, etc.\u201d between mother and D. For May 21, the observer noted that mother \u201csmiles at child,\u201d \u201cpraises child,\u201d \u201cresponds promptly to child\u2019s needs,\u201d \u201cfollows through with discipline,\u201d \u201cuses affirmations with child,\u201d \u201cavoids blaming and putdowns,\u201d and utilized \u201cage appropriate methods of behavior management.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The record also contains dozens of pictures of D that were taken by parents in their home before SCF was involved with D. The pictures, while dismissed by SCF as showing nothing meaningful, in fact show that D had age-appropriate toys within reach, that she was developing appropriately, and reaching milestones such as crawling, walking, and drinking from a cup, and that D was clean, adequately fed, and suitably dressed. They also show that the family home was reasonably clean and that the family engaged in activities with D. Taken with Bufford\u2019s assessment that, in her professional opinion, there were insufficient reasons to remove D from the home at that time, it becomes clear from those facts that, if parents are able to continue to parent D in the way they did in her first 14 months of her life, there is not clear and convincing evidence of grounds for termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>To supplement its reliance on the incident on November 9, 1998, SCF essentially relies on four other instances of father\u2019s \u201cconduct\u201d that occurred after D\u2019s removal, to establish conduct or conditions that it claims meet its burden of demonstrating that return of child to the custody of parents will be \u201cseriously detrimental\u201d to D. I agree with the trial court\u2019s assessment of each of the three situations it discussed: (1) father\u2019s conduct of swinging D in a car seat,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) father\u2019s calling D an unpleasant name,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (3) father\u2019s actions in pretending to punch D.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Those incidents standing alone or together do not demonstrate the kind of serious detriment that the legislature had in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The only other conduct on father\u2019s part that could be characterized as \u201cseriously detrimental\u201d conduct is his perceived inability by SCF representatives to interact with D in age-appropriate ways. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The record contains documentation of father \u201czoning out,\u201d leaving the room, dozing off during visits, ignoring or excluding D while providing care for the younger child, J, and having power struggles with mother in front of D that caused her to become a go-between for parents. Dr. James Ewell, a psychologist who performed an observation of mother, father, and D, testified that the most salient feature of the observation was the \u201cemotional distance\u201d he sensed between father and D. He testified that father \u201cappeared to almost frown at his daughter\u201d and he recalled that father clench [ed] his fist and put his fist near her face. Ewell testified, \u201cI didn\u2019t think he was going to hit her. I wasn\u2019t concerned for her welfare. But that seemed to me to be an unusual form of greeting.\u201d Ewell also explained that he found remarkable the \u201cemotional distance and the lack of nurturance and lack of affect from the father to the daughter.\u201d He also testified that father, despite obvious back pain, did get down on the floor and roll a toy back and forth with D.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">In contrast to Ewell\u2019s one-time observations, witness Diane Staehnke, who supervised a number of parents\u2019 visits, perceived that father was \u201cgenerally * * * very happy to see [D]\u201d and that his \u201cHello, shit for brains\u201d comment to daughter was \u201ccontrary to what I thought he felt for her.\u201d She testified that father\u2019s manner of interacting with daughter was to pretend to use his hand as a claw or as a fist and say, \u201cI am going to get you.\u201d She conceded that \u201cthere were always good moments. I am not saying there weren\u2019t any good moments. They played together at the park outside.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It follows that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>evidence about father\u2019s ability to interact with D in age-appropriate ways is subject to conflicting reasonable inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">No evidence was presented at trial of any \u201ccondition\u201d of father, such as drug or alcohol issues, or physical, sexual or other abuse issues, or mental deficiencies, except father\u2019s own admissions of a very challenging childhood. Father was diagnosed by Dr. Dudley, a psychologist. He found that father suffers from avoidant personality features, self-esteem issues, anxiety, and antisocial tendencies. However, Dudley did not testify that father\u2019s psychological condition, in itself, was dangerous or seriously detrimental to D. Instead, he explained that father\u2019s typical behaviors include a tendency to avoid others and to be uncomfortable in many situations. Dudley explained that, had father been in therapy, he would have him work on issues like reducing anxiety, not avoiding difficult or challenging situations, and increasing his self-esteem. Nothing in the record correlates those issues with the statutory requirements of ORS 419B.504. Ewell, who performed the parent/child observation discussed above, did not perform a psychological evaluation of father because father left before the evaluation was to begin. In conclusion, the record as to father is wholly inadequate to support a finding by clear and convincing evidence that either his conduct or his psychological conditions render him unfit to parent under the criteria of the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>SCF\u2019s evidence as to mother\u2019s conduct has more persuasive weight, in light of the statute\u2019s requirements. Although D was cared for adequately during the first 14 months of her life,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the events surrounding November 9, 1998, comment significantly on mother\u2019s fitness to parent on that date. The initial act of taking D to live for three weeks in the home of a convicted sex offender, without adequate diapers, clothing, or supplies, is an example of conduct, in my view, that is \u201cseriously detrimental\u201d to the child. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In addition, mother was apparently oblivious to D\u2019s welfare when the officer contacted her. After SCF took custody of D, there is evidence that mother allowed D to stand on a bookshelf to look into a mirror and that she allowed D to stand in a child\u2019s wagon that could have shifted and caused D to fall, but that conduct is hardly the kind of conduct that justifies the termination of parental rights under the statute. Because SCF did not ever attempt supervised visits in parents\u2019 home, there is no evidence showing that mother would engage again in the kind of conduct that occurred in November 1998. Ultimately, therefore, SCF\u2019s case turns on whether its evidence of mother\u2019s psychological conditions demonstrates that it is highly probable that conduct similar to what occurred in November 1998 will be repeated if custody is returned to mother and father.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">SCF asserts in response to the above issue that \u201cmother and father cannot be minimally adequate parents for their child or for any other child.\u201d It explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\u201cIn spite of least four parenting programs, and many other services, parent trainer Schafte testified that mother and father could not safely care for [D] without 24-hour monitoring. According to Linda Mulherin, even visits must be monitored at all times. The state is not required to provide foster care for the parents to enable them to care for the child. * * * Even if the state were required to provide that level of assistance to these parents, there is no evidence that they would cooperate or that their parenting would be improved by it; they resisted hands-on assistance by Jenny Keys and Linda Mulherin, for example and did not benefit appreciably from this mentoring.\u201d (Citations and transcript references omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">In short, SCF contends that, because of mother\u2019s conditions, \u201cnone of the[ ] services had any appreciable effect on the ability of\u2019 mother to provide adequate care for D.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In support of its assertion, SCF relies, in part, on the psychological evidence testified to by Dudley and Ewell. Before Ewell conducted the observation of mother, father, and D, SCF provided information to him that tended to convey SCF\u2019s perspective of the family. For example, Ewell was told that mother and father have a \u201clong history with the agency,\u201d these parents \u201chave participated in a variety of services,\u201d and that \u201cneither [parent] seemed capable of demonstrating \u2018any skills that they had been taught.\u2019 \u201d He was also told that \u201ctheir behaviors and lack of social conscience\u2019 were of utmost concern\u201d and that \u201cboth parents had experienced terrible childhoods and most likely endured significant damage to their own development.\u201d Ewell diagnosed mother with conditions that include mild mental retardation, post-traumatic stress disorder, adjustment disorder, and a personality disorder. Ewell concluded that, \u201cshe would certainly not be considered amenable to any form of treatment\u201d and \u201cthere is little evidence of a commitment to following through with personal responsibilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Dudley performed evaluations of mother at the request of the State of Washington\u2019s child protective services agency. In his evaluation, Dudley noted that, \u201ccompared to her previous assessment, some improvement in her judgment and overall functioning is suggested and antisocial trends are less evident.\u201d He concluded that she continues to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>have cognitive limitations, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and a personality disorder. Dudley testified that, when a person has the above conditions in combination, the conditions \u201ccould affect any one, any of the number of areas of functioning, not just parenting.\u201d When asked to assume that mother had not benefit-ted from the services offered to her and to give an opinion on her fitness to parent, he opined that her \u201cprognosis is poor.\u201d Unlike Ewell, Dudley opined that \u201c[mother] impressed this examiner as being relatively willing to accept services offered to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Some of the consequences of mother\u2019s conditions, in the view of Dudley and Ewell, are difficulty in managing anger and impulsiveness, a limitation in mother\u2019s ability to feel empathy and to perceive D\u2019s verbal and nonverbal clues as to her needs, and an inability to adapt her own behavior to put the child\u2019s needs first. For example, when asked to give an opinion about what mother\u2019s conditions mean regarding her \u201cability and future ability and prognosis to parent a child,\u201d Ewell answered, in part, that mother\u2019s mild mental retardation \u201cdoes not preclude a person from parenting, but it certainly does suggest that he or she [will have] issues of raising children.\u201d Ewell said he was \u201csurprised at the lack of insight that I saw from a person who had gone through programs of intervention.\u201d Later, he testified that \u201cthere was a sense that the responses that she gave \u2014 sounded like response that might come out of a parenting class. * * * I didn\u2019t have a sense of application.\u201d Ewell, when asked about a written summary that he had provided to a caseworker, said that he did not consider mother \u201cto be a viable placement resource for her children\u201d and that her prognosis was \u201cpoor.\u201d He explained that his opinion was based on his assessment that she lacked insight, that she was \u201cquite angry,\u201d and that she had limited cognitive ability. Ewell concluded from his evaluation that mother did not have the ability to provide a stable, predictable, loving and nurturing environment for D and \u201cthat there would be a strong risk of some emotional traumatization to the child because of [mother\u2019s] conditions [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In predicting a poor prognosis for change, Ewell and Dudley relied on the assertion by SCF that mother had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>improved her abilities or functioning despite extensive parenting training and services; thus, the validity of their prognoses necessarily depends on whether the picture of mother portrayed to them was accurate. Moreover, to the extent that Ewell did not rely on SCF\u2019s written background information, his and Dudley\u2019s prognoses in the abstract should be tested against the evidence of whether mother had, in fact, improved her parenting skills and abilities after November 1998. Ewell evaluated mother once. In contrast, Dudley recognized some improvement in his second evaluation after evaluating mother over a period of time. Because the expert testimony is subject to conflicting inferences about whether mother is capable of parenting and of improving her parenting skills, <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Pennington, </em>104 Or App 194, 799 P2d 694 (1990), <em>rev den </em>311 Or 166 (1991), I turn to the evidence of mother\u2019s state of functioning and her responsiveness, or lack thereof, to the training and services she has received.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">In its brief, SCF relies primarily on the testimony of Donna Schafte, Linda Mulherin, and Jenny Keys. At the time of trial, Schafte worked for Clark College in Vancouver, Washington, as a parent educator in a program for parents referred to it by the Washington State Department of Services and Human Resources. Her role was to meet with parents to talk about child guidance and anger and stress management and to promote understanding of how children develop. Schafte met with father and mother for ten weeks, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>beginning in January 2000, for a weekly two-hour class. She was asked by SCF\u2019s attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">\u201c[Q] Were the [mother and father] able to benefit in any significant way from your program?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201c[A] Absolutely, we saw a real turnaround, change of attitude, maybe the fourth week of class. The first few weeks were really tough. We were bucking along with resistance. We saw a turnaround. They continued to come very faithfully. They received certificates. So their attendance was very good.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Later, Schafte stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">\u201cBut the part that I saw in the parenting sessions with the parents was that cooperation, communicating with other parents, talking about the material and information that was covered, that kind of thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">When asked about parents\u2019 \u201cability to be parents at * * * [t]he point they left [her] program,\u201d Schafte responded, \u2018Well, again because I didn\u2019t see them interacting with the children very much at all, that\u2019s a little more difficult for me to evaluate.\u201d When asked if either parent improved his or her ability to understand child development, Schafte said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">\u201c[Mother], all long, you know, was able to share and talk. I think she\u2019s had a lot of background before this. The impression I got, really knew a lot of the terms and seemed to have some knowledge already of the parent education. [Father] was very quiet in most of the parenting classes, but he became more cooperative as time went on, at least in my portion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Counsel for SCF appears to have realized at that point that the witness\u2019 testimony was not favorable to his client. He reminded the witness of a phone interview that she had with an investigator for SCF. He asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-11\">\u201cDo you remember telling him[, the investigator,] that, \u2018[mother and father were] one of the most difficult couples [you have] had the misfortune to teach,\u2019 in your 28 years of teaching?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">Schafte answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-13\">\u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018misfortune,\u2019 but I did say that \u2014 in fact, that\u2019s when we had the talk with them because I wasn\u2019t willing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>continue with that resistance. It was just taking too much energy from the other couples in the class. They were very difficult to deal with. And we told them that as well. But I did not use the word \u2018misfortune.\u2019 We were really happy to see the change in attitude.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Again, counsel reminded the witness of her conversation with the investigator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">\u201c[Q] Did you remember him asking you if you thought that [mother and father] would make good parents * * * ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">* # \u2021 j}c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">\u201c[A] If they would make good parents? Yes, I guess so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">He probably did phrase that. I don\u2019t remember the term exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">\u201c[Q] Do you remember what you said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">\u201c[A] From my conversations with the other instructors, we felt they needed a lot more support, and we would not recommend that at this point without a lot of support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">\u201c [Q] Do you remember saying\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-12\">\u201c[A] We would worry about the children\u2019s safety. Pardon me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-13\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-14\">\u201c[Q] Did you also indicate that the parents are too into themselves to be parents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-15\">\u201c[A] Oh, I don\u2019t know, again, if that\u2019s the term that I used, but yes, I believe that they both need an intense amount of therapy and help to work through their own issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-16\">On cross-examination, Schafte testified that \u201c[parents\u2019] attendance was excellent. They really put forth great effort. They were there on time, stayed through the whole class.\u201d When asked about the ability of mother and father to understand the information being given to them, Schafte volunteered that, as to mother, \u201cit seemed like she had a really good handle on what we were talking about. [Father] was more quiet, more withdrawn during that time.\u201d Schafte said generally that mother and father \u201chad made some progress and had benefitted some from the program.\u201d Counsel then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>\u201cAnd you indicated that if they were going to be parenting in the home, that they would need some support. What type of support would you \u2014 do you feel that they would need?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Schafte answered, \u201cDid I say that?\u201d Counsel responded, \u2018You tell me.\u201d Schafte answered, \u201cTremendous amount of support. I would almost say a live-in, someone there consistently to begin.\u201d Counsel inquired, \u201cSomeone to check up on them on a regular basis?\u201d Schafte replied, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">On redirect examination, counsel for SCF asked:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">\u201cDid you also indicate that you were afraid that they would bomb your house because of the anger and rage they possessed?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Schafte answered, \u201cI said that flippantly. And I am sorry that that came through. I said that to [the investigator] just in a flippant manner because of the anger problems that I saw.\u201d On re-cross, Schafte conceded that mother and father had never made any threats to her and that any conflict that she observed occurred between them and was not directed toward D. In light of Schafte\u2019s inconsistent testimony, there is little weight to be accorded her opinions about mother\u2019s future fitness as a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">At the time of trial, Linda Mulherin was a home support specialist for the State of Washington. She was assigned to assist mother and father in their parenting skills with D during their visits with her beginning in January 2000 until the time of trial. The visits occurred twice a week, and each visit was one and one-half hour in length. Then about a month before trial, SCF reduced the parents\u2019 visits with D to once a week. Based on her supervision of those visits, Mulherin testified that she had concerns about father\u2019s and mother\u2019s parenting abilities. She explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">\u201cWell, I think that in [mother\u2019s efforts to show that she has learned certain parenting skills in classes and things, she discusses them. She\u2019ll say, \u2018I have learned this or I\u2019ve learned that\u2019 and then she\u2019ll \u2014 in trying to sort of follow through or demonstrate that, she\u2019ll be real rigid, for example \u2014 rigid but inconsistent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Mulherin gave an example to illustrate her concern.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\u201cWhen [mother] would want [D] to do a certain thing and it might be to say the ABC\u2019s or count * * * and [D] wanted to do something else, and [mother] was, like * * * kind of force her to kind of go through \u2014 -just go through certain routines instead of having it to be fun and kind of a natural learning experience. It\u2019s more of a demanding thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Mulherin also testified that, \u201c[a]t certain moments, [mother] \u2014 and I am not going to say she didn\u2019t generally\u2014 she didn\u2019t ever notice what [D] wanted. There were lots of times when she did.\u201d When asked about mother\u2019s use of discipline during the visits, Mulherin replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">\u201cThere were times when [mother] did good redirection as far as if [D] was trying to get something of [J]\u2019s, for example, and she didn\u2019t want (tape inaudible), she would find something else. * * * I would like to see a little more active diversion kind of thing where you get up and go to the child and you say, \u2018Did you see this,\u2019 or whatever. And that\u2019s the kind of thing I would model * * * the preferred method really, would be * * * providing an alternative for it[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">When asked by SCF\u2019s counsel whether mother would \u201cyell\u201d at the children, Mulherin responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t see her as a \u2014 yell, not at the children. I saw her get angry [with father] a couple of times.\u201d When asked whether the lessons being learned in the parent training were actually being applied, Mulherin said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">\u201cI didn\u2019t really notice that the kind of techniques that I teach when I am teaching the parenting class or doing the actual parent training, I didn\u2019t notice them using those techniques and skills.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Mulherin continued, explaining that when mother asked her to tell her if she was doing something wrong, and Mulherin did, \u201con a couple of occasions * * * she would get pretty angry * * * and say, \u2018that\u2019s not what they told me in the other class.\u2019 \u201d Mulherin described disagreements with mother over D not wearing earrings because mother was concerned that her pierced ears would close up. Mulherin said, \u201cafter a few weeks of this, [Mother] did finally, \u2014 I guess I could say, dropped the subject.\u201d Counsel asked if there was anything else that the witness wished to describe concerning mother\u2019s \u201cunderstanding of the needs of the child [.]\u201d Mulherin described how mother would sit and rock J and wanted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>rock D on a couple of occasions, even though D didn\u2019t want to be rocked. She concluded, \u201cThat\u2019s what I mean by activities were geared more to meet the needs of the parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">On cross-examination, Mulherin testified that she had not seen any progress over the last six months and that the parents\u2019 visits with D were still supervised. She said that D was \u201ceager\u201d to see her parents during visits, and she was unaware of the reason why the visits with D had been reduced. She commented on mother\u2019s parenting skills,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">\u201c[a]nd as far as the skills, I am not saying that [Mother] doesn\u2019t have parenting skills. She knows them. She can tell me all the right things. It\u2019s simply a matter of applying them. So, I am not saying that she doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Mulherin concluded that mother was a \u201cstrong, loving\u201d parent, but \u201cI don\u2019t know about [father].\u201d She conceded that she had never seen mother at home with D because the visits always occurred in a state office or facility. SCF did not conduct a redirect examination of Mulherin.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The third witness on whose testimony SCF relies to demonstrate that mother and father cannot be minimally adequate parents for D or any other child is Jenny Keys. At the time of trial, Keys was a parent mentor employed by Parrot Creek Child and Family Services. She worked with father, mother, and D from March 1999 until December 1999. She was with parents while they had two visits per week with D at an SCF facility during that period of time. On direct examination, Keys testified that, when she first started working with the parents, \u201c[mother] was pretty resistant. She seemed pretty angry and threaten [ed]. She wasn\u2019t very receptive or open to information or just my presence [.]\u201d Keys said that mother\u2019s responsiveness improved over time. However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">\u201c[i]t seemed hard for [mother] to stay focused, particularly after [J] was bom. They really struggled to divide their attention, and it seemed really hard for her to read [D]\u2019s cues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Keys perceived mother as giving inconsistent directions to D and attempting to control D\u2019s play during visitations. Mother</p>\n<p id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>and Keys disagreed about whether D was developmentally ready for certain activities. Keys said that, toward the end of her experience with father and mother, \u201cthere was a lot of positive stuff\u2019 because mother would try to emulate Keys\u2019s behavior. SCF\u2019s counsel asked, \u201cWas there a concern about her ability to continue that after you stopped working with her?\u201d Keys answered, \u201cYeah, I mean, it was short term, and I would have a concern that she wouldn\u2019t be able to identify those things on her own.\u201d Counsel asked, \u201c[I]n your estimation, are either of these parents able to successfully take care of [D]?\u201d Keys did not directly answer that question, responding instead about her concerns regarding father\u2019s safety choices.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Keys stated that she saw little improvement in mother\u2019s ability \u201cto meet the child\u2019s needs on her own,\u201d although she conceded that she \u201coccasionally\u201d saw an ability on mother\u2019s part to carry over the things she learned from one session to the next. Keys concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">\u201cPositively, one of the last visits that I had with her, she became visibly upset with [D] told her no or \u2014 no, refused to follow directions, which \u2014 it was very difficult behavior for her age. [Mother] was able to hold it together and actually asked, after the visit was over, how she could handle it different.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">On cross-examination, counsel pointed out that Keys had written in a March report that \u201c[b]oth [parents were] receptive\u201d to the information and suggestions that Keys had given them.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">As stated above, the weight to be accorded to Dudley\u2019s and Ewell\u2019s prognoses for change, and to SCF\u2019s projections that mother\u2019s psychological conditions will continue to render her unfit to parent, depends in large part on whether mother\u2019s behavior and performance have in fact improved in response to the parenting training and services she has received. Certainly, SCF can point to the events surrounding November 1998 to show poor judgment on mother\u2019s part. However, the failure to remove D from the family home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>before November 1998 and the other evidence in the record belies SCF\u2019s assertion that mother was unable to provide minimally adequate care before that time.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The trial court found that mother \u201cmade efforts to benefit from the programs [she] participated in\u201d and that she was \u201cat least modestly successful.\u201d Besides the testimony in the record to which I have already referred, there is additional testimony that supports the inference that regarding her parenting skills, mother is capable of change.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Kathleen Bufford, a marriage and parental therapist, worked with the family during the first 14 months of D\u2019s life, while D still lived with parents. Mother had come voluntarily to the program for which Bufford worked. Bufford testified that, during the 14 months that father and mother had custody of D, they had regular contact with representatives of the states of Oregon and Washington, the family home was clean and D was generally clean and adequately cared for. Bufford\u2019s closing summary indicates that mother had successfully completed the parenting program and that, in regard to understanding a child\u2019s development, she had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">\u201c[achieved a number of goals related to understanding child development, behavior, emotional management, and improved her bonding skills by practicing eye contact, positive verbal communication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">As to mother\u2019s progress after taking Bufford\u2019s program, Bufford testified, \u201cAnd it seemed to me that [mother] was, first of all, for a mom to learn that she needed to make eye contact. And in that respect I felt that [mother] had made progress.\u201d She was asked, \u201cYou noticed progress in her ability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>to make eye contact,\u201d and she answered, \u201cYes.\u201d She explained her concern:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\">\u201cI felt that in the lab situation [mother] displayed minimally adequate parenting. But I had grave concerns about what would happen within the next year as the child learned the word \u2018no\u2019 and as she learned to pull away from Mom rather than receive hugs from Mom, holding from Mom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">On cross-examination, Bufford was asked, \u201cYou felt that [mother] was, in fact, demonstrating, at least minimally adequate parenting skills?\u201d and Bufford answered, \u201cShe was learning minimally adequate parenting skills. And by the end, in lab <em>she was demonstrating those skills.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Bufford concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">\u201cWhat I found encouraging was her ability to relate well to me. And I felt that <em>she had made progress in terms of her ability to relate well to other adults, such as the other </em>parent educator, and in her desire to do what she needed to do, her desire to parent well and her confidence [.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Melissa Brown, a mental health therapist, worked with mother for 13 weeks in anger management therapy. She testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">\u201cI think initially, when she came for the initial sessions of therapy, she seemed to have difficulties with her anger. When I saw her the subsequent sessions, several months later, <em>she seemed to have made quite a bit of progress in handling anger. </em>* * * She seemed more able to utilize techniques that we talked about for managing anger such as time-outs and conflict resolution.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Brown said that \u201cit\u2019s hard to make many changes in a short period of time.\u201d Although she acknowledged that she had concerns about mother\u2019s ability based on her \u201climited cognitive ability which make[s] it more difficult for change to be sustained long-term\u201d without additional counseling, Brown explained that mother had expressed an interest in continuing the services after the 13-week session ended but was unable to do so financially.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">In essence, SCF\u2019s entire case against mother focuses on its continuing concerns about mother\u2019s ability to apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>what she has learned. Mother has met all of the requirements of her service agreements, she has made <em>bona fide </em>efforts to benefit from the programs she participated in and, as the trial court found, she and father were at least modestly successful in those endeavors. It is noteworthy that almost all of the care providers who had repeated interactions with mother, especially Bufford and Brown, said consistently that mother made observable improvements over the duration of their services, that she was incorporating their suggestions in. her care of the child, and that she was amenable to more parent education. The evidence of mother\u2019s inability to change, therefore, is subject, at least, to conflicting reasonable inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">In my view, those conflicting inferences prevent SCF from carrying its burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence. When the evidence of parents\u2019 efforts and moderate successes after November 1998 is combined with the evidence of their minimally adequate care for D before she was taken into custody by SCF, it is impossible to conclude that SCF has proved by highly probable evidence that father\u2019s and mother\u2019s parental rights should be terminated. On this record, the trial court wisely ordered that SCF immediately begin good faith efforts to reunite D with father and mother at the earliest appropriate time with appropriate safeguards for D\u2019s welfare. It may be that father and mother will be unable to adequately parent D in the future, but until they are given more of an opportunity than was afforded them by SCF since November 1998 to demonstrate that they can apply what they have learned, no one will know if that is the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">For those reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b562-6\">Landau and Armstrong, JJ., join in this dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\"> Mother\u2019s fourth child, J, is also a child of father in this case. He was born during the pendency of this proceeding. He is not part of this termination proceeding. Father has an older child from a different relationship who is also not part of this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-9\"> Washington State child protective services workers were involved with the family during that time in an effort to determine if mother\u2019s oldest child, A, could be placed in the home. He had been sexually assaulted by his biological father and presented too many difficult behaviors to make placement possible with these parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b545-5\"> The majority declines to draw the inference that, because the State of Washington did not intervene during this time period, mother and father must have been parenting adequately. It reasons that, \u201cunfortunately, it is likely true that there are many parenting situations that would justify termination even before SCF intervenes.\u201d 181 Or App at 476-77 n 2. However, the record shows that the agency\u2019s nonintervention was deliberate. A therapist, Bufford, who worked with parents consistently during this time period said, \u201cDuring that time, I felt that there was not sufficient indication to remove the child from the home.\u201d Additionally, as discussed below, the progress reports from mother\u2019s classes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>pictures of the family home and D during this time show that parents\u2019 ability to parent was at least minimally adequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b547-4\"> The \u201cconduct\u201d in question is that, during visits, father would occasionally \u201cswing\u201d D in a car seat without restraining her. As the trial court found, there was no evidence of actual danger involved in the activity, and again, in the words of an eyewitness to the event, \u201che was \u2014 she was laughing, of course, because it was fun for her.\u201d When father asked, \u201cGo again!?],\u201d she repeated, \u201cGo again, go again.\u201d Like the trial court, I agree that father\u2019s choice of that entertaining activity was not \u201cfree from all possible risk,\u201d but it did not scare D or impair her relationship with father, and it was certainly not grounds for termination of parental rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b547-6\"> Father greeted D with, and then repeated, the comment, \u201cHello, shit for brains.\u201d When questioned by counsel about that event, father testified that it had been intended as a joke, and that he realized afterward that D would probably not understand it to be a joke. Counsel then asked father, \u201cHow did you think that your daughter would feel about that? Did you think about that?\u201d Father responded, \u201cAfterwards, yeah, I did.\u201d He answered that he later thought, \u201cIt\u2019s my daughter. It was her looking at me and [asking], \u201cDad, why would you say that to me?\u2019 \u201d The court asked,</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\u201c[w]hy didn\u2019t you say that when [counsel] was asking you about it. When [counsel] was asking you about it, you were kind of acting like it was just a joke and nobody should think anything about it. If you felt like you kind of screwed up there and shouldn\u2019t have probably said it and one of those things you wished you hadn\u2019t said, why didn\u2019t you tell us that when [counsel] was asking you those questions?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Father replied, \u201cI really didn\u2019t understand why he was asking it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Other exhibits show that father exhibited pride in D\u2019s accomplishments. In my understanding of father\u2019s testimony as a whole, father had a difficult time getting past his resentment of SCF in order to acknowledge his shortcomings. However, upon the further questioning of the trial court, he was able to demonstrate that he now recognizes the wrongfulness of his words to D and, in any case, isolated comments such as he made, while ill advised and inappropriate, are not grounds for termination without a showing that they were seriously detrimental to D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b547-10\"> The record contains several references to instances of father pretending to punch D. In context, the record shows that father\u2019s typical conduct was a general roughness or abruptness in his interactions with D, and that he would typically do things like suddenly jarring D\u2019s chair to startle her, or growl at her. However, those who observed such conduct stated, \u201c[D] would end up laughing. It did turn into a game.\u201d Father himself acknowledged that \u201cMy growl is not a growl. I play with my daughter in a very strange way. It\u2019s just like my sense of humor is very strange.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5V8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The trial court found that this \u201cconduct\u201d was not seriously detrimental to D; instead, the trial court characterized it as a somewhat unnatural reaction to highly supervised, highly unnatural circumstances of interaction in a small, enclosed space. I agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\"> There was testimony about father\u2019s angry and hostile conduct toward social workers, including the fact that, when he heard child call her foster mother \u201cmommy,\u201d he threatened to \u201cbeat the crap out of\u2019 a social worker. While such evidence is probative of father\u2019s tendencies in dealing with anger, it was not correlated in any way in this record to any effect on D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b548-10\"> Much of SCF\u2019s evidence focuses on father\u2019s hostility toward its representatives, which, as the trial court recognized, may have made for an unpleasant time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>for father and the workers involved, but is evidence that is not sufficient to meet the requirements of ORS 419B.504.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\"> The majority views the import of the testimony about father\u2019s psychological conditions differently. <em>See </em>181 Or App at 485. Apparently, the majority relies on the assessments of Deborah Baker, a marriage and family therapist, which occurred in December 1998, and on the assessment of Sharon Brewer, a counselor, who tested mother and father in April 1999. However, both witnesses made clear that father was \u201cresistant to doing the assessment,\u201d or that he \"deferred to [mother]\u201d throughout the sessions. Baker acknowledged that she was not able to make diagnoses because she is not a psychologist, but she testified that \u201cthe mental health conditions [she] saw * * * are things that could be overcome with some counseling.\u201d Brewer reached her conclusion that father could not be a parenting resource for D based in part on \u201cthe difficulty in having him respond, first of all, to the assessments.\u201d With respect to the majority, there is no demonstrated nexus between father\u2019s difficulty or unwillingness to complete a psychological assessment and his ability to be a minimally fit parent. Also, those \u201cassessments,\u201d to the extent that they were actually based on information provided by father at all, conflict with Dudley\u2019s evaluation done in July and August 1998. He found that father\u2019s conditions would not necessarily affect his ability to be a parent. Conflicting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>psychological evaluations about fitness for parenting will rarely give rise to clear and convincing evidence, absent a clear reason to completely disregard one side of the conflicting evidence. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Pennington, </em>104 Or App 194, 799 P2d 694 (1990), <em>rev den </em>311 Or 166 (1991). Here, the majority offers no reason to disregard Dudleys opinion in favor of the other assessments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\"> There is conflicting evidence to the effect that child may have been left in a high chair or on the floor for an undue period of time, with a TV remote to play with, while mother played Nintendo for long periods of time. That conduct allegedly occurred during the time child lived with parents and, as discussed above, child\u2019s overall condition was not sufficient to trigger intervention by the State of Washington.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\">I agree with the trial court that such an incident, standing alone, would be insufficient grounds for termination. However, mother\u2019s failure to recognize or appreciate the danger that her conduct created, both at that time and at trial, makes the conduct more troubling. Mother persisted in her belief, even at trial in this case, that her brother had been wrongly convicted. Father, on the other hand, acknowledged that, although the convicted sex offender was D\u2019s uncle, he could pose a threat to D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b553-5\"> The majority says that \u201c[mother] is incapable of appreciating risks to D\u2019s safety and places in unsafe situations; she has subjected D to chaotic and dangerous living conditions, and she neither understands nor pays sufficient attention to D\u2019s physical and emotional needs.\u201d 181 Or App at 485. The majority implies that the \u201cplacing [of D] in dangerous conditions,\u201d the \u201csubjecting [her] to chaos and danger\u201d and mother\u2019s \u201cinattentiveness\u201d is ongoing. However, the evidence does not support the majority\u2019s assertions. The evidence can be divided into two time periods: the first 13 months of D\u2019s life and the time period when D was in foster care and mother had no opportunity to take care of D. As discussed more fully below, the evidence is in conflict regarding mother\u2019s fitness to parent during those time periods. During the first period, the State of Washington made the calculated assessment that it was not necessary for D\u2019s protection to remove her from the family home. It was a single event that prompted D\u2019s removal from the family home. During the second period, the most serious evidence that can be mustered against mother about her care for D is that she allowed D to stand on a raised object to look into a mirror and that she allowed her to stand in a wagon that could have rolled and injured her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\"> Keys answered that her concerns were \u201cchoices, safety choices that they have made.\u201d She then referred to the choice of father to swing D in the car seat, discussed above. <em>See </em>181 Or App at 507 n 4 (Edmonds, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b560-8\"> It appears that SCF is relying, as the trial court suggested, on its trial counsel\u2019s assertions that \u201cthe first 14 months of the child\u2019s life are not particularly [informative as to how the parents are going to be able to handle that child once the child starts to develop more challenging behaviors,\u201d and \u201cwe know by simple\u2014 by common knowledge [t]hat babies don\u2019t move around as much. They don\u2019t get into things. They don\u2019t \u2014 they\u2019re not as difficult to handle. It\u2019s once they start maturing a bit. And that is when \u2014 that is more challenging.\u201d That reasoning is not very persuasive, first because the parenting of an infant can be a difficult endeavor, and second, because SCF\u2019s own witnesses and exhibits show that mother had learned to some degree how to adjust her behavior and expectations to the child\u2019s developmental level.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
