The state acknowledges that the courts have held on numerous occasions that waiver of counsel requires that the difficulties of self-representation and the benefits of being represented by an attorney be made known to a defendant before a waiver will be considered knowing and voluntary. <em>See, e.g., State v. Meyrick, </em>313 Or 125, 831 P2d 666 (1992). The state further concedes that the record in this case does not reveal that defendant was advised about the dangers of self-representation. We find the state\u2019s concession to be well founded and therefore accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Reversed and remanded for new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-6\"> ORS 133.075 has since been repealed and renumbered as ORS 133.076. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1999, ch 1051, \u00a7 63.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
