Nelson </em>obtained from the honourable <em>John B. Clopton </em>an injunction to two judgments recovered by <em>James Cocke, </em>administrator of <em>Isaac Cocke </em>deceased, against said <em>Nelson, </em>in the Circuit Court of <em>King William, </em>In his bill he charged, that in the year 1834, <em>William B. Armstrong </em>had won from him at cards the sum of 267 dollars; that soon afterwards <em>Armstrong </em>had drawn two drafts upon him in favour of <em>Isaac Cocke, </em>on account of the money thus won from him, one for the sum of 134 dollars, payable on the first of October 1835, and the other for 133 dollars, payable the first of October 1836. That at the time these drafts were drawn and accepted, <em>Isaac Cocke </em>well knew they were for money won at cards, and promised complainant that he should pay them at his own convenience. That complainant afterwards became satisfied that he had been cheated by <em>Armstrong, </em>and had so informed <em>Cocke, </em>and gave him notice that he did not think he should pay the drafts; and that <em>Isaac Cocke </em>did not, during his lifetime, take any steps to enforce the payment of them. That <em>Isaac Cocke </em>had since died, and his administrator <em>James Cocke, </em>had recovered judgments against the complainant on the drafts, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>was proceeding to coerce payment thereof by execu- . . . tion. The complainant made <em>James Cocke, </em>as admimstrator of <em>Isaac Cocke, </em>deceased, and <em>William B. Armstrong, </em>defendants, and called upon them to answer the bill; and the prayer was for an injunction, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-12\"><em>James Cocke, </em>administrator of <em>Isaac Cocke, </em>answered the bill, and denied all knowledge of the gambling between the complainant and <em>Armstrong, </em>and of the consideration on which the acceptance of the drafts was founded. He says he never heard of or saw the drafts, until he found them among his intestate\u2019s papers, after his death; and he filed with his answer a letter he had received from the complainant, on which he relied to shew that complainant had accepted the drafts, upon a promise of indulgence, which had been given him; and that, therefore, if any equity ever existed in favour of the complainant, he bad waived it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-13\">The letter was dated October 4th, 1835. In it <em>Nelson </em>stated that he had some time during the previous winter accepted two orders given by <em>William B. Armstrong </em>in favour of <em>Isaac Cocke, </em>one of which was due the first of the month. That he had intended to pay it out of his wheat crop, but that had failed almost entirely, and he must therefore ask for longer indulgence. And he concluded by saying: \u201cYour brother always told me that he would grant me indulgence, provided I would accept the orders, as he thought the getting the money out of <em>Armstrong </em>very doubtful.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-15\">The plaintiff filed in the cause a record of a suit then pending in the Circuit Court of <em>King William, </em>in which <em>William B. Armstrong </em>was plaintiff, and <em>James Cocke </em>as administrator of <em>Isaac Cocke </em>was defendant, the object of which was to recover the amount of aa account which <em>Armstrong </em>claimed to be due to him, amounting to 1121 dollars 75 cents; one item of which was, \u201camount of two orders on <em>Wilson C. Nelson </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>269 dollars, under date of January 8th, 1834.\u201d He also filed- two depositions, one, that of <em>John P. Boughton, </em>who stated that <em>Armstrong </em>owed him 150 dollars, for the payment of which he applied to him about the last of November 1834; when <em>Armstrong </em>told him he would pay it if he would take an order on <em>Wilson C. Nelson, </em>for the amount; and at the same time stated he had won 400 dollars of <em>Nelson </em>at cards; which order witness refused to take.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-5\">The other witness stated, that in January or February 1835, he had seen both <em>Cocke </em>and <em>Armstrong </em>holding private conversations with <em>Nelson </em>at <em>Mechanics' ville, </em>which <em>Armstrong </em>told the witness related to money that <em>Armstrong </em>had won of <em>Nelson. </em>That <em>Armstrong, Cocke </em>and witness left the place together ; and the two first commenced talking about orders that <em>Armstrong </em>was to draw on <em>Nelson </em>in favour of <em>Cocke. Cocke </em>was to advance money for the orders, to discharge various debts which were mentioned at the time, which <em>Armstrong </em>owed. When they were about to part, <em>Cocke </em>observed to <em>Armstrong, </em>that if <em>Cocke </em>should arrange this business for <em>Armstrong, </em>he should expect to be well paid; and <em>Armstrong </em>replied, that he was willing to pay him well for his trouble.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-6\">Whilst the cause was pending in the Court below, <em>Nelson </em>died, and the cause was revived in the name of his administrator, <em>George R. Trant; </em>and coming on to be heard, the Court dissolved the injunction and dismissed the bill. From this decree the plaintiff applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-7\"><em>Morson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-8\"><em>Daniel, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b374-9\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ak8M\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">The Court is of opinion, that the Circuit Court erred in dissolving the appellant\u2019s injunction and dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>his bill, instead of directing issues to be tried by a jury for the purpose of ascertaining : 1. What was the consideration of the debt from <em>Wilson C. Nelson </em>to <em>William B. </em>Armstrong, for which the orders in the proceedings mentioned were drawn by the said <em>Armstrong </em>upon said <em>Nelson, </em>in favour of <em>Isaac Cocke. 2. </em>If the consideration of the said debt was money won by the said <em>Armstrong </em>from the said <em>Nelson </em>at unlawful gaming, did the said <em>Cocke </em>take the said <em>Nelson\u2019s </em>acceptances of said orders, under the belief, induced by the concealment or misrepresentation of the latter, that the consideration of said debt was good and lawful. It is therefore adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the decree of the Circuit Court be reversed and annulled, with costs to appellant. And the cause is remanded to the Circuit Court, with instructions to reinstate said injunction, and proceed as above indicated, to a final decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
