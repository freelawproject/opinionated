The indictment contained seven counts, some of which charged that the slaves were the property of <em>Esther Lewis. </em>On the trial, the Commonwealth offered evidence to prove that the prisoner advised certain slaves of the estate of <em>Lorenzo Lewis </em>to abscond, to which evidence the prisoner objected, on the ground that there was no count in the indictment, charging the offence against any property of the estate, or in the pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>session of <em>Esther Lewis, </em>executrix of said estate; but the Court overruled the objection, and admitted the evidence ; and the prisoner excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AkS\">The Commonwealth further offered evidence to prove that the prisoner advised a negro girl, the slave of <em>Sidney Allen, </em>to abscond from her master, to which evidence the prisoner objected, but the Court overruled the objection and admitted the evidence ; and he again excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b715-5\">The jury found the prisoner guilty, and fixed the term of his imprisonment in the penitentiary at* two years, and there was a judgment accordingly. And thereupon the prisoner applied to this Court for a writ of error, which was awarded.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b715-6\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A7Du\">The Court is of opinion that the judgment of the Circuit Court is erroneous in permitting the evidence mentioned in the second bill of exceptions to go to the jury; and for that cause only, the judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, the verdict set aside, and the cause remanded to the said Circuit Court, for a new trial to be had therein; and on such trial the evidence set forth in the said second bill of exceptions, is not to be admitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
