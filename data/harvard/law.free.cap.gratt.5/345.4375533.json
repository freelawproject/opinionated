That the clause in reference to the mode of her direction to her trustee to convey, though it may enlarge her power, so as to enable her, by her sole act, to dispose of portions of the property embraced in the deed, which otherwise she could not have aliened by deed without her husband\u2019s joining with her, does not operate to restrain or limit the general power of disposition which she retains over her personal estate by the terms of the deed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b364-5\">2. A married woman having given a mortgage on her separate estate, to secure a debt which she had contracted, afterwards obtains a further loan from the mortgagee.

Pence </em>and <em>Sarah B. Lyle </em>being about to marry, they executed a deed, which, after setting out the property of <em>Mrs. Lyle, </em>recites that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>it hath been agreed that the said <em>Sarah B. Lyle, </em>after the intended marriage shall have been had, shall receive and enjoy during the life of the said <em>John H. Pence, </em>and after his death, the full rents, issues, hires and profits of the property, real and personal, aforesaid, and of all other property, real and personal, to which the said <em>Sarah B. Lyle </em>hath now right or title, or to which she may hereafter have right or title in any way whatever; and that the said property, with the interest, hires, rents and profits thereof, before and after the said marriage shall have taken place, and during the life and after the death of the said <em>John H. Pence, </em>shall be at the sole and only disposal of the said <em>Sarah B. Lyle, </em>notwithstanding her coverture, and in the same manner to all. intents and purposes, as if she were a <em>feme sole. </em>The deed then conveys the property to <em>John Napier, </em>in trust, \u201c that the said <em>John Napier, </em>his heirs and assigns, shall do and permit the said <em>Sarah B., </em>during the life and after the death of the said <em>John H. Pence, </em>to have, receive, take, use and enjoy all the interests, hires, rents and profits of said property, to and for her own sole use and benefit; and upon trust that the said <em>John Napier, </em>his heirs and assigns, shall and do convey, assign, transfer and deliver over all the said property, or any part thereof, unto such person or persons, and in such proportions and parts, and at such time or times, and in such manner and form as the said <em>Sarah B. </em>shall from time to time, notwithstanding her coverture, by any writing or writings under her hand and seal, attested by three or more credible witnesses, or by her last will and testament, executed in writing in like manner, before the like number of witnesses, direct, limit and appoint; to the intent that the said property, with the profits thereof, may not be at the disposal, or subject to the control, debts, forfeitures or engagements of the said <em>John H. Pence, </em>her intended <em>husband; </em>and in default of such direction, limitation or appointment by the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>Sarah B. </em>in her lifetime, then to such person or persons as would inherit from the said <em>Sarah B. </em>under the laws of distribution in <em>Virginia, </em>as if she were to die a 7 . 7 7 . . <em>feme sole, </em>unmarried and intestate.\u201d This deed was executed by all the parties, and was admitted to record in the clerk\u2019s office of the County Court of <em>Fluvanna, </em>on the acknowledgment of <em>Pence </em>and <em>Napier.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-10\">In October 1839, <em>Mrs. Pence </em>executed a writing, under seal, attested by three witnesses, by which, after reciting that she was indebted to <em>Benjamin M. Perkins </em>in the sum of <em>757 </em>dollars 77 cents, due the 1st of October 1839, she authorized and requested her trustee <em>Napier </em>to convey and deliver to <em>Perkins </em>five slaves by name, to him and his heirs forever; but upon condition that <em>Perkins </em>should reconvey said slaves to <em>Napier </em>for her benefit, if she paid to <em>Perkins </em>the said sum of <em>757 </em>dollars 77 cents, with the interest, on or before the 1st of October 1840: but if she failed to pay the money and interest aforesaid by the time specified, then the slaves were to belong to <em>Perkins </em>in fee simple. In pursuance of this authority <em>Napier </em>conveyed the slaves to <em>Perkins, </em>upon the conditions stated in the paper executed by <em>Mrs. Pence.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-11\">In December 1840, <em>Napier, </em>as the trustee of <em>Mrs. Pence, </em>obtained from a Judge of the General Court an injunction to restrain <em>Benjamin M. Perkins </em>from taking possession of, selling or removing the slaves mentioned in the conveyance to him from said <em>Napier, </em>till the further order of the Court. In his bill, after referring to the deed of marriage settlement, and the other papers mentioned above, which he insisted was a mortgage, he charged that the same was procured from <em>Mrs. Pence </em>through fraud and undue influence; and that <em>Mrs. Pence </em>did not owe <em>Perkins </em>as much as he had induced her to believe she did. That <em>Perkins </em>was endeavouring by violent means to get possession of the said slaves <em>; </em>and had threatened to run them off. He therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>prayed for an injunction, and that <em>Perkins' </em>account \u00b0 might be correctly settled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AW2V\"><em>Perkins </em>answered the bill, denying the fraud, and insisting that his account with <em>Mrs. Pence </em>had been correctly settled; he insisted that the conveyance to him was not a mortgage but a sale, and alleged that upon the execution of the paper the slaves had been put into his possession ; though he had always intended that if he sold them for more than he had given, or if he kept them and considered them worth more, that he would return to her the excess. That he so informed <em>Mrs.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-7\"><em>Pence </em>some time after the execution of the bill of sale to him, when he advanced to her the sum of 300 dollars, upon the understanding that if he could get for the slaves that much more than he had given her for them, he would not call on her for it; but if not, he should.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-8\">When the cause came on to be heard, the Court below held that the conveyance to <em>Perkins </em>was a mortgage, and should be held as a security for any debt which <em>Mrs. Pence </em>owed to <em>Perkins </em>at the date thereof, or which had become due since: and it was referred to a commissioner to settle the account. The commissioner made two statements: the first, founded on the different evidences of debt held by <em>Perkins, </em>with interest thereon up to the time of taking the account: the second, taking the amount admitted to be due by the paper executed by <em>Mrs. Pence </em>in October 1839, with interest thereon from that time, and adding the sum of 300 dollars, which it was proved <em>Perkins </em>had advanced to her after that time, by paying an order drawn by her upon him in favour of <em>Schlater. </em>The only difference between the two statements was, that the interest due in October 1839 bore interest from that time in the second, and did not bear interest in the first. The plaintiff excepted to the first statement, because of some alleged errors and double charges in the accounts on which it was based; and to the second statement, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the same reasons, and also because interest was compounded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQy\">Whilst the cause was pending in the Circuit Court, the plaintiff <em>Napier </em>died; and <em>Samuel T. Woodson </em>having been appointed trustee in the deed of marriage settlement, the suit was revived in his name as plaintiff, and came on to be heard in April 1842, when the Court overruled the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report; and adopting the second statement, decreed that the plaintiff should pay to the defendant <em>Perkins </em>the sum of 1215 dollars 18 cents, with interest on 1057 dollars 77 cents, a part thereof, from the 1st of April 1842, until paid. And unless the plaintiff or some one for him, should, upon being served with a copy of the decree, forthwith enter into bond with good security in double the sum of 1215 dollars 18 cents, payable to the defendant Perkins, with condition to have the slaves included in the mortgage and the future increase of the females forthcoming at the expiration of six months from the date of the decree, to satisfy the same, that the sheriff should take the same into his possession forthwith, and after advertising the same for six weeks, should sell them, or as many of them as might be necessary, at public auction for cash; and out of the proceeds of sale should pay to Perkins, the said sum of 1215 dollars 18 cents, with interest as aforesaid. But if the plaintiff, or some one for him, gave the bond, then unless he paid the said sum of 1215 dollars 18 cents, with interest as aforesaid, to the defendant within the six months, the sheriff of the county should proceed to take the said slaves into possession and advertise and sell as before directed; and out of the proceeds pay to <em>Perkins </em>his debt, and pay over any surplus of sales to the trustee of <em>Mrs. Pence. </em>And each party was directed to pay his own costs. From this decree, <em>Wood-son </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number><em>Patton, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ALc\"><em>Cooke, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AtU\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ACH\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac8t\">The Court is of opinion, that, by the terms of the deed of settlement in the bill and proceedings mentioned, the said <em>Sarah B. Lyle </em>was invested with the full power of disposing of or charging her personal estate to all intents and purposes, as if she were a <em>feme sole; </em>that she retained said property, with all its privileges and incidents, one of which was the right of disposing of it. That the subsequent clause empowering the trustee to convey the property secured by said deed in such manner as she should from time to time, notwithstanding her coverture, by writing under her hand and seal, attested by three or more credible witnesses, or by her last will and testament direct, though it may have enlarged her power, so as to enable her by her sole act to dispose of portions of the property embraced in the deed, which otherwise she could not have aliened by deed without her husband\u2019s joining with her, did not operate to restrain or limit the general power of disposition which she retained over her personal estate by the terms of the deed in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The Court is further of opinion, that, without reference to any supposed liability of the separate estate of a married woman to discharge her general engagements, as a necessary incident to such separate estate, arising from the capacity of contracting which the possession of a separate estate confers, the previous dealings of the parties and the circumstances of the case clearly shew, that the order drawn by the said <em>Sarah B. Pence, </em>on the appellee in favour of <em>John Schlater, </em>for 300 dollars, dated the 18th October 1839, was drawn with the intention of affecting the separate estate, was paid by the appellee upon the credit thereof; and such separate estate would be specifically liable for payment thereof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>upon the ground of such intention and the credit so given as aforesaid, independent of any liability of the separate estate for the general engagements of the married woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">The Court is further of opinion, that as between the original parties, and where, the interest of no third person was affected, it was proper in a bill filed to redeem the personal property mortgaged, to require the payment of the 300 dollars, as well as the debt secured by the mortgage. The rule that the heir shall not redeem without paying the bond debt of the ancestor, although the bond could not be tacked to the mortgage as against the mortgagor, has been adopted to prevent circuity of action <em>; </em>and because thp mortgaged premises descended would be assets in the' hands of the heir, for the value of which he would be responsible to the creditor by obligation binding the heir. The reason of the rule applies with equal force to the separate estate of a wife. The wife cannot bind her person; but in equity, and equity only, her separate estate can be made liable for debts expressly, or by implication, made chargeable thereon; and it would be subjecting the parties to unnecessary costs and delay, to permit the party to redeem the separate estate covered by the mortgage, by the payment of the mortgage debt, and turn the creditor round to another suit in chancery to charge the same subject with another debt which was contracted upon the faith of, and intended to be paid out of, the separate estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">The Court is further of opinion, that as the decree appealed from was interlocutory, and not final, upon such appeals the principles of the decree, and not mere informalities in the form thereof, are the proper subjects of consideration. That as there was no ground for a personal decree against the trustee, it would have been competent for the Court at any time before final decree, so to have modified said interlocutory decree as to have relieved the trustee from any supposed personal liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>growing out of the general terms of the interlocutory order. And as no execution could issue on said interlocutory decree without the leave of the Court, ample opportunity would have been afforded to the trustee to protect himself from injury by correcting the interlocutory decree in this respect. And such opportunity may still be afforded, notwithstanding an affirmance of the decree, without prejudice to the rights of the trustee to move for and obtain such a modification of the interlocutory order as may relieve him from personal liability for any residue of the debt which may remain unsatisfied after the sale and application of the mortgaged property.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The Court is further of opinion, that as the bill was filed by the trustee asserting the rights of his <em>cestui que </em>trust, by impeaching the mortgage, claiming the right to redeem, and praying for a settlement of the accounts between the <em>cestui que trust </em>and the appellee; and it further appearing that such settlement has been made, and full opportunity afforded to the <em>cestui que trust </em>to controvert the pretensions of the appellee, and a full defence has been made, there was no necessity, in a suit so prosecuted by her trustee, to assert and defend her rights, to make her a formal party; and that the circumstances materially distinguish this case from those in which it has been held, that in bills filed to charge the trust estate, the <em>cestui que trust </em>is a necessary party.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The Court is further of opinion, that the exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report were properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Decree affirmed, so far as it affects the principles determined by it, with costs, but without prejudice to the right of the trustee, or the power of the Court, so to modify the form of the decree as to relieve the trustee from personal liability for the debt decreed to be paid.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
