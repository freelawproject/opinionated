Withers </em>and <em>Robert W. Withers, </em>which abated as to <em>A. B. Withers </em>by the return of the sheriff, that he was no inhabitant of the county. The action is founded on the following covenant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>We oblige ourselves to deliver to <em>Chiswell Dabney </em>an assignment of eighty dollars, on a bond given by <em>Harrison </em>and others to <em>John Ward, sr. </em>for 400 dollars; which assignment shall be for the benefit of <em>John Hes-tend </em>of <em>Albem,arle. </em>The bond is dated ill April 1821, bearing interest from the date, and is to be delivered to <em>G. Dabney </em>on the 4th of next month. Witness our hands and seals this 30th October 1822.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-4\"><em>Alexander' S.

Withers, </em>\u00a7 Seal.*</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">To this action the defendant pleaded covenants performed <em>; </em>and upon the trial the plaintiff demurred to the defendant\u2019s evidence. The jury rendered a verdict for 190 dollars, with interest on 80 dollars, from the 19th of September 1839, subject to the opinion of the Court on the demurrer to evidence; and in April 1841, the Court sustained the demurrer, and gave the plaintiff a judgment on the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-7\">The material facts proved are as follows: The bond referred to in the covenant, was executed by <em>Richard Harrison, Nancy Shields, Nicholas Harrison </em>and <em>Richard H. Buries </em>to <em>John Ward, sr., </em>who, by his endorsement thereon, dated the 24th of July 1822, assigned it without naming the assignee. On the 3d of October following, <em>M. C. Moorman, by </em>a like endorsement, assigned 322 dollars of the bond to <em>William Robinson; </em>and on the 25th of the same month, he assigned 80 dollars thereof to <em>Alexander S. Withers.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-8\">On the 1st of November 1822, <em>Alexander S. Withers </em>delivered the bond with the assignments thereon, to <em>Chiswell Dabney, </em>in execution of the covenant; and <em>Dabney </em>brought suit upon the bond against the obligors, in the name of <em>Ward, </em>for the benefit of <em>Robinson </em>as to 322 dollars, for the use of <em>Hestend </em>as to 80 dollars, and for the use of <em>Moorman </em>as to the residue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>This suit abated as to <em>N. Harrison </em>and <em>Burks. </em>A judgment was obtained against <em>R. Harrison </em>and <em>Nancy Shields, </em>and the sum of 240 dollars 85 cents was made , upon an execution which issued on the judgment, and was pa\u00a1\u00bf| over t0 <em>William Robinson </em>in part satisfaction of his claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-8\">The defendant applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment, which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-9\"><em>Grattan, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-10\"><em>Cooke, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b476-11\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AviT\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">The covenant of <em>Alexander S. Withers, </em>and <em>Robert W. Withers </em>the plaintiff in error, upon which this action is founded, was not a covenant to make an assignment of 80 dollars of the bond therein mentioned, but a covenant to deliver an assignment of so much of the bond, which assignment had been already made.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">The bond was executed by <em>Richard Harrison </em>and others to <em>John Ward, </em>who, by his endorsement thereon, dated the 24th of July 1822, made an assignment thereof, which omitted the name of the assignee. But <em>M. C. Moorman, </em>who, it seems, was the intended assignee, by his endorsement on the bond, dated 3d of October 1822, assigned 322 dollars thereof to <em>William Robinson, </em>and by another endorsement thereon, dated the 25th of October 1822, assigned 80 dollars thereof to <em>Alexander S. Withers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">The object of the covenant, which bears date the 30th of October 1822, appears to have been to give to <em>Hestend, </em>the defendant in error, the benefit of the assignment made to <em>Alexandm' S. Withers, </em>and that the bond should be delivered to <em>Mr. Dabney, </em>an attorney at law, on or before the 4th of November then next ensuing, in order that suit might be brought thereon, for the use of the persons respectively entitled to the benefit thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The bond was accordingly delivered on the 1st of November 1822, by <em>Alexander S, Withers </em>to ilir. <em>Dab-</em>net/, who brought suit thereupon in the name of <em>Ward, </em>^ \u201e <em>c </em>for the use of <em>Robinson, </em>as to 322 dollars, for the use of <em>Hestend </em>as to 80 dollars, and for the use of <em>Moorman </em>as to the residue; which suit was prosecuted to a judgment as to some of the obligors, and part of the money made by execution and paid over to <em>Robinson </em>towards the satisfaction of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The covenant was therefore fully performed by the delivery of the bond, with the assignment to <em>Alexander </em>$. <em>Withers </em>thereupon endorsed. That was the assignment contemplated by the covenant; and <em>Hestend </em>had the complete use of it in the action upon the bond. No other assignment was required by the terms or the true intent and meaning of the covenant, and none from the covenantors, or either of them, could have availed him any thing, inasmuch as he would not have been thereby enabled to maintain an action for the recovery of the 80 dollars in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">If <em>Hestend </em>by the transfer to him, for a valuable consideration of <em>Alexander S. </em>Withers\u2019 interest in the bond, and the prosecution of the action thereupon with due diligence, without being able to obtain satisfaction from the obligors, acquired a right to redress against the covenantors or either of them, his proper remedy was an action of <em>assumpsit </em>founded upon those circumstances, and not an action founded upon the covenant of which there has been no breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">It therefore seems to the Court that the Circuit Court erred in sustaining, instead of overruling, the defendant in error\u2019s demurrer to the evidence : And it is considered by the Court that the judgment of the Circuit Court be reversed with costs. And this Court proceeding to render such judgment as the Circuit Court ought to have rendered, it is further considered that the demurrer to evidence be overruled, and that there be a judgment for the plaintiff in error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
