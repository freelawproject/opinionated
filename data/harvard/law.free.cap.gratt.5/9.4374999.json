B. Selby, </em>obtained a judgment against him for a tract of land in the county of <em>Jefferson, </em>which was occupied by <em>Kretzer </em>as the tenant of <em>Selby. </em>On this judgment a writ of <em>habere facias possessionem </em>was sued out, and the sheriff went upon the land with <em>Wysong, </em>rode over it, and broke a twig from a tree and gave it to <em>Wysong </em>as and for a delivery of possession. At this time <em>Kretzer </em>was a tenant on the land, but was not present; though he was afterwards informed by the sheriff of what had been done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-7\">After this delivery of possession, <em>Wysong </em>requested <em>Kretzer </em>to deliver to his agent the share of the crop which he was to give for the rent of the land, which <em>Kretzer </em>promised to do; but <em>Selby </em>having obtained a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment in the case of unlawful detainer, <em>Kretzer </em>delivered the landlord\u2019s share of the crop to him. Since the execution of the writ of possession, the land had been farmed by the tenant of <em>Wysong.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-8\">The Court gave a judgment on the demurrer for the plaintiff; and <em>Kretzer applied </em>to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-9\"><em>Cooke, </em>for the appellant, and <em>Berry, </em>for the appellee, submitted the case.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b28-10\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"An\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">This action of trespass <em>quare clausum fregit </em>cannot be maintained by <em>Wysong </em>the plaintiff therein, without a previous recovery in ejectment, or proof of his actual possession at the time of the alleged trespass. There was no such recovery, and such actual possession has not been proved as against the defendant <em>Kretzer. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>execution by the sheriff of the writ of <em>habere facias possessionem, </em>sued out by <em>Wysong </em>upon his judgment in his writ of unlawful detainer against <em>Selby, </em>the landlord of <em>Kretzer, </em>gave him no possession against <em>Krelzer, </em>and the evidence does not prove an ouster of <em>Kretzer </em>by <em>Wysong: </em>on the contrary, the evidence serves to shew that <em>Kretzer </em>continued in possession of the land notwithstanding the execution of the writ of <em>habere facias possessionem, </em>gathered the crop raised by him thereupon, and delivered to <em>Selby </em>the landlord\u2019s share of the same; and the non-performance by <em>Kretzer </em>of his promise to deliver the landlord\u2019s share of the crop to <em>Wysotig\u2019s </em>agent was no trespass, and if <em>Wysong </em>had any remedy therefor, it was in a different form of action. If the evidence of possession of the land by a tenant of <em>Wysong, </em>after the execution of the writ of <em>habere facias possessionem, </em>could be regarded as incompatible Avith the continued possession of <em>Kretzer, </em>and as proving that he had been ousted or had surrendered the possession to that tenant prior to the alleged trespass, then the right of action for the trespass Avould enure not to <em>Wysong, </em>but to his tenant. It seems, therefore, to the Court, that the Circuit Court erred in rendering judgment upon the demurrer to evidence for the plaintiff, instead of the defendant in the action : And it is considered that the said judgment be reversed and annulled, Avith costs to the plaintiff in error. And this Court proceeding to render, &amp;c. Judgment for the defendant in the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
