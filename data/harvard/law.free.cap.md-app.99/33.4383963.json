He was survived by Shannon Barr (appellant) and others. Appellant was partly dependent upon Marvin and began receiving partial dependent survivor benefits through Marvin\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer. The trial court held that the statute, Md.Code (1991 Repl.Vol.),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 9-682 of the Labor and Employment Article required that appellant\u2019s partial dependent survivor benefits be capped at $17,500. This appeal followed. The primary focus of our opinion involves the recodification of the pertinent statutory provisions. Former Article 101 section 36 provided in subsection (8)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">(a) ... If there are wholly dependent persons ... the compensation shall be an amount ... not to exceed $45,-000.00____ If a surviving ... child continues to be totally dependent after the total amount of $45,000.00 has been paid, further payments ... shall be paid at the same weekly rate during ... her total dependency....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">(b) If there are no wholly dependent persons ... but there are partly dependent persons, those partly dependent shall receive compensation as follows: ... and payments to continue during the partial dependency but not to exceed $17,500.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">Then in subsection (d) the former statute provided, as to both wholly and partly dependent persons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-11\">Payment ... shall continue ... until the child ... reaches the age of eighteen years provided, ... if each child ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>[is] wholly dependent ... and incapable of self-support by reason of mental, or physical disability ... or the child ... [is] still partly dependent ... payments ... shall continue as under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) herein....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASp\">Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) herein referred to the cap language in section 36. That language in old section 36(8) that referred to wholly dependent persons has been recodified as section 9-681(c) and (g). Section 9-681(g) expressly provides for the continuation of payments past $45,000 if the person remains wholly dependent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">If a ... child continues to be wholly dependent after the total amount of $45,000.00 has been paid, the employer ... shall continue to make payments ... during the total dependency of the surviving child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">During the recodification, the language of old section 36(8) as to <em>partly </em>dependent persons, which had been intertwined with the language relating to wholly dependent persons by being placed in the same former subsection was recast as section 9-682, where, outwardly unfettered by its association with the language relating to the extension of the cap as to wholly dependent persons, it now states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">(c) <em>Duration of payment\u2014In </em>general.\u2014Except as otherwise provided in this section, the employer or its insurer shall pay the weekly death benefit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">(1) for the period of partial dependency; <em>or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">(2) until $17,500 has been paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">(e) <em>Same\u2014Child who becomes </em>18.\u2014(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, the employer ... shall continue to make payments to, or for the benefit of, a surviving child until the child reaches 18 years of age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Paragraphs (2) and (3) refer to provisions for payments past the age of eighteen under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">The parties agreed below that construction of the new statute was the only issue and that a summary judgment proceeding was the appropriate method for the trial court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>address the issue. After discussing the statute\u2019s provision for payments in respect to wholly dependent survivors, the court discussed the differences between the provisions for wholly dependent and partly dependent survivors. It found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">Section [ (c) ](2) clearly states that the $17,500 is an absolute cap. Unlike the case of the wholly dependent spouse, even if the partial dependency continues, no more payments may be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">It further opined that \u201cthe Legislature clearly intended to treat wholly and partially dependent individuals differently____\u201d The trial court subsequently discussed the basis for its interpretations\u2014that the legislature had a \u201clogical policy basis\u201d for making a distinction\u2014saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">A wholly dependent child ... is one who depended on the deceased worker for all of their needs and had no other source of maintenance and, but for the death of the worker, could reasonably have assumed that the deceased parent\u2019s support would continue until they reached the age of majority or they become self supporting. On the other hand, a partially dependent child by definition has alternative sources of support to which they can look for the necessities of life and may or may not have had a reason to expect that the deceased worker would be solely responsible for providing them with the necessities of life. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Appellant presents but one question, which we rephrase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">Whether a partially dependent minor should continue to receive partial benefits until age eighteen even if benefits totalling $17,500 are received prior to the attainment of age 18?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">We shall construe the statute to hold that the minor should not and will affirm. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">The Law</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 387-89, 614 A.2d 590 (1992), recently opined, in reference to construing an alimony statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>While the language of the statute is the primary source for determining legislative intention, the plain meaning rule of construction is not absolute; rather, the statute must be construed reasonably with reference to the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body.

As we do so, we note that the arguments of both appellant and appellee are, at least facially, plausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Prior to 1973, the predecessor statute to Labor &amp; Employment Article section 9-682\u2014Md.Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol., 1972 Cum.Supp.), Art. 101 \u00a7 36\u2014contained no language providing for continuation of payments to partial dependents beyond the weeks and amounts stated as m\u00e1ximums. The prior statute as relevant to the case <em>sub judice </em>provided benefits for partial dependents,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">in the amount not exceeding sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the average weekly wages or forty-eight dollars per week ... for ... 416 weeks ... not to amount to more than a maximum of five thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Md.Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol.), Art. 101 \u00a7 36(8)(b). The prior statute made no further provisions (relevant to the case at bar) for partial dependents. Language similar to that contained in the current statute first found its way into the law in 1973 Md.Laws Chapter 671. Among other things, Chapter 671 made major modifications in respect to the benefit statute not only as to partly dependent persons but also as to wholly dependent persons. In addition, Chapter 671 created the $45,000 maximum benefit applicable for wholly dependent persons and, in Article 36(8)(a), provided new language for persons wholly dependent, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">if a surviving wife ... or child continues to be totally dependent <em>after the total amount of $.45,000.00 has been paid, </em>further payments ... shall be paid at the same weekly rate.... It is the intention herein that a surviving wife or husband ... shall receive at least ... $45,000.00.... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>After discussing the amount of payments for partial dependents and the maximum limits, 416 weeks with a maximum sum of $9,000.00, the act created a separate subsection (d) that apparently applied to both partial and total dependents in that it made no partiaVwhole distinction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-4\">(D) Payment to ... a surviving child ... shall continue ... until the child ... reaches the age of eighteen years....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The subsection continues, creating a special provision for wholly dependent children extending their payments past the age of eighteen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">[H]owever, if each child or children though 18 years of age or over are wholly dependent ... and incapable of self-support by reason of mental or physical disability [the payments would continue]....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The subsection, after creating a special class of mentally and physically incapacitated children that is applicable only to \u201cwholly\u201d dependent children, reverts back to language making the remainder applicable to partial dependents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aao\"><em>or </em>the ... children though eighteen ... or over are still partly dependent ... payments ... <em>shall </em>continue as under paragraphs (A), (B) and (C)____ [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">At this point, the prior statute provided that payments would continue to be paid to dependents until they were eighteen or until a cap was reached. In respect to wholly dependent persons, the payments would continue even \u201cafter the total amount of $45,000.00\u201d had been paid. No similar language as to the cap was contained in the statute as to partial dependents (other non-relevant expanding language was included as to the possibilities of payments extending past the age of eighteen under certain circumstances). That language did not permit the extension of payments that exceeded the $17,500 cap for partial dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">The codifiers, through the 1964 Replacement Volume, included the provisions aforesaid in subsection 8(d) of section 36. Except for changing the section number to (7)(d), that status remained intact until 1991. By 1991 Md.Laws Chapter 8, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Workers\u2019 Compensation Article was recast as Title 9 of the Labor and Employment Article. The provisions above, which previously had been in one subsection and were clear and unambiguous when considered in one subsection, were reenacted into two different sections\u2014Section 9-681 \u201cWholly dependent individuals\u201d and Section 9-682 \u201cPartly dependent individuals.\u201d Putting the two provisions into two distinct subsections separated the provision that wholly dependent persons could exceed the $45,000 cap under certain circumstances from the provision discussing payment to partial dependents. When they were in the same subsection, the wholly dependent cap exception was viewed in contrast with the partial dependent provisions. The absence of similar cap provisions for partial dependents in the same subsection had interpretive importance in construing the intentions of the Legislature, <em>i.e., </em>the absence of the cap exception as to partial dependents in the same subsection where it was extant as to the wholly dependent persons was significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">We next note that Chapter 8 of the Laws of 1991, was passed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">[T]o revise, restate and recodify the laws ... relating ... to: ... workers\u2019 compensation....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac\">... By repealing Article 101, Workmen\u2019s Compensation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkV\">... [Section] 36 ... 8(a) through (h) and (j) ... and the subtitle \u201cClaims and Compensation; Benefits.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Thereafter, Chapter 8 enacts the new Workers\u2019 Compensation Law as Title 9. As relevant to Section 9-682, the Revisor\u2019s Note stated: \u201cThis section is new language derived without substantive change from former Art. 101, \u00a7 36(b), [and] (d)....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Some conflicts were apparent to the revisors during the recodification process. Subsection 9(D) of Chapter 8 pertaining to surviving spouses states that \u201cif a surviving spouse ... remarries ... the employer ... shall make payments ... for 2 years after the ... remarriage.\u201d The revisors noted that the relationship between the $17,500 cap contained in subsection (C) and the provisions in section (D) relating to the two-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>year continuation for remarrying surviving spouses was unclear. They stated that it could be argued that the payments could \u201ccontinue for 2 years even if $17,500 is paid.\u201d The revisors failed to see a similar issue, namely, the one arising here, might be generated by separating the two provisions as to wholly and partly dependent persons into separate subsections. Thus, a similar argument is made by appellant as to the provisions of section (e) relating to continuation of partly dependent children\u2019s payments until age eighteen under the statute. Subsection (e) provides that \u201c[T]he employer ... shall continue to make payments ... until the child reaches 18____ If a child who is 18 ... or older remains partly dependent ... the employer ... shall continue to make payments ____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">It is this interplay between the pertinent provisions of subsection (c) and (e) that gives rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Appellee argues that Labor &amp; Employment Article subsection 9\u2014681(g), when it refers to a continuation of payment to a wholly dependent child, adds the clause\u2014\u201cafter the total amount of $45,000 has been paid.\u201d Appellee argues that because the language \u201cafter a total amount of ... [$17,500] has been paid\u201d is <em>not </em>contained in section 9-682(e), that subsection should not be construed as authorizing a continuation of payments to partly dependent surviving children who have received the maximum limit. Appellee further argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR\">Thus, the most sensible reading of the statute provides three potential termination points for partly dependent surviving children: (1) when the period of partial dependency ends; (2) when the child reaches age 18, unless one of the two exceptions to the 18-year-old limitation applies; or (8) when the payments total $17,500. The payments must end at the earliest of these termination points.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Appellant argues that section 9-682(e) should be construed separately without reference to section 9-681(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">We initially note that the Revisor\u2019s Notes contained in section 9-681 and section 9-682 both state that the language of the respective section was derived \u201cwithout substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>change\u201d from that language of the prior section 36. As we have indicated, the provisions now found separately in sections 9-681 and 9-682 were, prior to the revision, contained in the same section. That one section, however, treated them differently. Paragraph (7)(a) (prior to 1987 it was paragraph (8)(a)) of the old section 36 set out the percentages of weekly payments for \u201cwholly\u201d dependent children as 100% and noted that the payments were \u201cto continue to be paid during total dependency but not to exceed $45,000.00, except as otherwise provided in this section.... \u201d Then it expressly provided that benefits in the weekly amount could continue to be paid \u201cafter the total amount of $45,000.00 has been paid.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Paragraph (7)(b) related only to partly dependent persons and was conspicuously silent as to any express statement that after the maximum of $17,500 had been received, a partly dependent person could continue to receive weekly benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">As we interpret the language of paragraph (7)(d), it provided for continuing payments under certain circumstances consistent with the respective caps on benefits contained in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). Under those circumstances, (a) essentially provided for no maximum for wholly dependent persons and (b) provided for a cap maximum payment of $17,500 for partly dependent persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">As we perceive it, the reenactment and recodification of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act has, to some extent, lessened the previous confusion in interpreting section 36. That confusion resulted from the differing limits of benefits for both whole and partial dependents being contained in one section. This was done by placing them, \u201cwithout substantive change,\u201d in separate sections. Thus, when the new section states that a partly dependent person\u2019s benefits are to continue in accordance with subsection 9-682(c), that section is properly construed to read that a partly dependent person, whose benefits have not reached $17,500 and whose partial dependency continues, shall continue to receive benefits during the dependency until the sum of $17,500 is reached. Our review of the legislative history of these provisions, including the separation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>of the wholly and partly dependent provisions into separate sections with no substantive change, inevitably results in the conclusion we have reached. We note in concluding that the problem presented here was apparently overlooked or unforeseen by the revisors. In <em>Department of Gen. Servs. v. Harmans Associates Ltd. Partnership, </em>98 Md.App. 535, 545-46, 633 A.2d 939, 944 (1993), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">As a general rule, statutes enacted as mere code revision are presumed not to contain substantive changes unless the intent to make such changes is clear....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">Here, in particular, there is absolutely no evidence that, in a pure Code Revision bill, the Legislature intended to abrogate the right of appeal to this Court. Indeed, there is \u201cpersuasive evidence\u201d that such was not the case.... The Revisor\u2019s Note to SFP, \u00a7 15-223, which was part of the bill, states that \u201c[t]his section is new language derived <em>without substantive change </em>from former SF \u00a7\u00a7 ll-137(e) and 11-139.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We would regard an abrogation of the right of appeal from the decision of the circuit court to be a substantive change in the law, and thus presume from the Revisor\u2019s Note that the Legislature did not intend such a result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">We \u201cwould regard an abrogation\u201d of the $17,500 cap for partial dependents under the age of 18 \u201cto be a substantive change in the law and thus presume from the Revisor\u2019s note that the Legislature did not intend such a result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Judge Carr was correct. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b60-12\">. At the time of Marvin\u2019s death, October 28, 1988, Md.Code (1957, 1985 Repl.VoL, 1988 Cum.Supp.), Art. 101 \u00a7 36 was the applicable statute. It was recodified without relevant substantive change as Labor and Employment Code Annotated section 9-682.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
