For purposes of sentencing, the trial court merged the possession with intent charge into the distribution charge, sentenced appellant to sixty days in jail, and imposed a $750 fine. The court. suspended the jail term and placed appellant on eighteen months of unsupervised probation. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Appellant raises three issues, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">I. Whether appellant was entitled to introduce, for the purpose of demonstrating contemporary community standards, videotapes of a similar nature that were distributed by local merchants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">II. Whether appellant was entitled to have the jury consider the defense of discriminatory prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-11\">III. Whether the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during closing argument necessitated a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">Discerning no error below, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">Pastor D. Joseph Horevay, a representative of Christian Gathering, a Cumberland organization, wrote a letter to Allegany County State\u2019s Attorney Lawrence Kelly, expressing his concern that 104 Video, an adult video store located on Mechanic Street in Cumberland, might be in violation of state obscenity laws. Mr. Kelly met with Pastor Horevay and John Calligan, another representative of Christian Gathering, and agreed to investigate the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-15\">Mr. Kelly directed the Cumberland City Police Department (\u201cCCPD\u201d) to purchase a \u201chomosexually oriented pornographic tape\u201d from 104 Video. Officer Philip Houser of the CCPD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>entered 104 Video, where appellant was working, and purchased a male homosexual-oriented, pornographic' videotape entitled \u201cSoap Studs.\u201d After reviewing the videotape, Mr. Kelly filed a criminal information in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Prior to trial, appellant served subpoenas upon Mr. Kelly, several CCPD officers (including Officer Houser), Pastor Horevay, Mr. Calligan, and a local newsperson to testify at trial for the defense. Believing that appellant would attempt to raise at trial the defense of discriminatory prosecution, the State filed a motion in limine. The State argued that, because the defense of discriminatory prosecution \u201cis a defect in the institution of the prosecution,\u201d <em>see </em>Rule 4-252(a)(l), the court should not consider that defense as the appellant failed to file a timely motion to dismiss under Rule 4-252(b). The State also asserted that the issue of discriminatory prosecution is not within the province of the jury, and therefore, appellant should not be allowed to pursue that defense at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">At the motions hearing, the circuit court ruled that: (1) the defense of discriminatory prosecution is recognized in Maryland; (2) \u201cbecause the defense ... does not go to the issue of the defendant\u2019s innocence or guilt or [sic] the crime charged the issue ... is not to be tried by the jury but rather to be presented to the Court by means of appropriate pre-trial motion for dismissal ..., or in the proper case by seeking injunctive relief to prevent or restrain the unconstitutional discriminatory enforcement of the law, or by seeking post-conviction habeas corpus relief\u2019; and, (3) the presence of discriminatory prosecution is a \u201cdefect in the institution of the prosecution\u201d that must be raised in a pre-trial motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Despite appellant\u2019s failure to file a timely motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 4-252(b), the Court determined, pursuant to Rule 4-252(a), that good cause existed to entertain appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss based on discriminatory prosecution. After a hearing at which appellant introduced evidence that other establishments in and around Cumberland distributed videotapes of a similar pornographic nature, but were not singled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>out for prosecution, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss, ruling that Mr. Kelly\u2019s decision to prosecute appellant was not based on an arbitrary or invidious criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">During the trial, appellant attempted to introduce six videotapes that were, assertedly, similar in nature to \u201cSoap Studs.\u201d Defense exhibit 1 was a bag containing two videotapes obtained from Potomac Video; defense exhibit 2 was a bag containing two videotapes obtained from Kline\u2019s; and, defense exhibit 3 was a bag containing two videotapes obtained from National Video.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The appellant called James William Forbeck as a witness to testify in regard to these tapes. Mr. Forbeck testified that he visited three different establishments in the Cumberland area\u2014Kline\u2019s, Potomac Video, and National Video\u2014and rented two videotapes from each establishment. Mr. Forbeck acknowledged that he had an opportunity to view videotapes from the \u201cgay section\u201d of 104 Video and saw enough of them to know \u201cwhat the gay sexual act would be.\u201d Mr. Forbeck further testified that appellant\u2019s counsel instructed him to obtain \u201csimilar materials from other establishments in the community.\u201d The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">Q Now have you had an opportunity to review any of the materials that you have here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">Q And did any of those materials have a male homosexual theme or conduct on it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">Q And do you know where that came from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-11\">A I\u2019d have to look at the name of the tape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: May I approach the witness to see if he can choose ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-13\">BY THE COURT: Well can we agree it came from one of the three, or is it significant which one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I would like to pin it down. Cause if I would go to offer it ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>BY THE COURT: All right. Go right ahead, counsel.

Potomac Video.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">BY THE COURT: Defendant\u2019s 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">A I think it\u2019s from Kline\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-11\"># * * # # ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-12\">Q Well we\u2019re not going to think. We\u2019re going to ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9f\">A I\u2019m just guessing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-13\">Q I\u2019m going to hand you No. 2 which came from Kline\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apk\">A Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-14\">Q Defense Exhibit No. 2 for identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-15\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-16\">Q Is it one or is it two?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-17\">A One.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-18\">Q Did you only pick up one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-19\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-20\">Q Now did you have an occasion to look for or select any females homosexual or gay type?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-21\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-22\">Q Did you have an opportunity to locate any of those? A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-23\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-24\">BY THE COURT: Yeah, we\u2019re ... Sustained. Sustained. I think I\u2019ve permitted all I\u2019m permitting on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-25\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, at this time I would move to ... (Pause) I would move to admit one tape from Kline\u2019s of the two. I would like to show ... I\u2019ve shown it to counsel. I\u2019d like to show it to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR0\">BY THE COURT: You can show it to whomever you like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: This one I would withdraw as being ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">BY THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So that leaves ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">BY THE COURT: No. So I\u2019m clear. When I say okay. I haven\u2019t ruled on any admissibility. I\u2019m letting you ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I understand that. I just wanted to check something ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">BY THE COURT: Sure. Go right ahead, counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... with regard to names.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">(Pause)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">Q I\u2019m going to hand you Defense Exhibit No. 3 and ask you to review the tape upon opening without your ... You could do it. Open them up and look at the title and see if any of those two were gay males?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-13\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-14\">Q Now hand you back Defense Exhibit No. 2 from Kline\u2019s. And I\u2019ve taken the liberty of putting one [tape] on the outside and one [tape] on the inside. Would you look at the one on the inside again and see if that may or may not be accurately described as male gay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-15\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-16\">Q So then that is not ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-17\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-18\">Q ... gay male? Now the other one in your hand, is that gay male?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-19\">A No. I\u2019m sorry. I thought it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-20\">Q Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-21\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-22\">Q So then do you know which one, if any, is ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-23\">A I did not get gay tape. I got the one in gay. I call female gay too. I mean ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-24\">Q So then ... I\u2019d have to ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-25\">A Sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-26\">Q No, that\u2019s okay I want (unclear) That\u2019s all I wanted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Appellant\u2019s counsel then offered the three exhibits into evidence: \u201cAt this time, Your Honor, I\u2019d have still Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 for the Defense, which we would offer for purposes of comparables with regard to the material and its similarity to the conduct depicted in ... as determined and set out in the statute.\u201d At the time, the court did not rule on the exhibits\u2019 admissibility; after the close of appellant\u2019s case, however, the court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">My conclusion is that as to the objection to their introduction I will sustain that objection. My reason or rationale is this. That to the best of my ability I have attempted to allow the Defendant latitude to generate and develop its [sic] theory of defenses, including the concept that a community standard can in part deal with what is sold at other locations. Over objection of the State, I have permitted that as I in my opinion that latitude should have been granted. However, to introduce these six items seems to me to go beyond that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">First, there is a practical difficulty. While I don\u2019t know I would imagine that six videos, if they\u2019re, anything of the length of what we have already observed, we\u2019re talking minimum of six hours of viewing material. It is simply a practical impossibility, as I would see it, for that to be prescreened and/or viewed by the Jury if ultimately viewed that they should be introduced. It would seem to me it would almost prohibit trials of this case. I couldn\u2019t see where the end could come. I suppose you could have a hundred of these in that fashion. <em>But perhaps more significantly, it does seem to me that six different films of varieties that I can\u2019t be certain of, none of which apparently deal particularly with the subject matter of this one that\u2019s before the Court, is collateral enough and certainly in my mind raises the possibility of being not only onerous but confusing to the Jury in terms of mere quantity and quality.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">During closing arguments, the State made the following remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>What else does [appellant] sell in that place? No other types of films. Does he rent them? No, he sells them. He sells them, and they go out into public. And then what happens to them? Nobody knows. They\u2019re gone. They\u2019re out there. He\u2019s putting into the public permanently this trash.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-4\">Once again, don\u2019t look at this ... And please don\u2019t ... This individual and the State is not interested in being considered prudish or in any way prejudicial or judgmental of a given sexual orientation. That is not what we are here about. What we\u2019re here about is degrading the human spirit. What we\u2019re here about is making people into animals and having candid shots ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Appellant\u2019s counsel objected and the following was said at a bench conference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to move for mistrial. I want this jury. I hate to do it. I sat back there and listened to all those comments you [the prosecutor] made, degrading comments. They were not proper argument to start with. And you bring animals into the case. Highly prejudicial statement. I move for mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">BY THE COURT: Okay---- I\u2019m going to deny the motion for mistrial. The use of animal can go a different ... a couple different ways. What I would suggest, if you want to refer to that, is to make it clear you\u2019re not suggesting this is bestiality or anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">BY THE COURT: Well I ... But that\u2019ll, you know ... And then ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Or the customers are animals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-12\">BY THE COURT: Or the ... Yeah. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ane\">[PROSECUTOR]: Nor will I refer to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAx\">BY THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Additional facts will be included in the discussion, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">A fundamental element of due process of law is the right of a defendant to present a defense. <em>See Washington v. Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 1923, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967). Appellant maintains that he was denied this right. Specifically, appellant contends that the trial court committed reversible error when it sustained the State\u2019s objection to the introduction of defense exhibits one, two, and three. These videotapes, appellant asserts, were probative of the local community\u2019s tolerance for pornography and thus directly relate to the issue of \u201ccontemporary community standards.\u201d <em>See Mangum v. Maryland State Bd. of Censors, </em>273 Md. 176, 185, 328 A.2d 283 (1974) (determination of obscenity rests, in part, on whether \u201c \u2018the average person, <em>applying contemporary community standards, </em>would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest\u2019 \u201d). The State points out that there is nothing for us to review because appellant did not make a sufficient proffer of the contents of the videotapes. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Although it had to be clear to the trial court the purpose for which appellant offered the videotapes, the contents of those videotapes were not at all clear. Appellant\u2019s counsel merely described the contents as \u201csimilar[ ] to the conduct depicted in ... as determined and set out in the statute.\u201d We assume that counsel was referring to Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 418 (1992), the statute under which appellant was charged. That section proscribes, <em>inter alia, </em>distribution and possession with intent to distribute \u201cobscene\u201d matter. The term \u201cobscene\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 418; rather, that term is defined by case law. Thus, at best, counsel\u2019s proffer indicated that the videotapes contained conduct similar to obscene conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">Counsel also made reference to the fact that the proffered exhibits were comparable to \u201cSoap Studs.\u201d The testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Mr. Forbeck, however, makes clear that none of the six videotapes was of a male homosexual theme. This, of course, directly contradicts counsel\u2019s assertion that they were comparable to \u201cSoap Studs.\u201d Without a proffer of the specific conduct that is portrayed in each of the videotapes, it is not possible for this Court to engage in an analysis of whether the lower court abused its discretion when it refused to admit the evidence. Because appellant failed to make a sufficient proffer, the issue is not preserved for appellate review. <em>See Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 603, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984) (\u201c[T]he question of whether the exclusion of evidence is erroneous and constitutes prejudicial error is not properly preserved for appellate review unless there has been a formal proffer of what the contents and relevance of the excluded [evidence] would have been.\u201d); <em>cf. Avery v. State, </em>121 Md. 229, 232, 88 A. 148 (1913) (\u201cThere can be no reversal for error without injury, and this Court can not determine whether the appellant was injured by answers to improper questions unless the answers are set out in the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We next turn to an issue that has not heretofore been addressed by either this Court or the Court of Appeals: whether it is within the province of the jury to consider the issue of discriminatory prosecution. We shall conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">It is well settled that a State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s power to institute a criminal prosecution is replete with broad discretion. <em>See Murphy v. Yates, </em>276 Md. 475, 495, 348 A.2d 837 (1975).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0n\">This broad discretion rests largely on the recognition that the decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review. Such factors as the strength of the case, the prosecution\u2019s general deterrence value, the Government\u2019s enforcement priorities, and the case\u2019s relationship to the Government\u2019s overall enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent to undertake. Judicial supervision in this area, moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>entails systemic costs of particular concern. Examining the basis of a prosecution delays the criminal proceeding, threatens to chill law enforcement by subjecting the prosecutor\u2019s motives and decisionmaking to outside inquiry, and may undermine prosecutorial effectiveness by revealing the Government\u2019s enforcement policy. All these are substantial concerns that make the courts properly hesitant to examine the decision whether to prosecute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-5\"><em>Wayte v. United States, </em>470 U.S. 598, 607-08, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 1530-31, 84 L.Ed.2d 547 (1985). Although prosecutorial discretion is broad, it is not unfettered. <em>Id. </em>at 608, 105 S.Ct. at 1531.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In the often-cited case of <em>Yick Wo v. Hopkins, </em>118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886), the Supreme Court recognized that, in limited circumstances, a prosecutor\u2019s decision to prosecute can violate the equal protection clause. Justice Matthews, writing for the Court, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">Though the law itself be fair on its face, and impartial in appearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 373-74, 6 S.Ct. at 1073. In <em>Oyler v. Boles, </em>368 U.S. 448, 456, 82 S.Ct. 501, 506, 7 L.Ed.2d 446 (1962), however, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement is not in itself a federal constitutional violation\u201d; selective prosecution must be both deliberate and \u201cbased upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The allegation of selective or discriminatory prosecution is not new to Maryland courts. Several appellate court decisions address the topic in varying contexts. <em>See, e.g., Bourexis v. Carroll County Narcotics Task Force, </em>96 Md.App. 459, 470-71, 625 A.2d 391 (plea bargaining process), <em>cert. denied, </em>332 Md. 453, 632 A.2d 150 (1993); <em>Richardson v. State, </em>89 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>App. 259, 270-71, 598 A.2d 1 (1991) (decision to seek the death penalty), <em>aff'd, </em>332 Md. 94, 630 A.2d 238 (1993); <em>Middleton v. State, </em>67 Md.App. 159, 169-72, 506 A.2d 1191 (decision to pursue mandatory sentence for a subsequent offender), <em>cert. denied, </em>308 Md. 146, 517 A.2d 771 (1986); <em>In re: Laurence T., </em>285 Md. 621, 627, 403 A.2d 1256 (1979) (decision to institute juvenile delinquency proceedings); <em>Giant of Md., Inc. v. State\u2019s Attorney, </em>267 Md. 501, 517, 298 A.2d 427 (decision to prosecute for violation of Sunday Blue Laws), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>412 U.S. 915, 93 S.Ct. 2733, 37 L.Ed.2d 141 (1973); <em>cf. Pruitt v. Howard County Sheriff\u2019s Dep\u2019t, </em>96 Md.App. 60, 73-75, 623 A.2d 696 (discipline against officers of Sheriffs Department), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>332 Md. 143, 630 A.2d 723 (1993); <em>Consumer Protection Div. Office of the Attorney Gen. v. Consumer Publishing Co., </em>304 Md. 731, 751-53, 501 A.2d 48 (1985) (Attorney General\u2019s decision to file charges under the Consumer Protection Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing relative to the issue of discriminatory prosecution. After hearing the evidence, the court concluded that Mr. Kelly\u2019s decision to prosecute appellant was not based on an arbitrary or invidious criteria. Appellant does not challenge that ruling; rather, he argues that he was entitled to have the jury consider the evidence and reach its own conclusion therefrom. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The highest courts of two of our sister states have addressed this issue. In <em>People v. Goodman, </em>31 N.Y.2d 262, 338 N.Y.S.2d 97, 101, 290 N.E.2d 139, 143 (1972), the Court of Appeals of New York held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARi\">the claim of discriminatory enforcement should not be considered as an affirmative defense to the criminal charge, to be determined together with the issue of guilt by the trier of fact, but, rather, should be addressed to the court <em>before trial </em>as a motion to dismiss the prosecution upon constitutional grounds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The Court cited with approval <em>People v. Utica Daw\u2019s Drug Co., </em>16 A.D.2d 12, 225 N.Y.S.2d 128, 131-33 (1962), wherein the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>The claim of discriminatory enforcement should not be treated as a defense to the criminal charge, to be tried before the jury and submitted to it for decision, but should be treated as an application to the court for a dismissal or quashing of the prosecution upon constitutional grounds. Insofar as a question of fact may be involved, the court should take the evidence in the absence of the jury and should decide the question itself. If the court finds that there was an intentional and purposeful discrimination, the court should quash the prosecution, not because the defendant is not guilty of the crime charged, but because the court, as an agency of the government, should not lend itself to a prosecution the maintenance of which would violate the constitutional rights of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">As was said in a concurring opinion by Mr. Justice Roberts speaking for himself and for Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is and Mr. Justice Stone in a different context: \u201cIt is the province of the court and of the court alone to protect itself and the government from such prostitution of the criminal law * * * [It] should be dealt with by the court no matter by whom or at what stage of the proceedings the facts are brought to its attention\u201d and further: \u201cRecognition of the defense * * * as belonging to the defendant and as raising an issue for decision by the jury called to try him upon plea of the general issue, results in the trial of a false issue wholly outside the true rule which should be applied by the courts.\u201d <em>(Sorrells v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 435, 457-458 [53 S.Ct. 210, 218-19, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932)] ...)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">\u2756 * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">Treating the claim of discriminatory enforcement as a motion to quash the prosecution, addressed to the court, puts it in the same category as a motion to suppress illegally seized evidence under the Federal criminal procedure ... or the similar procedure now mandated in the State courts under <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643 [81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961)]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>[Matters' of this kind should be dealt with by the court rather than the jury. This places the power and the responsibility where it belongs,\u2014in the court. The claim of discriminatory enforcement does not go to the question of the guilt or innocence of the defendant, which is within the province of the jury. The question is rather whether in a community in which there is general disregard of a particular law with the acquiescence of the public authorities, the authorities should be allowed sporadically to select a single defendant or a single class of defendants for prosecution because of personal animosity or some other illegitimate reason.... The court is asked to stop the prosecution at the threshold, not because the defendant is innocent but because the public authorities are guilty of a wrong in <em>engaging </em>in a course of conduct designed to discriminate unconstitutionally against the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Similarly, in <em>Murgia v. Municipal Court for the Bakersfield Judicial Dist., </em>15 Cal.3d 286, 124 Cal.Rptr. 204, 208 n. 4, 540 P.2d 44, 48 n. 4 (1975) (en banc) <em>(overruling People v. Van Randall, </em>140 Cal.App.2d 771, 296 P.2d 68 (1956)), the Supreme Court of California held that an allegation of discriminatory prosecution should be raised through a pre-trial motion to dismiss and must be resolved by the court, not the jury. <em>See also United States v. Schmidt, </em>935 F.2d 1440, 1449-50 (4th Cir.1991) (holding implicitly that the defense of selective prosecution is not triable to a jury); <em>United States v. Berrigan, </em>482 F.2d 171, 175 (3d Cir.1973) (\u201cThe question of discriminatory prosecution relates not to the guilt or innocence of appellants, but rather addresses itself to a constitutional defect in the institution of the prosecution.\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Erne, </em>576 F.2d 212, 216 (9th Cir.1978) (\u201c[A] defendant is usually entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claim of discriminatory prosecution \u2018when enough facts are alleged to take the question past the frivolous stage.\u2019 \u201d). <em>See generally </em>Comment, <em>The Right to Nondiscriminatory Enforcement of State Penal Laws, </em>61 Colum.L.Rev. 1103, 1131-33 (1961); S.R. Shapiro, Annotation, <em>Preconviction Procedure for Raising Contention </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>That Enforcement of Penal Statute or Law is Unconstitutionally Discriminatory, 4 </em>A.L.R.3d 404 (1965 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">We are persuaded that the approach taken by both the New York and California courts represents the modern view. In addition to the academic reasons for this approach cited by the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, in <em>Utica Daw\u2019s Drug Co., </em>there are at least two practical ramifications worth noting. First, unlike the case of an acquittal, where double jeopardy would bar a future prosecution, dismissal of the charging document before jeopardy attaches would not bar the State from instituting a subsequent <em>nondiscriminatory </em>prosecution. Second, if the court grants the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the State would have the right to appeal from the court\u2019s decision pursuant to Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 12-302(c)(l) (1989) (\u201cThe State may appeal from a final judgment granting a motion to dismiss or quashing or dismissing any indictment, information, presentment, or inquisition.\u201d). If the rule were otherwise and the trial results in an acquittal, the State would be left without a forum to challenge what is essentially a constitutional appraisal of the facts, similar to a fourth amendment search and seizure issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Appellant cites <em>Medley v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 225, 448 A.2d 363, <em>cert. denied, </em>294 Md. 544 (1982), and argues that, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>there was a \u201cdispute as to the proper interpretation of the law\u201d that should have been submitted to the jury for resolution. In <em>Medley, </em>we recognized that Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights \u201crequires the court to instruct the jury that its (the court\u2019s) instructions are advisory <em>only </em>in circumstances where there is a \u2018dispute as to the proper interpretation of the law of the crime for which there is a <em>sound basis.\u2019 \u201d Id., </em>at 237, 448 A.2d 363 <em>(quoting Montgomery v. State, </em>292 Md. 84, 89, 437 A.2d 654 (1981)). In <em>Hebron v. State, </em>331 Md. 219, 233, 627 A.2d 1029 (1993), the Court of Appeals stated that Article 23 \u201cmeans that, although the jury is the sole judge of the facts, the jury\u2019s role with respect to the law is limited to resolving conflicting interpretations of the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number><em>of the </em>crime <em>and </em>determining whether that law should be applied in dubious factual situations.\u201d <em>See also In re Petition for Writ of Prohibition, </em>312 Md. 280, 318, 539 A.2d 664 (1988) (\u201cWhat it all boils down to now is that the jury\u2019s right to judge the law is virtually eliminated; the provision, as we have construed it, basically protects the jury\u2019s right to judge the facts.\u201d). In the case <em>sub judiee, </em>however, there was no conflicting interpretation of the law; rather, there was a question of fact and law to be determined by the court, not unlike a motion to suppress illegally obtained evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Accordingly, we hold that a criminal defendant who claims that the State instituted criminal proceedings in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment must raise that issue pre-trial for resolution by the court. Because of its practical importance, we shall briefly discuss the proper procedure by which a defendant may raise this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Rule 4-252 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">(a) Mandatory Motions.\u2014In the circuit court, the following matters shall be raised by motion in conformity with this Rule and if not so raised are waived unless the court, for good cause shown, orders otherwise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">(1) A defect in the institution of the prosecution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">(2) A defect in the charging document other than its failure to show jurisdiction in the court or its failure to charge an offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">(3) An unlawful search, seizure, interception of wire or oral communication, or pretrial identification;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">(4) An unlawfully obtained admission, statement, or confession;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-12\">(5) A motion for joint or separate trial of defendants or offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-13\">(b) Time for Filing Mandatory Motions.\u2014A motion under section (a) of this Rule shall be filed within 30 days after the earlier of the appearance of counsel or the first appearance of the defendant before the court pursuant to Rule 4-213(c), except when discovery discloses the basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>a motion, the motion may be filed within five days after the discovery is furnished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">\u201c[T]he Court of Appeals in adopting new Rule 736 [the predecessor of Rule 4-252] decided, as a matter of judicial policy and administration, to make the Maryland rule parallel to Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d <em>Kohr v. State, </em>40 Md.App. 92, 98, 388 A.2d 1242, <em>cert. denied, </em>283 Md. 735 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">In <em>Schmidt, supra, </em>935 F.2d at 1449, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit refused to consider whether the lower court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the appellants\u2019 claim of selective prosecution. Instead, the Court recognized the well-settled principal that \u201c \u2018[defenses and objections based on defects in the institution of the prosecution\u2019 must be raised prior to trial\u201d and held that the appellants\u2019 \u201cfailure to comply with the requirements of Rule 12(b)(1) [the federal counterpart to Rule 4-252(a)(l) ] constitute^] a waiver by them of any claim that the prosecution was instituted for discriminatory reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1450; <em>see also United States v. Taylor, </em>562 F.2d 1345, 1356 (2d Cir.) (holding that a claim of selective prosecution is a \u201cdefense based on \u2018defects in the institution of the prosecution\u2019 \u201d and must be raised in compliance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(1)), <em>cert. denied, </em>432 U.S. 909, 97 S.Ct. 2958, 53 L.Ed.2d 1083 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Thus, it is evident that a discriminatory prosecution is a \u201cdefect in the institution of the prosecution\u201d and therefore a claim of discriminatory prosecution must be raised in a mandatory motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 4-252(a) within the time constraints provided by Rule 4-252(b). If this is not done, the claim is waived, \u201cunless the court, for good cause shown, orders otherwise[.]\u201d Rule 4-252(a). If the claim is raised properly, however, the court shall undertake to determine its merits, conducting an evidentiary hearing, if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">The discriminatory prosecution issue is based on the allegation that the State\u2019s Attorney had failed to prosecute an individual who was distributing the same type of material, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>who happened to be a former client of the State\u2019s Attorney. We do not wish to let this issue pass without commenting on the following statement made by the State\u2019s Attorney in response to that allegation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\">After the charges were publicized with Mr. Purohit, Mr. Kline called me, indicated he had similar type materials, asked for my directions as to what his position would be. I indicated to him at that time ... He indicated that he was selling those type materials. I indicated that he should desist from selling. That\u2019s what Mr. Purohit was charged with. He inquired as to rentals. I indicated that at that point in time there were no prosecutions relating to those who rented, and that if at such time that occurred I would give him the courtesy of advising him. And Mr. Kline indicated to me that at any time if there was any possibility of prosecution with regard to these type materials that he would immediately remove them. He further indicated that he was going to contact certain individuals and offer for sale all of his materials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Clearly, it was inappropriate first of all to advise a former client that he would not be prosecuted and secondly that, if a decision would be made to prosecute, he would be notified ahead of time so that he could comply with the law. There is also a question whether Kline, in fact, should have been further investigated to determine whether he should have been prosecuted for selling the materials he was handling.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Appellant also argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it refused to grant a motion for mistrial after the State made two allegedly improper remarks during closing argument. In <em>Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, 422, 583 A.2d 218 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 112 S.Ct. 117, 116 L.Ed.2d 86 (1991), the Court of Appeals reviewed the standard of appellate review of the trial court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>\u201c[T]he declaration of a mistrial is an extraordinary act which should only be granted if necessary to serve the ends of justice.\u201d This Court has recognized that granting a motion for a mistrial lies within the discretion of the trial judge. The trial judge, who hears the entire case and can weigh the danger of prejudice arising from improper testimony, is in the best position to determine if the extraordinary remedy of a mistrial is appropriate. <em>We will not reverse a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial unless the defendant was so clearly prejudiced that the denial constituted an abuse of discretion.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">(Citations omitted) (emphasis added); <em>see also State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 278, 604 A.2d 489 (1992) (the determination of prejudice is best left to the trial judge because it is he who \u201chas his finger on the pulse of the trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In the context of improper remarks made during closing arguments, the Court of Appeals has made clear that \u201c \u2018the mere occurrence of improper remarks does not by itself constitute reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 431, 326 A.2d 707 (1974) <em>(quoting People v. Mackins, </em>17 Ill.App.3d 24, 308 N.E.2d 92, 110 (1974)). If the reviewing court can declare, \u201c \u2018upon its own independent review of the record, ... a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict,\u2019 \u201d such error can be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and the judgment may be affirmed. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>325 Md. 511, 520, 601 A.2d 1093 (1992) <em>(quoting Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The first remark about which appellant complains is the State\u2019s reference to the fact that appellant sold, rather than rented, the videotape. This contention is not preserved for our review because counsel failed to object to this portion of the State\u2019s closing argument. <em>See </em>Rule 8\u2014131(a); <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>94 Md.App. 715, 730, 619 A.2d 155 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The second remark about which appellant complains is the State\u2019s comment that the videotape essentially \u201cma[de] people into animals.\u201d Assuming, without deciding, that this remark went beyond what is permissible argument, we can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>conclude, based on an independent review of the record, that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 2615, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), the Supreme Court enunciated \u201cbasic guidelines for the trier of fact\u201d when considering whether matter is obscene:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">(a) whether \u201cthe average person, applying contemporary community standards\u201d would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atj\">(Citation omitted). The jury in the case <em>sub judice </em>was instructed that, in order to find appellant guilty of the charges, it must be satisfied that the State proved each of the three elements beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Before the State rested its case, the jury viewed \u201cSoap Studs\u201d in its entirety. This videotape, which is nearly ninety minutes in length, contains numerous episodes of homosexual sex between several pairs of adult males. The content of the videotape may be best described as \u201chard-core\u201d pornography from beginning to end. Various deviant and unnatural sexual acts are performed throughout the tape. These \u201cultimate and climactic acts,\u201d <em>B &amp; A Co. v. State, </em>24 Md.App. 367, 372, 330 A.2d 701, cert. <em>denied, </em>274 Md. 725 (1975), include, among others, fellatio, analingus, digital penetration of the anus, and anal intercourse. There are lewd exhibitions of the genitals and patently offensive representations of masturbation. <em>See Miller, </em>413 U.S. at 25, 93 S.Ct. at 2615. Many of the sexual acts are videotaped close-up and at various revealing angles. Further, there are commercial-type \u201cendorsements\u201d for such products as \u201cSpurts\u201d breath mints (they \u201cend morning breath\u201d) and \u201cJac-creme\u201d; one of the actors used an \u201cAmerican Sex Press\u201d credit card for payment of a male prostitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Based upon our review of the evidence, we hold that the State\u2019s remark regarding animals, even if improper, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
