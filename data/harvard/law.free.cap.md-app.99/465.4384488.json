Appellee sought to collect Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits. At a hearing before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (Commission), appellee claimed the following injuries: a total loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>vision in both eyes, total loss of his sense of smell, total loss of his sense of taste, and a head injury from the bullet which remains lodged in his head. At the hearing, appellant, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, stipulated that appellee was completely blind in both eyes. Appellee presented uncontradicted evidence that he had a total loss of his senses of smell and taste as a result of his injury. The only other evidence presented (the transcript of the hearing was only seven pages long, including a title page and table of contents page) was that appellee was currently employed by the Police Department as an instructor for the Police Academy. The Commission ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\"><em>PERMANENT PARTIAL DISABILITY: </em>Under \u201cOther Cases\u201d amounting to 85% industrial loss of the body as a whole; at the rate of $244.00, payable weekly, beginning at the end of accidental injury benefits previously paid unto the claimant, for a period of 567 weeks; pursuant to Labor and Employment Title 9-630.<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Appellee appealed this order to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and moved for partial summary judgment claiming that the Commission erred by considering all his injuries under the \u201cOther Cases\u201d provision. He argued that the Commission should have considered his loss of vision under the schedule for specific injuries and then considered his loss of taste and smell and the bullet lodged in his head separately under the \u201cOther Cases\u201d provision. Appellee, in his motion for partial summary judgment, requested that the court award him permanent partial disability benefits for 500 weeks for his total loss of vision (250 weeks per eye) under the schedule for specific injuries, award him an additional 167 weeks under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>section 9-630 for a serious disability, and remand the case to the Commission to determine the extent of his permanent partial disability under \u201cOther Cases\u201d for the loss of his senses of smell and taste. The court granted his motion. Appellant then filed this appeal. The parties raise the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">Was the Circuit Court for Baltimore City correct in awarding Officer Cassidy permanent partial disability benefits under Md. Labor &amp; Employment Code Ann. \u00a7 9\u2014627(d) \u201cscheduled injuries\u201d provision for the 100% loss of both eyes and remanding his case for a further determination of industrial loss of taste and smell? <footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW BY CIRCUIT COURT OF COMMISSION\u2019S ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Appellee was disabled as a result of an accidental injury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">Where the case involves an accidental injury, the court must determine three things: (i) did the Commission justly consider all the facts concerning the injury; (ii) did the Commission exceed its statutory authority; and (iii) did the Commission misconstrue the facts or the law applicable to the case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\"><em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. Bell, </em>46 Md.App. 37, 42, 415 A.2d 636 (1980). \u201c[I]n making th[e]se determinations, the reviewing court has very broad authority, notwithstanding the <em>prima facie </em>correctness of the administrative decision.\u201d <em>Egypt Farms, Inc. v. Lepley, </em>49 Md.App. 171, 176, 430 A.2d 122, <em>cert. denied, </em>291 Md. 778 (1981). This presumption of correctness applies to the factual decisions of the Commission and not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the Commission\u2019s interpretations of the pertinent statutory provisions. <em>C &amp; R Contractors v. Wagner, </em>93 Md.App. 801, 808, 614 A.2d 1035 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>329 Md. 480, 620 A.2d 350 (1993). \u201cTh[e] review ... \u2018extends both to findings of fact and applicable law\u2019 and \u2018provides for a trial which is essentially de novo.\u2019 \u201d <em>Egypt Farms, </em>49 Md.App. at 176, 430 A.2d 122. <em>See also Dawson\u2019s Charter Service v. Chin, </em>68 Md.App. 433, 440, 511 A.2d 1138 (1986) (\u201c[A]n appeal of a worker compensation case is a <em>de novo </em>proceeding in the circuit court.\u201d) and <em>Turner v. Public Defender, </em>61 Md.App. 393, 398, 486 A.2d 804 (1985). When the circuit court granted appellee\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, it apparently determined that the Commission misconstrued the law applicable to this case by determining that the loss of vision in both eyes fell under section 9-627(k) of the Labor <em>&amp; </em>Employment Article, \u201cOther Cases,\u201d instead of determining the loss of vision in both eyes fell under the schedule of specific injuries in section 9-627(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\n<em>SPECIFIC INJURIES AND \u201cOTHER CASES\u201d UNDER SECTION 9-627</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Generally, the Labor &amp; Employment Article \u201cshould be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes. Any uncertainty in the law should be resolved in favor of the claimant.\u201d <em>C &amp; R Contractors, </em>93 Md.App. at 807, 614 A.2d 1035 (quoting <em>Victor v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., </em>318 Md. 624, 629, 569 A.2d 697 (1990)). \u201cWhile the Act is to be liberally construed, a court is not at liberty to disregard its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Id., </em>93 Md.App. at 808, 614 A.2d 1035 (quoting <em>Montgomery County v. Lake, </em>68 Md.App. 269, 273, 511 A.2d 541 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Maryland Code (1991 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-627(d) of the Labor and Employment Article provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">(1) Compensation shall be paid for the period listed for the loss of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>(vi) an eye, 250 weeks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Labor and Employment Article \u00a7 9-627(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">The permanent loss of use of a[n] ... eye shall be considered equivalent to the loss of the ... eye.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Labor and Employment Article \u00a7 9\u2014627(k) <em>Other cases </em>provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">(1) In all cases of permanent partial disability not listed in subsections (a) through (j) of this section, the Commission shall determine the percentage by which the industrial use of the covered employee\u2019s body was impaired as a result of the ... injury....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\">(3) The Commission shall award compensation to the covered employee in the proportion that the determined loss bears to 500 weeks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Appellant contends the Commission correctly construed the law when it determined the loss of vision in both eyes fell under the \u201cOther Cases\u201d provision. Appellant cites two sources as support for this contention. It first cites Larson\u2019s treatise stating, \u201cProfessor Larson, in dealing with the loss of sight in both eyes being under \u2018other cases\u2019, has formulated \u2018the multiple-impairment principle\u2019.\u201d Larson states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-11\">There is a further factor that may help to account for a number of the newer decisions, which might be called the multiple-impairment principle. This principle wo\u00fald recognize the common sense fact that, when two or more schedule injuries occur together, <em>the disabling effect may be far greater than the arithmetic total of the schedule allowances added together. </em>The most obvious applications of this principle are already specifically provided for in a typical schedule. <em>Total loss of sight of two eyes may be rated at, not twice as much, but five times as much as the loss of one eye, and loss of two feet may be rated 'at almost Jfk times </em>as <em>much as loss of one foot. </em>But these, together with binaural loss of hearing and other losses of two major members, are only the most obvious examples of the principle. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Maryland court identified this factor and gave direct application to it in <em>Department of Correction [] v. Johnson.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYl\">1C Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 58.24 (1992) (emphasis added, footnotes omitted). Thus, appellant reasons, because appellee suffered total loss of sight in both eyes plus loss of taste and smell and because his total loss of vision may \u201cbe rated at, not twice as much, but five times as much as the loss of one eye,\u201d appellee\u2019s injuries must be classified as an \u201cOther Case.\u201d His award under \u201cOther Case\u201d would be less than if his total loss of vision was rated at the loss of one eye multiplied by two under the schedule for specific injuries. \u201cMerely to state such a construction is, we think, to refute it.\u201d <em>Department of Correction v. Johnson, </em>222 Md. 139, 149, 159 A.2d 658 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The other source appellant cites for support is the <em>Johnson </em>case, where the Court of Appeals addressed \u201cwhether the Commission, <em>in its discretion, </em>might allow compensation <em>in a larger amount </em>under the \u2018Other Cases\u2019 provisions.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141, 159 A.2d 658 (emphasis added). The injured employee in <em>Johnson </em>suffered a loss of both his thumbs. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEe\">We conclude that the amputation of <em>both </em>thumbs is not within the schedule of specific disabilities contained in ... the Act and that it falls within ... the \u201cOther Cases\u201d provision of our statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 149, 159 A.2d 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">By determining that the injured employee\u2019s loss of both thumbs fell under the \u201cOther Cases\u201d provision, the employee was able to collect a greater amount than if he had been compensated for the loss of one thumb multiplied by two. As Professor Larson indicates in the quote that appellant cited above, the ability to give a greater award was one of the primary factors that motivated the Court to utilize the \u201cother cases\u201d provision. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>since appellee suffered the loss of his eyes (the loss of one eye requires disability benefits be awarded for 250 weeks) instead of his thumbs (the loss of one thumb requires disability benefits be awarded for 100 weeks), appellee\u2019s award will be lower if his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>injury is treated under the \u201cOther Cases\u201d provision as opposed to treating each eye as a separate specific injury and then adding the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The <em>Johnson </em>Court reviewed Schneider, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>and Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">The text writers have considered the problem to some extent. See 11 Schneider, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>(Perm. Ed.), \u00a7\u00a7 2311, 2318, 2322(a), and 2 Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 58.20. Schneider, in \u00a7 2311, states in part: \u201cThe question of when a specific injury becomes an \u2018other injuries\u2019 type often presents a shadowy line of demarcation and calls for the <em>wise discretion </em>of the Board, Commission or Referee in the light of substantial facts in evidence.\u201d And in \u00a7 2318, he says: \u201cUsually multiple injuries will be considered to affect the body of the employee as a whole, or a member as a unit, and so such multiple injuries are generally rated under the catchall, or other cases,, provisions. The exceptions are so numerous that it is difficult to say which is the general rule. Little more can be done than give the examples of the decided cases in the various jurisdictions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">Larson ... says: \u201cThe great majority of modern decisions agree that, if the effects of the loss of the member extend to other parts of the body and interfere with their efficiency, the schedule allowance for the lost member is not <em>exclusive.\u201d </em>As the learned author points out, the <em>extended effects of such injuries may result in greater interference with the employee\u2019s ability to work than might be expected from a simple and uncomplicated injury.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 146, 159 A.2d 658 (emphasis added). The Court then added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">It requires neither argument nor elaboration to show that to a manual worker the loss, or loss of use, of both thumbs is a substantial injury and that it is much more serious than would be the loss of one thumb.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The Court also looked to several earlier Maryland cases: <em>Paul v. Glidden Co., </em>184 Md. 114, 39 A.2d 544 (1944); <em>Lisow</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><em>sky v. White, </em>177 Md. 377, 9 A.2d 599 (1939); and <em>Congoleum Nairn, Inc. v. Brown, </em>158 Md. 285, 148 A. 220 (1930), where, when the employee had suffered an injury to several fingers, it held that the employee should be compensated for a partial loss of a hand instead of each individual finger. In <em>Lisowsky, </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">The higher element or measure of damage, or injury, ... should be accorded to the injured person.... [I]f the loss, or injury, to the entire hand, is greater than that limited to the aggregate loss of the fingers, then it would seem but just that the higher measure of damage should be applied, because after all it is adequate compensation that the law seeks to accord.... If there is a conflict in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law with respect to these questions of construction, it seems to us that this should be resolved in favor of the claimant....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">177 Md. at 381-82, 9 A.2d 599 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In <em>Paul, </em>the Court followed its holding in <em>Lisowsky </em>stating that it was based on \u201cthe theory that the higher element or measure of damage in workmen\u2019s compensation cases should be accorded to the injured person.\u201d 184 Md. at 116, 39 A.2d 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The <em>Johnson </em>Court also cited several cases from foreign jurisdictions, including <em>Chapman v. Raftery, </em>174 S.W.2d 352 (Mo.App.1943), and <em>Dauster v. Star MFG. Co., </em>145 S.W.2d 499 (Mo.App.1940). In <em>Dauster, </em>the court held that when an injured employee received multiple injuries in the same accident, the employee\u2019s disability benefits should be determined based on how the injuries affected the use of the employee\u2019s body as a whole, instead of adding the benefits provided for in the statute for each separate injury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">The <em>Chapman </em>court described the holding in <em>Dauster </em>as: [W]here there are combined or multiple injuries resulting from one and the same accident, the compensable period is not <em>necessarily </em>to be fixed with regard for the relation which each and every one of such multiple injuries may bear to some one of the specific injuries mentioned in the statuto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ry schedule, but that instead the commission, in such a case, <em>may </em>properly fix the period in its relation to the ... period of ... weeks, considered from the standpoint of the percentage of disability in the normal functions of the injured man himself....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">... <em>UY the situation was otherwise, ... injustice to the injured employee would almost inevitably </em>result....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQXu\"><em>Chapman, </em>174 S.W.2d at 354 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Our discussion of <em>Johnson </em>illustrates two points. First, the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Johnson </em>is based, to a large degree, on the fact that the employee received greater benefits under the \u201cOther Cases\u201d provision than he would have been awarded under the schedule for the loss of one thumb multiplied by two. Second, the Commission and reviewing court are not <em>required </em>to consider multiple injuries from one accident under the \u201cOther Cases\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">To illustrate the second point we note that, after the <em>Johnson </em>decision, the Commission has awarded permanent partial disability benefits based on <em>both </em>the schedule for a specific injury and the \u201cOther Cases\u201d provision for an injury to the body as a whole to an employee that suffered multiple injuries from a single accident. <em>Barnes v. Ezrine Tire Co., </em>249 Md. 557, 560, 241 A.2d 392 (1968), (\u201c[T]he ... Commission ... found that he \u2018sustained a permanent partial disability [under ... \u201cSpecific Injuries\u201d] resulting in 100% loss of vision in his right eye, and a permanent partial disability under ... \u201cOther Cases\u201d amounting to 30% industrial loss of use of his body as a result of the injury to his back and his right shoulder.... \u2019 \u201d). The issue before the Court in <em>Barnes, </em>however, was not whether the Commission was permitted to make such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The Court in <em>Barnes </em>was addressing when the serious disability provision was triggered and held it could not be triggered by adding the \u201cSpecific Injury\u201d and the \u201cOther Cases\u201d awards together, but that each injury must be considered separately. The Legislature, in response to the <em>Barnes </em>case, then amended the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>the \u201cserious disability\u201d provision to be triggered by \u201cthe <em>product </em>of scheduled specific <em>injuries </em>... or to the body as a whole under the \u2018other cases\u2019 provisions ... <em>or to a combination of both.\u201d Carter v. Allen, Son &amp; Co., </em>28 Md.App. 541, 546, 346 A.2d 453 (1975) (emphasis added). In <em>Barr v. Barberry Brothers, Inc., </em>99 Md.App. 33, 39, 635 A.2d 64 (1994), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\">When several statutes are <em>in pari materia, </em>any interpretation must be <em>made </em>with full awareness of <em>all </em>the relevant enactments. It is presumed that the General Assembly acted with full knowledge of prior legislation and intended statutes that affect the same subject matter to blend into a consistent and harmonious body of law. Therefore, various consistent and related enactments, although made at different times and without reference to one another, nevertheless should be harmonized as much as possible. [Quoting <em>State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 93, 581 A.2d 9 (1990).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The language of section 9-630(a)(l) of the Labor <em>&amp; </em>Employment Article, which provides that the serious disability provision is triggered when an \u201cemployee is given an award <em>or a combination of awards </em>[emphasis added] resulting from 1 accidental ... injury ... under \u00a7 9-627,\u201d and our construction of the provision in <em>Carter </em>are consistent with an interpretation of section 9-627 that does not require the Commission or reviewing court to base awards for multiple injuries solely on the \u201cOther Cases\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Based on the circuit court\u2019s broad standard of review; the fact that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Article should be liberally construed in favor of the injured employee; the fact that the injured employee receives greater compensation under the circuit court\u2019s interpretation of the statute than the Commission\u2019s interpretation; and the fact that the Commission and reviewing court have discretion to consider each injury resulting from a single accident as the product of scheduled specific injuries, the body as a whole under the \u201cOther Cases\u201d provision or a combination of both, we hold the circuit court did not err by reversing the Commission and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>treating appellee\u2019s loss of both eyes as scheduled specific injuries instead of an \u201cOther Case\u201d and remanding this case to the Commission for an additional award under the \u201cOther Cases\u201d provision for appellee\u2019s loss of taste and smell. We hold further that, given the rule that where uncertainty exists, it should be resolved in favor of the claimant and that, generally, the greater compensation should be awarded when a conflict as to the measure of compensation exists by reason of conflicting provisions in the statute, the Commission, in such cases, must apply that statute or combination of statutes that results in the greater compensation to the worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b493-7\">1. Maryland Code (1991 Repl.Vol.) section 9-627(k) of the Labor &amp; Employment Article \u201cOther Cases\u201d requires the Commission to determine the percentage that the industrial use of the employee\u2019s body was impaired. Permanent partial disability benefits are then awarded for this percentage of 500 weeks. Eighty-five percent of 500 is 425. Section 9-630 of the Labor &amp; Employment Article requires the Commission to increase any award under section 9-627 that exceeds 250 weeks by one-third. One-third of 425 is approximately 142 and these two added together amount to 567 total weeks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[2]\">\n<p id=\"b494-9\">2. Appellant also argued that the Commission and circuit court are not compelled to find an amount of disability equal to the medical anatomical evaluations and that they have independent discretion to determine amounts of disability. While this is true, it has no bearing on this case. The evidence of appellee's injuries was either stipulated to or uncontradicted. The circuit court did not reverse because of the amount (percentage) of the disability, it reversed because the Commission did not treat the loss of both eyes under the schedule for specific injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
