C. Hughes, Jr., appeals from a judgment of conviction for failure to report for induction into the armed forces, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a), after a non-jury trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Irving Ben Cooper, J., 364 F.Supp. 310 (1973). Appellant was sentenced as a young adult offender to six months in prison and 18 months probation thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-29\">Appellant\u2019s basic claim is that the failure of appellant\u2019s local board to act upon his allegedly timely request for reclassification vitiated the induction order. Appellant, a permanent resident alien from British Honduras, was supposed to report for induction on July 16, 1970. A few days prior to that date, appellant allegedly returned to British Honduras and mailed to his local board a letter requesting reclassification under 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.42(e) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as an alien \u201cwho.has departed from the United States.\u201d The letter was dated July 14, but was not received by the local board until July 20. The stated reason for the departure was that appellant\u2019s \u201ckid brother is ill,\u201d thus creating an \u201cemergency.\u201d While the record hardly justifies this characterization, but does make clear appellant\u2019s evasive tactics, we need not tarry over his good faith or lack of it. Although the circumstances were curious,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we may as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>sume, as did Judge Cooper, that the letter was actually mailed before July 16. However, we agree with the trial judge that the controlling date is when the request for reclassification was actually received by the local board. United States v. Baldridge, 454 F.2d 403 (1st Cir. 1972); United States v. Daniell, 435 F.2d 834 (1st Cir. 1970) (per curiam), cert, denied, 401 U.S. 982, 91 S.Ct. 1201, 28 L.Ed.2d 334 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The claim that Local Board Memorandum No. 72<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires a different result is without merit. That Memorandum clearly applies only to specified situations where the registrant\u2019s <em>response </em>is triggered by board action and restricted to specified time limits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> United States v. Baldridge, <em>supra, </em>454 F.2d at 404-405. Here, Hughes presumably was not responding to the induction order, but to his brother\u2019s alleged illness. Since appellant\u2019s request for a change in classification was received by the local board after the date scheduled for his induction, he was required to obey the induction order. It may be that a situation will arise where an unusual delay in the mails or some other equitable circumstance would raise due process questions if a mailed request for reclassification was therefore received too late to be considered. See id.; Blades v. United States, 407 F.2d 1397, 1399 n. 1 (9th Cir. 1969). But this is far from such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-16\">. The regulation at the time provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-18\">(c) In Class IV-C shall be placed any registrant who is an alien and who has departed from the United States. Such alien shall be placed in Class IV-C even though he is a delinquent but this classification shall in no way relieve Mm from liability for prosecution for violation of the selective service law. If any registrant so classified under this paragraph returns to the United States, Ms classification shall be reopened and he shall be classified anew.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-31\">Executive Order 10659, 21 Fed.Reg. 1103. The regulation has since been amended to eliminate the second sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b671-32\">. Although the letter had British Honduras stamps and registered mail markings on it, it carried only a July 18 postmark of receipt by a Bronx post office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b672-5\">.

Selective Service Regulations provide that a registrant and other specified persons, to be entitled to a procedural right or to qualify for a status, must file with or submit to the local board a notice or information within a specified period of time or before a \u201ccutoff\u201d date.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">2. When such a notice or information is filed with or submitted to the local board by mail, the date of mailing as shown by the postmark on the envelope and not the date it was received by the local board shall be used in determining whether the filing or submission is timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-24\">3. The envelope in which any such notice or information is received shall be placed in the registrant\u2019s cover sheet attached to the contents of the envelope.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b672-25\">. The Memorandum indicates on its face that it applies to the registrant\u2019s duties under what were at the time of its issuance 32 O.
