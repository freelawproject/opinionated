District Judge Duffy, relying primarily upon a comparison of black and white photographic reproductions of the designs, found no infringement and did not reach the question of validity. We disagree, find infringement as a matter of law, determine the copyright valid, and remand with directions for an injunction and for an assessment of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-4\">Dress fabric designs notoriously last one year. Appellants\u2019 design here, No. 5700, was into its third successful season, aided perhaps by changes in the accompanying color combinations, when appellee, upon request by a mutual customer, took a swatch of material containing appellant\u2019s design to its textile design studio, gave the salesman the design, as he put. it, \u201cfor inspirational purpose,\u201d and told him \u201cto make a design that would be non-conflicting to that design,\u201d that is, sufficiently dissimilar to avoid this decision. It is not exactly easy in the two-dimensional, black and white print of a judicial opinion to compare two dress designs, but suffice it to say that in a design containing a strip of crescents, scalloping or ribbons between that strip and then rows of semicircles, the only obvious dissimilarity from a few feet away is that the semicircles in two rows of four are reversed in Stafford\u2019s fabric, while they are not in the three rows of Soptra\u2019s. Close up one sees that some of the Stafford crescents are tilted, that the Stafford scalloping is less gracefully treated and that Soptra\u2019s design generally is somewhat more discreet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">Soptra purchased its original design in October, 1970, in the form of a sketch or painting from the Rampelberg Studios in Paris. The design was put \u201cin repeat\u201d to broaden or extend it so as to cover a bolt of cloth. A silk-screen process was used to print the design on the greige goods or naked cloth. At first two colors (in addition to the \u201cwhite\u201d portion of the cloth that is rendered impervious to dye in the silkscreen process) were used in reproduction. Subsequently three colors were used. The copyright was secured by the Textile Distributors Association for the appellant, using a two-color combination as a sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-7\">The district court could not have been more correct in stating the underlying test for infringement as being \u201cwhether an average lay observer would find a substantial similarity in the designs . \u201d Concord Fabrics, Inc. v. Marcus Brothers Textile Corp., 409 F.2d 1315, 1316 (2d Cir. 1969). As Judge Learned Hand said, under such a test, \u201cDecisions must therefore inevitably be <em>ad hoe.\u201d </em>Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., 274 F.2d 487, 489 (2d Cir. 1960). In this respect we agree with Judge Frankel\u2019s observation quoted by Judge Duffy below, that \u201cGood eyes and common sense may be as useful as deep study of reported and unreported cases, which themselves are tied to highly particularized facts.\u201d Couleur International Ltd. v. Opulent Fabrics Inc., 330 F.Supp. 152, 153 (S.D.N.Y. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-8\">The court below concluded that \u201cthe graphic patterns themselves are, in fact, different.\u201d He does not specify in what respects. Our conclusion, with the same materials, exhibits, color combinations <em>and </em>black and white reproductions before us, is to the contrary: in our view the designs are substantially similar, the differences ever so slight, the dissimilarities insubstantial. While we may in a real sense be,factfinding, since we have before us the same record, and since no part of the decision below turned on credibility, \u201cwe are in as good a position to determine the question as is the district court.\u201d Concord Fabrics, Inc. v. Marcus Brothers Textile Corp., 409 F.2d at 1317. The error of the district court was probably in neglecting to give due weight to \u201cthe uses for which the design is intended, especially the scrutiny that observers will give to it <em>as used.\u201d </em>Peter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>Pan Fabrics v. Martin Weiner Corp., 274 F.2d at 489 (emphasis supplied). Here the designs were to be used in dresses, and although small differences between the designs might be found to exist under courtroom scrutiny, those differences fade away within a few feet or absent sharp scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">Judge Duffy purported to follow Clarion Textile Corp. v. Slifka, 223 F.Supp. 950 (S.D.N.Y.1961), where the court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-5\">The designs are enough alike so that a woman wearing plaintiff\u2019s [design] in brown and green would exclaim \u201cThere goes my dress\u201d if she saw a woman wearing [defendant\u2019s design] in the same color scheme. My belief is, however, that there would be no such exclamation if [defendant\u2019s] were in light green and cerise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\"><em>Id. </em>With all due respect to the <em>Clarion Textile </em>court its homely illustration misses the point: if the defendant\u2019s dress there had been light green and cerise, would the woman wearing the design in brown and green say, \u201cThere goes the <em>design </em>of my dress\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-8\">The court below went on to attempt to look beyond any color similarities (though appellee\u2019s matched even appellant\u2019s color combination in some of the comparison materials submitted to the court) by reviewing black and white photographic reproductions of the designs. By looking only to the black and white reproductions, the district judge, we fear, missed the point here also. Certainly the color schemes were not to be entirely overlooked. <em>See </em>Scarves by Vera, Inc. v. United Merchants and Manufacturers, Inc., 173 F.Supp. 625, 627 (S.D.N.Y.1959). As <em>Couleur International, supra, </em>said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-9\">The appearance in one of defendant\u2019s fabrics of colors identical to plaintiff\u2019s is additional evidence of actual copying, as well as another factor leading to the conclusion that the aesthetic appeal of the fabrics is the same ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1168-10\">330 F.Supp. at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-11\">But perhaps the error was really the result of a young district judge\u2019s failure to appreciate with the wisdom and experienced eye that only middle age can bring to the subject of feminine wear the substantial similarity we appellate judges discern in appellant\u2019s and appel-lee\u2019s designs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-12\">\n<em>Ad quod non est responsum.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-13\">On the question of validity Stafford argues that the Soptra copyright is invalid because it represents an exact copy of the uncopyrighted Rampelberg design and thus lacks the requisite originality. Stafford rightly refers us to, <em>e. g., </em>Alfred Bell &amp; Co. v. Catalda Fine Arts, 191 F.2d 99 (2d Cir. 1951) (mezzotints of old masters\u2019 paintings entitled to copyright), for the proposition that skill and judgment must be employed in the reproduction to entitle it to copyright. But Peter Pan Fabrics v. Dan River Mills, 295 F.Supp. 1366 (S.D.N.Y.), aff\u2019d, 415 F.2d 1007 (1969) (per curiam), states what we consider to be the law of this circuit in terms of textile designs. The embellishment or expansion of the original design \u201cin' repeat,\u201d so as to broaden the design and thereby cover a bolt of cloth, together with beginning the pattern in a particular way so as to avoid showing an unsightly joint when the pattern is printed on textiles on a continual basis, constitutes modest but sufficient originality so as to support the copyright. 295 F. Supp. at 1368. The minimal quantum of originality in the textile pattern field, where the design printed is itself unmistakably original, as here, is not very high. Nevertheless, even if there were no originality, the Rampelberg painting-design could have been filed as a \u201cwork of art\u201d under \u00a7 5(g) of the Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(g). The filing here under \u00a7 5(h) as a reproduction of a work of art is at most an \u201cerror in classification\u201d which under \u00a7 5 does not \u201cinvalidate or impair the copyright protection secured under this title.\u201d 295 F.Supp. at 1368.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>Accordingly we reverse and remand with directions that an injunction issue and that the district court proceed to an assessment of damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
