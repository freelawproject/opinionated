GOODWIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b579-19\">American President Lines, Ltd., challenges in this ship-collision case district court orders which dismissed its cross-claim against a pilot and its third-party complaint against the City of Long Beach. The court ruled that the tariff of the Port of Long Beach provided for noneompulsory pilotage services and that the exculpatory provisions of this tariff were valid. We agree with these conclusions, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-20\">On the morning of July 5, 1968, while the government-owned USS Capac\u00f3n was moored in its berth in Long Beach inner harbor, American President Lines re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>quested the port to furnish pilotage services to the SS President Van Bur\u00e9n for a movement into the inner harbor. Municipal Pilot Carl Aultman boarded the President Van Bur\u00e9n and assumed his duties. The President Van Bur\u00e9n, while proceeding under pilotage, collided with the Capacon, damaging both vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The United States subsequently filed its complaint against the President Van Bur\u00e9n, in rem, and against American President Lines and Carl Aultman, in personam, to recover the damages sustained by the Capacon. No service was accomplished in the in-rem proceeding, and that action has been dormant pending resolution of this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">American President Lines (APL) denied liability and counterclaimed against the United States for property damage sustained by the President Van Bur\u00e9n. APL also filed a cross-claim against Aultman, and a third-party complaint against the Port of Long Beach and Ja-cobsen Pilot Services, Inc., the pilotage contractor which, pursuant to its contract with the port, had placed Aultman aboard the President Van Bur\u00e9n.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The district court, sitting in admiralty, without a jury, awarded the United States its full damages against APL. The court dismissed the government\u2019s complaint against Aultman, APL\u2019s counterclaim against the government, APL\u2019s cross-claim against Aultman, and APL\u2019s third-party complaint against Long Beach and Jacobsen. These rulings raise two issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The first question is whether Aultman was a noncompulsory pilot. If so, he was in much the same position as one of the ship\u2019s officers. Under the ordinary rules of <em>respondeat superior, </em>the shipowner would be responsible for Aultman\u2019s actions. If, on the other hand, the district court had concluded that pilotage was compulsory, the <em>re-spondeat superior </em>nexus would have been broken, and APL would not be personally liable for the results of the pilot\u2019s negligence. <em>See </em>Homer Ramsdell Transportation Co. v. La Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 182 U.S. 406, 21 S.Ct. 831, 45 L.Ed. 1155 (1901); G. Gilmore &amp; C. Black, The Law of Admiralty 429-30 (1957).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">\u201c(a) The City of Long Beach maintains a force of municipal pilots, pursuant to a contract with an independent pilotage contractor, to perform the service of piloting vessels within, into and out of the Port of Long Beach. Any vessel entering, leaving or shifting within the Port of Long Beach may, but is not required to, request the services of and be piloted by a municipal pilot. Such</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">The tariff of the Port of Long Beach, under which Aultman boarded the President Van Bur\u00e9n, on its face provides for optional pilotage services to vessels entering, leaving, or shifting within the port.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, if a vessel subject to the payment of pilotage elects not to take aboard a municipal pilot, an assessment of three quarters of the applicable charge is payable to the port.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> APL argues that this financial inducement makes compulsory the use of the port\u2019s pilots.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">In The China, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 53, 19 L.Ed. 67 (1869), the Supreme Court held that under a New York statute which made the master liable for the payment of full pilotage even if he chose to proceed without one, vessels were compelled to take a pilot. The Court further held, however, that, even though the shipowner was not liable in person-am, the vessel itself still was liable in rem.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">Three years later, in The Merrimac, 81 U.S. (14 Wall.) 199, 20 L.Ed. 873 (1872), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-14\">\u201c * * * State pilot laws which compel the owners of vessels to pay pilotage services are understood to be voluntarily requested and voluntarily rendered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aej-dedup-1\">\u201cThree-fourths (%) the applicable charge, including minimum or maximum charge, shall be assessed when vessel subject to the payment of pilotage is not piloted by a municipal pilot.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>half-pilotage in cases where the pilot offers his services and they are refused, where the law is not enforced by any penalty, are not regarded as compulsory, and therefore, the fact that the vessel was in charge of a pilot under such a law at the time of the collision is no defence to a libel for damages, if it appears that the collision was occasioned by negligence or unskilful navigation * * 81 U.S. at 203.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">This holding was cited in dicta in the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent opinion on the subject of compulsory pilotage. Homer Ramsdell Transportation Co. v. La Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 182 U.S. at 415, 21 S.Ct. 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The trial court correctly relied upon the portion of <em>The Merrimac </em>quoted above, even though this court had held that an earlier version of the tariff of the Port of Long Beach provided for compulsory pilotage. National Development Co. v. City of Long Beach, 187 F. Supp. 109, 113 (S.D.Cal.1960), aff\u2019d, 289 F.2d 586 (9th Cir.), cert, denied, 368 U. S. 901, 82 S.Ct. 177, 7 L.Ed.2d 95 (1961); City of Long Beach v. American President Lines, Ltd., 223 F.2d 853, 856 (9th Cir. 1955). Neither of our cases would support a holding today that the pilotage is compulsory. The Long Beach tariff has been significantly amended. The earlier version provided that \u201call vessels entering and leaving, and shifting within, the Port of Long Beach * * * <em>must </em>be piloted by a municipal pilot * * <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Its current version, by contrast, purports to provide that pilotage is completely voluntary. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">The three-quarter charge on vessels that elect not to take on a muncipal pilot, the port explains, is assessed in order to generate needed revenues to help defray the many costs of operating a major port. We have no basis for holding this explanation to be unreasonable. <em>Cf. </em>Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia, 53 U.S. (12 How.) 299, 311-314, 13 L.Ed. 996 (1851).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">Accordingly, we hold that Aultman was a noncompulsory pilot for the purposes of fixing the <em>respondeat </em>liability of the owner of the vessel under pilot-age. The court correctly held APL responsible for the damages sustained by the Capacon.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">Having agreed with the trial court that pilotage was noncompulsory, we come to the second issue: are the sweeping immunity provisions of the tariff of the Port of Long Beach valid ?</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">Normally, a pilot is personally liable for his own negligence, and his employers are responsible for his actions under the rules of <em>respondeat superior. See </em>G. Gilmore &amp; C. Black, <em>supra </em>at 430-32; A. Parks, Law of Tug, Tow and Pilotage 484 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">In this ease, the tariff of the Port of Long Beach provided that pilot-age services are furnished on the understanding that the pilot is acting as the servant of the vessel, and that the vessel and its owners agree not to assert any liability against the pilot, Long Beach, the Board of Harbor Commissioners, and the pilotage contractor, and to hold those parties harmless with respect to any liability arising out of the negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>gence of the pilot except such personal liability as may arise by reason of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the pilot.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> APL argues that these exculpatory provisions are void, as against public policy, and unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Sun Oil Co. v. Dalzell Towing Co., 287 U.S. 291, 53 S.Ct. 135, 77 L.Ed. 311 (1932), enforced a contractual clause very similar to the one at issue here. The clause in <em>Sun Oil </em>provided that a tug captain who piloted a vessel propelled by its own power should be considered the servant of that vessel and that the tug owners should not be liable for his negligent pilotage. 287 U.S. at 292-293, 53 S.Ct. 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Bisso v. Inland Waterways Corp., 349 U.S. 85, 75 S.Ct. 629, 99 L.Ed. 911 (1955), distinguished <em>Sun Oil, </em>and held invalid an exculpatory contract designed to relieve a tugboat owner from liability for negligent towage of a dead ship:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">\u201c * * * ii jg one thing to permit a company to exempt itself from liability for the negligence of a licensed pilot navigating another company\u2019s vessel on that vessel\u2019s own power. That was the <em>Sun Oil </em>case. It is quite a different thing, however, to permit a towing company to exempt itself by contract from all liability for its own employees\u2019 negligent towage of a vessel * * * \u201d 349 U.S. at 94, 75 S. Ct. at 634.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">APL argues, however, that the controlling distinction between Sun Oil and <em>Bisso </em>is not the difference between a live ship and a dead tow, but rather the degree of disparity in the relative bargaining positions of the parties. APL points particularly to the statement in <em>Sun Oil </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-12\">\u201c * * * Respondent had no exclusive privilege or monopoly in respect to the services that petitioner desired to have performed for its tanker. And petitioner was under no compulsion to accept the terms of respondent\u2019s pilotage clause. There is nothing to suggest that the parties were not on equal footing or that they did not deal at arm\u2019s length -X- * * \u201d 287.U.S. at 294, 53 S.Ct. at 136.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">APL concludes that, unlike the contract involved in <em>Sun Oil, </em>but like that in <em>Bis-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>so, the port\u2019s tariff here is adhesive in light of the relative bargaining positions of the parties and should be held invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">However, the exculpatory provisions of the Long Beach tariff are integrated within a pilotage scheme which we have held to be noncompulsory. APL was not forced to use a municipal pilot, and in this sense it was not compelled to accept the exculpatory provisions of the port\u2019s tariff.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Moreover, Long Beach had anticipated APL\u2019s- argument by making available to owners of piloted vessels \u201ctrip insurance\u201d at a nominal charge of $4.50 per trip in addition to the pilotage fee. A steamship company can purchase in advance insurance covering all movements of its ships within the harbors of Long Beach and Los Angeles while piloted by municipal pilots, or a shipowner can purchase insurance solely for a specific ship movement. If not arranged earlier, the ship\u2019s master or agent can request single-trip insurance from the pilot himself at the time he boards the vessel. The insurance offered covers the legal liability for negligent acts or omissions of pilots furnished by Long Beach. In effect, then, Long Beach has offered two types of pilotage \u2014 one for an uninsured passage at a fixed rate, and the other for an insured passage at a slightly higher rate. APL had a free choice between uninsured and insured pilotage, and it chose the former.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To quote from <em>Sun Oil: </em>\u201cIt would be unconscionable for petitioner upon occurrence of a mishap to repudiate the agreement upon which it obtained the service.\u201d 287 U.S. at 295, 53 S.Ct. at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Because of the voluntary nature of the pilotage, and the availability of trip insurance at a nominal cost, the provisions of the tariff of the Port of Long Beach exculpating the pilot and his employers from liability are valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\">.
