The employer questions the sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings and orders of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-17\">In our opinion an examination of the testimony, together with the inferences properly deducible therefrom, fully supports the findings and orders of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-18\">It is therefore ordered that the Order of the Board be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
