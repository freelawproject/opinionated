Appellant was sentenced to concurrent terms of ten years on the purchase count and fifteen years on the two counts pertaining to sale of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-23\">On appeal defendant-appellant\u2019s principal attack is directed at claimed error in the District Judge\u2019s refusal to quash the indictment because of asserted variances from the provisions of the Jury Selection Act of 1968, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861 et seq. (1970). Appellant claims that the voter registration list employed for the jury wheel from which the grand jury in question was chosen was not the list of persons registered to vote in the most recent state or federal general election, that the list had not been procured from the Election Commission of the City of Detroit, as provided for by the Jury Plan, and that a person who was not a federal employee, namely the sister of the jury clerk, had allegedly worked on the selection of the names to go into the jury wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-24\">On disputed but persuasive evidence, the District Court found that the voter lists which were employed were 1967 lists. The court also held that the \u201cmost recent\u201d election within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1869(c) was that of November 8, 1966. We find no error of fact or law on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-25\">As to the source of the voter list, it appears that the jury clerk procured an official list of registered Detroit'voters from the Recorder\u2019s Court of the City of Detroit rather than from the Election Commission. While this seems somewhat inappropriate to us, it does not violate the language of 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1869(c), since the lists used were \u201cofficial records\u201d which had been supplied to Recorder\u2019s Court by the \u201clocal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>election officials\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1869(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">As to the sister of the jury clerk, there is no evidence that she played any role in choosing names for the jury wheel, nor is there any hint of misconduct on her part.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867(d) (1970) provides the standard for challenging compliance with selection procedures. We find (as did the District Judge) that there was no \u201csubstantial failure to comply with the provisions\u201d of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">We have read the instances of limitation of cross-examination complained of by appellant concerning his trial and we do not find that any relevant questions were excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">Nor do we find any substance to the claim that the government withheld or destroyed evidence arguably material and which \u201cmight have led the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt about [defendant\u2019s] guilt.\u201d <em>See </em>United States v. Bryant, 142 U.S.App.D.C. 132, 439 F.2d 642 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
