Presumably, it was also to test the constitutional validity of certain Board of Regents\u2019 rules requiring co-sponsorship by an Assistant Dean of the appropriate college (here, the College of Law) for a non-campus group. No such co-sponsorship was sought or denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">The time for the meeting has long since gone by and there is no indication that there now is, or will be, a real case or controversy as to which these plaintiffs have adequate standing to challenge the co-sponsorship requirement or the need for injunctive relief. The case as posed is moot. The judgment of the District Court is therefore vacated and the case remanded to dismiss as moot so the case will not spawn any precedential consequences. United States v.
