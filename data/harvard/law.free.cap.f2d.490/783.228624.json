MILLER, Senior Circuit Judge, and TAMM and ROBB, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b858-4\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">By our opinion of July 30, 1973, 483 F.2d 1275, we found \u201cno fault with either the conclusions of the Commission or the process applied to juxtapose them,\u201d but remanded this case to the Commission \u201cto conduct whatever further proceedings it deems necessary either for the preparation and circulation of an impact statement or for preparation of a statement of reasons as to why an impact statement is unnecessary.\u201d Pursuant to this remand the Commission has issued, as of October 26, 1973, and filed with this court, its Opinion 615-B entitled: \u201cOpinion and Order in Compliance with Court Remand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Exercising the option afforded it by the court, the Commission\u2019s Opinion 615-B sets out its reasons why it feels an impact statement to be unnecessary. Petitioner challenges the adequacy and the legal sufficiency of the Commission\u2019s action on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Opinion 615-B sets forth in some detail the factual considerations which prompt its conclusion that the denial of petitioner\u2019s proposal \u201cdoes not have a \u2018significant effect on the quality of the human environment\u2019 \u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Included in these data are a series of tables and calculations relating to the sulphur dioxide emissions in the Phoenix-Tucson area over a seven-year period on a comparative basis as between the burning of oil or natural gas. Several of the tables were prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency. A table computes the percentage total of these emissions as compared to the total emissions in the study area. Other tables set forth urban frequency distribution of sulphur dioxide on an annual basis and the applicable air quality standards in the Phoenix area. In addition, the Commission considered the testimony of qualified witnesses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Measuring and evaluating the complete record and considering \u201cboth the State and Federal standards as ceilings for pollution levels,\u201d the Commission accepted testimony that its action would \u201craise the level of concentration to a mere 40% of the Federal standard.\u201d It concluded that the \u201c[djenial of El Paso\u2019s application does not significantly affect the quality of the human environment and, therefore, no detailed environmental impact statement is required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">Noting that the record encapsulated heretofore was not made in the present case, the petitioner challenges the Commission\u2019s reliance on \u201cextra record data.\u201d Petitioner argues to this court that since subsections 7(c) and (e) of the Natural Gas Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> require a hearing and record in these cases, it was deprived of \u201copportunity for cross-examination and presentation of rebuttal evidence\u201d although \u201cfundamental fairness required it.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s Brief, pages 3-6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">The factual situation is that all of the evidence considered by the Commission in this case was actually developed not in this case (Docket No. CP71-234), but in a case entitled El Paso Natural Gas Co. (Docket No. RP72-6). This latter docket related to hearings conducted by the Commission to consider, among other things, \u201cthe environmental impact of burning an almost identical amount of oil, as a substitute for natural gas, in the Phoenix-Tucson area.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Petitioner was a party to the RP72-6 proceedings, </em>offered evidence and had full opportunity to participate in the hearings. Under these circumstances \u2014 embracing identity of parties, identity of issues and full opportunity for participation \u2014 we do not believe that the use of extra record data either deprives petitioner of any legally-recognized right, or constitutes a deprivation of fundamental fairness. The cases cit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>ed and discussed on this point are readily distinguishable from the present factual situation and our research has not disclosed reported cases which may be cited as authority for petitioner\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Petitioner also charges that the Commission \u201cignored relevant portions of the Docket RP72-6 record and misconstrued other parts.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 9-21. Our review of the record does not convince us that there was any element of arbitrariness or capriciousness in the treatment of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">The court finds that the Commission, by Opinion 615-B, has adequately established by competent evidence that an environmental impact statement is not legally required in this case. The court further finds that the Commission\u2019s action did not deprive petitioner of any procedural or \u201cfairness\u201d right, nor were its conclusions bottomed upon arbitrary or capricious considerations or treatment of the evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-8\">.
