After a non-jury trial he was found not guilty of importing, but guilty of possessing the 264 pounds of marijuana found in the truck, with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The sole question on defendant\u2019s appeal is the legality of the warrantless search.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-25\">The same hiatus in the surveillance between the vehicle\u2019s apparently lawful entry from Mexico (at 2:30 PM) and its apprehension and the discovery of the marijuana (at 6:30 PM) which required a finding of not guilty on the importation count, makes frivolous the government\u2019s claim that the \u201csearch was the functional equivalent of a border search.\u201d We merely note, in passing, that this is not a case of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>short hiatus after suspicion had been aroused. <em>See, e. g., </em>Alexander v. United States, 362 F.2d 379 (9th Cir. 1966), cert, denied, 385 U.S. 977, 87 S.Ct. 519, 17 L.Ed.2d 439; Leeks v. United States, 356 F.2d 470 (9th Cir. 1966). Even less supportable is the government\u2019s extraordinary assertion that the \u201cplain sight\u201d doctrine embraces objects revealed only as a result of entering the truck and lifting a plywood floorboard. It is conceded that until the plywood was raised, exposing a false compartment, no evidence of marijuana was noted, even by smell. As the Court has said many times, the plain view doctrine is applicable only when there has been no prior unjustified intrusion. <em>See, e. g., </em>discussion in Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">We turn, therefore, to the district court\u2019s finding that the search was supported by probable cause. The facts are these. At about 4:30 PM on the day in question one Fern\u00e1n, a Border Patrol agent was informed by a previously demonstrated reliable informant that a truck, which he pointed out to him parked across the street from the Customs Agency in Calexico, California, had marijuana concealed in a false compartment in the body bed. If the informant gave Fern\u00e1n any explanation, source or basis for this information, the government failed to introduce it. Fern\u00e1n reported by telephone to Walker, a Customs special agent. The precise nature of what was said is important. According to Walker, the sole testifier, the \u201cinformant indicated that there was a false compartment in the bed of this vehicle, and that it contained an unknown quantity of marijuana.\u201d We cannot take Walker\u2019s word \u201cindicated\u201d as meaning pointed out the compartment as distinguished from merely stating it existed, because in the sentence almost immediately preceding Walker had used the word \u201cindicated\u201d as clearly meaning by word of mouth. It is true that there were visible plywood boards over the compartment, but no witness suggested that a plywood flooring in a pick-up truck was unusual or suspicious. Even the government did not claim that the testimony of agent Salinas of seeing the compartment after the flooring was removed, or the snapshots then taken, suggested that it was previously visible. Nor do we so construe the record. The burden is on the government, and if we were to draw any inference, it would be that there would be no point in having a false compartment if its existence was apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Having seen the truck, Fern\u00e1n obviously was able to describe it accurately. Walker went to the window and looked out, but the truck had gone. A general call was sent out. At 6:30 PM a truck meeting the description stopped of the driver\u2019s own accord at a then closed highway checkpoint to clean the windshield. Some fortuitously present government agents recognized it, effected the search, and arrested the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The government asserts that the fact the informant was of proven reliability is all that was needed to establish probable cause for the search. While support may be found for this view, e. <em>g., </em>Costello v. United States, 324 F.2d 260 (9th Cir. 1963), cert, denied, 376 U.S. 930, 84 S.Ct. 699, 11 L.Ed.2d 650, it is now clear that, as the court said in United States v. Davis, 461 F.2d 1026, at 1033 (3rd Cir. 1972), there is a \u201ctwo-pronged\u201d test. It is necessary to make some showing of the validity of the conclusions made by the reliable informant. Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 416, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969); Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 114, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964). This aspect can be satisfied by evidence of \u201csome underlying circumstances\u201d warranting the informant\u2019s conclusions in the particular instance, Travis v. United States, 362 F.2d 477, at 479 (9th Cir. 1966), cert, denied, 385 U. S. 885, 87 S.Ct. 179, 17 L.Ed.2d 113, or by corroboration of his information from other sources, Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1958); <em>see </em>Whiteley v. Warden, 401 U.S. 560, 567, 91 S.Ct. 1031, 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>L.Ed.2d 306 (1971); or, perhaps, by the information itself if it is so detailed as to be inherently reliable. Thus in Draper v. United States, ante, where the informant not only described the suspect, but stated that he would be arriving by train from Chicago carrying a brown satchel, the Court considered the subsequent fulfillment of this prophecy to be sufficient corroboration of the informant\u2019s statement that the suspect would be carrying contraband. The probative significance of this subsequent event was noted in Spinelli v. United States, ante, 393 U.S. at 416-417, 89 S.Ct. 584. In the case at bar all the government had was a statement supported by nothing that was not open and obvious to anyone. We know of no case suggesting that this is enough. <em>Cf. </em>Whiteley v. Warden, ante, rejecting informer\u2019s un-amplified \u201ctip\u201d that described individuals, in a described car, had stolen gold coins.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Finally, the government, in keeping with its other views in this case, offers as an alternative ground the fact \u201cthe information provided was verified.\u201d It is hornbook law that ex post facto verification does not satisfy the Fourth Amendment. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L. Ed.2d 441 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b675-6\">CHOY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AdL\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">I respectfully dissent. I would sustain as not clearly erroneous the district court\u2019s factual finding that there was probable cause for the warrantless search. Costello v. United States, 324 F.2d 260, 261 (9th Cir. 1963), cert, denied, 376 U.S. 390, 84 S.Ct. 699, 11 L. Ed.2d 650 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Not only was the informant of proven reliability, but also his information was corroborated by government agents (Fern\u00e1n and Salinas) before Agent Salinas made any attempt to lift the ply-board sheet covering the false compartment in the pickup truck-bed to smell the marijuana. The corroborative facts preceding the search and the reasonable inferences therefrom are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-10\">The well-described truck, which the informant indicated had a false compartment in its bed containing a quantity of marijuana, was parked where the informant said it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-11\">The plyboard cover to the false compartment in the open truckbed was clearly visible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-12\">Fern\u00e1n inspected the truck where it was originally parked and saw the false cover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-13\">Salinas saw the plyboard cover and recognized it as covering the false compartment before he raised it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">I find this case indistinguishable from Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1958). I would not second guess the district judge and say he was clearly erroneous. We are concerned here with whether there was probable cause to search, not with whether a prima facie case to convict for possession of 264 pounds of marijuana was established before Salinas made the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
