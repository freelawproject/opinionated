Helms, appeals from a judgment of the district court denying a refund of estate taxes. The district court ruled that Mrs. Helms\u2019 gross estate included prop-, erty valued at approximately $88,000 because she held a general power of appointment with respect to it. A sense of unfairness casts a shadow over this case, and others of its kind,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because Mrs. Helms never exercised the power, and a change in its phrasing might well have accomplished its purpose without subjecting her estate to additional taxes. Nevertheless, the Revenue Act, Treasury Regulations, and judicial precedent dictate affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-15\">Mrs. Helms\u2019 husband, Thomas W. Helms, died in 1967 at the age of 85, survived by his wife and their daughter, Edna Helms Simms. Mrs. Helms died six months later, at the age of 84. Mr. Helms wrote his own will. The second paragraph provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-16\">\u201cAll my stock and holdings in the Helms Self Service Market Corporation, T. W. Helms Land Development Corporation, Grand View Hotel Corporation, I leave to my beloved wife, Mary E. Helms, for her comfort and care so long as she may live. It shall be her right to dispose, sell, trade or use said holdings during her lifetime for her comfort and care as she may see fit. At her death, all of the said holdings, if any, are to go to my daughter, Edna Helms Simms, to have and to hold as she may so decide.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-17\">The stock of the store corporation was valued at $88,000, but the stock in the other corporations had no value.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-18\">All the family, including Mrs. Simms and her children, had worked in Mr. Helms\u2019 store. They lived frugally, invested their earnings, and Mr. and Mrs. Helms accumulated jointly held property worth $305,000. In addition, from the proceeds of insurance policies, and as residuary legatee of her husband\u2019s estate, Mrs. Heljns received cash and miscellaneous property aggregating some $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Section 2041 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2041 (1970)], dealing with powers of appointment, governs taxation of the stock.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsection (a)(2) includes as a part of the decedent\u2019s gross estate the value of property over which the decedent had a general power of appointment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsection (b)(1) defines a general power of appointment to include a power which is exercisable in favor of the decedent,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but with this important exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">\u201cA power to consume, invade, or appropriate property for the benefit of the decedent which is limited by an ascertainable standard relating to the health, education, support, or maintenance of the decedent shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Thus, the issue to be resolved is whether the power to sell the stock and spend the proceeds conferred on Mrs. Helms by her husband\u2019s will was limited to an ascertainable standard relating to her health, support, or maintenance within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The government claims that the value of the stock must be included in Mrs. Helms\u2019 estate because she could sell it and spend the proceeds for things not related to her health, support, or maintenance. The administrator, on the other hand, contends that Mrs. Helms did not receive a general power of appointment because (1), her right to consume the property for her comfort and care is limited by state law to the frugal life to which she was accustomed \u2014 a standard of living that tolerated expenditures only for health, support, or maintenance, and (2) state law would give effect to an inference that Mr. Helms intended Mrs. Helms to use the stock for her support only after she had consumed her other ample resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">Mrs. Helms\u2019 power to dispose of the stock is measured by state law. Whether her power, as defined by state law, is subject to the federal tax must be determined by federal law. Morgan v. Commissioner, 309 U.S. 78, 60 S.Ct. 424, 84 L.Ed. 585 (1940). Therefore, Mr. Helms\u2019 will must first be examined in the light of Virginia law to determine the nature and extent of Mrs. Helms\u2019 \u201cright to dispose, sell, trade, or use [the stock] during her lifetime for her comfort and care as she may see fit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">Virginia formerly held that a life estate coupled with the absolute power of disposition created a fee simple estate invalidating the remainder. May v. Joynes, 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 692 (1871). This rule obviously could defeat a testator\u2019s intent, and, therefore, a statute was enacted to validate the remainder to the extent that the life tenant had not disposed of it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statute, however, does not restrict the life tenant\u2019s power of disposition. The most re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>cent Virginia case explaining the nature of a life tenancy coupled with a power of sale is Rawlings v. Briscoe, 214 Va. 44, 197 S.E.2d 211 (1973), which involved the construction of a will that created a life estate in the residue of the testator\u2019s property with a remainder over to designated beneficiaries. The will authorized the life tenant \u201cto sell any or all of the said residue at her discretion and use any part of the principal thereof that may be necessary for her care and maintenance.\u201d The life tenant gave a substantial portion of the property to her grandchild. After the life tenant died, the gift to the grandchild was challenged on the ground that the life tenant was empowered to sell the property and to use the proceeds only if necessary for her care and maintenance. The Supreme Court of Virginia rejected this interpretation of the will. Upholding the gift to the grandchild, the Court ruled that the life tenant\u2019s authority to sell the property at her discretion gave \u201cher absolute dominion over the subject property with full power of disposition.\u201d The Court added that the language concerning her \u201ccare and maintenance\u201d merely expressed a motive for the devise and did not limit her power to dispose of the property. This decision, we conclude, establishes that Mrs. Helms\u2019 \u201cright to dispose, sell, trade or use [the stock] during her lifetime for her comfort and care as she may see fit\u201d was not limited by state law to an aseertainable standard relating to her health, support, or maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Hughes v. Williams, 99 Va. 312, 38 S. E. 138 (1901), on which Mrs. Helms\u2019 administrator relies, does not furnish authority for limiting Mrs. Helms\u2019 right to dispose of the stock. That case dealt with the discretion allowed a trustee in expending the principal of a trust to provide necessary supplies for the comfort of the beneficiaries, but it does not define the rights of a life tenant who possesses the power of sale. The Virginia Court has shown no disposition to treat these situations similarly. Nor do we find in state law any implied restriction on Mrs. Helms\u2019 right to sell the stock because she had other resources. Moreover, the Treasury Regulations make a restriction of this kind immaterial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">In the absence of Virginia law limiting Mrs. Helms\u2019 power to consume the proceeds from the sale of the stock to an ascertainable standard relating to her health, support, or maintenance, the value of the stock must be included in her gross estate. While the power to consume need not be limited to the bare necessities of life, the Regulations specifically state: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>This narrow interpretation of the exemption from taxation found in \u00a7 2041(b)(1)(A) has been generally followed when the appointee could exercise the power to provide for his comfort.

United States, 387 F.2d 866 (3rd Cir. 1968) (expenses incidental to her comfort and well-being); Cf. Strite v. McGinnes, 330 F.2d 234, 239 (3rd Cir. 1964) (benefit or comfort); Stafford v.
