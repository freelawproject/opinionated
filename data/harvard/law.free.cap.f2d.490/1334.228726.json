KAUFMAN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AYbR\">A mere glimpse into the multifarious financial manipulations of Robert Vesco reveals a web of corporate and personal transactions of astonishing intricacy. Although the appellants before us do not include Mr. Vesco, himself, who we note parenthetically has refused to return to the Southern District of New York<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and seems to be safely ensconced in Nassau, the Bahamian capital, beyond the reach of the United States,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we cannot ignore his pervasive presence in the litigation which precipitated these appeals. Having allegedly utilized appellee International Controls Corp. [ICC] as a financial source and vehicle for his purported securities manipulations, Vesco, and his individual and corporate associates, have now become the objects of ICC\u2019s strenuous efforts to recover whatever assets remain \u2014 assets ranging from, (1), a Boeing 707 aircraft, owned by appellant Skyways Leasing Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of appellant Fairfield Aviation Corp., in turn wholly-owned by appellant Fairfield General Corp. [Fairfield Group], to (2), 846,380 shares of ICC common stock transferred by Vesco and his children to appellant Vesco &amp; Co., Inc. [Vesco &amp; Co.], to (3), a pleasure yacht, the Patricia III, which, although used exclusively by Vesco and his family, is claimed by intervenor-appellant Andean Credit S.A. [Andean]. Thus, we are asked by appellants Fair-field Group, Vesco &amp; Co., and Andean, in three separate appeals, to review the propriety of preliminary injunctions issued by Judge Stewart restraining the disposition of these various assets claimed by ICC, injunctions which, with some modification, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-14\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"aix-dedup-0\">On November 27, 1972, the Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] filed a complaint in the Southern District of New York, SEC v. Vesco et al., 72 Civ. 5001, against 42 individual and corporate defendants<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging a scheme of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>extraordinary magnitude, deviousness, and ingenuity in violation primarily of the anti-fraud provision of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 [1934 Act], Section 10(b) (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b)), and Rule 10b-5 (17 CFR \u00a7 240.10b-5). In brief, the SEC charged that Robert Vesco masterminded and, with his cohorts, implemented a plan involving the manipulation of the assets and securities of a number of corporations controlled by Vesco including ICC, also a defendant in this SEC suit. In the course of this purported scheme, Vesco and his group were alleged to have defrauded the public investors in ICC, as well as investors in four mutual funds, managed by subsidiaries of IOS, Ltd., a corporation which had been acquired by ICC, through the creation of a number of corporate entities and the subsequent transfer to these corporations of the assets of ICC and the mutual funds. The SEC asserted that as a result of this elaborate shell game, clothed in the garb of securities transactions, Vesco and others had secured control of over $200 million deposited in banks located in countries ranging geographically from Luxembourg to Costa Rica. The complaint closed with a prayer for permanent injunctive relief against future violations and a demand that receivers be appointed for several defendant corporate vehicles, including ICC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-8\">On March 16, 1973, ICC, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission\u2019s complaint, consented to the entry of final judgment against it in the SEC action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to this consent judgment, ICC was permanently enjoined from future violations of the Securities Exchange Act. Judge Stewart further ordered that, in lieu of the appointment of a receiver sought by the SEC, a Special Counsel and a new interim board of directors be appointed by the Court to represent ICC. The order provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-9\">Special Counsel shall have the power and be directed to (inter alia):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-10\">(b) take all appropriate action, including but not limited to, the institution and prosecution of suits on behalf of International Controls to recover all assets or monies improperly used, taken, wasted, misappropriated, dispensed, obligated or paid to anyone (i) without appropriate authorization, approval or ratification of the board of directors of International Controls or (ii) in breach of duties owed to defendant International Controls or its subsidiaries by present or former officers, directors or employees of International Controls or any other person. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>The Special Counsel shall consult with plaintiff Commission and the board of directors of International Controls in the resolution of all claims International Controls may have. He shall neither decline to pursue any claim . nor settle any claims against the recommendation of plaintiff Commission and without the approval of this Court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1414-4\">(d) pending the investigation and accounting by the Special Counsel, he shall take immediate, necessary or appropriate action to protect International Controls\u2019 claims, interests and rights and pursue all possible claims against the defendants herein or any other persons including, but not limited to, the commencement of legal proceedings to prevent the dissipation or flight of any funds or other assets, the placing of a stop transfer order on securities beneficially owned or controlled by said defendants and/or the institution of appropriate action to freeze and preserve the assets of said defendants or others who may be obligated to International Controls.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1414-5\">The order also provided that the newly-appointed board of directors \u201cshall replace the existing board of directors of International Controls, and shall have full power under applicable corporate law to conduct the affairs of International Controls in conjunction with the Special Counsel. . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-6\">Given this mandate, Special Counsel David Butowsky, on June 7, 1973, filed a complaint on behalf of ICC against 32 individual and corporate defendants,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 22 of whom were defendants in the pending SEC action, and 10 of whom, including Veseo &amp; Co. and the Fairfield Group were not. The complaint contained eleven \u201ccounts\u201d alleging various violations of the 1934 Act, principally of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and charged fraud, self-dealing, waste of corporate assets and breach of fiduciary duty. Much of the complaint paralleled the SEC\u2019s charges of securities manipulation by Vesco and his associates at the expense of ICC and its stockholders. The Fairfield Group, the ICC complaint alleged, had been the vehicle for the diversion of ICC\u2019s assets in the form of a Boeing 707 aircraft, purchased and leased to ICC 'by Skyways at a time when Skyways was a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICC. ICC charged also that Vesco had caused ICC to spend over $1 million in refurbishing the plane, including the installation of a discotheque and sauna for Vesco\u2019s private use, and that Vesco and certain other directors of ICC had fraudulently induced the remaining ICC directors to approve a dividend in kind of ICC\u2019s stock in the Fairfield Group, thereby establishing the Fair-field Group as corporate entities independent of ICC. Appellant Vesco &amp; Co. was referred to in the complaint only once and quite simply as \u201ca Delaware corporation to which defendant Vesco and his children have transferred certain of their assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-9\">Since Robert L. Vesco, the principal orchestrator of the alleged fraud, had already fled the United States and resisted efforts to induce him to return, ICC moved quickly to prevent the dissipation of assets to which it would be entitled if its lawsuit should be successful. Accordingly, ICC first obtained temporary restraining orders and then, on July 3, 1973, secured preliminary injunctions against Veseo &amp; Co. and the Fairfield Group. Veseo &amp; Co. was enjoined from disposing of the 846,380 shares of ICC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>common stock and from prosecuting a pending state court derivative suit instituted by Vesco &amp; Co. on behalf of ICC against certain former and current directors of ICC. The Fairfield Group was similarly enjoined from selling the Boeing 707 and from prosecuting two actions against ICC, filed in New Jersey Superior Court, for failure to continue payments under the Boeing 707 lease between ICC and Skyways, and to recover books and records of the Fairfield Group in the possession of ICC. Finally, after ICC had secured a temporary restraining order against Vesco restraining the removal from its Miami berth of the yacht, Patricia III, used and allegedly owned by Vesco, the appellant in the third appeal before us, Andean Credit, intervened, claiming ownership of the yacht and seeking, therefore, to have the temporary restraining order dissolved. After an evidentiary hearing before Judge Stewart, the temporary restraining order ripened into a preliminary injunction, issued October 5, 1973, restraining Andean from removing the yacht from its berth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-5\">Having sketched the broad outlines of the litigation resulting from Vesco\u2019s extraordinarily complex manipulations, and which spawned the three appeals before us, we can now turn to the specific claims asserted by each appellant. Although of common origin, each appeal rests on factual and legal contentions sufficiently different to warrant separate discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-6\">II. THE FAIRFIELD GROUP APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-7\">The factual basis for the preliminary injunction issued against the Fairfield Group is not disputed. Thus, Judge Stewart did not find it necessary to hold an evidentiary hearing as a predicate to granting injunctive relief. <em>See </em>SEC v. Frank, 388 F.2d 486 (2d Cir. 1968). On its part, ICC filed four affidavits in support of its motion: (1) by David Bu-towsky, Special Counsel; (2) by Allen Shinn, a court-appointed director and President of ICC; (3) by Laurence B. Richardson, Jr., former President, Chief Operating Officer and director of ICC; (4) by Malcolm McAlpin, a former director of ICC. In response, the Fair-field Group submitted an affidavit by Joel M. Grady, President of Skyways and Fairfield Aviation, Executive Vice President of Fairfield General, and a director of all three corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-10\">Our examination<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of these affidavits reveals the following salient facts. On June 15, 1971, Skyways, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fairfield Aviation, which, in turn, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICC, purchased a Boeing 707 jet aircraft from Pan American World Airways, Inc. for $1,375,000. Thereafter, on October 1, 1971, Skyways leased the plane to ICC for a five-year period for an approximate gross rental of $3,500,000. This lease also provided that, upon five days notice, Skyways could terminate the lease should it desire to sell the aircraft and that all improvements to the aircraft would remain the property of Skyways. This lease was not submitted to the board of directors of ICC for approval until December 8, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-11\">During the six-month period from June to December 1971, ICC spent $600,000-$700,000 to refurbish the plane. These improvements, however, were not of the sort generally associated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>with business purposes but rather, suited the personal comforts, conveniences and zest for living of the primary user of the 707, Vesco.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\">On November 19, 1971, ICC incorporated Fairfield General as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Subsequently, on December 8, 1971, at a board of directors meeting crucial to the alleged fraud, the ICC board first approved the transfer of ICC\u2019s Fairfield Aviation stock to Fair-field General, in return for additional stock in Fairfield General and second, voted to issue all of the Fairfield General stock to the shareholders of ICC as a dividend in kind. Both Richardson and McAlpin, members of the board of directors on December 8, stated in their affidavits that, at the time of this meeting, they had not been informed either of the improvement expenditures or of the termination and ownership of improvements provisions of the Boeing 707 lease and, had they known of these facts, they would' not have approved the dividend of the Fairfield General stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-5\">Based on the foregoing facts, ICC claims in its complaint that it was fraudulently deprived of the Boeing 707 aircraft since, as a result of the spin-off of Fairfield General and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Fairfield Aviation and Skyways, that asset is no longer under its control. Moreover, in exacerbation of this loss, ICC contends that it remains obligated to Skyways under the onerous 707.lease. ICC claims that the motive for the spin-off was Veseo\u2019s concern that he might lose control over ICC and, as a consequence, be forced to relinquish his personal use of the 707. Accordingly, to foreclose that eventuality, Vesco sought to shelter the aircraft in a corporate shell free from ICC\u2019s control, a corporation such as Fairfield General in which all of the directors were Vesco associates.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ICC concludes its complaint by praying, <em>inter alia, </em>that the fraudulently induced dividend of Fairfield General stock be declared null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-6\">The Fairfield Group responded by filing a motion to dismiss the complaint, asserting a lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the 1934 Act. They urged that while ICC may have stated a claim of internal corporate mismanagement, it had not stated or proved a claim cognizable under Section 10(b), the only section of the 1934 Act relied on by ICC, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Absent subject matter jurisdiction under the 1934 Act, moreover, the Fairfield Group contended that the suit must be dismissed as to them because, as New Jersey corporations doing no business in New York, service of process could only be valid under the provision for nationwide service of process, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa, if the 1934 Act were applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-7\">A. <em>Subject Matter Jurisdiction Under Section 10(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-9\">Section 10 of the 1934 Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1416-10\">It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1416-11\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1416-12\">(b) To use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1416-13\">Rule 10b-5 of the Commission provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1416-14\">It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1417-5\">(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact \u2022 necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1417-6\">(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1417-7\">in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-8\">It is now well-settled that the failure or refusal of a majority of a board of directors to disclose to the remaining directors pertinent information, as Richardson and McAlpin claimed was the case concerning the dividend of Fairfield General stock, constitutes a \u201cfraud\u201d upon ICC within the meaning of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Ruckle v. Roto American Corp., 339 F.2d 24 (2d Cir. 1964). The critical question remains, however, whether that \u201cfraud\u201d was perpetrated on ICC \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\u201d Haberman v. Murchison, 468 F.2d 1305 (2d Cir. 1972); Iroquois Industries, Inc. v. Syracuse China Corp., 417 F.2d 963 (2d Cir. 1969), cert, denied, 399 U.S. 909, 90 S.Ct. 2199, 26 L.Ed.2d 561 (1970); Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., 193 F.2d 461 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 343 U.S. 956, 72 S.Ct. 1051, 96 L.Ed. 1356 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-11\">ICC contends that its exchange of Fairfield Aviation stock for Fairfield General stock constituted the requisite \u201csale.\u201d Although the definition of \u201csale\u201d under the 1934 Act is indeed a broad one \u2014 including \u201cany contract to sell or otherwise dispose of\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(14)) \u2014 we cannot agree that by transferring its ownership of Fairfield Aviation to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Fairfield General, ICC in any sense \u201cdisposed of\u201d its Fairfield Aviation stock. Quite simply, as long as ICC retained sole ownership of Fairfield General, it retained complete control over Fairfield Aviation and thus relinquished nothing in the exchange. Accordingly, that self-dealing transaction does not appear to satisfy the \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d requirement of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10(b)-5. <em>Cf. </em>Blau v. Mission Corp., 212. F.2d 77, 80 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 347 U.S. 1016, 74 S.Ct. 872, 98 L.Ed. 1138 (1954); <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In re Penn Central Securities Litigation, 347 F.Supp. 1327, 1333-1339 (E.D.Pa.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-13\">ICC also suggests that its dividend in kind of the Fairfield General stock represented a \u201csale\u201d under the relevant statute and rule. It urges us to follow a recent line of cases holding that such subsidiary spin-offs constitute \u201csales\u201d for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933 [1933 Act], 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77a et seq., thus requiring a registration statement to be filed covering the subsidiary\u2019s shares, as in fact Fairfield General did file in this instance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> SEC v. Datronics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>Engineers, Inc., 490 F.2d 250 (4th Cir. 1973), petition for cert, filed, 42 U.S.L.W.L.Rep. \u00b6 94,334, 3388 (U.S. Dec. 27, 1973) (No. 1011); SEC v. Stern-Haskell Inc., [Current Volume] CCH Fed.Sec.L.Rep. \u00b6 94,065 (S.D.N.Y.1973); SEC v. Harwyn Industries Corp., 326 F.Supp. 943 (S.D.N.Y.1971). Although each of these cases involved the 1933 Act definition of \u201csale,\u201d a definition which explicitly requires that the \u201cdisposition\u201d be \u201cfor value,\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> each cited case rested on facts wholly inapposite to the instant one. In each instance, the court held that the parent corporation had received \u201cvalue\u201d or consideration for the \u201cdisposition\u201d of its subsidiary through the creation of a public market in the subsidiary\u2019s shares, an \u201caftermarket\u201d which substantially increased the value of the spun-off subsidiary\u2019s shares r\u00e9tained by the parent corporation or by the insiders in control of the parent. In contrast, the thrust of ICC\u2019s complaint is that it was fraudulently induced to part with its subsidiary, bearing with it a very valuable asset in the form of a Boeing 707 aircraft, without receiving aiiy value whatsoever.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In short, we do not believe that ICC can find comfort in the <em>Harwyn </em>line of cases for the proposition that its spin-off of Fairfield General constituted a \u201csale\u201d under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-5\">Finding the analogy to <em>Harwyn </em>and its progeny inapt, we searched, but in vain, for a precedential response to the precise question whether a dividend of portfolio securities might satisfy the \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d requirement of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Our attention, of course, was directed to the seminal case construing \u201cpurchase\u201d and \u201csale\u201d in the context of \u00a7 16(b) of the 1934 Act, Shaw v. Dreyfus, 172 F.2d 140 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 337 U.S. 907, 69 S.Ct. 1048, 93 L.Ed. 1719 (1949). In <em>Shaw, </em>a divided panel of this Court held that the receipt of stock rights, essentially analogous to a stock dividend because issued on a pro rata basis to all shareholders, did not constitute a \u201cpurchase\u201d of those rights by the stockholders. Although apprised of the broad definitional language of \u201cpurchase\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and \u201csale\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> under .the 1934 Act, we declined to interpret the term \u201cpurchase\u201d to include any \u201cacquisition\u201d or the term \u201csale\u201d to include any \u201cdisposition.\u201d Instead, over the sharp dissent of Judge Clark, the majority stated that a \u201cpurchase\u201d or \u201csale\u201d meant an acquisition or disposition <em>for consideration. </em>Thus, <em>Shaw </em>held that since the shareholder recipients of the stock rights had not given the corporation any quid pro quo in return for these rights, their acquisition was not a \u201cpurchase,\u201d and there was no liability under \u00a7 16(b) for any profit on their subsequent, short-swing sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-10\">The Fairfield Group strenuously argues that our decision in <em>Shaw </em>governs the instant case. They contend that the ICC dividend in kind of the Fairfield General securities is identical with the rights distribution in <em>Shaw </em>be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>cause both were distributed on a pro rata basis to all stockholders and neither required any payment by the recipient shareholders in return. Without in any way questioning the soundness of our decision in <em>Shaw, </em>we do not find it determinative, for we are mindful of the following words of caution uttered in a remarkably similar context by the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1418-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>The terms \u201csale\u201d and \u201csell\u201d each include any contract to sell or otherwise dispose of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>Although the interdependence of the various sections of the securities laws is certainly a relevant factor in any interpretation of the language Congress has chosen, ordinary rules of statutory construction still apply. The meaning of particular phrases must be determined in context, SEC v. C. M. Joiner Leasing Corp., 320 U.S. 344, 350-351 [64 S.Ct. 120, 123-124, 88 L.Ed. 88] (1943). Congress itself has cautioned that the same words may take on a different coloration in different sections of the securities laws; both the 1933 and the 1934 Acts preface their lists of general definitions with the phrase \u201cunless the context otherwise requires.\u201d 1933 Act, \u00a7 2, 48 Stat. 74, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b; 1934 Act, \u00a7 3, 48 Stat. 882, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c. We must therefore address ourselves to the meaning of the words \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d in the context of \u00a7 10(b). Whatever these or similar words may mean in the numerous other contexts in which they appear in the securities laws, only this one narrow question is presented here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1419-6\">SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 466, 89 S.Ct. 564, 571, 21 L.Ed.2d 668 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-7\"> We must, therefore, in accordance with the teaching of <em>National Securities, </em>consider whether the fraudulent conduct alleged, in this case the withholding of information pertinent to the issuance of a portfolio security dividend, \u201cis the type of fraudulent behavior which was meant to be forbidden by the statute and the rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>393 U.S. at 467, 89 S.Ct. at 572. In seeking to effectuate the purpose of \u00a7 10(b), we recognize that it \u201cmust be read flexibly,not technically and restrictively.\u201d Supt. of Insurance v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co., 404 U.S. 6, 12, 92 S.Ct. 165, 169, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971). Moreover, the Court, in <em>Bankers Life, </em>emphasized that \u00a7 10(b) was intended by Congress to protect investors, including corporations, from deceptive devices and contrivances which would inhibit informed decision-making in the course of securities transactions. And, the Court quoted with approval the following language from Shell v. Hensley, 430 F.2d 819, 827 (5th Cir. 1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-10\">When a person who is dealing with a corporation in a securities transaction denies the corporation\u2019s directors access to material information known to him, the corporation is disabled from availing itself of an informed judgment on the part of its board regarding the merits of the transaction. In this situation the private right of action recognized under Rule 10b-5 is available as a remedy for the corporate disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1419-11\">Supt. of Insurance v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co., <em>supra, </em>404 U.S. at 13, 92 S.Ct. at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-12\">In light of this umbrella of protection placed over securities transactions by \u00a7 10(b), we are of the view that ICC must be deemed to be a \u201cseller\u201d of its Fairfield General stock at the time it disposed of its Fairfield General portfolio securities by way of a dividend in kind to its shareholders. The decision whether to retain or spin-off a subsidiary is indeed an important one for the parent corporation. The possible asset drain must be weighed against such considerations as the desirability of removing the blight of an unprofitable subsidiary from the consolidated income statistics reported to the public. In any event, it is a transaction involving, as it unquestionably does, the disposition of securities and, therefore, one for which the corporation is well deserving of and entitled to the protection of \u00a7 10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>Nor do we believe, as our dissenting brother suggests, that because ICC\u2019s shareholders were not required to part with consideration in return for the dividend of Fairfield General portfolio stock, the transaction was beyond the purview of \u00a7 10(b). By thus focusing on the absence of harm to the recipient shareholders, the dissent simply ignores the fact that the statute was intended to safeguard not only the shareholders of a defrauded corporation, but its creditors as well. The Court noted in <em>Bankers Life, id. </em>at 12, 92 S.Ct. at 169:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-4\">. the fact that creditors of the defrauded corporate buyer or seller of securities may be the ultimate victims does not warrant disregard of the corporate entity. The controlling stockholder [Vesco in this instance] owes the corporation a fiduciary obligation \u2014 one \u201cdesigned for the protection of the entire community of interests in the corporation \u2014 creditors as well as stockholders.\u201d Pepper v. Litton, 308 U.S. 295, 307 [60 S.Ct. 238, 245, 84 L.Ed. 281].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1420-5\">And, to be sure, the creditors of ICC may be significantly and adversely affected when the asset base of the corporation is eroded by a portfolio security dividend.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1420-6\">We therefore reject our dissenting brother\u2019s paean to literalness in construing the term \u201csale\u201d to require the passage of consideration in order to inject the requisite significance into the disposition of securities. Learned Hand wisely counselled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-10\">Of course it is true that the words used, even in their literal sense, are the primary, and ordinarily the most reliable, source of interpreting the meaning of any writing: be it a statute, a contract, or anything else. But it is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary; but to remember that statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to their meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1420-11\">Cabell v. Markham, 148 F.2d 737, 739 (2d Cir. 1945). Accordingly, although in other -contexts the term \u201csale\u201d might appropriately be construed more narrowly,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we find a rote emphasis on consideration inconsistent with the broad scope of protection under \u00a7 10(b) for those who engage in transactions eventuating in the acquisition or disposition of securities.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1420-12\">B. <em>The Venue Question</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1420-13\">The Fairfield Group asserts a second jurisdictional defect in this action, contending that venue was improp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>erly laid in the Southern District of New York. This argument merits short shrift. The applicable provision of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1421-5\">Any suit or action to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or rules and regulations thereunder . may be brought in any [district wherein any act or transaction constituting the violation occurred]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">In this case, ICC claims that a \u00a7 10(b) violation occurred when it was fraudulently induced to spin-off its Fairfield General subsidiary. An essential element of that fraudulent scheme was the actual mailing of the spin-off dividend to the ICC shareholders. It is uneontro-verted that the mailing was performed by ICC\u2019s transfer agent, the Marine Midland Bank, from its offices in Manhattan. Accordingly, since \u201cany use of instrumentalities of the mails or other interstate facilities made within the forum district constituting an important step in [the] consummation [of the fraudulent scheme] is sufficient\u201d, Hooper v. Mountain States Securities Corp., 282 F.2d 195, 204-205 (5th Cir. 1960), cert, denied, 365 U.S. 814, 81 S.Ct. 695, 5 L.Ed.2d 693 (1961), venue in the Southern District of New York is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-8\">C. <em>The Preliminary Injunction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1421-9\">With these jurisdictional hurdles behind us, we have little difficulty in affirming the preliminary injunction insofar as it restrains the Fair-field Group from disposing of the Boeing 707. Although an extraordinary remedy, a preliminary injunction is properly granted to preserve the status quo <em>pendente lite </em>where the balance of hardships tips decidedly toward the party requesting the temporary relief and that party has raised questions going to the merits so serious, substantial, and difficult as to make them a fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation. Sonesta International Hotels Corp. v. Wellington Associates, 483 F.2d 247, 250 (2d Cir. 1973); Checker Motors Corp. v. Chrysler Corp., 405 F.2d 319, 323 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 394 U.S. 999, 89 S.Ct. 1595, 22 L.Ed.2d 777 (1969); Hamilton Watch Co. v. Benrus Watch Co., 206 F.2d 738, 740 (2d Cir. 1953). ICC has easily satisfied both requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-13\">Richardson and McAlpin, both former directors of ICC, have stated in their affidavits that information material to their decision to approve the spin-off of Fairfield General was withheld from them. Although raising an interesting application of the fraud provisions under \u00a7 10(b), these uncontroverted statements certainly present \u201ca fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1421-14\">That the balance of hardships tips decidedly in favor of ICC cannot fairly be questioned. It appears from the record that the Boeing 707 is now<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the sole substantial asset owned by Fairfield General or its subsidiaries. Its sale might well result in the dissipation of an important asset, leaving little for ICC to recapture if it should eventually succeed in this lawsuit. We have recognized that an asset freeze may be appropriate to assure compensation to those who are victims of a securities fraud. SEC v. Manor Nursing Centers, Inc., 458 F.2d 1082, 1105-1106 (2d Cir. 1972). Moreover, Judge Stewart has narrowly fashioned the injunctive decree so that it will not interfere with the operation of the aircraft.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>ingly, we do not find that the district court abused its discretion by enjoining the sale of the Boeing 707 <em>pendente lite.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">D. <em>The New Jersey Suits by Skyways and the Fairfield Group</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1422-5\">We turn finally to appellants\u2019 contention that the district court was without authority to enjoin the prosecution of the pending state court actions, one of which was instituted by Skyways to enforce the Boeing 707 lease, while the second was initiated by the Fairfield Group to recover certain books and records which ICC has refused to release to the Group. The limited authority of a federal court to stay a pending state court proceeding is embodied in 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2283 which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1422-6\">A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1422-7\">Moreover, in construing this statute, we are counselled to resolve</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArzJ\">any doubts as to the propriety of a federal injunction against state court proceedings ... in favor of permitting the state courts to proceed in an orderly fashion to finally determine the controversy. The explicit wording of \u00a7 2283 itself implies as much, and the fundamental principle of a dual system of courts leads inevitably to that conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1422-11\">Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 398 U.S. 281, 297, 90 S.Ct. 1739, 1748, 26 L.Ed.2d 234 (1970). In light of this presumption against interference, we must agree with the Fairfield Group that the district court erred by enjoining the prosecution of the two state court suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-12\">In support of its request for this relief, ICC urges that the district court possessed the requisite authority under \u00a7 21(e) of the 1934 Act (15 U.S. C. \u00a7 78u) which, argues ICC, satisfies the \u201cexcept as expressly authorized by Act of Congress\u201d language of \u00a7 2283.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Section\u201921(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1422-13\">Whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person is engaged or about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of the provisions of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation thereunder, it may * * * bring an action * * * to enjoin such acts or practices, and upon a proper showing a permanent or temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted without bond.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZRG\">Although this language empowers the SEC alone to obtain injunctive relief, we have held that, under certain circumstances, it may be construed to authorize a private party to enjoin a pending state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>court, action where the very prosecution of that lawsuit furthers a violation of the securities laws. Studebaker Corporation v. Gittlin, 360 F.2d 692 (2d Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">ICC contends that our holding in <em>Gittlin </em>is applicable to this case. Its argument, accepted by Judge Stewart, is basically that but for the spin-off of Fairfield General, a transaction fraudulently induced in violation of \u00a7 10(b), neither Skyways nor the balance of the Fairfield Group would enjoy the independent status effectively required to sue its former parent. Thus, ICC concludes that, as in <em>Gittlin, </em>where Gittlin\u2019s state court action against Studebaker was permanently enjoined because Gittlin had obtained the necessary stockholder authorizations by violating the Proxy Rules issued under \u00a7 14(a) of the 1934 Act, here too, the state court actions are predicated on violations of the securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-6\">There is, however, a critical distinction between <em>Gittlin </em>and the instant case. In <em>Gittlin, </em>the injunction issued, after a decision on the merits holding that Gittlin had, in fact, violated \u00a7 14(a), while in this case, ICC\u2019s claim of a \u00a7 10(b) violation, though presenting a fair ground for subject matter jurisdiction and a temporary injunction has yet to result in a judgment on the merits after trial. To be sure, the SEC, under \u00a7 21(e), is empowered to secure a preliminary injunction, but, in view of the explicit words of caution appearing in <em>Atlantic Coast Railroad, </em>we decline to extend the <em>Gittlin </em>rationale to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-7\">This conclusion, moreover, is buttressed by our decision in Vernitron Corporation v. Benjamin, 440 F.2d 105 (2d Cir.), cert, denied; 402 U.S. 987, 91 S.Ct. 1664, 29 L.Ed.2d 154 (1971), decided subsequent to <em>Gittlin. </em>In <em>Vernitron, </em>a preliminary injunction was sought and granted to restrain a pending state court action which, the moving party claimed, was brought to enforce a contract obtained by fraudulent conduct vi-olative of \u00a7 10(b). We reversed, finding <em>Gittlin </em>\u201cinapposite in that the prosecution of the state action there relevant would itself have furthered the violation of the Securities Exchange Act.\u201d Vernitron Corporation v. Benjamin, <em>supra, </em>440 F.2d at 108. Since the facts here bear greater resemblance to <em>Vernitron </em>than <em>Gittlin, </em>we believe our decision in <em>Vernitron </em>to be the more applicable. Accordingly, we vacate so much of the preliminary injunction against the Fair-field Group that enjoins further prosecution of the two actions pending in New Jersey Superior Court, without prejudice to renewal of the application upon a showing that prosecution of these actions has interfered or threatens to interfere with the district court\u2019s jurisdiction or a judgment issued by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-9\">III. THE VESCO &amp; CO. APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-10\">The circumstances surrounding appellant Vesco &amp; Co.\u2019s alleged role in the purported scheme to defraud ICC are, in the context of this sprawling and labyrinthine lawsuit, remarkably straightforward. Indeed, our knowledge of the details relating to Vesco &amp; Co. derives principally from an affidavit submitted by Milton Stern, counsel for Vesco &amp; Co., in support of its unsuccessful motion to dismiss the complaint. Vesco &amp; Co., it appears, was incorporated in Delaware on July 12, 1972 as an estate planning device for Robert Vesco. At that time, Vesco exchanged 800,000 shares of ICC common stock for all of the preferred stock of Vesco &amp; Co. The common stock of Vesco &amp; Co. is owned by Patricia Vesco, Vesco\u2019s wife, as custodian for Vesco\u2019s children. The sole asset of Vesco &amp; Co. is the block of ICC common stock which, through the additional contributions of Vesco\u2019s children, totals 846,380 shares. Furthermore, we have been advised that the officers of Vesco &amp; Co. are Mrs. Vesco and defendant Shirley Bailey, Vesco\u2019s personal secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-11\">On facts such as these, which can hardly be characterized as common, routine or without the semblance of taint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>ICC moved for and was granted a preliminary injunction enjoining Vesco &amp; Co. from disposing of the 846,380 shares of ICC common stock <em>pendente lite. </em>Judge Stewart found <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that Vesco &amp; Co. was merely Vesco\u2019s alter ego and, as such, would be equally liable should ICC sustain its claim of a \u00a7 10(b) violation against Vesco. The district court also granted ICC\u2019s motion for preliminary relief restraining Vesco &amp; Co. from prosecuting a pending state court action, finding such injunctive relief necessary to protect and effectuate its judgment, entered with the consent of ICC, in SEC v. Vesco et al., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">A. Vesco <em>&amp; Co.\u2019s Preliminary Defenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-5\">In attacking the preliminary injunction, Vesco &amp; Co. contends \u2014 as did the Fairfield Group \u2014 that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the 1934 Act. It adds that this jurisdictional basis is essential here because in personam jurisdiction over Vesco &amp; Co., a Delaware corporation doing no business in New York,, can only be sustained under the nationwide service of process authorized by the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa \u2014 an issue raised also in the Fairfield Group appeal. The district court denied this claim holding that, as a court of equity, it could pierce the corporate veil and treat Vesco &amp; Co. as the equivalent of its dominant shareholder, Vesco. Thus, since ICC had unquestionably stated a claim under \u00a7 10(b) against Vesco, the court had jurisdiction as well over Vesco &amp; Co. We agree.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-8\">Although we need not labor the principle that the law will ordinarily treat the corporation as an entity distinct from its shareholders, it is equally well-established that \u201cwhenever it is necessary to relieve or to protect from frauds, the corporation may be disregarded as against the responsible parties.\u201d 1 Fletcher Cyc. Corp., Perm.Ed. \u00a7 44; <em>Cf. </em>In re Gibraltor Amusements, Ltd., 291 F.2d 22 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 368 U.S. 925, 82 S.Ct. 360, 7 L.Ed.2d 190 (1961). In this case, we note that ICC\u2019s detailed allegations of fraud against Vesco, personally, have now ripened into a default judgment.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Moreover, the virtual identity of interest between Vesco and Vesco &amp; Co. is uncontroverted, as is the fact that Vesco actually transferred his ICC common stock to Vesco &amp; Co. at a time when he was actively engaged in his allegedly fraudulent scheme. Finally, we have sustained 1934 Act jurisdiction over a corporation that participated in the fraudulent scheme solely as transferee for the illicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>fruits. SEC v. Manor Nursing Centers, Inc., <em>supra </em>(jurisdiction over defendant Capital Cities Nursing Centers, Inc.). Thus, although ICC does not claim that the ICC common stock itself represents the fruits of Vesco\u2019s fraudulent conduct, nevertheless, we believe that the district court had ample power, as a court of equity, to reach those assets under the jurisdictional purview of the 1934 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">Vesco &amp; Co. also contends that the complaint was defective in failing to state a valid claim against it. Admittedly, the solitary reference to Vesco &amp; Co. in \u00b6 5(r) of the complaint \u2014\u201ca Delaware corporation to which defendant Vesco and his children have transferred certain of their assets\u201d \u2014 is not replete with detail. Yet, the \u201cnotice pleading\u201d mandated by Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that the complaint be construed liberally, Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 79 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); Dioguardi v. Durning, 139 F.2d 774 (2d Cir. 1944); and \u201cjurisdiction ... is not defeated ... by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which [the pleader] could actually recover.\u201d Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682, 66 S.Ct. 773, 776, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946). <em>See </em>A. T. Brod &amp; Co. v. Perlow, 375 F.2d 393, 398 (2d Cir. 1967). Accordingly, in view of the more than adequate allegations of fraud against Vesco, the allegation that he transferred certain assets to Vesco &amp; Co. was sufficient to suggest that ICC would urge a piercing of the corporate veil as the basis for judgment against Vesco &amp; Co.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Moreover, in light of the allegations in the affidavits accompanying the applications for the preliminary injunctions, the interstices of the complaint have been filled in. We would be acting contrary to the spirit of the Federal Rules if we did not recognize the ease with which the complaint may be amended under these Rules to supply any additional allegations required to make the complaint more informative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-9\">B. <em>The Preliminary Injunction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-10\">Turning to the propriety of the injunctive relief fashioned by the district court, we find, for the reasons substantially set forth in Part II, that the district judge was well within his discretion in enjoining the disposition of the 846,380 shares of ICC common stock. With Vesco now well beyond the reach of ICC and the United States, this large and perhaps controlling block of ICC common stock is indeed a critical asset should ICC prevail on the merits against Vesco &amp; Co. Sale of the stock would only aggravate the alleged fraud. Indeed the Vesco family, as sole shareholders, are unlikely to evidence concern over improper disposal of this asset. Moreover, as a holding company, Vesco &amp; Co. will hardly experience any disruption in operations \u2014 an element to be considered by the district court in evaluating the appropriateness of an asset freeze. <em>See </em>SEC v. Manor Nursing Centers, Inc., <em>supra, </em>458 F.2d at 1106. Accordingly, the balance of hardships once again tilts in ICC\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-11\">The other half of the preliminary injunction equation set forth by <em>Hamilton Watch </em>and its progeny \u2014 the existence of serious questions establishing a fair ground for further litigation \u2014 has also been satisfied by ICC in its claim against Vesco &amp; Co. That Vesco, himself, is responsible to ICC because of his fraudulent scheming, has now been established by the default judgment. The only question which remains, therefore, is whether ICC may pierce the corporate shell and reach the assets contained within it. As we have already made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>clear, both the timing of incorporation and the precise identity between the stockholders and officers of Vesco &amp; Co. and Vesco, his family, and personal secretary are more than sufficient to provide fertile ground for \u201cmore deliberate investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">C. <em>The New Jersey Suit by Vesco &amp; Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">That portion of the preliminary injunction restraining Vesco &amp; Co. from prosecuting its pending state court action still remains for our consideration. The state suit, filed in the Chancery Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey, is based on a complaint containing four counts in a derivative action filed by Vesco &amp; Co. on behalf of ICC. Counts one and two seek compensatory and punitive damages against Laurence Richardson, a former director, and Gary Benjamin, a former officer of ICC for alleged breach of their fiduciary obligations to the company. Count three charges that ICC \u201chas paid, or is contemplating payment of, the personal legal fees and expenses\u201d for three former directors, Richardson, Frank Beatty, and Wilbert Snipes, incurred in their defense of actions against them for mismanagement. Vesco &amp; Co. prays for an injunction against future payments, and the return of any such reimbursements to date. Finally, count four of the complaint alleges that the former board of directors of ICC \u201cabdicated their responsibilities as directors\u201d by consenting to the \u201cFinal Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Appointment of Special Counsel and Directors\u201d which terminated ICC\u2019s involvement in SEC v. Vesco et al., <em>supra. </em>As relief, Vesco &amp; Co. seeks, <em>inter alia, </em>to enjoin the court-appointed board of directors from exercising their duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-6\">In granting ICC\u2019s request to enjoin this lawsuit, Judge Stewart relied on the exception in \u00a7 2283 which authorizes a federal court to stay a state court proceeding \u201cto protect or effectuate its judgments.\u201d Although <em>Atlantic Coast Railroad </em>teaches that this exception must be narrowly construed, it clearly supports injunctive relief restraining count four of Vesco &amp; Co.\u2019s New Jersey action. This count represents a direct assault on the Final Judgment entered by Judge Stewart in SEC v. Vesco et al., <em>supra, </em>and constitutes an attempt to frustrate the court\u2019s order appointing a new board of directors for ICC by seeking to enjoin the functioning of the board. Accordingly, we have little difficulty in sustaining the preliminary injunction restraining Vesco &amp; Co. from proceeding with count four of its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-8\"> We reach a contrary conclusion, however, with respect to the remaining counts of this state suit. We do not find in these counts the kind of real or potential conflict with the Final Judgment in SEC v. Vesco et al., <em>supra, </em>which we believe is required to justify the disfavored intervention into the orderly proceedings of a state court. Although the Final Judgment vests Special Counsel with the power to prosecute claims on behalf of ICC, the court\u2019s order does not purport to override the traditional right of a stockholder to sue on the corporation\u2019s behalf. <em>See </em>13 Fletcher Cyc. Corp., Perm.Ed. \u00a7 5940. Even were we to accept ICC\u2019s contention that appointment of Special Counsel and a new board of directors was equivalent to the appointment of a receiver, it is well-settled that a derivative suit could be instituted, provided a proper demand had been made and refused by the receiver. Lucking v. Delano, 129 F.2d 283, 286 (6th Cir. 1942); 13 Fletcher Cyc. Corp., Perm.Ed. \u00a7 5966. Accordingly, we vacate so much of the preliminary injunction which restrains Vesco &amp; Co. from prosecuting counts one \u2014 three of its pending state court action, without prejudice to renewal of the application upon a showing that prosecution of these counts has interfered or threatens to interfere with the district court\u2019s jurisdiction or a judgment issued by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>IV. THE ANDEAN APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-4\">The seeds of Andean\u2019s involvement in the instant lawsuit were planted on July-27, 1973. On that date, United States Customs officials seized the yacht, Patricia III, while it was undergoing repairs at the Merrill Stevens Dry Dock Company in Miami, Florida. The yacht was of Panamanian registry, the registration certificate having been issued to Andean, a Panamanian corporation. The vessel was seized for allegedly failing to pay duties pursuant to relevant Tariff Schedules of the United States. These payments are required as duty assessments on yachts of foreign origin which enter the United States while chartered to or owned by a resident of the United States. In this instance Ves-co was that American resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">One week after the yacht\u2019s seizure by the United States, on August 3, ICC moved for and Judge Ward granted a temporary restraining order enjoining Vesco from removing the yacht from its Miami berth.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> On August 14, Andean appeared as intervenor before Judge Ward and subsequently, on August 16, submitted a written application supported by an affidavit of counsel to Judge Stewart seeking to dissolve the restraining order on the ground that it and not Vesco was the owner of the Patricia III. ICC\u2019s response was that Andean was nothing more than a nominee for Vesco, and that the source of the funds used to purchase the yacht was Vesco. In the alternative, ICC claimed that the Columbus Trust Company [Columbus Trust] which held a f1,500,000 mortgage on the yacht, was either a mere conduit for moneys provided by Vesco or was, itself, independently liable to ICC as a result of its participation in Vesco\u2019s alleged scheme to loot the assets of ICC.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1427-9\">In an effort to support its serious charges, ICC deposed Roland Boddy, Captain of the Patricia III, and Joseph Sutton, President of Merrill Stevens. ICC also sought to take the deposition of Eusebio Morales, Andean\u2019s sole shareholder, but Morales refused to appear in Miami for the deposition despite. Judge Stewart\u2019s order so requiring.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> ICC also failed in its effort to depose Donald Aberle, President of Columbus Trust, who, like Morales, preferred to remain in the snug harbor of Nassau. Unlike Morales, Aberle had not been ordered by the Court to appear. Instead, and by way of response to ICC\u2019s charges that Andean and/or Columbus Trust were fronts for Vesco, Andean submitted affidavits by Morales, Aberle, several other officers of Columbus Trust, and by Virgil Coakley, an assistant to the Controller of Property Resources Limited [PRL], a corporation in which ICC formerly had an indirect interest, and the assets of which were allegedly misappropriated by Vesco with the aid of Columbus Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-10\">On October 2, 1973, an evidentiary hearing was held before Judge Stewart at which David Warham, former Controller of PRL, and Charles Bliven, a yacht broker who arranged the sale of the Patricia III to Andean, testified on behalf of ICC. Three days later, on October 5, 1973, the district judge issued his preliminary injunction, enjoining Andean and Columbus Trust from mov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>ing the Patricia III, an order from which only Andean has appealed.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">A. <em>The Preliminary Injunction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">At the outset, we note that the question before us is quite narrow. Since both Vesco, against whom a default judgment has already been entered, and Columbus Trust, a Bahamian corporation, are effectively immunized from execution because they both are beyond the reach of the court, enjoying the protection of the Bahamian government, it is indisputable that ICC would be irreparably harmed should we permit this yacht, valued in excess of one million dollars, to depart our shores and sail to other lands, perhaps to a rendezvous with her alleged owner Vesco. Accordingly, with the balance of hardships so obviously in ICC's favor, we need decide only whether Judge Stewart abused his discretion in determining that serious questions were raised concerning the source or sources of the funds used to purchase the yacht and Columbus Trust\u2019s alleged role in defrauding ICC. Sonesta International Hotels Corp. v. Wellington Associates, supra; Checker Motors Corp. v. Chrysler Corp., <em>supra-, </em>Hamilton Watch Co. v. Benrus Watch Co., <em>supra. </em>After a careful review of the record, we find no abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-6\">Morales's affidavit discloses that Andean was formed in February, 1973, when Morales contributed $10,000 in return for all of the corporation\u2019s stock. After its incorporation, neither Andean nor Morales played more than a passive role in the purchase or operation of the Patricia III. Instead, it was Aberle who negotiated for the acquisition of the yacht from Charles Bliven &amp; Co., yacht brokers. On May 14, 1973, Columbus Trust wired $1,326,000 to Bliven, and Andean took title to the yacht.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-9\">Thereafter, Andean entered into a charter party with Mackinley Limited, a Bahamian corporation whose interest in chartering a luxury yacht had, according to Aberle, initially prompted his negotiations with Bliven. Mackinley, however, was hardly a stranger to Aberle, who, coincidentally, happened to be Mackin-ley\u2019s Secretary. Moreover, it does not appear wholly without significance or is it perhaps simply another coincidence, that a letter sent by Aberle to the Registrar-General of Nassau in February, 1973 stated that Vesco was appointed as Director and President of Mackinley. To add yet a third curious note, we find that Aberle subsequently termed this appointment \u201cincorrect\u201d in a second letter to the Registrar-General, sent shortly after the first, in which Aberle made the rather unusual request that the first letter be returned. In any event, Mack-inley\u2019s strange background aside, it arranged with Andean for a one-year charter, with an option to renew for five additional one-year periods, at the rate of $30,000 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-10\">On June 20, 1973, Vesco, Patricia Ves-co, his wife, and Veseo\u2019s family boarded the yacht (renamed Patricia III after its purchase) and Vesco and his family remained it sole users until shortly before it put into Miami for repairs. The record discloses that Vesco submitted plans for the extensive refurbishing and refitting of the yacht\u2019s interior. Indeed, in July, 1973 a cheek for $40,000 was issued by Patricia Melzer [Mrs. Vesco\u2019s maiden name], on behalf of Mackinley, Ltd., to Merrill Stevens Dry Dock Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>pany in partial payment for work performed on the yacht. Payment on this check was stopped, however, and it was replaced with a check issued by Columbus Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-4\">Turning our attention to Columbus Trust and its pedigree, we observe that it was incorporated by Aberle and one Dobbie in 1969 as a vehicle for those seeking to invest capital in the Bahamas, a tax haven not unknown to the initiated. By 1973, Dobbie\u2019s interest was acquired by the Bahamas Commonwealth Bank, Ltd. [BCB], a defendant in this lawsuit. BCB was in turn controlled by Norman LeBlane, another defendant and both are also defendants in SEC v. Ves-co et al., <em>supra, </em>against whom default judgments have been entered in the SEC .action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-5\">In March, 1973, Aberle and two other Bahamians purchased BCB\u2019s interest in Columbus Trust. In that same month, according to Warham\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing before Judge Stewart, PRL, of which LeBlane was a director, arranged to have Columbus Trust manage the not insignificant sum of $40,750,000 then held in certificates of deposit in PRL\u2019s account in London. Warham also testified that this important arrangement was concluded at the behest of Veseo, who, though neither a director nor officer of PRL, appeared to have a strong influence over the management of PRL\u2019s funds. Finally, War-ham described in some detail a series of transactions by which PRL \u2014 which was controlled by a corporation (Value Capital Limited) in which ICC owned a controlling interest \u2014 was subsequently transferred by Vesco, through ICC\u2019s sale of its interest in Value Capital Limited, to a corporation dominated by LeBlane. This series of transactions have been alleged by both the SEC and ICC to have violated the securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-9\">Once Columbus had control of PRL\u2019s $40,750,000 it proceeded to purchase $5,700,000 in Costa Rican bonds from BCB. Another $3,350,000 is, according to Coakley\u2019s affidavit and a telex exhibit from a Panama bank, deposited in the Banco Nacional de Panama. The balance of $31,700,000 remains in London, frozen in PRL\u2019s account by an order of the English Chancery Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-10\">Upon the foregoing, we can hardly say that ICC has failed to raise serious questions concerning the source of funds used to purchase the Patricia III. One thing appears clear: Andean performed no function other than that of a mere nominee or shell. Aberle undertook all negotiations for the yacht\u2019s acquisition, and it is undisputed that Columbus Trust supplied both the $1,326,000 purchase price and the substantial sums subsequently required to repair and refit the yacht. Moreover, at the eviden-tiary hearing, ICC submitted an audited financial statement of Columbus Trust revealing a net worth of only $266,808 as of March 31, 1972. Although this net worth figure related to a period more than one year prior to the yacht\u2019s purchase, we are unaware of any effort by Columbus Trust to rebut this evidence by introducing a more recent financial statement, although such information is under the control of Columbus Trust. We conclude on the totality of circumstances that ICC has made a sufficient showing of Vesco\u2019s interest in the yacht to sustain .the injunctive relief granted.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Accordingly, we need not pass upon ICC\u2019s alternative contention, also accepted below, that it has demonstrated with sufficient likelihood Columbus Trust\u2019s liability to ICC through its mishandling of the PRL funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>B. <em>The Posting of Security</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">Andean claims that the district court erred in denying its request for security by ICC, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(c). Rule 65(c) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-5\">No restraining order or preliminary injunction shall issue except upon the giving of security by the applicant, in such sum as the court deems proper</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1430-9\">In construing this language, we have stated that, especially in view of the phrase \u2014 -\u201cas the court deems proper\u201d\u2014 the district court may dispense with security where there has been no proof of likelihood of harm to the party enjoined. Ferguson v. Tabah, 288 F.2d 665, 675 (2d Cir. 1961). <em>See also </em>Ur-bain v. Knapp Brothers Manufacturing Co., 217 F.2d 810 (6th Cir. 1954), cert, denied, 349 U.S. 930, 75 S.Ct. 772, 99 L.Ed. 1260 (1955). Andean argues, however, that its inability to move the yacht has been costly, both in the loss of charter revenues and in additional maintenance expenses. ICC\u2019s response to this is quite simple. It claims that even were the restraint lifted, Andean would be unable to remove the yacht because of a forfeiture action brought by the United States in the Southern District of Florida for the unpaid assessed duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-10\">Subsequent to the argument of this case, we received a copy of findings of fact and conclusions of law signed by Judge Mehrtens in the actions pending before him in Florida. Although he found Andean liable for customs duties in the amount of $60,000, and indebted to the Merrill-Stevens Dry Dock Company in the sum of $77,474 for breach of a repairs and improvements contract, Judge Mehrtens denied the Government\u2019s claim for forfeiture. Thus, should Andean satisfy these judgments, it would be barred from removing the Patricia III only by the preliminary injunction granted Below. Accordingly, in light of the Florida dispositions, we remand to the court below for reconsideration of Andean\u2019s motion for security.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-12\">Although we have scarcely plumbed the depths of Vesco\u2019s alleged financial manipulations, we have attempted to describe the intricacies of the web spun by him and his associates in their alleged scheme to ensnare the assets of ICC and its subsidiaries. Emerging from this maze of securities schemes, of corporate shells and subsidiary spin-offs, one point stands out in bold relief: the ingenious plotter cannot find a medium more supple than the world of securities to effectuate his design. Thus, we find in these appeals further proof of the wisdom in adopting a flexible approach to the application of Section 10(b), a judicial construction consonant with that Section\u2019s broad prophylactic purpose. Confidence in our securities markets can only be maintained by establishing a protective shield which cannot be circumvented by recourse simply to the novel, to the unexpected, or to entanglements difficult to unravel. We remand to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1412-10\">.

Ordinarily, we would give considerable weight to the detailed findings of fact of a district judge supporting his order granting the preliminary injunction. But, we must note our disapproval of the procedure utilized by Judge Stewart, roundly condemned in this as well as other circuits, of adopting <em>in toto </em>the findings of fact submitted by counsel for ICC. <em>See e. g. </em>Rooted Hair, Inc. v. Ideal Toy Corp., 329 F.2d 761 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 379 U.S. 831, 85 S.Ct. 63, 13 L.Ed.2d 40 (1964) (Medina, <em>J. </em>concurring).

In <em>Blau, </em>a similar conclusion was reached in the context of \u00a7 16(b) of the 1934 Act.

Whether this degree of participation is sufficient for jurisdictional purposes as to Columbus Trust is a question not before us, since Columbus Trust has not appealed from Judge Stewart\u2019s order.

The theory of plaintiff International Controls Corp. (ICC) is that Vesco, a corporate buccaneer, was intent upon securing for his personal use a Boeing 707, which was owned by Skyways Leasing Corp. and leased to ICC on terms which were distinctly disadvantageous to ICC. In addition it had been redesigned and refurbished at great expense to ICC to satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>fy Vesco\u2019s sybaritic tastes rather than to accomplish the legitimate corporate purposes of ICC. Vesco, who was a major shareholder in ICC and at various times a holder of important corporate positions in the company, is alleged to have wasted corporate assets and generally to have deceived the ICC board of directors. Unquestionably, as the Fair-field Group admits, a complaint of corporate mismanagement in a stockholder derivative action would lie here. Although Mr. Justice Douglas did announce in Superintendent of Ins. v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co., 404 U.S. 6, 12, 92 S.Ct. 165, 169, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971), that \u201cCongress by \u00a7 10(b) did not seek to regulate transactions which constitute no more than internal corporate mismanagement\u201d, it seems reasonably clear that the existence of internal corporate mismanagement does not insulate fraudulent practices which are induced by a controlling influence to the detriment and loss of a corporation, provided, of course, that the transaction is otherwise within the purview of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. See Sehoenbaum v. Firstbrook, 405 F.2d 215 (2d Cir. 1968) (en banc), cert, denied, 395 U.S. 906, 89 S.Ct. 1747, 23 L.Ed.2d 219 (1969); Ruc-kle v. Roto American Corp., 339 F.2d 24 (2d Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-5\">The first question is whether or not the fraud practiced was <em>\u201cin connection with\u201d </em>the sale or purchase of securities. The pattern of misbehavior urged is novel and no precedent is adduced to support the proposition that it is connected to a security sale. However, I agree that the statute is to be construed liberally, and not restrictively, where its terms permit flexibility. Superintendent of Ins. v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co., <em>supra, </em>404 U.S. at 12, 92 S.Ct. 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-6\">Vesco had originally secured the Boeing 707 through Skyways, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Fairfield Aviation Corp. Fairfield Aviation, in turn, was totally owned by ICC. The negotiation of the lease and the transformation of the commercial plane into a luxury air carrier were achieved by Vesco without any sale or purchase of securities. The theory of the complaint here is that, because Vesco, not otherwise a worrisome type, was concerned that the theretofore complacent and amenable board of ICC might prove troublesome, he engineered a series of devious moves to ensure his continuing use of a corporate asset for private pleasure. Fairfield General Corp. was therefore created, and all of the shares of Fairfield Aviation, were transferred to it. A dividend of Fairfield General shares to the stockholders of ICC was then declared by the board of ICC. As a result of these activities, Skyways and the plane came under the control of Vesco and three associates, who made up the board of directors of Fairfield General.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-8\">Obviously, the manipulation charged is indeed intricate, and separating the flim from the flam may well prove to be difficult. In any event, whether there exists between the fraud allegedly practiced upon ICC and the spin-off a nexus sufficient to satisfy the <em>\u201cin connection with\u201d </em>requirement of the statute (see Note, The Controlling Influence Standard in Rule 10b-5 Corporate Mismanagement Cases, 86 Harv.L.Rev. 1007, 1010-15 (1973)) presents a question we need not now determine definitively. Since this is an appeal from a preliminary injunction which merely maintains the status quo, with the balance of hardships tipping sharply in ICC\u2019s favor and serious litigable issues presented, there is enough to sustain the injunction without determining the question with finality. See Exxon Corp. v. City of New York, 480 F.2d 460, 464 (2d Cir. 1973) <em>; </em>Gulf &amp; Western Indus., Inc. v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., 476 F.2d 687 (2d Cir. 1973); A. H. Bull Steamship Co. v. National Marine Engineers\u2019 Beneficial Ass\u2019n, 250 F.2d 332, 337 (2d Cir. 1957); American Federation of Musicians v. Stein, 213 F.2d 679 (6th Cir.), cert, denied, 348 U.S. 873, 75 S.Ct. 108, 99 L.Ed. 687 (1954); 601 West 26 Corp. v. Solitron Devices, Inc., 291 F.Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>882 (S.D.N.Y.1968), aff\u2019d, 420 F.2d 293 (2d Cir. 1969); Garland v. Ruskin, 249 F.Supp. 977, 980 (S.D.N.Y.1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-4\">A key jurisdictional question remains. Was there a \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d of securities here under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5? The majority, while finding no \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d in the exchange of securities between Fairfield Aviation and Fairfield General, finds the spinoff, the stock dividend of Fairfield General shares to the stockholders of ICC, to be such a \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d within the 1934 Act and Rule. It is at this point that I respectfully but firmly part company with the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-5\">Chief Judge Kaufman candidly admits that there is no precedent for the holding in this case, and, it should be added, the technique adopted by the majority was not even suggested by the appellee or by the SEC in its amicus brief. The majority simply equates purchase and sale with acquisition and disposition of securities, even though no consideration or value or price is involved in the transaction. This is not only unprecedented, but is contrary to the holding of the court in Shaw v. Dreyfus, 172 F.2d 140 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 337 U.S. 907, 69 S.Ct. 1048, 93 L.Ed. 1719 (1949). The question before the court there was whether the receipt of stock rights eon-eededly tantamount to a stock dividend was within the \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d definition of the 1934 Act, \u00a7 3(a) (13) &amp; (14), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(13) &amp; (14), which is precisely the definitional section involved here. While \u00a7 16(b), rather than \u00a7 10(b), was the provision allegedly violated in <em>Shaw, </em>the court there, in applying the definition of \u201cpurchase or sale,\u201d stated: \u201cThe popular or accepted import of words furnishes the general rule for the interpretation of statutes.\u201d Id. at 142 (footnote omitted). The court found that \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d means that some price or consideration must be involved in the transaction in shares. Since the popular and accepted meaning of \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d still imports consideration, and since there is admittedly no precedent for any \u00a7 10(b) construction which would eliminate consideration, I fail to see any basis for a differing interpretation. In fact, it is not so much an interpretation as it is an evisceration. Surely the use of \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d was an indication that Congress intended to place certain limitations upon the scope of \u00a7 10(b). Congress did not declare that \u00a7 10(b) was to apply to all \u201ctransactions involving securities\u201d or all \u201cdispositions of securities.\u201d Instead, it chose terms which have had, and still retain, a conceptual significance now abandoned. In effect, the majority is construing \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d to include no purchase and no sale. If another definition of the coverage of the Act is to be provided, it must be provided by Congress and certainly not by a panel of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-7\">Section 3(a)(13) &amp; (14) of the Act defines \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d to include a contract to acquire or dispose of securities. There was here no contract to dispose of or to acquire securities, and there was no sale by ICC or purchase by ICC stockholders. The corporation received nothing in exchange for the dividend and the stockholders paid nothing. If a corporate spin-off of a \u201cportfolio subsidiary\u201d is a purchase or sale simply because it involves a stock transaction or the disposition of securities by a corporation, then a normal corporate stock dividend, a gift of shares or a distribution of securities by a fiduciary can also be found to be a purchase or sale. The majority states that the scope of protection under \u00a7 10(b) extends to \u201cthose who engage in transactions eventuating in the acquisition or disposition of securities.\u201d If there is to be any limitation upon the cases to which this broad definition may be applied in the future, the majority opinion gives no indication of what the guidelines may be, thus opening the door to future litigation which will require continuing appellate interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-8\">The majority emphasizes that the misbehavior here is the type meant to be proscribed by \u00a7 10(b) and that the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>ute must be read flexibly.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Logically, this can only mean that the manipulative and deceptive devices or contrivances referred to in \u00a7 10(b) and the further refinement of them in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of Rule 10b-5 should be construed broadly to encompass the myriad schemes of the malevolent and the greedy. See SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, 375 U.S. 180, 195, 84 S.Ct. 275, 11 L.Ed.2d 237 (1963). While the Act and the Rule have this substantive fluidity, the fraud alleged must be in connection with a \u201csale or purchase.\u201d A flexible approach does not permit a court to extend the terms of a statute beyond their fair import.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-5\">The protection of the statute and the Rule is extended only to a \u201cseller or purchaser.\u201d This has been the law of this circuit and other circuits<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> since it was announced by Judge Augustus N. Hand of this court in Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., 193 F.2d 461, cert, denied, 343 U.S. 956, 72 S.Ct. 1051, 96 L.Ed. 1356 (1952). This principle was recently reaffirmed in GAF Corp. v. Milstein, 453 F.2d 709, 721 (2d Cir. 1971), cert, denied, 406 U.S. 910, 92 S.Ct. 1610, 31 L.Ed.2d 821 (1972), wherein Judge Kaufman noted that this court has steadfastly refused to extend the reach of 10b-5 to give standing to an issuer. While the question of standing has not specifically been raised here,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I fear that the decision of the majority may portend the demise of the <em>Birry-baum </em>rule. We found in <em>Birnbaum </em>that Congress has determined that the umbrella of protection is to be extended only to purchasers and sellers in connection with a purchase or sale of securities. Although this rule has been criticized,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it serves the salutary purpose of foreclosing limitless liability under \u00a7 10(b). See Bradford, Rule 10b-5: The Search for a Limiting Doctrine, 19 Buffalo L.Rev. 205 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-11\">Although Veseo is at best an unsympathetic figure, and his hegira, whether to the Bahamas, Costa Rica or even to Glubbdubdrib, hardly inspires confidence in his character, this is not adequate cause for a panel of this court to rewrite the statute and ignore precedent. \u201c[W]e are not free to adopt a construction that not only strains, but flatly contradicts, the words of the statute.\u201d Reliance Electric Co. v.
