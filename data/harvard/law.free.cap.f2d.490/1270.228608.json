Appellants, inmates of the Arkansas Department of Correction, basically complain of the actions of a prison employee, Utility Sergeant Kenneth Taylor, who they feel acts unfairly toward them. Specifically, they allege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-12\">1. That Sergeant Taylor threatened them with job demotions unless they became informers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-13\">2. That inmate Ellingburg was deprived of needed medical care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-14\">3. That inmate Ellingburg was intimidated by prison officials because the officials discussed with him the large number of writs he filed and denied him essential medical care in revenge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-15\">4. That inmate Higgins was placed in punitive segregation because he attempted to explain to Sergeant Taylor certain actions which had resulted in a disciplinary report being filed against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-16\">5. That Sergeant Taylor confiscated personal property of inmates during searches.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1345-17\">The district court referred the case to a magistrate for screening. The magistrate went to the prison and interviewed the persons involved and then submitted a full report to the district court. Upon receipt of the report, the district court entered an order dismissing the complaint because it failed to state a claim, and because even if the complaint were sufficiently factually specific, none of the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations rose to federal constitutional dignity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-18\"> We affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s order. Broad and conelusory statements unsupported by factual allegations are not sufficient to support a cause of action under \u00a7 1983. Howard v. Swenson, 426 F.2d 277 (8th Cir.), cert, denied, 400 U.S. 948, 91 S.Ct. 255, 27 L.Ed.2d 254 (1970); Fletcher v. Hook, 446 F.2d 14 (3d Cir. 1971); Gittlemacker v. Prasse, 428 F.2d 1 (3d Cir. 1970); Church v. Hegstrom, 416 F. 2d 449 (2d Cir. 1969). In addition, none of appellants\u2019 allegations as stated rises to federal constitutional dignity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
