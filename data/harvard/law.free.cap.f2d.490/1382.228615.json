Respondent did not file any exceptions with the Board as to these findings and does not challenge these findings before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-34\">The Administrative Law Judge also found that respondent had not violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>Section 8(a) (5) of the Act and therefore declined to issue a bargaining order. The General Counsel took an exception to this finding and the Board found a Section 8(a)(5) violation and issued a bargaining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-4\">The propriety of the Board issuing a bargaining order is the only issue before this court. We conclude from our examination of the record that there is substantial evidence to support the finding of an 8(a)(5) violation and that a bargaining order is proper under the principles enunciated in N.L.R.B. v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). Accordingly, the petition for enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
