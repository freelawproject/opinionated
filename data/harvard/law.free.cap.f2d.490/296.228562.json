This argument is without merit and we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-20\">The principal government witness at trial was a federal agent. He testified that on three occasions he called on the appellant at the latter\u2019s office and was either directly sold controlled substances from appellant\u2019s stock or sold prescriptions for controlled substances which he then had filled at various pharmacies. The agent further testified that appellant never examined- him in any way before selling him the drugs or prescriptions, and that appellant indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>he knew the drugs were not to be used for therapeutic or medical purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant took the stand on his own behalf and denied every pertinent fact alleged by the agent. The jury found him guilty on all counts, obviously believing the agent\u2019s testimony and not that of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The government acknowledges that appellant is authorized to \u201cdispense\u201d controlled substances and therefore could not have been convicted of violating \u00a7 841(a)(1) unless the jury found that his actions constituted something other than dispensing, namely, distributing. The real issue, then, is the meaning of \u201cdispense,\u201d which the statute defines as \u201cdeliver [ing] a controlled substance to an ultimate user or research subject by, or pursuant to the <em>lawful </em>order of, a practitioner . . . . \u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(10) (1970) (emphasis added). \u201cPractitioner\u201d is defined as a \u201cphysician . . . registered, or otherwise permitted, by the United States or the jurisdiction in which he practices or does research, to distribute, dispense, conduct research with respect to, administer, or use in teaching or chemical analysis, a controlled substance <em>in the course of professional practice or research.\u201d </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(20) (1970) (emphasis added). The combined effect of these statutory definitions in the present context is to limit the meaning of \u201cdispense\u201d to delivery of controlled substances by a physician who is acting in the course of professional practice or research. The point is made explicitly in the regulations. <em>See </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 306. 04(a) (1973). Delivery of controlled substances outside the course of professional practice or research would constitute \u201cdistributing\u201d, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(11) (1970), an activity which violates \u00a7 841(a) (1) even if carried on by a registered physician. United States v. Collier, 478 F.2d 268, 271-272 (5th Cir. 1973).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">In the instant case, the jury was properly charged that in order to convict appellant under \u00a7 841(a)(1) it had to determine whether he had delivered drugs and prescriptions to the agent and, if so, whether such deliveries were in the course of appellant\u2019s professional practice or research. The jury obviously concluded that deliveries had occurred and were not within the course of appellant\u2019s medical practice. Both conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>sions were amply warranted by the record. Indeed, assuming as we must the truth of the agent\u2019s testimony for purposes of this appeal, appellant\u2019s conduct bore no more resemblance to professional medical practice than the conduct of any street-corner \u201cpusher.\u201d A medical degree confers no immunity from criminal punishment. United States v. Collier, <em>supra </em>at 271; United States v. Warren, 453 F.2d 738, 744 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 406 U.S. 944, 92 S.Ct. 2040, 32 L.Ed.2d 331 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Appellant\u2019s alternative contention that he was entrapped cannot even be considered in view of the fact that he has denied committing any acts on which the conviction could have been based. It is well settled in this circuit that one cannot both deny the deed and say that he was entrapped into doing it. Sylvia v. United States, 312 F.2d 145, 147 (1st Cir.), cert, denied, 374 U.S. 809, 83 S.Ct. 1694, 10 L.Ed.2d 1032 (1963). Quite apart from this principle, there was no evidence that would warrant a finding of entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-10\">. The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-11\">\u201c(a) Except as authorized by this sub-chapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowing]y or intentionally\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-12\">(1) to manufacture, distribute, or dispense ... a controlled substance.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-21\">. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-22\">\u201c(b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b372-6\">. The following excerpt from the agent\u2019s testimony suggests its overall tenor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201cSo I examined the bottle containing a hundred Desoxyn [a controlled substance], and I gave [the appellant] another $20, so I said, well, was that all? He said, \u2018The only thing I have left is some lonamin [a noncontrolled substance],\u2019 and I told him that X couldn\u2019t make any money on the lonamin. He told me that the kids told him that it was great for parties and that it was a real good pill. I said I wasn\u2019t interested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\u201cThen he told me that he was sorry that he hadn\u2019t met me three years before. He said that he used' to get thousands of these tablets that he would have been able to supply. He also told me that he preferred to sell me the pills from the office because my name wasn\u2019t on them and his name wasn\u2019t on them.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\">. We acknowledge that this interpretation of the statutory scheme conflicts with the recent decision of the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Leigh, 487 F.2d 206 (5th Cir. 1973). In <em>Leigh, </em>the court affirmed the dismissal of an indictment which charged a physician with unlawful \u201cdistribution\u201d in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1) where the physician was accused of writing prescriptions for controlled substances outside the course of his professional practice. The court held that instead he should have been indicted for unlawful \u201cdispensing\u201d in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1). We disagree. We think the reason Congress included the term \u201cdispense\u201d in \u00a7 841(a) (1) was to compel physicians to become properly licensed. If not licensed, a physician could then be convicted of unlawful dispensing. However, once licensed, he could not be convicted of unlawful dispensing because, as we stated above, the statute defines the term in and of itself as a lawful act. It should also be noted that <em>Leigh </em>seemingly conflicts with the prior Fifth Circuit decision in <em>Oollier, supra, </em>where the court affirmed a physician\u2019s plea of guilty to unlawfully \u201cdistributing\u201d controlled substances in violation of \u00a7 841(a) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
