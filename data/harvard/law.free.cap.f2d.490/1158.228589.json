width=\"1585\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1234-9\">President Donald Lane authorized separate $50.00 per week pay increases for the periods commencing May 24, 1969, October 18, 1969, and January 5, 1970. Neither the Executive Board nor the general membership specifically authorized or approved any of the salary increases. Each salary increase was the basis of a charged violation against each defendant for his own salary increases. Lane, however, was charged with three violations for his own three salary increases and with nine violations relating to the three salary increases for each of the three other officers. The Government did not contend that substantial expense money received was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-12\">Section 7.02(b) of the Union\u2019s constitution requires the Executive Board to \u201cMpprove the salaries, benefits, allowances, direct and indirect disbursements, expenses and reimbursement of expenses for officers, agents and employees.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>The minutes from every Executive Board meeting from December 22, 1968, through October 15, 1972, were admitted into evidence, and no approval of the three salary increases for any of the officers was recorded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants make no claim that the Executive Board or the membership expressly approved of the salary increases, and the three trustees testified that they did not know of the increases. In late 1971, when all of the officers were running for reelection, Union members asked at different Union membership meetings what the officers were being paid. Apparently, Lane responded at these times that \u201cI\u2019ll not discuss it with you or anyone else\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t ask what you make and you shouldn\u2019t ask me what I make.\u201d Ma-hany often said to \u201c[c]ome on up and look at the books; they are always open.\u201d Apparently Union members first learned of the substantial increases in late 1971, when a candidate for president, opposing Lane, obtained accurate salary information from the LM-2 reports filed with the Government pursuant to the Act and mailed copies of those reports to the members.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">Defendants\u2019 main contention is that the following resolution<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> approved by the Union membership granted to the President and Secretary-Treasurer the power to increase salaries without approval of the Executive Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1235-6\">[T]he President and Secretary-Treasurer have the authority, which is hereby confirmed, verified, and extended to make such expenditures and use of Teamsters Local 600 funds and facilities to whatever extent they believe is related' to the interests and benefit of Teamsters Local 600 without any prior approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1235-10\">We agree with the Government that this general resolution cannot be read as rescinding the specific constitutional provision requiring Executive Board approval of salary increases. To do so would defeat the provisions of the Union\u2019s constitution. Defendants urge other contentions that the Union\u2019s constitution authorized the salary increases; however, we think that \u00a7 702(b) of the Union\u2019s constitution clearly takes precedence and provides that salary increases must be approved by the Executive Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-11\">Defendants also argue that the Government must prove \u201clack of union benefit\u201d as an essential element of a crime under \u00a7 501(e). Since the District Court instructed the jury that a \u00a7 501(c) crime contains the essential elements of a specific intent to deprive the union of its funds and an unauthorized expenditure of union funds, defendants argue that it was prejudicial error not to include the alleged element of lack of union benefit. Defendants contend that the essential elements of every \u00a7 501(c) crime are; (1) specific intent to deprive the union of its funds, (2) unauthorized expenditure of union funds, <em>and </em>(3) lack of union benefit from the expended funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-12\">In order to decide whether lack of union benefit from expended union funds \u2014 in this case, unauthorized salary increases \u2014 is an element of a \u00a7 501(c) crime, we review the legislative history and Congressional purpose of \u00a7 501. This court has clearly held that \u201cCongress intended that it [the Act] should not be interpreted by the Courts narrowly or strictly, but, to the contrary, that its confines are broad.\u201d Johnson v. Nelson, 325 F.2d 646, 650 (8th Cir. 1963) ; <em>accord, </em>Pignotti v. Local # 3 Sheet Metal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>Workers\u2019 Int. Ass\u2019n, 477 F.2d 825, 832-835 (8th Cir. 1973). We said in <em>Johnson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1236-4\">Thus it plainly appears that the statute is broad in its reach. Officers and other union representatives may not act adversely to their organization or to the members as a group or acquire a personal interest which is contrary to the interests of the organization. Being trustees the officers must subvert their own personal interests to the lawful mandates and orders of the organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">Johnson v. Nelson, <em>supra, </em>325 F.2d at 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-6\">Section 501 should be interpreted broadly in order to insui-e that elected union officials fulfill their responsibilities as fiduciaries to their members, guard union funds from predators, and keep intact all such funds except those expended in the legitimate operation of the union\u2019s business. The funds should be treated as trust funds belonging to the union\u2019s members. Section 501(a), titled in part \u201cFiduciary responsibility of officers of labor organizations,\u201d specifically states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1236-7\">(a) The officers, agents, shop stewards, and other representatives of a labor organization occupy positions of trust in relation to such organization and its members as a group. It is, therefore, the duty of each such person, taking into account the special problems and functions of a labor organization, to hold its money and property solely for the benefit of the organization and its members and to manage, invest, and expend the same in accordance with its constitution and bylaws and any resolutions of the governing bodies adopted thereunder -X- -\u00bb *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1236-12\">Much has been written by many courts <em>concerning </em>the fiduciary responsibility of union officials imposed by \u00a7 501,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> however, House Report No. 741, prepared by the Committee on Education and Labor, trenchantly describes the purposes of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In commenting on union financial and administrative practices, House Report No. 741 said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1236-13\">The members of a labor organization are the real owners of the money and property of such organizations and are entitled to a full accounting of all transactions involving such money and property. Because union funds belong to the members they should be expended only in furtherance of their common interest. A union treasury should not be managed as though it were the private property of the union officers, however well intentioned such officers might be, but as a fund governed by fiduciary standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"agq-dedup-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>The conduct of the financial affairs of labor unions and the conduct of union officers in their capacity as officers of labor organizations are matters of proper concern to the Federal Government. This is so because the funds that pass through union treasuries and for which unions and their officers are responsible constitute vast sums of money, and the uses to which these funds are put have a substantial impact on the Nation\u2019s economy. Furthermore, if unions are to enjoy the protection of rights and exercise the broad powers which are guaranteed to them by the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act, they ought also to be held responsible for abuses that have accompanied the exercise of such powers and rights by some union leaders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-5\">* * * . * -* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-6\">It is the purpose of this bill to insure that full information concerning the financial and internal administrative practices and procedures of labor organizations shall be, in the first instance available to the members of such organizations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, Vol. 2, 86th Cong. 1st Sess.1959, H.Rep.No.741, at 2430.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\"> The statute, cases, and legislative history clearly establish that union officers are fiduciaries for union members, and a willful misappropriation of union funds by officials constitutes a violation of \u00a7 501(c). In United States v. Bryant, 430 F.2d 237, 239 (8th Cir. 1970), we indicated that \u201ca conviction would be supported by proof of willful embezzlement.\u201d In <em>Bryant, </em>however, \u201clack of union benefit\u201d as an essential element was not raised, and we only stated that \u201c[t]he court properly instructed the jury as to the essential elements of each offense charged.\u201d 430 F. 2d at 239. Similarly, other Eighth Circuit cases do not discuss this issue. <em>E. g., </em>Hayes v. United States, 329 F.2d 209 (8th Cir.), cert, denied sub nom. Bennett v. United States, 377 U.S. 980, 84 S.Ct. 1883, 12 L.Ed.2d 748 (1964); Doyle v. United States, 318 F.2d 419 (8th Cir. 1963). The issue of whether \u201clack of union benefit\u201d is an essential element of the crime under \u00a7 501(e) has not been raised before in this circuit. Probably because the common law crime of embezzlement consists of an unauthorized taking for personal use, otherwise stated, a conversion of entrusted funds to the personal use of the fiduciary, any incidental benefits that may fortuitously inure to the benefit of the victim is immaterial. In the broader category of willful misuse or abstraction of union funds and the conversion of them for the personal use of the converter or for non-union purposes, the issue of union benefit might be material where there was proper authorization for the payment of the funds, for example, the payment of authorized political contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-10\">The Second Circuit has had occasion to probe this issue more deeply than any of the other circuits. Its decisions in United States v. Silverman, 430 F.2d 106 (2d Cir.), modified on other grounds, 439 F.2d 1198 (2d Cir. 1970), and United States v. Ferrara, 451 F.2d 91 (2d Cir. 1971), present other factual situations as applied to the proscriptions of \u00a7 501(c). In <em>Silverman, </em>the defendant labor official was charged with violations of \u00a7 501(c) in Counts 1 through 8 for political contributions and in Counts 10 through 13 with receiving four Christmas gratuity checks. Judge Moore wrote the majority opinion for all counts except the political contributions charges, and his majority opinion on the \u00a7 501(c) counts relating to the Christmas checks affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction. Judge Friendly joined by Judge Hays wrote the majority opinion for the charges relating to the political contributions disguised in union records as payments for printing and reversed defendant\u2019s conviction on these counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-11\">In discussion of the Christmas checks counts, Judge Moore stated that defendant argued that the evidence failed \u201cto support a finding that the money was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>expended for a non-union purpose.\u201d United States v. Silverman, 430 F.2d at 117. However, the discussion on this issue for these charges does not hold that the Government had to prove lack of union benefit. Judge Moore held that only Silverman knew for what purpose the checks were used and that he failed to offer evidence that the checks were used for union benefit. Since the burden of proof for union benefit was placed on defendant, this would seem to imply that \u201clack of union benefit\u201d would not be an essential element of a \u00a7 501(c) violation to be proved by the Government. Judge Friendly did not discuss the counts relating to the Christmas checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">The political contributions charges are more fully discussed in <em>Silverman. </em>Judge Moore, dissenting on these charges, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_v\">[A] conviction under section 501(c) may be made out by a demonstration of a fraudulent intent to deprive the union of its funds and either a lack of bona fide authorization <em>or </em>an absence of benefit to the labor organization from the expenditure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">United States v. Silverman, 430 F.2d at 117 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">Therefore, according to Judge Moore, the essential elements of a \u00a7 501(c) violation vary. First, the essential elements may be: (1) a fraudulent intent to deprive the union of its funds and (2) a lack of authorization according to the union\u2019s bylaws and constitution. Second, the essential elements could be: (1) a fraudulent intent to deprive the union of its funds and (2) an absence of benefit to the union. This would most likely apply to the situation where there was authorization on the record but a lack of benefit to the union coupled with a fraudulent intent. United States v. Dibrizzi, 393 F.2d 642 (2d Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">Judge Friendly, whose opinion states the majority view in <em>Silverman </em>on the political contributions counts, only assumes <em>arguendo </em>that Judge Moore\u2019s statement of the essential elements is correct and eventually holds no reasonable jury could be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of defendant\u2019s guilt on these charges \u2014 a failure of proof. The only conclusion, therefore, that can be drawn from <em>Silverman\u2019s </em>discussion on the political contributions counts is that the essential elements were not delineated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-11\">The Government contends that United States v. Ferrara, <em>supra, </em>makes \u201ccertain that Judge Friendly * * * had not rejected Judge Moore\u2019s analysis in <em>Sil-verman.\u201d </em>While that analysis might be correct, we do not read <em>Ferrara </em>that broadly. The Government in <em>Ferrara </em>introduced evidence that there was a lack of authorization for long-term auto leases made for the personal benefit of the union officials. The court said that \u201c[b]y its verdict of guilty the jury found that appellants, without authority <em>and for personal </em>purposes, entered into long-term auto leases for themselves and their Union friends.\u201d United States v. Ferrara, 451 F.2d at 96 (emphasis added). It also said in relation to another \u00a7 501(c) count that \u201c[t]he first defense to this charge was that the dinners were for Union business, but there was evidence that they were merely social occasions.\u201d 451 F.2d at 96. Finally, the court concluded on this charge that \u201cplainly the jury was justified that these were unauthorized expenditures for personal benefit.\u201d 451 F.2d at 96. Obviously, the jury could have concluded from the evidence presented that there was fraudulent <em>intent, </em>lack of authorization, <em>and </em>lack of union benefit. Since <em>Ferrara </em>neither discusses the district court\u2019s charge nor states the elements of the offense, we certainly cannot say that the Second Circuit has established lack of union benefit as an essential element of a \u00a7 501(c) offense. Rather, Judge Moore\u2019s well-reasoned opinion in <em>Silver-man </em>appears to state the Circuit\u2019s view where there is a lack of authorization for the expenditures, and Judge Friendly\u2019s opinion in <em>Silverman </em>states that Circuit\u2019s view where there has been a sufficient authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>Thus, we cannot accept defendants\u2019 view that \u201clack of benefit to the union\u201d is an essential element in this case involving the unauthorized increased salaries of the Union\u2019s officers. We think that the Government sufficiently proved a submissible case by demonstrating that the officers fraudulently intended to deprive the Union of its funds by taking unauthorized salary increases, that is, by knowingly taking increases not authorized according to the Union\u2019s constitution and bylaws. According to Judge Moore\u2019s statement of the essential elements in <em>Silverman, </em>the Government proved a <em>prima facie </em>case by establishing fraudulent intent and lack of authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">If the Government establishes fraudulent intent and lack of proper authorization, it should not also be saddled with an additional burden of proving lack of benefit to the union. To do so would emasculate the Act. Aside from the difficulties of proving a negative fact, such as lack of union benefit, we do not think that Congress intended that union funds be the fair subject of embezzlement that is only vaguely premised on claimed union benefit. The conduct of these defendants cannot by any stretch of the imagination or by the use of sophisticated semantics be raised to the level of conduct required of fiduciaries, who at common law and in the ordinary context of that term are charged with a high degree of integrity and candor in their dealings with fiduciary funds, together with strict proscriptions against self-dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">Section 501(a) specifically says that a fiduciary responsibility includes expending union funds \u201cin accordance with its constitution and bylaws.\u201d The overall purpose of the Act is to protect union property and funds, to provide full disclosure of financial affairs of the union, to establish self-help remedies for union members, and to impose criminal sanctions under \u00a7 501(c). The unauthorized expenditures of union funds with a fraudulent intent alone is exactly what the Act was attempting to reach. The purpose of the Act was \u201cto insure that full information concerning the financial and internal administrative practices and procedures of labor organizations\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>is available to union members. The exercise of power by union officials is not unfettered, but checked in the first instance by proper approval within its own ranks. The salary increases, which were not approved by the Executive Board, effectively were kept secret until the second reeleetion of defendants. Section 501(e) was designed to reach this exact type of occurrence. In upholding the constitutionality of \u00a7 501(c), the District Court in the Northern District of New York perceptively said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-10\">[T]he power of a labor organization to bargain collectively in matters affecting commerce, all of which is now regulated by statute, would be lessened by the misuse or abuse of its funds to the diminution of its power to bargain in matters affecting commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1239-11\">United States v. Haverlick, 195 F.Supp. 331, 332 (N.D.N.Y.1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-12\">The Government appropriately points out that several \u201cfelonious taking\u201d statutes do not require a showing of lack of benefit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 501(c) should be interpreted similarly. We do not think that lack of union benefit need be established when the funds are <em>unauthorizedly </em>expended, because \u00a7 501(c)\u2019s language of \u201cembezzles, steals, or unlawfully and willfully abstracts or converts to his own use\u201d only \u201cmeans * * * \u2018not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>the use of the entruster.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Harrelson, 223 F.Supp. 869, 870 (E.D.Mich.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">We, therefore, hold that the essential elements of a \u00a7 501(c) crime in this case are: (1) fraudulent intent to deprive the union of its funds and (2) lack of authorization according to the union\u2019s constitution and bylaws.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since we have held that the salary increases lacked the proper authorization, we do not reach the issue whether there is a \u00a7 501(c) violation when there has been a fraudulent intent and proper authorization, but a lack of benefit to the union. That situation presents a more troublesome issue: namely, does \u00a7 501(c) protect union funds by penalizing union officials when the members themselves have authorized union officials to expend union funds for non-union purposes? That issue must wait for another day..</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">In summary, fraudulent intent to deprive the union of its funds and a demonstrated lack of authorization, is sufficient for a prosecution under \u00a7 501(c). Lack of union benefit is not essential, but fraudulent intent must be proved; that is, the intent to deprive the union of its funds, not an intent to deprive the union of its funds that are not expended for union benefit. For example, if by mistake or accident a union official spends funds that are unauthorized, he is not liable under \u00a7 501(c).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To hold that \u201clack of union benefit\u201d must be affirmatively proved by the prosecution and to allow a showing of union benefit to vitiate fraudulent intent in a case involving unauthorized expenditures would allow union officials to handily evade the broad fiduciary provisions of \u00a7 501(c) and the essential elements of a \u00a7 501(c) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-12\">Defendants finally contend that proffered evidence, for example, on defendants\u2019 longer working hours, was \u201chighly probative\u201d on the matter of intent. According to our above discussion, a case involving lack of authorization under \u00a7 501(c) does not require a proof of lack of benefit to the union as an essential element, nor is a showing of benefit relevant to disproving fraudulent intent to deprive the union of its funds where the disbursement was unauthorized. The District Court properly refused to admit all such evidence on the grounds of irrelevancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-13\">Judgment of convictions affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1233-14\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c) provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-15\">\n<em>Embezzlement of assets; penalty</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-16\">(e) Any person who embezzles, steals, or unlawfully and willfully abstracts or converts to his own use, or the use of another, any of the moneys, funds, securities, property, or other assets of a labor organization of which he is an officer, or by which he is employed, directly or indirectly, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1234-10\">.
