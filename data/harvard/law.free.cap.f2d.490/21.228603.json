The district court granted leave to appellant Puyallup Tribe to intervene as a party plaintiff in both actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">On August 6, 1971 the district court entered an order applicable to both cases assuming, but not deciding, that it had jurisdiction and staying all proceedings pending exhaustion of state remedies. Jack Moses and Puyallup Tribe appealed from the stay order. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issues on this appeal are (1) whether the stay order of the district court is appealable; and (2) if so, whether the stay order was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Following oral argument on appeal an order was entered deferring a ruling in these cases until the Supreme Court decided three cases in which certiorari had been granted or probable jurisdiction noted, i. e., Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones et al., MeClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Commission, and Tonasket v. The State of Washington.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\"><em>Mescalero Apache Tribe </em>and <em>McClana-han </em>were decided on March 27, 1973.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On April 24, 1973 a per curiam was entered in <em>Tonasket </em>reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-13\">\u201cThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington is vacated, and the case is remanded to that Court for reconsideration in light of \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7 of c. 157, 1972 Session Laws of the State of Washington, and this Court\u2019s decision in McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm\u2019n, No. 71-834 (March 27, 1973).\u201d 411 U.S. 451, 93 S.Ct. 1941, 36 L.Ed.2d 385.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-15\">Counsel were invited to comment on the effect of these decisions of the Supreme Court and whether a decision on this appeal should be deferred until the Supreme Court of Washington reconsiders its decision in <em>Tonasket. </em>In response appellee states that \u201cThe issues of state law, for the resolution of which the U. S. Supreme Court remanded the <em>Tonasket </em>case to the state supreme court, may well have a bearing on the merits of the present controversy\u201d and that a full resolution on the merits cannot be obtained until <em>Tonasket </em>is finally determined. Appellee urges that the State of Washington be permitted to proceed with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>action in the Pierce County Superior Court; that this court no longer defer a decision; and that the order of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Appellants argue that the reconsideration of <em>Tonasket </em>will not necessarily have a bearing on these cases and that the district court will be able to render a decision based on \u201cpresent federal law\u201d, including the decision in <em>McClan-ahan. </em>In the alternative, appellants urge that the decision on this appeal be deferred further until the Washington Supreme Court has reconsidered <em>Tonasket, </em>so that this court will be in a better position \u201cto instruct the District Court as to what issues should be considered if and when the case is remanded\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">We have concluded to remand now to the district court for further consideration in the light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\n<em>Appealability of Stay Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aeg\">Appellee contends that the stay order is not an appealable order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, which provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States * * It is argued that the stay order is not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The rule here applicable was summarized in 9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, para. 110.20 [4.-2] at 251 (2d ed. 1973) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">\u201cIf there is no action pending in a state court<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the district court stays the action before it and directs the parties to go to the state court to obtain a ruling as to what the state law is, the stay is appealable as a final order under 28 USC \u00a7 1291. If in-junctive relief is sought in the district court action, such a stay is also ap-pealable as a denial of an injunction under 28 USC \u00a7 1292(a)(1).\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGE\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s order staying proceedings \u201cpending exhaustion of state remedies by plaintiffs\u201d is an appealable order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">\n<em>Subject Matter Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ABA\">Assuming, without deciding, that it had jurisdiction, the district court stated that \u201cupon the record now presented it is clear the Court should not interfere with exercise of state tax power where adequate remedies are available to plaintiffs in the courts of this state,\u201d citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-15\">\u201cThe district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-16\">At first glance it would appear that \u00a7 1341 bars this action. There are exceptions to \u00a7 1341, however, and one of them is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-17\">The Supreme Court has said that \u201c\u00a7 1341 does not act as a restriction upon suits by the United States to protect itself and its instrumentalities from unconstitutional state exactions.\u201d Department of Employment v. United States, 385 U.S. 355, 358, 87 S.Ct. 464, 467, 17 L.Ed.2d 414 (1966). This rule, commonly known as the federal instrumentality doctrine, has its clearest application in cases where the United States is both a plaintiff and \u201chas in fact a proprietary interest\u201d. United States v. Arlington County, Commonwealth of Virginia, 326 F.2d 929, 931 (4 Cir. 1964).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the instrumentality doctrine has also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>been held applicable where the Government sues on behalf of a private party in order to protect and enforce its policies with respect to those in whom the United States has a special interest, though perhaps not a proprietary one.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The doctrine also applies where the United States is not a party plaintiff, if the suit could have been brought by the United States and is in fact brought by parties who could properly be co-plaintiffs with the United States. Agua Caliente Band of Mission Ind. v. County of Riverside, 442 F.2d 1184, 1186 (9 Cir. 1971), cert, denied, 405 U.S. 933, 92 S.Ct. 930, 30 L.Ed.2d 809 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">There can be no doubt that the United States has a special interest in its ward Indians, with respect to which the Government \u201chas charged itself with moral obligations of the highest responsibility and trust\u201d. Seminole Nation v. United States, 316 U.S. 286, 297, 62 S. Ct. 1049, 1054, 86 L.Ed. 1480 (1942). This \u201cspecial interest\u201d has manifested itself in the form of a federal policy to protect Indians and Indian property from state taxation. This was recognized most recently in <em>McClanahan, supra </em>at 170-171 of 411 U.S., at 1261 of 93 S.Ct., where the Court quoted with approval \u201ca leading text on Indian problems\u201d as summarizing \u201cthe relevant law: \u2018State laws generally are not applicable to tribal Indians on an Indian reservation except where Congress has expressly provided that State laws shall apply. It follows that Indians and Indian property on an Indian reservation are not subject to State taxation except by virtue of express authority conferred upon the State by act of Congress.\u2019 U. S. Dept, of the Interior, Federal Indian Law 845 (1958) * * *\"</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-14\">\u201c1362. Indian tribes. \u2014 The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions, brought by any Indian tribe or band with a governing body duly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the matter in controversy arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-15\">While \u00a7 1362 does not confer jurisdiction with respect to the claims of Moses <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the statutory basis of jurisdiction is not expressly alleged, it seems clear from the allegations of the complaint that the district court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-16\">We conclude that the district court has subject matter jurisdiction over appellants\u2019 claims, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1362, and that this jurisdiction is not defeated by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, since it falls within the instrumentality doctrine\u2019s exception to the jurisdictional bar of \u00a7 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-17\">Having concluded that the district court has jurisdiction, we turn to the other rather complex factual and procedural issues raised by the respective parties and which should be resolved initially by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the district court in the light of comments in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\n<em>Impact of Tonasket, McClanahan, and Mescolero</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In view of the \u00abremand of <em>Tonasket </em>to the Supreme Court of Washington for further consideration, the district court may properly stay further proceedings in these cases pending the resolution of any state law issues in <em>Tonasket. </em>It seems clear, and the parties apparently agree, that the resolution of the state law issues in <em>Tonasket </em>may have some bearing on the determination of- these cases on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The Supreme Court of Washington was also directed to reconsider <em>Tonasket </em>in the light of <em>McClanahan, </em>where the Court held that the State of Arizona has no jurisdiction to impose a tax on the income of Navajo Indians residing on the Navajo Reservation, whose income is wholly derived from reservation sources. In limiting the effect of its decision the Court said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">\u201cIt may be helpful to begin our discussion of the law applicable to this complex area with a brief statement of what this case does not involve. We are not here dealing with Indians who have left or never inhabited reservations set aside for their exclusive use or who do not possess the usual accoutrements of tribal self-government. * * * Nor * * * is this a case where the State seeks to reach activity undertaken by reservation Indians on nonreservation lands. * * * Rather, this case involves the narrow question whether the State may tax a reservation Indian for income earned exclusively on the reservation.\u201d 411 U.S. at 167-168, 93 S.Ct. at 1260.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">In <em>Mescolero, </em>the Court clearly recognized the distinction between income from activities on and off Indian reservations, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-12\">\u201cabsent cession of jurisdiction or other federal statutes permitting it, there has been no satisfactory authority for taxing Indian reservation lands or Indian income from activities carried on within the boundaries of the reservation, and McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm\u2019n, <em>supra, </em>lays to rest any doubt in this respect by holding that such taxation is not permissible absent congressional consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-13\">\u201cBut tribal activities conducted outside the reservation present different considerations. \u2018State authority over Indians is yet more extensive over activities . . . not on any reservation.\u2019 Organized Village of Kake [Organized Village of Kake v. Egan], <em>supra </em>[369 U.S. 60], at 75 [82 S.Ct. 562, 7 L.Ed.2d 573]. Absent express federal law to the contrary, Indians going beyond reservation boundaries have generally be held subject to nondiscriminatory state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the State.\u201d 411 U.S. at 148-149, 93 S.Ct. at 1270.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-15\">Neither appellant Moses nor plaintiff King comes within the precise category held exempt from state taxation in <em>Mc-Clanahan. </em>Appellant Moses is a member of the Puyallup Tribe, but the land on which he was selling cigarettes and other tobacco products was not within the exterior boundaries of the Puyal-lup Indian Reservation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> King is not a member of the Puyallup Tribe but was selling cigarettes within the exterior boundaries of the Reservation. Moreover, while <em>McClanahan </em>would prevent the imposition of a state excise tax on the sale of cigarettes by a member of the Tribe to Indians on the reservation, it does not reach the question of imposition of such a tax on sales to non-Indians.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The district court will of course consider the effect of <em>McClanahan </em>and <em>Mescalero </em>under the facts in these cases in the light of the final determination in <em>To-nasket.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\n<em>Abstention for Determination of Other State Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Appellee argues that in addition to any issues of state law involved in <em>Tonasket, </em>there is a \u201csecond set of issues\u201d of state law critical to a determination of these cases, i. e., the application of RCW 37.12.-010 and the meaning of the phrases \u201cIndian territory * * * country and lands\u201d and \u201cestablished Indian reservation\u201d as used in that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Under RCW 37.12.010 the S'.,ate of Washington assumed criminal and civil jurisdiction \u201cover Indians and Indian territory, reservations, country and lands\u201d within the state. However, except for eight categories of jurisdiction,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> not including taxation, it was provided that this assumption of jurisdiction did \u201cnot apply to Indians when on their tribal lands or allotted lands within an established Indian reservation and held in trust by the United States or subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Abstention, of course, is proper where state action is challenged in federal court as being contrary to federal law, and there are questions of state law that may be dispositive of the case; that is, where the action could be held illegal as a matter of state law, thereby obviating the need for a decision on the federal issues. Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941). See also Wright, Federal Courts \u00a7 52 (2d Ed. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">In this case a decision on the federal issues can be avoided only by a holding as a matter of state law that the lands in question are within \u201can established Indian reservation\u201d, with respect to which Washington has not assumed taxing jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">The Supreme Court of Washington, however, has twice held that \u201cthe Puyal-lup Indian Reservation has ceased to exist\u201d. Department of Game v. Puyallup Tribe, Inc., 70 Wash.2d 245, 422 P.2d 754, 759 (1967), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 391 U.S. 392, 88 S.Ct. 1725, 20 L.Ed.2d 689 (1968) ;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> State v. Satiacum, 80 Wash.2d 492, 495 P.2d 1035, 1036 (1972). Under these decisions the Washington Supreme Court has already in effect held that the Puyallup Reservation is not \u201can established Indian reservation\u201d within the meaning of RCW 37.12.010. The trust land on which Moses sold cigarettes obviously is not on an \u201cestablished Indian reservation\u201d, since it is not within the exterior boundaries of any Indian reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">On October 15, 1973 the Supreme Court, in a per curiam opinion, granted certiorari in <em>Satiacum </em>and vacated the judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington, stating that it appeared that the petitioner might have been fishing at a location outside the boundaries of what is, or was, the Puyallup Indian Reservation when the alleged offenses were committed, and if so, the Supreme Court of Washington had unnecessarily addressed and determined \u201cthe federal question whether the Puyallup Reserva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>tion \u2018has ceased to exist\u2019 \u201d.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> 414 U.S. 1, 94 S.Ct. 209, 38 L.Ed.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">On January 29, 1973 the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, in United States of America v. The State of Washington, an action involving the enforcement of fishing laws, held that the Puyallup Reservation has ceased to exist. That case is now pending on appeal in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"> The question of whether the Puyallup Reservation has been abolished or terminated is of course a federal question to be decided on .the basis of federal treaties, statutes and administrative actions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The present status of the Reservation may well prove critical in resolving the issues in these cases. While we find no basis for application of the abstention doctrine for determination of state issues, we do recognize that the district court may deem it advisable to defer further proceedings pending final determination of <em>Satiacum </em>and <em>State of Washington </em>as well as <em>Tonasket.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">We do not hold that the taxing jurisdiction necessarily depends upon a holding that the Puyallup Reservation has ceased to exist. If it is determined that the Reservation is still in existence, it will be necessary for the district court to determine in the light of the final determination of <em>Tonasket </em>(and other applicable law) whether the State of Washington may impose its cigarette tax laws on cigarettes sold (1) by Moses on trust land outside the exterior boundaries of the Puyallup Reservation; and (2) by King or a Puyallup Indian within the exterior boundaries of the Puyallup Reservation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">\n<em>Three-Judge Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">King filed a request for a three-judge court, with a supporting brief. While the question of the propriety of a three-judge court was not raised on appeal, it may become necessary for the district court to consider this question under the complaints filed by Moses and King.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">The jurisdiction of a three-judge court is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281. The jurisdictional requirements under this section are that \u201ca state statute or administrative order must be challenged, a state officer must be a party defendant, injunctive relief must be sought, and it must be claimed that the statute or order is contrary to the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Wright, Federal Courts \u00a7 50 (2d Ed. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">A three-judge court is required if a state statute is. challenged on the ground that it is contrary to some provision of the United States Constitution other than .the Supremacy Clause.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> With respect to the claims of the Puyallup Tribe, the application of the Washington cigarette tax statutes is chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>lenged only on the ground that these statutes violate the Supremacy Clause. Moses and King, however, challenge the statutes as violative, not only of the Supremacy Clause, but also of the Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In summary, we conclude that the two cases should be remanded to the district court for further consideration in the light of this opinion, and we recognize the propriety of the district court\u2019s staying further proceedings pending the final determination of <em>Tonasket, Satiacum </em>and <em>State of Washington. </em>The final determination in <em>Satiacum </em>may of course be dis-positive of <em>State of Washington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-16\">. When the complaint was filed it was assumed that the land on which Moses made his sales was within the exterior boundaries of the Puyallup Reservation. It was later determined that this land was outside the boundaries of the Reservation. It is, however, trust land under the control of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-17\">. No appeal was taken by plaintiff King.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b97-18\">. We recognized that these cases would not be dispositive of all of the issues raised in the instant cases, but concluded that the decisions might be helpful to this court in resolving this appeal and to the district court in the event of a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-19\">In addition, following the district court\u2019s order of August 6, 1971, a declaratory judgment action was instituted by the State of Washington in the Superior Court for Pierce County against the appellants and others to test the question of whether cigarettes and other tobacco products can be sold within the exterior boundaries of the Puyallup Reservation without complying with the revenue laws of the State of Washington. That case was removed to federal court and a motion to remand to state court was filed. At this court\u2019s request and by agreement of counsel, no further action has been taken in that case pending determination of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b97-21\">.

It may be noted that the brief for the United States as amicus curiae filed by the Solicitor General in <em>Tonasket </em>contended that the taxes of the State of Washington at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>in that case were invalid insofar as they applied to sales to Indians residing on the Reservation. Appellant contended that the sales to non-Indians were also exempt. The Solicitor General expressed no view on that issue, although he did point out certain considerations which might be of assistance to the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b101-10\">. The eight categories of jurisdiction assumed by Washington with respect to all Indians and Indian territory within the state include: compulsory school attendance; public assistance ; domestic relations ; mental illness ; juvenile delinquency ; adoption proceedings ; dependent children; and operation of motor vehicles upon the public streets, alleys, roads, and highways.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b101-17\">. This case involved the rights of members of two Indian tribes to fish \u201cat all usual and accustomed grounds\u201d off the reservations. The Supreme Court of the United States did not reach the holding of the Washington court that the Puyallup Reservation had ceased to exist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\">. The Court remanded for resolution by the state courts of the factual issue of whether the alleged offenses took place outside the boundaries of what is, or was, the Reservation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\">. <em>See </em>Satiacum v.

Arnett, 412 U.S. 481, 93 S.Ct. 2245, 37 L.Ed.2d 92 (1973), where a state court in California held that the Klamath River Reservation in 1892 \u201cfor all practical purposes almost immediately lost its identity\u201d. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and the Supreme Court of California denied a hearing. The Court reversed, stating that its \u201cconclusion that the 1892 Act did not terminate the Kla-math River Reservation is reinforced by repeated recognition of the reservation status of the land after 1892 by the Department of the Interior and by Congress\u201d. 412 U.S. at 505, 93 S.Ct. at 2258.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">The Associate Solicitor for Indian Affairs, Office of the Solicitor, U.S. Department of the Interior, in an opinion dated March 26, 1971 with respect to the \u201cStatus of the Puyallup Indian Reservation in the State of Washington\u201d, concluded that \u201cboth the reservation and the Puyallup Tribe still exist as legal entities\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b102-16\">.
