BRYAN, Senior Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b398-19\">A secondary boycott in violation of the National Labor Relations Act, Section 8(b) (4) (i) (ii) (B), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>158(b) (4) (i) (ii) (B), as amended,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was pursued by each of two labor unions, the National Labor Relations Board has found.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the charges of a general contractor,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> complaints were issued and jointly heard. In both cases the contractor, while accepting the Board\u2019s decision, nevertheless sought review- in an endeavor to broaden the fact findings and legal conclusions; the unions asked vacation of the Board\u2019s remedial order. Countering, the Board prays enforcement of its order. We enforce the order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">With a hearing before the Trial Examiner waived, the controversy was put before him on briefs and facts agreed. The Board adopted the \u201cfindings, conclusions and recommendations of the Administrative Law Judge [the Examiner] \u201d, summed up as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u201cThe relevant stipulated facts as noted by the Administrative Law Judge show that on June 17, 1970 George Koch Sons, Inc., hereinafter Koch, was awarded a contract by General Electric Company, hereinafter G.E., for the design, manufacture, and installation of two industrial finishing systems to be used in the preparation of metal appliances at G.E.\u2019s plant in East Columbia, Maryland. Pursuant to a contract interpretation calling for the pretesting of certain pipes for this system, Koch prefabricated certain pipes at its Indiana facility using its own employees to do this fabrication work. Thereafter, this pipe was utilized to pretest the systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">\u201cKoch subcontracted to Phillips Plumbing and Heating Co., hereinafter Phillips, the work of installing all pipe required in the final assembly of the systems at the G.E. site. Pursuant to its contract with Koch and the specifications made a part thereof, Phillips was required to install, <em>inter alia, </em>the prefabricated pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">\u201cBoth Respondents [the unions] had a current agreement with the Mechanical Contractors Association of Maryland, hereinafter the Association. Although not a member of the Association, Phillips was a signatory to the current agreements and, pursuant to their provisions, employed members of Respondent Local 48 for plumbing work and members of Respondent Local 438 for steamfitting-pipefitting work. Both of these agreements contained the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-15\">\u2018All pipe of any size used on the job shall be cut and threaded by journeymen and apprentices either by machine or by hand and all fitting to be made up (of any size), caulked, or otherwise, fitted to any pipe, must be done on the job or in the contractor\u2019s shop by journeymen and apprentices.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>As a result of these provisions, which have been included in the Respondents\u2019 collective-bargaining agreements for years, the cutting, threading, and fitting of pipes have customarily been performed on the jobsite or in shops within the Baltimore vicinity by individuals who are employed by the employers signatory to the agreements and who are members of or are represented by the Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u201cBeginning about March 15, 1971, Koch shipped both the prefabricated pipe (that used in the pretesting) and certain nonprefabricated pipe to the G.E. jobsite. The employees of Phillips represented by the Respondents worked on and installed the nonprefabricated pipe without incident. But, when Phillips attempted to assign the work of installing the prefabricated pipe to the employees represented by the Respondents, Phillips was told by officers and agents of both Respondents that the Respondents would not let their members or employees represented by them install that prefabricated pipe because it had not been cut, threaded, and fitted on the jobsite or in Phillips\u2019 shop in accordance with the above-quoted provisions of their agreements with the Association. Thereafter, since on or about May 1, 1971, Phillips\u2019 employees who were members of or represented by the Respondents, pursuant to instructions from Respondents\u2019 officials, refused to install the prefabricated pipe although requested to do so by Phillips, while they continued to install the nonprefabricated pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u201cThe Administrative Law Judge concluded that \u2018by the actions of their officers and agents in stating to Phillips that they would not allow employees of Phillips who were members of or represented by Respondents to install the prefabricated pipe on the G.E. job because the pipes were not cut, threaded, and fitted with the facilities on the jobsite or in Phillips\u2019 shop by employees represented by Respondents, or by so instructing employees of Phillips, both Respondents violated Section 8(b)(4) (i) (ii) (B)\u2019 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u201cWe agree with this conclusion of the Administrative Law Judge. However, in view of the importance of the issue presented, we deem it necessary to explicate in detail our reasons for doing so.\u201d [Footnotes omitted.]</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Thereupon the unions were directed to \u201ccease' and desist\u201d from encouraging employees to refuse to perform services where the object was to force Phillips to refrain from installing prefabricated pipe. For us this conduct examples the classic secondary boycott. NLRB v. Operating Engineers, 400 U.S. 297, 302, 303, 91 S.Ct. 402, 27 L.Ed.2d 398 (1971). It is fair to state now that we see the Board\u2019s decision, adjudging the unions guilty of a secondary boycott, firmly bottomed on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The unions bear down on the Board\u2019s opinion as but an all-out exploitation of the \u201cright-to-control\u201d doctrine. Untangled, the doctrine is that if an employer is not legally empowered to meet his employees\u2019 demand, then they cannot lawfully strike him fo* his failure to accede. Applied now, the clauses of the Phillips-union agreements \u2014 that the pipe must be cut and threaded on the jobsite or at Phillips\u2019 shop \u2014 could not be pressed against Phillips if it was not vested with the right to fix where pipe fabrication would be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">The unions dismiss \u201cright-to-control\u201d as obsolete dogma, discredited, if not fully eclipsed, by National Woodwork Manufacturers Ass\u2019n v. National Labor Relations Board, 386 U.S. 612, 87 S.Ct. 1250, 18 L.Ed.2d 357 (1967). Further, it is argued that this gauge, if at all still viable, is now misconceived by the Board as the end-all, critical determinant that a boycott is secondary rather than primary. Additionally, the unions expound those in suit to be work preservation clauses, purposed solely to retain for the Phillips\u2019 employees tasks customarily performed by them and avouched in <em>National Woodwork </em>to be a traditional right of labor, in no wise affronting the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">In replication, the Board and Koch denounce the clauses as actually projected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>by the unions to be \u201ctactically calculated to satisfy union objectives elsewhere.\u201d <em>National Woodwork, </em>at 644, 87 S.Ct. at 1268. When so activated, the argument runs, the restrictions engender the forbidden secondary boycott. Cf. NLRB v. Denver Building &amp; Construction Trades Council, 341 U.S. 675, 686, 687, 71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed. 1284 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The unions err. <em>National Woodwork </em>did not scuttle the \u201cright-to-control\u201d test for, obviously, the point was not before the Court. 386 U.S. at 616-617, fn. 3, 87 S.Ct. 1250. Nor does the Board presently write in disregard of <em>National Woodwork. </em>Rather, it reads that decision for what it is, a delineation of that degree of proof which establishes a permissible primary boycott but falls short of evidencing the interdicted secondary boycott.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Further, <em>National Woodwork, </em>at 644-645, 87 S.Ct. at 1268, after defining a preservation-of-work boycott, signally declares that when \u201cthe agreements and boycott were tactically calculated to satisfy union objectives elsewhere\u201d they present a secondary boycott. The further lesson of <em>National Woodwork </em>is that the ascertainment of whether the \u201cagreements and boycott\u201d do have this effect can be made only upon inquiry of \u201call the surrounding circumstances\u201d. Notably, right-to-control is not excluded from this consideration. Id. at 644, 87 S.Ct. at 1268. Despite the union\u2019s opposing contention, the Board has not exalted right-to-control as per se the conclusive indicium of a secondary boycott. On the contrary, the Board obediently followed the Court\u2019s instruction, according weight to all existing and relevant circumstances. This consideration included extraordinary facts well beyond the events of <em>National Woodwork.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The incidents not paralleled in <em>National Woodwork </em>were these: no right-to-control was possessed by the employer ; the unions were informed of the employer\u2019s lack of control; the employer-contractor agreement required the fabrication to be done at the latter contractor\u2019s location; and the contract between that contractor and the owner obligated that contractor to fabricate the pipe at its place of business. These circumstances are quite material in differencing the facts here from those of <em>National Woodwork. </em>The Court there did not have to ponder these added circumstances to the existence or absence of a secondary boycott. Thus it did not preordain decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">The decisive question, therefore, is whether in the light of \u201call the surrounding circumstances\u201d the agreements and boycott between Phillips and the unions were \u201ctactically calculated to satisfy union objectives elsewhere\u201d. We think the Board was right in concluding that they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">To begin with, since the unions were aware of the conditions in the Phillips-Koch pact, they knew that Phillips did not have control of the pipe fabrication. Consequently, their enforcement of the collective bargaining terms evinces the unions\u2019 intention to press their objectives \u201celsewhere\u201d other than upon Phillips.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">Moreover, Koch and the unions were not in privity; neither was bounden to the other. Koch, then, was a neutral, and yet with regard to it the unions still sought to prosecute the conditions in order to \u201csatisfy the union objectives\u201d beyond Phillips. This, too, is precisely \u2014 \u2022 and even more emphatically \u2014 the posture of the unions with respect to G.E. To repeat, these facts confirm the Board\u2019s finding of the tactical effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">These conclusions are not gainsaid or diminished by the unions\u2019 insistence that the stipulations are enforceable as work-preservation measures. The Board did not nullify the clauses as work-preservation assurances; they remained available for appropriate application. However, regardless of their initial in-tendment, they could by undue extension, over and above the Phillips-employee relationship, lead to violations of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (B) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>That the clauses have been so exerted in this instance is, it appears, precisely the illegality the Board perceived in the unions\u2019 actions. Like the Board, we see Phillips as not an \u201coffender\u201d but rather a neutral vis-a-vis its employees; therefore the effect of the strike was to compel Phillips unlawfully \u201cto cease doing business with any other person\u201d. Granted, the efficacy of work-preservation covenants is not to be stunted because of the severity of their impact. <em>National Woodwork, </em>at 627, 87 S.Ct. 1250; see also NLRB v. Operating Engineers, supra, 400 U.S. 297, at 303, 91 S.Ct. 402, 27 L.Ed.2d 398. Nevertheless, if a result of that pressure is to cause a neutral employer (here Phillips) to terminate his business with another (Koch), then such enforcement fouls the Act. That this use or effect of the clauses is inconsistent with the intent of the Act is corroborated in <em>National Woodwork, </em>at p. 625,. 87 S.Ct. at p. 1258:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ang-dedup-0\">\u201cThe other subsections of \u00a7 8(b)(4) of the Act were similarly limited to protecting employers in the position of neutrals between contending parties .... The central theme pervading these provisions of protection for the neutral employer confirms that . . . Congress likewise meant to protect the employer only from union pressures designed to involve him in disputes not his own.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">See also <em>Denver Building, </em>supra, 341 U. S. 675, at 689, 71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed. 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Joining the Board, we are unwilling to construe the Phillips-unions contract so rigidly as to trammel Phillips in its intercourse with customers outside of Maryland, e. g. Koch or G.E. So severe' an execution of the collective bargaining agreement would not only invade the rights of Maryland contractors, such as Phillips, but it would hobble their interstate transactions. Not to reprove the boycott of Phillips would be a plain discard of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (B). It would be tacit approval of the unions\u2019 compulsion of Phillips to \u201ccease doing business\u201d with any person, in-State or out, not a signatory to the instant Maryland collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Conversely, in like circumstances, not only Koch but every other in- or out-of-state contractor would be unable to contract with any Maryland business, which was a party to the collective agreement, without subjection to the agreement\u2019s restrictive clauses. Incidentally, the employees of Koch and of like outsiders would at the same time suffer from these limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Admittedly, an employer should not have an unfettered license to contract out work and, as a result, acquire a shield from union collective bargaining agreements. Certainly where the employer was initially in a position to accede to potential union demands through the negotiating stages of the contract, then he should not later be deemed a neutral if he intentionally forfeited his potential for control. But the circumstances now presented show that G.E. required Koch to pretest the pipe at the latter\u2019s location in Indiana- \u2014 thus away from the jobsite \u2014 and for this purpose the pipe had first to be fabricated. Since Koch was inextricably tied to this schedule, Phillips had no bargaining power with respect to this work. Consequently, Phillips did not surrender its right-to-control, for it never had any.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">Of course, Phillips and its immediate contractor could fake the appearance of a secondary boycott by a collusive contract providing that the work ordinarily belonging to Phillips' employees should be performed elsewhere. But there is not even an intimation or trace of connivance or such complicity here. Indeed, the extraordinary circumstances outlined earlier banish any suspicion of it. Phillips had no motive to favor the arrangement with Koch. Indeed, it deprived Phillips of profitable work.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">Finally, we dispose of the case under \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) of the Act, and notwithstanding references in the arguments of counsel to \u00a7 8(e), we observe nothing in the latter section to warrant modification of the conclusions herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">Order enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\">.
