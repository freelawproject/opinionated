Spencer et al., 5 Cir. 1972, 468 F.2d 553, the district court held an evidentiary hearing and entered its opinion order<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> finding adversely to the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s contentions as to the factual issues directed to be fried by our remand. Those issues were (1) whether or not the action<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Board of Regents of San Jacinto Junior College in not renewing Ms. Lewis\u2019 teaching contract was taken in retaliation for her exercise of First Amendment rights and her rights of freedom of association; and (2) whether the adoption of the policy without a recognition therein of plaintiff and her husband\u2019s unique situation (viz, recently married and the only couple in the school to whom the policy was applicable) through such a device as a grandfather clause or prospective application, would make impermissible as applied an otherwise constitutionally valid policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-15\">The trial court\u2019s hearing fully ventilated these issues and his findings of fact settled them, unless we determine that his findings were \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d. Rule 52(a), F.R.Civ.P.; United States v. National Association of Real Estate Boards, 1950, 339 U.S. 485, 495-496, 70 S.Ct. 711, 94 L.Ed. 1007. The task of demonstrating that the findings of a trial court are \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d is a heavy burden indeed. We are satisfied that the plaintiff-appellant has not met that burden on this appeal. Our view is rather that the trial court\u2019s findings were required by the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>presented, to the extent that we would seriously consider assigning a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d label if contrary findings had been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-8\">.
