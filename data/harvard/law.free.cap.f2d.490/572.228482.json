Okla. Const. Art. XXVII \u00a7 4; 37 O.S. \u00a7 538(h). The writs were stayed on appeal and we now find them to be improvidently granted and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-18\">On July 18, 1972, an Amtrak train moving interstate through Oklahoma, was boarded at Oklahoma City by law enforcement officers who found liquor being sold on the train by the drink. George Bell, an Amtrak employee, was charged with operating an open saloon in violation of Oklahoma law. On September 6, 1972 Amtrak filed this suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1332, 1337 seeking a declaratory judgment holding (1) Oklahoma\u2019s liquor laws could not be enforced against it because Congress had exempted its operations from \u201cany State or other law pertaining to the transportation of passengers by railroad as it relates to rates, routes, or service\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 546(c); and (2) in the prosecution of its employee, George Bell, the appellants had engaged in \u201cconscious willful discrimination\u201d in the application of the Oklahoma liquor laws \u201cresulting in discriminatory enforcement\u201d as prohibited under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court, after a hearing, granted the declaratory judgment prayed for, found discriminatory enforcement present and issued a permanent injunction \u201cto protect and effectuate\u201d its decrees. 354 F. Supp. 887, 893, 894 (1972). Amtrak\u2019s first issue based on its claimed exemption from Oklahoma law was raised and decided adversely to it in National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Miller, 358 F.Supp. 1321 (D.C.Kan., 1973), affirmed, 414 U.S. 948, 94 S.Ct. 285, 38 L.Ed.2d 205 (1973). It is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-19\">We likewise find no merit in Amtrak\u2019s second contention. At the outset the Court\u2019s circumvention of the anti-injunction statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283, as the appellants noted, may well be dis-positive. Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971) admonishes that federal \u201ccourts of equi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>ty should not act, and particularly should not act to restrain a criminal prosecution, when the moving party has an adequate remedy at law.\u201d 401 U.S. at 43, 91 S.Ct. at 750. In the framework of this case, the <em>Younger </em>rule places quite a heavy burden on one seeking injunctive relief. The finding by the District Court here that its failure to act would result in irreparable injury, was clearly erroneous under prevailing standards. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908) ; Fenner v. Boykin, 271 U.S. 240, 244, 46 S.Ct. 492, 70 L.Ed. 927 (1926); Spielman Motor Co. v. Dodge, 295 U.S. 89, 55 S.Ct. 678, 79 L.Ed. 1322 (1935) ; Beal v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 312 U.S. 45, 61 S.Ct. 418, 85 L.Ed. 577 (1941); Douglas v. City of Jeanette, 319 U.S. 157, 63 S. Ct. 877, 87 L.Ed. 1324 (1943); Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965); Younger v. Harris, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"> Nor does Amtrak have any parade of horribles with reference to its discrimination claim. On the contrary, the record shows that the prosecution was triggered by a telephone call from a newspaper reporter to the Director of the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, advising that Amtrak was selling liquor by the drink on its trains. The Director wrote an Amtrak official, advising of \u201cpossible violations of law,\u201d requesting cooperation, stating that his letter was \u201cnot to be construed as an immediate threat of action\u201d and requesting a reply as to Amtrak\u2019s \u201cintended action.\u201d No reply was made and some two weeks later an independent investigation by state agents was instituted which ascertained that Amtrak had no intention of complying with Oklahoma\u2019s liquor laws. This prosecution followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (1). We are not persuaded that the District Court\u2019s conclusion of law as to discriminatory enforcement of law saves Amtrak. It is not named as a defendant and George Bell, its employee, has an adequate remedy at law through state prosecution. Two Guys v. McGinley, 366 U.S. 582, 588, 589, 81 S.Ct. 1135, 6 L.Ed. 2d 551 (1960). Also see Fenner v. Boy-kin, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">(2). Intervenors Charles J. Davis and Catherine L. Nuckolls, owner and employee, respectively, of Shangri-La Lodge, claim Oklahoma laws were unconstitutionally applied to them and invidious discrimination is present. The record indicates that within the large resort complex a private club is operated wherein liquor by the drink is sold. On two occasions arrests have been made of employees, one of them is Intervenor Nuckolls. As it had done in the Amtrak ease, the District Court proceeded straightaway to decide the declaratory judgment claim of unconstitutional application of Oklahoma\u2019s liquor laws, and after finding for Davis and Nuckolls, issued an injunction to \u201cprotect and effectuate its decrees\u201d 361 F.Supp. at 393. As Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 91 S.Ct. 764, 27 L.Ed.2d 688 (1971) dictates, where a state prosecution has begun, \u201cthe same equitable principles relevant to the propriety of an injunction must be taken into consideration and that where an injunction would be impermissible ... . declaratory relief should ordinarily be denied as well.\u201d 401 U.S. at 73, 91 S.Ct. at 768. As was said in Perez v. Ledes-ma, 401 U.S. 82, 85, 91 S.Ct. 674, 677, 27 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971), injunctive relief lies \u201conly in cases of proven harassment or prosecutions undertaken by state officials in bad faith without hope of obtaining a valid conviction and perhaps in other extraordinary circumstances where irreparable injury can be shown.\u201d We find neither harassment, bad faith nor irreparable injury present here; hence the conclusions of the District Court are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">(3). As to Soonersphere Club Association and Ruby Boyd v. Harris, No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>73-1266, the motion to dismiss the appeal was denied by this Court on May 5, 1973. The record now shows that the Association entered a plea of guilty and paid a fine on the criminal charge of operating an open saloon, and the prosecution against Ruby Boyd was dismissed. Neither party has filed a brief on the merits nor appeared at argument on September 12, 1973. We are advised that both parties \u201chave elected not to further test the constitutionality or validity\u201d of Oklahoma\u2019s liquor laws. We therefore conclude that this appeal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The judgments in each of the consolidated cases, save No. 73-1266, are reversed, the orders are vacated and the cases remanded with instructions to dismiss each of them. In No. 73-1266, Soonersphere and Ruby Boyd, the cause is declared moot, the orders are vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-5\">. The record also discloses that there were, in Oklahoma County alone, approximately thirty-four prosecutions (involving some sixty-five persons and business establishments) instituted during the nine-month period immediately preceding the filing of this suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
