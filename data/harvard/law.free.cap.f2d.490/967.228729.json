We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-11\">The pertinent statutory provisions are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"a8z-dedup-0\">Tariff Schedules of the United States</p>\n<p id=\"Am9\">Schedule 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-12\">Part <em>1. </em>\u2014 Live <em>Animals</em></p>\n<p id=\"A89U\">Part 1 headnotes:</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-13\">2. Unless the context requires otherwise, each provision for named or described animals applies to such animals regardless of their size or age, e. g., \u201csheep\u201d includes lambs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-15\">* * ' * * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-16\">Live animals other than birds:</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-17\">* * ******</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-18\">Cattle:</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-19\">********</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-20\">Weighing 700 pounds or mor\u00e9 each:</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-21\">100.50 Cows imported specially for dairy purposes...... <em>1$ </em>per lb. Other:</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-23\">100.53 For not over 400,000 head entered in the 12-month period beginning April 1 in any year, of which not over 120,000 shall be entered in any quarter beginning April 1, July 1, October 1, or January 1 ................................ 1.5$ per lb.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-24\">Appellant argues that each of the animals in question was a \u201cyoung cow\u201d imported \u2022 specially for dairy purposes; that a young cow carrying a calf is j.ust as \u201csuitable\u201d for dairy purposes as one which .has just given birth to a calf; and that paragraph 2 of the headnotes makes clear the Congressional intent that any cow, imported specially for dairy purposes, is to be classified under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>item 100.50 if it weighs 700 pounds or more regardless of its age or size.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">Appellee agrees with the opinion of the trial court that a heifer does not attain the status of a \u201ccow\u201d until parturition takes place for the first time. It contends that the trial court properly-found that appellant\u2019s animals were not \u201ccows\u201d; also that, even if they should be determined to be \u201ccows,\u201d they were incapable of being milked for commercial purposes at the time of importation and could not be classified as \u201ccows imported specially for dairy purposes\u201d under item 100.50 TSUS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">The basic issue is whether appellant has sustained its burden of proving that the animals in question were \u201cCows imported specially for dairy purposes\u201d within the meaning of item 100.50. As the trial court correctly observed, the language involved in the TSUS appears for the first time in any tariff act of the United States. No definition is provided for \u201cCows imported specially for dairy purposes\u201d, so the trial court determined the common meaning of \u201ccow.\u201d While we do not disagree with such determination, we believe the qualifying language \u201cimported specially for dairy purposes\u201d requires a determination of the meaning of \u201ccow\u201d in the dairying trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">Both parties have cited various dictionary and lexicographic definitions, which support appellant\u2019s contention that a heifer is a young cow and appel-lee\u2019s contention that a cow is a female bovine which has produced a calf. However, since we are seeking the meaning of \u201ccow\u201d in the dairying trade for purposes of the tariff schedules, we do not regard these sources as particularly helpful \u2014 with the exception of the cited <em>Dictionary of Agriculture and Allied Terminology,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which contains this definition: \u201cCow \u2014 a <em>market </em>term for designating a female bovine which has produced a calf.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) See United States v. The Spiegel Bros. Corp., 51 CCPA 69, C.A.D. 839 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">Appellee points out that Corpus Juris Secundum, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, and Words and Phrases which appellant cites derive their definitions from cases concerned with state laws relating to theft or exemption from levy which are not, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, relevant to the purposes of the TSUS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">Appellant cites the First Reciprocal Trade Agreement with Canada (T.D. 48033), which became effective January 1, 1936, and the Digest of Trade Data published by the U. S. Tariff Commission in 1936 as the source of the provision for \u201cCows imported specially for dairy purposes\u201d, and contends that \u201ccow\u201d was used in lieu of, and in the same sense as, female cattle. This contention is based on a Customs Regulation (T.D. 48057), issued by the Secretary of the Treasury following the Canadian Trade Agreement, which directs that the Customs officer \u201cshall satisfy himself that the animal is suitable for dairy purposes.\u201d Appellant further claims that \u201cA young cow, heifer, which is carrying a calf, is clearly just as suitable for dairy purposes as a young cow, first-calf heifer, which has just given birth to a calf, and is beginning- her first lactation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">We have concluded that these arguments must fail. The direction to the Customs officer in the quoted portion of the Customs Regulation, could as well have been intended to prevent a reduction in duty from being applied to <em>cows </em>of a breed suitable for beef cattle production as to permit such reduction to be applied to all females of a dairy breed. Moreover, appellee has called attention to tables published by the Tariff Commission which appear in the above-referred to Digest of Trade Data. These tables list \u201cCows and heifers 2 years old and over,\u201d showing recognition of a distinction between \u201ccows\u201d and \u201cheifers.\u201d Appellant has not shown that the Digest of Trade Data was considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>by the Congress. Assuming that it was, there is nothing in the legislative history of the TSUS to indicate other than tacit acceptance of this distinction. Finally, appellant appears to equate the phrase \u201csuitable for dairy purposes\u201d in the referenced Customs Regulation with \u201cspecially for dairy purposes\u201d in the statute with which we are here concerned. The latter phrase denotes an exclusivity of purpose, which the animals in question did not possess because, at the time of importation, each had to first produce a calf before becoming marketable for dairy purposes. This is substantiated by the testimony of appellant\u2019s witness, Philip R. Goldberg, who stated that \u201cninety-nine per cent\u201d \u2014 \u201ca good many each day\u201d \u2014 of the heifers imported by the partnership calved while in possession of the partnership after importation and prior to sale; that \u201cmost of the people that we sell cattle to in Connecticut are primarily in the business of producing milk. . . . they are interested in buying an animal that is ready to produce milk today.\u201d He also testified that pregnant heifers are valued the same as a cow in preparing financial statements for the partnership for commercial bank loan purposes. While no evidence was submitted that the lending agencies regarded such heifers as \u201ccows,\u201d the testimony serves to show that the impending calf crop from such animals was a commercial consideration for such valuation purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">Six witnesses were presented by appellant: Robert Perry, a drover who bought bred heifers from Canadian dairy farmers for the importing firm; Norman and Philip Goldberg, members of the importing firm; Richard Lewis, Robert Thompson, and Irwin McQuer\u2014 all long-time dairy farmers. Perry testified that he regarded a heifer as a young cow and defined a cow as \u201can animal that produces a calf.\u201d Norman Goldberg testified that to him the word \u201ccow\u201d as applied to dairy cattle meant \u201can animal that is matured, five years of age, full mouth [eight teeth]\u201d; that an animal three or four months prior to giving birth to her first calf is \u201ca young cow.\u201d Philip Goldberg, in addition to the testimony earlier ref erred, to, testified that the animals in question were sold to two operators of dairy farms in Connecticut; that a heifer is the same as a young cow; that a mature cow has a \u201cfull mouth\u201d \u2014 -\u201ceight teeth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">Witness Lewis testified that to him the term \u201cheifer\u201d meant \u201ca young eqw\u201d; that, in his opinion, a cow \u201cis a female bovine as the other people [appellant\u2019s previous witnesses] have said.\u201d Witness McQuer testified that his understanding of the word \u201ccow\u201d was \u201ca female with a full mouth\u201d; that a heifer is a \u201cyoung cow.\u201d In answer to a question on cross-examination whether he would accept delivery of an open (unbred) heifer when he had ordered a cow, he responded: \u201cNot if I wanted an animal for milk.\u201d Witness Thompson, on <em>direct examination, </em>testified that he grew up on a dairy farm, had operated his own dairy farm since 1944, was chairman of the board of the Eastern Artificial Insemination Cooperative, and traveled widely in the United States in that official capacity; that, in his understanding of a dairy cow, <em>\u201cWe never refer to an animal as a cow until after she has had a calf.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) He stated that \u201ca senior yearling heifer is a heifer between the ages of 18 and 24 months\u201d and that such an animal \u201ccould still be a cow if she has produced a calf and she could produce a calf as a senior yearling, but not ordinarily.\u201d On cross-examination, he further testified that he belonged to the New York Holstein Association and paid dues on the basis of a flat fee plus an additional amount for each milking cow in the herd or each cow which has milked; that <em>bred heifers in their last month of pregnancy would not be counted for dues purposes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\">Three witnesses were presented by ap-pellee. The first was Dr. Edwin Smith, a practicing veterinarian since 1943 with degrees from New York State Ag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>ricultural College at Cornell University, and currently a professor of Animal Science at Canton (New York) Agriculture &amp; Technical College. He testified that he was born and raised on a farm and had owned his own dairy farm; that a cow by definition is \u201can animal that has those anatomical and physiological changes brought about by having a calf\u201d; that a heifer is \u201ca female bovine animal that has not had a calf\u201d; that he would not consider bred heifers to be cows because \u201cthey have not had their first calf and do not have the anatomical and physiological changes that come about by having that calf,\u201d and that he had attended five auctions a year during his years as a veterinarian where there were separate categories for \u201cbred heifers\u201d and \u201ccows.\u201d He also stated that the factor of teeth is not determining between heifer and cow, although it is a factor in age.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">Appellee\u2019s next witness was Dr. Frank Bancroft, also a Cornell University graduate, a veterinarian with the U. S. Department of Agriculture for over four years and previously in private practice for thirty-three years, born and raised in a dairy community. He testified that he believed a cow to be \u201cA bovine animal that has had a calf and lactated\u201d and that he would not consider a bred heifer to be a cow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">Appellee\u2019s third witness was James Repard, Executive Secretary of the New York State Holstein Association, which is a 4,600 member voluntary organization for the promotion and merchandising of Holstein cattle in the State of New York. He was born and raised on a dairy farm in the State of New York and, prior to becoming Executive Secretary, had owned and operated a dairy farm since 1938. He testified that he kept up with changes in the dairy industry by attending sales, meetings, and conventions and talking with farmers throughout the state. It was his statement that \u201cA cow is a bovine female that has had her first calf,\u201d and that \u201cA heifer is a heifer until she has her first calf and then becomes a cow.\u201d Based on his experience as a dairy farmer and his position in the Holstein Association, he stated that it is normal among farmers to distinguish between cow and heifer, and that \u201cNo, no way\u201d is a bred heifer known as a cow in the farming industry. He said \u201cDefinitely not\u201d in response to a question of whether he would accept a bred heifer as delivery for a cow, and \u201cNo\u201d to whether he would accept a cow when he had ordered a heifer. He pointed out that there are heifer classes in a show, followed by the cow classes. With respect to association dues, he testified that there is a $10 minimum fee plus <em>25$ </em>for every cow in the herd, not counting heifers even if bred. He described the classification program for members of the association under which a herd is enrolled, with each cow that has had a calf being listed and no animal being classified that has not calved. He identified appellee\u2019s Exhibit B, a catalog of a sale on May 6, 1972, as \u201cvery typical of the catalogues that we have at cattle sales,\u201d and interpreted the descriptions of various lots, thus: cow (\u201cShe has had at least one calf.\u201d); H. C. (\u201cHeifer calf.\u201d); 1st (\u201cShe is milking with the first calf. She is a cow.\u201d); and B. H. (\u201cBred heifer.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">Appellant argues that the trial court applied a \u201cnarrow scientific meaning\u201d of the word \u201ccow\u201d and that \u201cThe government witnesses, being men of science, interpreted the term \u2018cow\u2019 in the strict technical sense\u201d; whereas \u201cAppellant\u2019s witnesses, being men of the earth, defined cow in the language of everyday parlance.\u201d It is true that two of appellee\u2019s witnesses were veterinarians, but one had long been a dairy farmer and both practiced in dairy communities. Appellee\u2019s third witness could hardly be described as a \u201cman of science\u201d; not only had he been a long-time dairy farmer, but he also was an officer of wide experience in the New York Holstein Association which was concerned with the promotion and merchandising of animals of the same breed as the animals here in question. We also note that Robert Thompson, one of appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>lant\u2019s \u201cmen of the earth\u201d witnesses, testified on direct examination that \u201cWe never refer to an animal as a cow until after she has had a calf\u201d; that another of such witnesses, Irwin McQuer, stated that he would not accept delivery of a heifer when he had ordered a cow \u201cif I wanted an animal for milk.\u201d Such testimony supports appellee\u2019s response that its witnesses were not testifying solely from a scientific and technical frame of reference, but \u201cin the language of commerce of those intimately familiar with bovine, dairy farmers, and all phases of dairy farming.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the meaning of \u201ccow\u201d in the dairying trade is a female bovine of a breed suitable for dairy purposes which has produced a calf.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">With respect to the applicability of paragraph 2 of the headnotes to item 100.50, we observe that \u201cthe context requires otherwise\u201d only with respect to <em>size </em>of the cows being imported, because item 100.50 specifically requires that they weigh \u201c700 pounds or more each.\u201d The context is silent on age, and from this appellant postulates that bred heifers as \u201cyoung cows\u201d would qualify. However, in view of our above conclusion on the meaning of \u201ccow\u201d and in further view of what we have said regarding the significance of the qualifying language \u201cimported specially for dairy purposes\u201d with reference to bred heifers, we conclude that paragraph 2 of the headnotes is of no avail to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">In view of the foregoing, and having fully considered the evidence of record and the briefs of both parties, we hold that the animals in question were not \u201cCows imported specially for dairy purposes\u201d for purposes of the TSUS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">The judgment of the Customs Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1043-11\">.

We observe a similar posture in the trial judge\u2019s reminiscence of having been accorded, as a young lad, the \u201cdubious honor\u201d of milking the family cows on a farm \u201cin the beautiful and fertile Red River Valley of North Dakota.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
