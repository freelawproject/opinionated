It files its federal income tax returns for a fiscal year beginning March 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-23\">From 1942 until February 28, 1957, a partnership comprised of Loy T. Hempt, J. F. Hempt, Max C. Hempt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>and the George L. Hempt Estate was engaged in the business of quarrying and selling stone, sand, gravel, and slag; manufacturing and selling ready-mix concrete and bituminous material; constructing roads, highways, and streets, primarily for the Pennsylvania Department of Highways and various political subdivisions of Pennsylvania, and constructing driveways, parking lots, street and water lines, and related accessories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-4\">The partnership maintained its books and records, and filed its partnership income tax returns, on the basis of a calendar year and on the cash method of accounting, so that no income was reported until actually received in cash. Accordingly, in computing its income for federal income tax purposes, the partnership did not take uncollected receivables into income, and inventories were not used in the calculation of its taxable income, although both accounts receivable reflecting sales already made and physical inventories existed to a substantial extent at the end of each of the partnership\u2019s taxable years. Rather than using the inventory method of accounting, the partnership deducted the costs of its physical inventories of sand, gravel, and stone as incurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-5\">On March 1, 1957, the partnership business and most of its assets were transferred to the taxpayer solely in exchange for taxpayer\u2019s capital stock, the 12,000 shares of which were issued to the four members of the partnership. These shares constituted 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of the taxpayer. This transfer was made pursuant to Section 351(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; . Thereafter, the taxpayer conducted the business formerly conducted by the partnership.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-7\">Among the assets transferred by the partnership to the taxpayer for taxpayer\u2019s shares of stock were accounts receivable in the amount of $662,824.40 arising from performance of construction projects, sales of stone, sand, gravel, etc., and rental of equipment prior to March 1, 1957. Also among the assets transferred were physical inventories of sand, gravel, and stone, with respect to which the partnership had deducted costs of $351,266.05 and the value of which was no less than $351,266.05.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-9\">Commencing with its initial fiscal year [which] ended February 28, 1958, taxpayer maintained its books and filed its corporation income tax returns on the cash method of accounting and, accordingly, did not take uncollected receivables into income and did not use inventories in the calculation of its taxable income. In its taxable years ending in 1958, 1959, and 1960, taxpayer collected the respective amounts of $533,247.87, $125,326.71 and $4,249.72 of the accounts receivable in the aggregate amount of $662,824.40 <em>(sic) </em>that transferred to it, and included those amounts in income in computing its income for its federal income tax returns for those years, respectively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-12\">As a result of an examination extending over a period of years, it was determined by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and agreed to by the taxpayer, that the use of the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting with regard to purchases and sales, without taking into account merchandise on hand at the beginning and end of the taxable year, did not clearly reflect taxpayer\u2019s income. Accordingly, taxpayer\u2019s income was adjusted as set forth in an examination report of August 24, 1964 to accrue unreported sales [accounts receivable] made during the taxable years in question and to take into account inventories in computing its cost of goods sold. In computing taxpayer\u2019s cost of goods sold under the inventory method, for the fiscal year ended February 28, 1958, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in conjunction with his accrual method treatment, fixed the beginning inven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>tory of stone, sand, and gravel, which had been transferred to the taxpayer by the partnership, at zero, and the ending inventory at $258,201.35. The result was an increase in taxpayer\u2019s taxable income for the fiscal year ended February 28, 1958, in the amount of $258,201.35.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed deficiencies in taxpayer\u2019s federal income taxes for its fiscal years ending February 28, 1958, and 1959. The taxpayer paid the amounts in 1964, and in 1965 filed claims for refund of $621,218.09 plus assessed interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The claims were disallowed in full on September 24, 1968, and the district court action was timely instituted on December 5, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">The district court held: (1) taxpayer was properly taxable upon collections made with respect to accounts receivable which were transferred to it in conjunction with the Section 351 incorporation, and (2) the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain taxpayer\u2019s contention that the tax-benefit theory of recovery entitled it to an opening inventory of not' less than $351,266.05, since that theory of recovery was not presented in taxpayer\u2019s claim for refund. Hempt Bros., Inc. v. United States, 354 F.Supp. 1172 (M.D. Pa.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-8\">Taxpayer argues here, as it did in the district court, that because the term \u201cproperty\u201d as used in Section 351 does not embrace accounts receivable, the Commissioner lacked statutory authority to apply principles associated with Section 351. The district court properly rejected the legal interpretation urged by the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-9\">The definition of Section 351 \u201cproperty\u201d has been extensively treated by the Court of Claims in E. I. Du Pont de Nemours and Co. v. United States, 471 F.2d 1211, 1218-1219 (Ct.C1.1973), describing the transfer of a non-exclusive license to make, use and sell area herbicides under French patents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1249-13\">Unless there is some special reason intrinsic to [Section 351] . the general word \u201cproperty\u201d has a broad reach in tax law. . For section 351, in particular, courts have advocated a generous definition of \u201cproperty,\u201d and it has been suggested in one capital gains case that nonexclusive licenses can be viewed as property though not as capital assets. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1249-16\">We see no adequate reason for refusing to follow these leads.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1249-17\">We fail to perceive any special reason why a restrictive meaning should be applied to accounts receivables so as to exclude them from the general meaning of \u201cproperty.\u201d Receivables possess the usual capabilities and attributes associated with jurisprudential concepts of property law. They may be identified, valued, and transferred. Moreover, their role in an ongoing business must be viewed in the context of Section 351 application. The presence of accounts receivable is a normal, rather than an exceptional accoutrement of the type of business included by Congress in the transfer to a corporate form. They are \u201ccommonly thought of in the commercial world as a positive business asset.\u201d Du Pont v. United States, <em>supra, </em>at 1218. As aptly put by the district court: \u201cThere is a compelling reason to construe \u2018property\u2019 to include [accounts receivable]: a new corporation needs working capital, and accounts receivable can be an important source of liquidity.\u201d Hempt Bros., Inc. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>at 1176.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In any event, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>this court had no difficulty in characterizing a sale of receivables as \u201cproperty\u201d within the purview of the \u201cno gain or loss\u201d provision of Section 337 as a \u201cqualified sale of property within a 12-month period.\u201d Citizens Acceptance Corp. v. United States, 462 F.2d 751, 756 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">The taxpayer next makes a strenuous argument that \u201c[t]he government is seeking to tax the wrong person.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It contends that, the assignment of income doctrine as developed by the Supreme Court applies to a Section 351 transfer of accounts receivable so that the transferor, not the transferee-corporation, bears the corresponding tax liability. It argues that the assignment of income doctrine dictates that where the right to receive income is transferred to another person in a transaction not giving rise to tax at the time of transfer, the transferor is taxed on the income when it is collected by the transferee; that the only requirement for its application is a transfer of a right to receive ordinary income; and that since the transferred accounts receivable are a present right to future income, the sole requirement for the application of the doctrine is squarely met. In essence, this is a contention that the nonrecognition provision of Section 351 is in conflict with the assignment of income doctrine and that Section 351 should be subordinated thereto. Taxpayer relies on the seminal case of Lucas v. Earl, 281 U.S. 111, 50 S.Ct. 16, 74 L.Ed. 600 (1930), and its progeny<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for support of its proposition that the application of the doctrine is mandated whenever one transfers a right to receive ordinary income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-8\">On its part, the government concedes that a taxpayer may sell for value a claim to income otherwise his own and he will be taxable upon the proceeds of the sale. Such was the case in Commissioner v. P. G. Lake, Inc., 356 U.S. 260, 78 S.Ct. 691, 2 L.Ed.2d 743 (1958), in which the taxpayer-corporation assigned its oil payment right to its president in consideration for his cancellation of a $600,000 loan. Viewing the oil payment right as a right to receive future income, the Court applied the reasoning of the assignment of income doctrine, normally applicable to a gratuitous assignment, and held that the consideration received by the taxpayer rcorporation was taxable as ordinary income since it essentially was a substitute for that which would otherwise be received at a future time as ordinary income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-9\">Turning to the facts of this case, we note that here there was the transfer of accounts receivable from the partnership to the corporation pursuant to Section 351. -We view these accounts receivable as a present right to receive future income. In consideration of the transfer of this right, the members of the partnership received stock \u2014 a valid consideration. The consideration, therefore, was essentially a substitute for that which would otherwise be received at a future time as ordinary income to the cash basis partnership. Consequently, the hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>ing in <em>Lake </em>would normally apply, and income would ordinarily be realized, and thereby taxable, by the cash basis partnership-transferor at the time of receipt of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">But the terms and purpose of Section 351 have to be reckoned with. By its explicit terms Section 351 expresses the Congressional intent that transfers of property for stock or securities will not result in recognition. It therefore becomes apparent that this case vividly illustrates how Section 351 sometimes comes into conflict with another provision of the Internal Revenue Code or a judicial doctrine,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and requires a determination of which of two conflicting doctrines will control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">As we must, when we try to reconcile conflicting doctrines in the revenue law, we endeavor to ascertain a controlling Congressional mandate. Section 351 has been described as a deliberate attempt by Congress to facilitate the incorporation of ongoing businesses and to eliminate any technical constructions which are economically unsound.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">Appellant-taxpayer seems to recognize this and argues that application of the <em>Lake </em>rationale when accounts receivable are transferred would not create any undue hardship to an incorporating taxpayer. \u201cAll a taxpayer [transferor] need do is withhold the earned income items and collect them, transferring the net proceeds to the Corporation. Indeed the transferor should retain both accounts receivable and accounts payable to avoid income recognition at the time of transfer and to have sufficient funds with which to pay accounts payable. Where the taxpayer [transfer- or] is on the cash method of accounting [as here], the deduction of the accounts payable would be applied against the income generated by the accounts receivable.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Brief at 32.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-9\">While we cannot fault the general principle \u201cthat income be taxed to him who earns it,\u201d to adopt taxpayer\u2019s argument would be to hamper the incorporation of ongoing businesses; additionally it would impose technical constructions which are economically and practically unsound. None of the cases cited by taxpayer, including <em>Lake </em>itself, persuades us otherwise. In <em>Lake </em>the Court was required to decide whether the proceeds from the assignment of the oil payment right were taxable as ordinary income or as long term capital gains. Observing that the provision for long term capital gains treatment \u201chas always been narrowly construed so as to protect the revenue against artful devices,\u201d 356 U.S. at 265, 78 S.Ct. at 694, the Court predicated its holding upon an emphatic distinction between a conversion of a capital investment \u2014 \u201cincome-producing property\u201d \u2014 and .an assignment of income <em>per se. </em>\u201cThe substance of what was assigned was the right to receive future income. The substance of what was received was the present value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>of income which the recipient would otherwise obtain in the future.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>at 266, 78 S.Ct. at 695. A Section 351 issue was not presented in <em>Lake. </em>Therefore the case does not control in weighing the conflict between the general rule of assignment of income and the Congressional purpose of nonrecognition upon the. incorporation of an ongoing business.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">We are persuaded that, on balance, the teachings of <em>Lake </em>must give way in this case to the broad Congressional interest in facilitating the incorporation of ongoing businesses. As desirable as it is to afford symmetry in revenue law, we do not intend to promulgate a hard and fast rule.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We believe that the problems posed by the clash of conflicting internal revenue doctrines are more properly determined by the circumstances of each case. Here we are influenced by the fact that the subject of the assignment was accounts receivable for partnership\u2019s goods and services sold in the regular course of business, that the change of business form from partnership to corporation had a basic business purpose and was not designed for the purpose of deliberate tax avoidance, and by the conviction that the totality of- circumstances here presented fit the mold of the Congressional intent to give nonrecognition to a transfer of a total business from a non-corporate to a corporate form.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-10\">But this too must be said. Even though Section 351(a) immunizes the transferor from immediate tax consequences, Section 358 <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> retains for the transferors a potential income tax liability to be realized and recognized upon a subsequent sale or exchange of the stock certificates received. As to the transferee-corporation, the tax basis of the receivables will be governed by Section 362.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">The taxpayer contends that the court erred in ruling that its inventory argument was not reasonably encompassed within its claim for refund, and that had the court considered this contention for the fiscal year commencing March 1, 1957, the taxpayer-corporation would have been entitled to a beginning inventory of $351,266.05 instead of zero by application of the tax benefit rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">The government restates th\u00e9 reason for the district court\u2019s refusal to consider taxpayer\u2019s argument but by its brief advises: \u201cWe believe it unnecessary for this Court to explore the often obscure distinction between the facts to support a claim and the theory of a claim\u201d and that \u201c[w]ithout joining in the debate over facts versus theory, examination of the substance of taxpayer\u2019s claim for inventory adjustment makes it clear that the facts asserted in its claim for refund do not support it and the agreed facts negative it.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s brief at 19.) Regardless of the procedural question, we are persuaded that appellant\u2019s tax benefit argument does not apply to this factual complex, and \u201c[w]e pass at once to a consideration of . [the merits].\u201d B. F. Goodrich Co. v. United States, 321 U.S. 126, 64 S.Ct. 471, 88 L.Ed. 602 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">The tax benefit rule can be simply stated: If a taxpayer makes an expenditure or suffers a loss for which it takes a deduction giving rise to a reduction in its income tax and later recovers the funds or property that it has spent or lost, it must take the amount recovered as income. Connery v. United States, 460 F.2d 1130, 1132 (3d Cir. 1972); Alice Phelan Sullivan Corp. v. United States, 381 F.2d 399, 401-402 (Ct.C1.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-9\">Applying this rule to the facts of this case taxpayer contends that partnership\u2019s receipt of stock in exchange for inventory previously expensed but presently valued at $351,266.05 constituted a \u201crecovery\u201d which stepped up the basis of the inventory from zero to $351,266.05 and that this stepped-up basis became the basis to the partnership and the corporation under Sections 358 and 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-11\">Relying on Nash v. United States, 398 U.S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1550, 26 L.Ed.2d 1 (1970), and the various courts of appeals decisions in Commissioner v. An-ders, 414 F.2d 1283 (10th Cir. 1969); Spitalny v. United States, 430 F.2d 195 (9th Cir. 1970); Connery v. United States, <em>supra, </em>and Citizens\u2019 Acceptance Corp. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>taxpayer proceeds to equate \u201cvalue\u201d of the inventory with tax \u201cbasis\u201d as conceptualized in Sections 358 and 362. This keystone in the taxpayer\u2019s arch of reasoning proves to be most fragile upon close inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-12\">Although Justice Douglas in <em>Nash </em>addressed a transfer of receivables under Section 351(a), the Court did not have before it the critical question posed here \u2014whether a partnership\u2019s \u201cbasis,\u201d and ultimately the corporation\u2019s \u201cbasis,\u201d in a previously expensed inventory is equal to the \u201cvalue\u201d of the inventory when transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-13\">\u201cIn <em>Nash </em>the Court held that when eight partnerships transferred their assets to eight newly formed corporations in exchange for shares in the corporations \u2014 transfers that produced no gain or loss under \u00a7 351 of the Internal Revenue Code \u2014 there was no \u2018recovery\u2019 of the bad debt reserves under the tax benefit rule \u2018[s]ince the reserve for purposes of this case was deemed to be reasonable and the value of the stock received upon the transfer was equal to the <em>net value </em>of the receivables. . . .\u2019 398 U.S., at 4, 90 S.Ct., at 1552 (emphasis in original).\u201d Citizens\u2019 Acceptance Corp. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>462 F.2d at 754. While it is true that Justice Douglas stated that \u201c[a] 11 that petitioners received from the corporations were secu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>rities equal in value to the net worth of the accounts transferred, that is the face value less the amount in reserve for bad debts\u201d, 398 U.S. at 4, 90 S.Ct. at 1551, the sole issue before the Court was whether such receipt constituted a \u201crecovery\u201d within the meaning of the tax benefit rule. It was not necessary for the <em>Nash </em>Court ever to reach the question of the tax \u201cbasis\u201d in the hands of either the transferor or transferee. Thus, the taxpayer would have us read into <em>Nash </em>a holding which did not appear therein, which was not posed by the facts, and which does not inexorably nor logically follow therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">Nor may the taxpayer find solace in the decisions of the various courts of appeals upon which it relies. At issue in <em>Anders </em>and <em>Spitalny </em>were inventories which had been completely expensed and therefore had a zero basis. After the inventories were sold, the liquidated corporations attempted to assert a no-gain immunity from tax liability by virtue of the operation of \u00a7 337.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In each case the court held the sale proceeds would not be considered as non-recognizable gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">We find nothing in the teachings of the Ninth and Tenth Circuits supporting taxpayer\u2019s contention that in a Section 351(a) transfer the accounting basis for property must equal the actual or market value thereof. At the time taxpayer\u2019s inventory was totally expensed on the cash basis books of the partnership that property had mercantile value in the sense as described by Justice Douglas in <em>Nash </em>but for accounting purposes and as a tax basis it still had a zero value. The mere fact that an asset has been transferred under Section 351(a) from a partnership ownership to a corporate ownership does not in itself alter its tax basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-10\">We now turn to our decisions in <em>Connery </em>and <em>Citizens. </em>The <em>Connery </em>issue was whether tax benefit principles applied following recovery of previously expensed prepaid advertising. We agreed with the Commissioner in the application of the tax benefit rule because the taxpayer realized income equivalent to the value of the previously expensed advertising costs. We said that the taxpayer incurred a tax liability based on the difference between a zero basis and the amount previously expensed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-11\">The difficulty presented in both Section 337 and Section 351 cases is that the statute expressly provides for no-gain and no-loss tax consequences by virtue of the actual liquidation or transfer. Nothing in the statutory schema permits an immunization of normal tax consequences arising out of those separate activities which may accompany a liquidation under Section 337 or a transfer under Section 351 but which are not inherently a necessary aspect of the liquidating or transferring process. The tax imposed in <em>Connery </em>was not the result of the liquidation process <em>per </em>se; it was imposed because of the recovery of an item previously expensed. The happenstance that the recovery took place as an additional feature of the liquidating process does not immunize that recovery from normal tax consequences. The prepaid advertising expenses had a zero basis before the liquidation process began; it had the same basis during the liquidation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-12\">The <em>Citizens </em>issue was the extent to which the taxpayer had recovered its previously deducted bad debt reserve. Our holding in <em>Citizens </em>was simply a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>iteration of the holding in <em>Nash, </em>that the receivables had to be valued on the basis of face value less bad debt reserve. <em>Citizens </em>did not involve an adjustment of the tax basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">In the case before us, whatever may have been the actual value of the inventory at the time of the transfer, the \u201cbasis of . the property exchanged,\u201d Section 358(a) (1), remained the same as it appeared in the partnership\u2019s books \u2014zero. As to the distributees, the \u201cbasis of the . . . [stock] permitted to be received under . i . [Section 351] shall be the same as that of the property exchanged\u201d \u2014 zero. Section 358(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-8\">As to the corporation, according to Section 362(a) \u201cthe basis shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor [partnership]. . . . \u201d This must be zero as well. Accordingly, the taxpayer cannot prevail in his contention that he is entitled to a basis for the inventory in the amount of $351,266.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-11\">Appellant raised at oral argument a question which, on first blush, is extremely attractive and appealing. It questions the fundamental fairness of the Commissioner\u2019s action in requiring a corporation to change from a cash to an accrual basis without permitting adjustments to the predecessor partnership. We note, however, that appellant does not dispute the Commissioner\u2019s determination that its use of the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting with respect to purchases and sales, without taking into account merchandise on hand at the beginning and end of the year did not clearly reflect income. (Appendix at 18a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-14\">The argument is premised on the history of IRS audits of the previous partnership books, and -the failure of the Commissioner to direct that the partnership change from a cash to an accrual basis. To this is added the reality that the identical partnership business was continued by the corporation with present stock ownership reflecting past partnership interests. The argument continues: requiring the corporate taxpayer to make a sudden change in accounting methods, generating huge new tax liabilities, is basically unfair to the taxpayer; that at the very least, there should now be permitted a reopening of the partnership books to allow for adjustments under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 481 so that a new basis for an opening inventory may be permitted and a distribution of increased tax liabilities shared by the previous partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-15\">Where a method of accounting differs from that under which the taxpayer\u2019s income for a preceding calendar year was computed, Section 481(a) provides for adjustments in previous years which are determined to be necessary solely by reason of the change, in order to prevent an amount from being duplicated or omitted. Notwithstanding the adjustment provisions of Section 481(a), a corporation formed for a business purpose is a separate entity and a separate taxpayer from the stockholders who are responsible for its creation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>Moline Properties v.

And because of the separate taxable corporate entity, it has been held that where the change in the accounting practices is ordered for the first year of the corporation\u2019s existence, the corporation had no preceding taxable year, and, therefore, Section 481 is inapplicable.

[make adjustments] both in the opening inventory and closing inventory for the . . . [previous years permitted by Section 481]. Thus, <em>petitioner- </em>\u2014 a taxpayer separate and distinct from its predecessor \u2014 appears to fare worse than its predecessor would have. We also recognize . . . the tax benefit of the deductions . taken by petitioner\u2019s predecessor may not have been as great as the tax burden which our rationale now requires petitioner to bear, <em>e.g., </em>because the partners may have been in lower tax brackets or the partnership may have operated at a loss in some of the prior years. Moreover, if the ownership of petitioner\u2019s stock had changed prior to the taxable years herein involved, the economic effect of the tax benefit would not inure to, nor would the tax burden fall upon, the same persons. But these are nothing more than some of the myriad of different consequences which may result from a change to the corporate form of doing business or from the acquisition of stock of a corporation rather than corporate assets.\u201d 48 T.C. at 199-200 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-15\">Applied to this case, these principles preclude a judicial command that the Commissioner make adjustments in the predecessor business entity to supplement the direction that the new corporate taxpayer convert to an accrual basis.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>We have carefully considered each of appellant\u2019s contentions and have concluded that the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1247-24\">.
