When the case was reached for trial plaintiff was at sea in the South Pacific and plaintiff\u2019s counsel was informed by radio that plaintiff could not leave his ship, and that plaintiff would not agree to a $7500 settlement. Although plaintiff\u2019s deposition was available, when the case was reached for trial, counsel marked the case settled on agreement by defendant to pay $8500. An order of discontinuance was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\"> On return to New York, plaintiff refused to accept the settlement and filed a motion to restore the ease to the calendar. Judge Gurfein, apparently believing that the earlier order was a \u201cdiscontinuance with prejudice\u201d reluctantly denied the motion. In this he was in error. Under the circumstances, the motion should properly have been treated as one to vacate a voluntary discontinuance, which might, and here should have been granted in the court\u2019s inherent power. <em>See </em>7 J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 66.20 at 242 (2d ed. 1973). At issue here is not the power of the court to control its calendars, but rather the authority of counsel to settle a case without his client\u2019s consent. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Beebe, 180 U.S. 343, 352, 21 S. Ct. 371, 45 L.Ed. 563 (1901). Here there were no such exigent circumstances as might have conferred such a power. Plaintiff\u2019s deposition was available and other witnesses were on call. Trial was a possible choice, not only dismissal or settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-16\">Reversed and remanded for setting aside of the order of discontinuance and restoration of the case to the calendar.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
