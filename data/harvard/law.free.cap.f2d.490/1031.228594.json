Kaczmarek, former Vice-President and Treasurer of Liberty Federal Savings and Loan Association, stands convicted of conspiracy to misapply and the misapplication of $244,250 of the funds of Liberty Federal in violation of Title 18, United States Code, \u00a7\u00a7 371, 2 and 657.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The gist of the alleged conspiracy was that Kaczma-rek participated in a cheek \u201ckiting\u201d scheme with a customer of Liberty Federal, Bernard Chemers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As time went by, Kaczmarek demanded and received payments in cash for his services which were delivered indirectly to him from Chemers via an intermediary, John J. Viverito, the Credit and Collection Manager of Liberty Federal. Both Chemers and Viverito were charged in the indictment; both pleaded guilty and testified for the Government. Both were probated while Kaczmarek received a concurrent two-year sentence on two counts and a $10,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-17\">Kaczmarek raises four questions: (1) insufficient evidence; (2) refusal of his \u201cgood faith\u201d instruction; (3) the admission of the guilty pleas of Chemers and Viverito and the comment of the prosecutor thereon to the jury; and (4) an excessive sentence, imposed as punishment for exercising his right to a trial by jury. We find no merit in these contentions and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-18\">(1) For many years, Liberty Federal has engaged in the business practice of \u201ccheck exchanges\u201d whereby customers, upon authorization by a corporate officer, may exchange a personal check for a Liberty Federal check in the same amount in order to facilitate business transactions. It appears that prior to the circumstances giving rise to this prosecution, Liberty Federal provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>this service to Chemers, a real estate developer, with no apparent irregularity in the transactions. However on August 18, 1969, Kaczmarek approved the exchange of three of Chemers\u2019 personal checks, drawn on the Plaza Drive-In-Bank in the amounts of $49,925, $49,800 and $49,475. Chemers did not have sufficient funds to cover the checks he had written. Thereafter, this practice was continued for almost one month with check exchanges approved by Kaczmarek occurring as often as four times a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">On September 19, 1969, when Edward J. Burns, then Vice-President and Secretary of Liberty Federal, discovered the frequency and size of the accommodation checks being issued, he directed Kaczmarek to stop exchanging so many checks in such large amounts to Chemers in a single day. Despite this admonition, however, on September 22, 1969, Kaczmarek approved five more of Chemers\u2019 checks totalling $244.250.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When Kaczmarek attempted to obtain Burns\u2019 authorization as to all five checks on September 24th, Burns refused and in conformity with the stated policy, approved only one cheek in the amount of $49,800. Shortly thereafter six Chemers checks, including the one authorized by Burns, were returned NSF (not sufficient funds). Upon return of the checks, a conference of Burns, Ch\u00e9mers and Kaczmarek concluded in the checks being placed in Kaezmarek\u2019s hands for collection. He directed that the checks be redeposited and they were again returned NSF. The Federal Reserve Bank prohibits the redeposit of any check which has been twice deposited and not been paid. After the second such deposit a legend is stamped on the check to prevent deposit a third time. Therefore, to escape this requirement and to be able to deposit the Chemers checks again, Kaczmarek periodically required replacement checks from Chemers, which were deposited. Upon return of these checks for insufficient funds, the routine would be systematically repeated. In October, 1969 Chemers enlisted the help of Viverito in getting the checks held up so that Chemers could have more time to pay. When Viverito contacted Kaczmarek, the latter agreed to hold up the checks upon payment of $1,000 by Chemers to him personally each month. Chemers began paying the $1,000 monthly bribe in November, 1969 and continued through August, 1970, using Viverito as a go-between.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">One set of replacement checks total-ling $294,050 were issued November 4, 1969 and were held until December 30th on Kaezmarek\u2019s instructions. They were listed on Liberty\u2019s monthly report to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board as \u201ccash items\u201d since they were carried as a \u201cdeposit memo\u201d on the statement to Liberty Federal from the Continental Bank. This report was false, however, because the Chemers checks, though deposited for collection with Continental, were in truth \u201caccounts receivable.\u201d By depositing these bad replacement checks on the 30th of December, they were not listed on Liberty Federal\u2019s December reconciliation report since they were an \u201cin transit item.\u201d Thus the federal auditors were not aware of the checks; and the Board was kept in the dark. Kaczmarek as Treasurer was in charge of these transactions of Liberty Federal, and he effectuated their concealment. Again, on March 19, 1970 Kaczmarek gave the Liberty Federal accounting clerk two checks of Chemers, one for $20,000 and another for $9,700, which were held until May 7 on his direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">In April 1970, Viverito, Chemers and Kaczmarek met in a restaurant and Chemers asked the latter if additional checks could be exchanged. Kaczmarek said that he would think about it. A few days later he advised it could be done if the checks were made out to Viv-erito, not to Liberty Federal. Viverito was to deposit them in his account at the Continental Bank and write checks on his account payable to Liberty Federal. Under this arrangement, there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>some fifteen check exchanges in amounts ranging from $500 to $12,000 between April and August, 1970. On May 4 a Chemers check for $10,000 payable to Viverito was approved by Kaczmarek. Viverito told Kaczmarek that his monthly payment of $1,000 was to come out of it. After cashing it, Viverito gave Kaczmarek the $1,000. Thereafter, in May, Viverito was called into Kaczmarek\u2019s office and was told that an audit by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board was imminent. Kaezmarek said that no further check exchanges would be possible and that all the currently held NSF checks would have to be deposited. Later that month Kaczmarek demanded $25,000 not to deposit them. Chemers told him $25,000 was \u201cbeyond reason.\u201d Finally, Kaczmarek relented and agreed to $12,000 to be paid by check from Chemers to Viverito and the latter\u2019s check to himself, which was exchanged at Liberty Federal, cashed on the spot and the money handed to Kaczmarek by Viverito at the cashier\u2019s window.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">Late in June, 1970, Kaczmarek gave a Liberty Federal clerk two of Chemers\u2019 checks to hold, each being for $20,000. They were never deposited. In August, 1970, the Continental Bank called Burns and advised that Viverito was attempting to deposit a $35,000 Liberty Federal accommodation check which Burns discovered Viverito had approved himself. Burns stopped payment, reported the shortage to the Board of Directors and called for an audit. It was not until the audit of October, 1970, that the two undeposited checks, each for $20,000 were discovered. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">We find this evidence amply sufficient to show specific intent on the part of Kaczmarek to defraud Liberty Federal and to support the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty on both counts in the indictment. As to the conspiracy, it is clear that it can exist without the formalities of an agreement, United States v. Varelli, 407 F.2d 735 (7 Cir. 1969), and that a conspiracy may be proved by circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences to be drawn by the jury from evidence of the parties\u2019 relationship, overt acts and the totality of their conduct. United States v. Cogwell, 486 F.2d 823 (7th Cir. 1973); Isaacs v. United States, 301 F.2d 706 (8th Cir. 1962). As to the substantive violation of the misapplication statute, the evidence strongly supports the jury\u2019s conclusion with respect to an unlawful intent to.injure or defraud because of Kaezmarek\u2019s obvious reckless disregard for the interests of Liberty Federal. Mulloney v. United States, 79 F.2d 566 (1st Cir. 1935). Also see United States v. Hickey, 360 F.2d 127 (7th Cir. 1966); United States v. Stevison, 471 F.2d 143 (7th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">(2) Kaezmarek requested the submission of \u201cgood faith\u201d instructions in connection with the crime of misapplication of funds. The court refused to give them but did give an instruction on specific intent, advising the jury that the \u201cgovernment must prove that the defendant knowingly did an act which the law forbids, or knowingly failed to do an act which the law requires, purposely intending to violate the law.\u201d The instruction as to the word \u201cwilfully\u201d adequately covered a defense of good faith; and the overruling of Kaezmarek\u2019s request was not error. United States v. Grizaffi, 471 F.2d 69, 75 (7th Cir. 1972). Also see United States v. Emalfarb, 484 F.2d 787 (7th Cir. 1973) and United States v. Pritchard, 458 F.2d 1036 (7th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-9\">(3) Kaezmarek assigns error to the admission of guilty pleas of co-defendants. However, under the decided cases in this Circuit, we find none since an appropriate cautionary instruction was given to the jury. United States v. Kahn, 381 F.2d 824 (7th Cir. 1967) ; United States v. Aldridge, 484 F.2d 655 (7th Cir. 1973). We are obliged to follow these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-10\">(4) Finally, Kaezmarek urges that his sentence was excessive and imposed as a penalty for standing trial. We find the sentence to be well within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>the limits of the statute. Indeed, a ten-year sentence and $15,000 fine is the maximum, while Kaczmarek received concurrent sentences of two years on each count and a $10,000 fine. But Kaczmarek says that there is a disparity. We think not. Both of Kaczmarek\u2019s codefendants who pleaded guilty received the same sentence \u2014 probation. Kaczma-rek, having elected to stand trial, subjected himself only to the risk of a judgment of conviction with appropriate statutory penalties attendant thereto. The authority of the District Court to impose any sentence within the statutory maximum is not subject to review except under \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d United States v. Humphreys, 457 F.2d 242 (7th Cir. 1972); Simpson v. United States, 342 F.2d 643 (7th Cir. 1965). Such circumstances are not present in this case; therefore we cannot say that the trial judge abused his discretion. Accordingly we find no merit in this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1107-11\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-12\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-13\">\u201ca) Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-14\">b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZzi\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 657 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apu\">\u201cWhoever, being an officer, agent or employee of or connected in any capacity with any . . . savings and loan corporation or association embezzles, abstracts, purloins or willfully misapplies any moneys, funds, credits, securities or other things of value belonging to such institution or pledged or otherwise entrusted to its care, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1107-20\">. The Government specified that under the scheme devised, Chemers would write personal checks in large amounts drawn on the Plaza bank. He would bring the checks to Liberty Federal and exchange them with the approval of Kaczmarek for Liberty Federal checks. Chemers then would proceed to a third bank, the Continental Bank, have the Liberty Federal checks certified and then have them deposited in his Plaza.account for payment. The problem was that Chemers did not have sufficient funds in his Plaza account to cover his original personal checks. The Government asserted that the scheme allowed Chemers the use of Liberty Federal\u2019s money without authorization and without collateral and that Kaczmarek, in reckless disregard for the interests of Liberty Federal, violated his duty to make certain Chem-ers was solvent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1108-8\">.
