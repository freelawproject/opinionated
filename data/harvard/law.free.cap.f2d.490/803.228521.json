Is the interception by a husband using electronic equipment of the conversations of his wife with a third party over the telephone in the marital home included in the statutory proscription? The context in which we must address this issue is a suit by the wife for civil damages against the husband, pursuant to Section 2520. The district court answered in the negative and we affirm, although the language and legislative history of the Act leaves the question in considerable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Harboring uncertainties as to his wife\u2019s faithfulness, appellee obtained a device for tapping and recording telephone conversations. He attached the device to phone lines within his home, and thereby intercepted conversations between his wife and another man. The conversations were mildly compromising establishing that the other man was making advances, and that while the wife was resisting, she was not doing so in a firm and final fashion. Convinced that he had \u201ccaught her,\u201d appellee played the tapes, or portions thereof, to various neighbors and family members. He also played them for a lawyer, on whose advice the wife agreed to an uncontested divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-18\">After the divorce appellant brought this action. Failing below, she has appealed, arguing before this court that her claim is bolstered by constitutional protections of privacy and emerging concepts of women\u2019s rights. We take a more pedestrian view of the case, and are of the opinion that it involves nothing more nor less than statutory construction. If Congress intended to extend such a remedy to persons in her position, appellant prevails; if it did not, she fails. This being the case, we turn to the statute and its history.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-19\">TITLE III</p>\n<p id=\"b878-20\">Title III of the Omnibus Act broadly prohibits the interception <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or disclosure of a wire communication,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> subject to stated exceptions which are not relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>to this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Violators are subject to criminal penalties of up to $10,000 or five years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They are also civilly liable to persons whose communications they intercept or disclose.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">The naked language of Title III, by virtue of its inclusiveness, reaches this case. However, we are of the opinion that Congress did not intend such a far-reaching result, one extending into areas normally left to states, those of the marital home and domestic conflicts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We reach this decision because Congress has not, in the statute, committee reports, legislative hearings, or reported debates indicated either its positive intent to reach so far or an awareness .that it might be doing so. Given the novelty of a federal remedy for persons aggrieved by the personal acts of their spouses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>within the marital home,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and given the severity of the remedy seemingly provided by Title III, we seek such indications of congressional intent and awareness before extending Title III to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Our independent search of legislative materials has been long, exhaustive, and inconclusive. To summarize the results, we have found no direct indications that Congress intended so much, and only several scattered suggestions that it was aware that the statute\u2019s inclusive language might reach this case. In support of this general statement, we now turn to a specific discussion of the statute and its history.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">An initial observation about Title III is that it is a part of a crime control act. In the Omnibus Act Congress sought generally to strengthen the position of law enforcement officials, <em>see </em>Senate Judiciary Comm., Senate Report No. 1097, 1968 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2112.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, the Senate report states that, \u201cThe major purpose of title III is to combat organized crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1968, p. 2157. Five of Title III\u2019s eleven sections deal almost exclusively with procedures for utilizing electronic surveillance against criminal activities, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2514, 2516-2519, and its principal goal is surveillance standards that satisfy the constitutional requirements of Berger v. New York, 1967, 388 U.S. 41, 87 S.Ct. 1873, 18 L.Ed.2d 1040, and Katz v. United States, 1967, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576. See <em>Senate Report, </em>pp. 2161-2163.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Be this as it may, Title III also was intended to protect individuals against invasions of their privacy by sophisticated surveillance devices. <em>Senate Report, </em>p. 2153. Thus, the Senate report introduces its section on the \u201cProblem\u201d with the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-10\">The tremendous scientific and technological developments that have taken place in the last century have made possible today the widespread use and abuse of electronic surveillance techniques. As a result of these developments, privacy of communication is seriously jeopardized by these techniques of surveillance. Commercial and employer-labor espionage is becoming widespread. It is becoming increasingly difficult to conduct business meetings in private. Trade secrets are betrayed. Labor and management plans are revealed. No longer is it possible, in short, for each man to retreat into his home and be left alone. Every spoken word relating to each man\u2019s personal, marital, religious, political, or commercial concerns can be intercepted by an unseen auditor and turned against the speaker to the auditor\u2019s advantage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-11\"><em>Id. </em>at U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1968, p. 2154. The report further states that, \u201cTo assure the privacy of oral and wire communications, title III prohibits all wiretapping and electronic surveillance by persons other than duly authorized law enforcement officers . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1968, p. 2153. The nature and breadth of Congress\u2019s response to private surveillance is fairly indicated by the Senate report's section entitled \u201cProhibition,\u201d quoted in full in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>For our purposes it must be pointed out that we have herein quoted virtually every phrase of the report\u2019s text dealing with private surveillance \u2014 amounting to less than one of the ten pages about Title III, the balance concerning electronic surveillance by law enforcement officials. Not only does the report, like the act, focus on crime control, but it also contains no clear indication that Congress intended to intrude into the marital relation within the marital home. We thus have considered it necessary to consult the extensive legislative hearings on the subject, the better to gauge Congress\u2019s intent and awareness.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">The impression left by these hearings is similar to that produced by the report \u2014the focus was official use of surveillance devices, with little explication of how far the private prohibition should extend. This is strikingly true of the hearings immediately preceding passage of Title III. While there are occasional references to the fact that the bill would prohibit private use of electronic surveillance techniques,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> there are no substantive discussions of the probable or desired reach of the prohibition. Earlier hearings also accorded little attention to private users. For example, we have found in Sen. McClellan\u2019s 1966 hearings only three relevant sentences.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Similarly, of Sen. Long\u2019s six-part 1965-1966 hearings, four parts dealt ex- \u201e clusively with government surveillance, and one with \u201cservice observing\u201d by telephone companies; Part 5 dealt in part with private use,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> although much of it concerned government serveillance practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Of what testimony there was about private surveillance, only a minor portion was with reference to the marital setting. The only relevant passages which we have found, in hearings stretching over five years, are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It should be noted that the concerns and information in these passages are primarily directed towards the involvement of private investigators in marital conflicts. Indeed, were appellant seeking to recover from a third party, we could not, on the basis of this legislative history, accept the defense that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>the interceptions were authorized by the husband. However, to our minds a third-party intrusion into the marital home, even if instigated by one spouse, \u25a0is an offense against a spouse\u2019s privacy of a much greater magnitude than is personal surveillance by the other spouse. The latter, it seems to us, is consistent with whatever expectations of privacy spouses might have vis-a-vis each other within the marital home.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>\u201cThe three large areas of snooping in this [non-governmental] field are (1) industrial (2) divorce cases, and (3) politics. So far, we have heard no real justification for continuance of snooping in these three areas. If any justification exists, we will probably hear about it in the next few weeks as we expect to explore this terrain thoroughly.\u201d <em>Hearings </em>#II, pt. 5, at 2261 (see note 10, <em>supra).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>When we narrow our search to mate-. rial relevant to this ultimate issue, that of whether Congress intended its regulations to invade the realm of personal acts within the marital home, we find very little indeed. We think that only two passages support appellant\u2019s case, these being the testimony of Ben Jamil and John W. Leon, quoted in note 14. These statements suggest congressional awareness that private individuals were using electronic surveillance techniques within their own homes. However, they do not support the proposition that Congress was concerned that such activities took place.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Given this inconclusive legislative history, we think two other factors are important. First, it is clear that Congress did not intend to prohibit a person from intercepting a family member\u2019s telephone conversations by use of an extension phone in the family home\u2014 subsection (5) (a) (i) of section 2510 directly covers this point.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If there is a convincing distinction between this clearly acceptable overhear and the overhear accomplished by appellee, we fail to see it. In fact, we think the (5) (a) (i) exemption is indicative of Congress\u2019s intention to abjure from deciding a very intimate question of familial relations, that of the extent of privacy family members may expect within the home vis-a-vis each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">Second, we note that not only does Title III have the primary goal of controlling crime, but that it also prescribes criminal sanctions for its violators. That is, if appellant prevails here then appellee is subject to severe criminal penalties, assuming of course that the prosecution could meet the higher standards of proof required for criminal convictions. We thus are bound by the principle that criminal statutes must be strictly construed, to avoid ensnaring behavior that is not clearly proscribed. <em>See </em>Kordel v. United States, 1948, 335 U.S. 345, 349, 69 S.Ct. 106, 109, 93 L.Ed. 52, 56. We consider this basic due process principle to be of considerable importance in this ease, in light of our own inability to determine from the statute and its legislative history whether one is prohibited from taping one\u2019s spouse\u2019s conversations within one\u2019s own home.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">As should be obvious from the foregoing, we are not without doubts about our decision. However, we have concluded that the statute is not sufficiently definite and specific to create a federal cause of action for the redress of appellant\u2019s grievances against her former husband. Our decision is, of course, limited to the specific facts of this case. No public official is involved, nor is any private person other than appellee, and the <em>locus in quo </em>does not extend beyond the marital home of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-9\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2510(4) &amp; (5) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-10\">\u201c(4) \u2018intercept\u2019 means the aural acquisition of the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-11\">(5) \u2018electronic, mechanical, or other device\u2019 means any device or apparatus which can be used to intercept a wire or oral communication other than\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-13\">(a) any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or any component thereof, (i) furnished to the subscriber or user by a communications common carrier in the ordinary course of its business and being used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business ; or (ii) being used by a communications common carrier in the ordinary course of its business, or by an investigative or law enforcement officer in the ordinary course of his duties ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-21\">(b) a hearing aid or similar device being used to correct subnormal hearing to not better than normal; . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b878-22\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2510(1) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-23\">\u201c(1) \u2018wire communication\u2019 means any communication made in whole or in part through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications by the aid of wire, cable, or other like connection between the point of origin and the point of reception furnished or operated by any person engaged as a common carrier in providing or operating such facilities for the transmission of interstate or foreign communications;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-24\">\u201cParagraph (1) defines \u201cwire communication\u2019 to include all communications carried by a common carrier, in whole or in part, through our Nation\u2019s communications network.

No one quarrels with the .proposition that the unauthorized use of these techniques by law enforcement agents should be prohibited. It is not enough, however, just to prohibit the unjustifiable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>interception, disclosure, or use of any wire or oral communications. An attack must also be made on the possession, distribution, manufacture, and advertising of intercepting devices. All too often the invasion of privacy itself will go unknown. Only by striking at all aspects of the problem can privacy be adequately protected. The prohibition, too, must be enforced with all appropriate sanctions. Criminal penalties have their part to play. But other remedies must be afforded the victim of an unlawful invasion of privacy. Provision must be made for civil recourse for damages. The perpetrator must be denied the fruits of his unlawful actions in civil and criminal proceedings. Each of these objectives is sought by the proposed legislation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\"><em>Senate </em>Report, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.

The latest twist in this game is the installation of tiny radio transmitters in cars that relay. to prying ears and tape recorders any conversations or other sounds produced by drivers and passengers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">Richard Gerstein, Dade County District Attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-13\">\u201cNonetheless, it is routine procedure in marital disagreements and other civil disputes for private detective agencies, generally with full knowledge of the lawyers, to tap telephones.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-14\"><em>Hearings </em>#II, pt. 2, at 1009 (see note 10, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">Bernard Spindel, private investigator/electronic technician (explaining the '10% of his work that he refers to as the \u201caffirmative, defensive type of eavesdropping\u201d) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-17\">\u201cIn other words, it is restricted to defense in the sense that a man believes that there is some wrongdoing within his own premises; we will help him electronically obtain the evidence of such wrongdoing.

He described the \u201c10-day blitz,\u201d named for the fact that if it uncovers nothing within ten days you may as well forget the theory that your spouse is playing around. The blitz includes telephone taps, car and room bugs, voice-activated tape recorders, and an automatic camera, all of which could be purchased for private use for $400. He testified that previously he would have employed the devices himself for a client, but no longer did so because of F.O.C. regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-23\">When questioned about the ethics of these practices, he replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-24\">\u201c[W]e have found statistically that once the truth is out in any domestic squabble, there is a 50% better chance of a couple being reconciled.
