J. Ruffin and Ralph Ruffin were convicted on separate counts of receiving and concealing firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(h) and (j).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ralph Ruffin received concurrent terms of three years\u2019 imprisonment on each count.

We agree and reverse the convictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">On February 23, 1972, defendants were stopped by police officers in St. Louis, Missouri, driving a 1968 black Ford LTD, after the car had been observed running a stop sign. According to the government\u2019s evidence, T. J. Ruf-fin was sitting on the passenger\u2019s side, Ralph Ruffin was driving and Frank Cooley Hearing, now deceased, was in the back seat. Officers testified at trial that T. J. Ruffin reached into his overcoat and withdrew a revolver with his left hand and a large automatic with his right hand. He passed both of these guns to the driver, Ralph Ruffin, who was observed taking them with his right hand and dropping them down on the floorboard. Thereafter, Ralph reached into his own waistband and withdrew a nickel plated revolver and also placed that on the floorboard. Upon a search the officers found three guns underneath the front seat.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">It was stipulated that both defendants had been previously convicted of crimes punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year. T. J. Ruffin was charged in Count One with receiving a .357 caliber magnum revolver, model security six, Serial No. 150-04758, and Ralph Ruffin in Count Two with receiving the same gun. It was stipulated that this gun was shipped on July 6, 1971, from the manufacturer in South Port, Connecticut, to a destination in LaMesa, Texas, by common carrier, and had been stolen from the carrier between July 9, 1971, and July 23, 1971, in Centreville, Illinois. Under Count Three, the concealment charge under which both defendants were found guilty, the gun involved was a Colt .45 caliber automatic pistol, government model, Serial No. 333933-C, which was stipulated as having been stolen from the trunk of an automobile belonging to an East St. Louis police officer in Col-linsville, Illinois, on January 12, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">THE RECEIVING COUNTS</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">Section 922(h) is part of Title IV of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Pub.L.No.90-351. This section makes it unlawful for certain classes of persons to receive a firearm <em>\u201cwhich has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d </em>The government\u2019s proof showed only that the revolver had been previously shipped from Connecticut to Texas and stolen in Illinois some seven months prior to the time the weapon was found in the defendants\u2019 possession. In construing Title VII of the same Act, the<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Supreme Court in United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L. Ed.2d 488 (1971), rejected the argument that Title IV and Title VII are redundant. Instead, the Court found significant differences between the two, both as to classes of people covered and, most relevant here, classes of behavior reached. Although the Court left open the exact reach of Title IV <em>(Bass, supra </em>at 343 n. 10, 92 S.Ct. at 520), it noted that \u201cTitle IV apparently does <em>not </em>reach possessions or intrastate transactions at all, even those with an interstate commerce nexus, <em>but is limited to the sending or receiving of firearms as part of an interstate transportation.\u201d Id. </em>at 342-343, 92 S.Ct. at 520 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">In construing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202(a) (part of Title VII), the Supreme Court was faced with the requirement that the receipt, possession, or transportation be-\u201cin commerce or affecting commerce.\u201d The Court concluded that this requirement was satisfied if the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>\u201cdemonstrates that the firearm received has <em>previously </em>traveled in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350, 92 S.Ct. at 524 (emphasis added). And, of significance to the present case, the Court noted that \u201c[t]his reading [of Title VII] preserves a significant difference between the \u2018receipt\u2019 offenses under Title IV and Title VII.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350 n. 18, 92 S.Ct. at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Thus, we conclude that it is not sufficient under \u00a7 922(h) for the government to prove that the firearm had at some remote time previously-traveled in interstate commerce. As pointed out in <em>Bass, </em>Title IV is primarily concerned with the <em>transportation </em>of firearms. Accordingly, for a receipt to be cognizable under \u00a7 922(h), the government must show that at the time the gun was received it was <em>part </em>of an interstate transportation. The proof in this case, as well as the count\u2019s instruction,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was inadequate to meet this test. <em>Accord, </em>United States v. Craven, 478 F.2d 1329, 1336 (6th Cir. 1973).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The government showed only that the gun had been stolen in Illinois from an interstate carrier and that it was found some seven months later in defendants\u2019 possession in Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">As recognized in <em>Bass, </em>this construction comports with the interpretation given the predecessor of \u00a7 922(h), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(f).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statutory language of \u00a7 902(f) relating to the interstate commerce requirement remained unchanged in \u00a7 922(h). In Tot v. United States, 319 U.S. 463, 63 S.Ct. 1241, 87 L.Ed. 1519 (1943), where the Court held unconstitutional the statutory presumption in \u00a7 902(f), it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">Both courts below held that the offense created by the Act is confined to the receipt of firearms or ammunition as a part of interstate transportation and does not extent to the receipt, in an intrastate transaction, of such articles which, at some prior time, have been transported interstate. The Government agrees that this construction is correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 466, 63 S.Ct. at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">THE CONCEALMENT COUNT</p>\n<p id=\"b634-14\">Count III, charging each defendant with concealing the automatic, arises under \u00a7 922(j) of Title IV. That section applies to a firearm <em>\u201cwhich is moving as, which is a part of, or which constitutes, interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d </em>At trial, the government\u2019s evidence showed that the gun had been stolen in Illinois on January 12, 1972, and was found in defendants\u2019 possession in Missouri on February 23, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-15\">We are unable to find any court decision which has construed the interstate commerce language of \u00a7 922(j). However, we find the only reasonable construction of \u00a7 922(j), like \u00a7 922(h), requires proof of transactions that are <em>a </em>part, <em>of </em>an interstate transaction. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>statutory language clearly requires a <em>continuing </em>relationship with interstate commerce at the time of the alleged concealment. The fundamental issue is whether the government has carried its burden of proof that the gun was still moving or was still part of interstate commerce at the time defendants concealed it. If the gun had come to rest in Missouri, after it was stolen in Illinois on January 12, 1972, the interstate character of the transaction would be over, and defendants could not be found guilty of any <em>federal </em>crime. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349-350, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971); Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U.S. 607, 66 S.Ct. 402, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The language relating to interstate commerce under \u00a7 922 (j) is virtually identical to the earlier language of the National Stolen Property Act, and its successor statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2313 and 2315.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We look to the judicial construction of these acts for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">In Booth v. United States, 154 F.2d 73 (9th Cir. 1946), the defendant was charged under the National Stolen Property Act with conspiracy to receive, conceal and store stolen stock certificates. The evidence established that the stock had been stolen from Seattle, Washington, and transported to California, where the defendant came into possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">The court reversed the conviction, on the basis of the following instruction which it found erroneous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-13\">If you believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants or any of them had unexplained possession in California of the securities involved, recently after their theft in Washington, you may infer from their possession that these securities were still a part of interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-14\">That is to say, if the jury believes the securities were stolen and entered into the flow of interstate commerce as such, and there being no evidence of an intermediate sale to a purchaser and that said securities came into the unexplained possession of the defendants, knowing said securities to be stolen property, you may infer .that the securities at the time they came into possession of the defendants were still in interstate commerce.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>Booth, supra </em>at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The Ninth Circuit found no logical basis upon which the inference could be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In Schwachter v. United States, 237 F.2d 640 (6th Cir. 1956), the defendant was convicted of selling an automobile moving in interstate commerce under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2313. The Sixth Circuit reversed, because of the trial court\u2019s failure to submit the interstate commerce question to the jury. The court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">It is recognized that the interstate movement of a car does not necessarily cease when the car stops and transportation of it into the other state ends. The <em>sale </em>thereafter may be an <em>incident </em>to the theft and <em>transportation </em>and so tied up with it as to constitute the final step of a continuous unlawful scheme. . . . <em>But its character of being a part of interstate commerce does not continue indefinitely after its transportation ends. </em>After a period of time and <em>depending upon what is done with the car, </em>it may no longer be correct to treat it as moving in interstate commerce. The acquisition of the car and later sale of it by a person who is in no way connected with the theft and transportation may be under such circumstances as to terminate its interstate character. It is a question of fact under the surrounding circumstances in each particular case. Being a question of fact it is for the jury to determine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-9\"><em>Schwachter, supra </em>at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">Here the trial court left the commerce question to be decided by the jury. The trial court\u2019s instruction only repeated the language of the statute as an element of the crime. However, the difficulty here is that the only fact bearing on whether the gun was concealed while still moving in interstate commerce is that it was stolen in another state some 41 days before defendants were found to have concealed it. The facts demon.strate only interstate movement at some earlier time. In order to convict, the jury necessarily had to infer that the gun was <em>still </em>moving in interstate commerce. In accord with the analogous decisions, we hold this inference does not rationally follow. Under the government\u2019s proof the defendants could just as easily have been concealing the gun sometime after it came to rest in Missouri. In this regard, the case of Davidson v. United States, 61 F.2d 250 (8th Cir. 1932), is factually similar. In an early decision under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 408, the facts disclosed that the car was stolen on March 23, 1931, in Hominy, Oklahoma, and transported to Kansas City, Missouri, on or about March 31, 1931. The charge was receiving and concealing a stolen auto which was moving in interstate commerce. The facts were undisputed, however, that the stolen car had come to rest in Missouri before the defendants came into possession of it. Nonetheless, this court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-13\">The mere fact that the ear had theretofore been transported in interstate commerce is not sufficient. The act does not purport to exercise jurisdiction over individuals who receive or sell stolen cars after such cars cease to move in or be a part of interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-15\">The time period between the interstate theft and the defendants\u2019 possession is, of course, a significant factor in determining the sufficiency of the ev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>idence to substantiate a conviction. The time element, however, is only one factor, but essential to our holding here, there must also exist other corroborative facts to support the charge that the defendants\u2019 possession of the stolen article was an intermediate or final step in the completion of an interstate scheme. <em>See, e.g., </em>United States v. Brady, 425 F. 2d 309 (8th Cir. 1970) (conviction affirmed; car stolen in Kansas October 8, 1968, defendant borrowed money to purchase a ear on October 2, bought car with Colorado license on October 21, immediately placed Missouri plates on car, obtained fictitious bill of sale from seller on November 28; defendant\u2019s purchase was \u201cfinal step\u201d of interstate transportation); Babb v. United States, 351 F.2d 863 (8th Cir. 1965) (conviction affirmed; switching of license plates by the receiver-defendant after recent theft and interstate transportation and proof of an intended trip to California showed stolen car still part of interstate commerce) ; United States v. Browning, 439 F.2d 813 (1st Cir. 1971) (conviction affirmed; defendant\u2019s sale in Rhode Island of auto stolen from Massachusetts \u201cfinal link\u201d in interstate chain); Pearson v. United States, 378 F.2d 555 (5th Cir. 1967) (conviction affirmed; jewel theft where the holding and delivery of the stolen ruby was part of the \u201cintegral scheme\u201d so as to be connected with the interstate transportation of it).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">This court in United States v. Briddle, 430 F.2d 1335 (8th Cir. 1970), discussed the sufficiency of proof required to show that the stolen property was still moving in interstate commerce at the time that it was feloniously received or concealed. Judge Vogel there wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">The test, therefore, is not the length of time the car is held or how often it was resold, but what was done with the car after it came into the defendant\u2019s possession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-7\"><em>Briddle, supra </em>at 1338-1339.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">In the present case there is no evidence to suggest that either defendant stole the gun or had any connection with its theft.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under the circumstances we find that there was not sufficient proof by the government to justify a jury finding that the firearm was moving as, or was a part of, or constituted interstate or foreign commerce when the defendants, or either of them, obtained possession of it. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Wyatt, 437 F.2d 1168 (7th Cir. 1971). <em>See also </em>Schwachter v. United States, 237 F.2d 640 (6th Cir. 1956) ; Grimsley v. United States, 50 F.2d 509 (5th Cir. 1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">There are insufficient facts on the present record to justify either defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 922(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">Judgments of convictions reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-10\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">(h) It shall be unlawful for any person\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aipj\">(1) who is under indictment for, or who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-13\">(2) who is a fugitive from justice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-14\">(3) who is an unlawful user of or addicted to marihuana or any depressant or stimulant drug (as defined in section 201 (v) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) or narcotic drug (as defined in section 4731(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954) ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-15\">(4) who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has. been committed to any mental institution; to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-25\">(j) It shall be unlawful for any person to receive, conceal, store, barter, sell, or dispose of any stolen firearm or stolen ammunition, or pledge or accept as security for a loan any stolen firearm or stolen ammunition, which is moving as, which is a part of, or which constitutes, interstate or foreign commerce, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the firearm or ammunition was stolen.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\">.

Although not objected to by the defendants, the trial court\u2019s instruction inaccurately described the necessary proof: \u201cIn order to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt under Counts 1 and 2 of the Indictment the Government need show that each of the defendants received a firearm <em>which had previously traveled in interstate commerce.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b634-9\">. United States v. Craven, 478 F.2d 1329 (6th Cir. 1973), is tiie only circuit court decision dealing with the proper construction of the interstate commerce language of \u00a7 922(h). Although the primary issue was whether an inference of receipt could be drawn from constructive possession, the court also discussed the interstate commerce requirement. The Court of Appeals, citing <em>Bass </em>and <em>Tot, </em>recognized that \u00a7 922(h) does not extend to firearms which have merely <em>previously </em>been transported interstate. However, the court stated that \u201c[t]he interstate transportation element of \u00a7 922(h) was met by the prosecution\u2019s evidence of the very recent Lexington, Kentucky, to Wood-lawn, Ohio, transportation of the weapon.\u201d <em>Graven, supra </em>at 1336. The time period involved was only ten days. The court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"axq-dedup-0\">[R]eceipt under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h)(1) may be shown circumstantially by proving possession, at least where no significant passage of time has elapsed between the interstate transportation and proof of possession, and no intervening intrastate transactions have occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 1337.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b634-18\">.
