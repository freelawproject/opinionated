The complaints allege that the repossession of plaintiffs\u2019 autos by the bank, lien holders, pursuant to the Minnesota statutes, was in violation of the due process clause of the United States Constitution on the grounds that the repossession of the autos was done without affording the parties prior notice and hearing. Plaintiffs sought a temporary injunction to prevent the repossession and sale of their respective autos.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-9\">The district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 request to designate a three-judge court to entertain plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional attack on the state statute, dismissed the suit against the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles and denied the prayer seeking a temporary injunction. On appeal plaintiffs assert error as to each ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-10\"> The only order this court has jurisdiction to review relates to the denial of the temporary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to appeal from the dismissal of the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles lacks finality in that the district court still has jurisdiction of the pending suits against the Bank. The district court has not directed that the judgment is final pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) as required when the order adjudicates the rights and liabilities of fewer than all of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-13\">Similarly, this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal from the denial of the request for a three-judge court in the absence of a final order. <em>See </em>Ferrara v. Louisiana, 443 F.2d 344 (5th Cir. 1971); Lindauer v. Oklahoma City Urban Renewal Authority, 439 F.2d 761 (10th Cir. 1970); <em>cf. </em>Hartmann v. Scott, 488 F.2d 1215 (8th Cir. 1973). Mandamus to the Court of Appeals is the appropriate remedy to challenge the denial of a properly requested three-judge court. <em>See </em>9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 110.03[3],</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-14\">In order to justify the grant of a temporary injunction a party must demonstrate an inadequate remedy at law, <em>i. e., </em>that irreparable damage will follow without the grant of equitable relief and second, a reasonable probability that the party seeking the injunction would ultimately prevail. <em>See </em>Brown v. Chote, 411 U.S. 452, 93 S.Ct. 1732, 36 L.Ed.2d 420 (1973); Telex Corp. v. International Business Machines Corp., 464 F.2d 1025 (8th Cir. 1972). In the instant ease plaintiffs concede that if the car was wrongfully attached and sold that plaintiffs would have a claim for damages. Furthermore, a prior ruling of this court that \u201cstate action\u201d under \u00a7 1983 is not involved when a private party, acting as a creditor relying on state law,' attaches secured property of a debtor, would tend to lessen the probability of ultimate success in the action filed. <em>See </em>Bichel Optical Laboratories, Inc. v. Marquette National Bank, 487 F.2d 906 (8th Cir. 1973). Under the circumstances, we find the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the preliminary injunctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>The appeals as to the dismissal of the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles and the denial of a three-judge court are dismissed for the reason that they do not constitute final orders. The district court\u2019s order denying injunctive relief is affirmed. ' -</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
