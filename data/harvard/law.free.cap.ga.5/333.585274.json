There were other attachments claiming said money, but no controversy or issue was made in respect of them. It appeared, if the attachment of the defendant in error, Wiley,- should recovei its full amount, that the attachment in favor of the plaintiff in error, Casey, would be partially excluded. Thereupon, the original attachments, bonds, and other papers pertaining to the respective cases of the said parties, Casey and Wiley, were submit tod to the Court below, when it appeared that the attachment in favor of Wiley, was not issued and made returnable in terms of, and in accordance with the Statutes in such cases, made and provided, in this, that said attachment bore date, and was issued on the twenty-seventh day of February, eighteen hundred and forty-seven, and was made returnable to the next Superior Court, to be held in and for the said county of Muscogee, on the second Monday in February, then next, when in truth, and fact, there was no Superior Court to be held in and for said county of Muscogee, on the day to which said attachment was made returnable. Whereupon the counsel of Casey moved to exclude the judgment of Wiley from participation in said fund, on the ground that his attachment was null and void, on the ground that it had not been issued and returned in the manner prescribed by the Statute. Which motion, the Court below overruled, deciding that the attachment of Wiley was good and valid, and entitled to be paid out of said money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-7\">To which decision the counsel of Casey excepted, and assigned for error, that the Court below directed that the attachment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>in favor of Wiley was good and valid, notwithstanding said attachment was not made returnable to the next Court to be held after the expiration of thirty days after the issuing of said attachment, and was made returnable to a day on which no Court was holden, and nearly twelve months after the issuing of said attachment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-5\">Bethune &amp; Patterson, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-6\">E.

Prince\u2019s Dig. </em>31. If the attachment is taken out, more than thirty days before the <em>next Court, </em>in the county in which it is levied, it must be made returnable to <em>that next Court; </em>if within thirty days before the sitting of the next Court, then it must be made returnable to the Court <em>next after </em>the expiration of the said thirty days, and not otherwise. The right and interest of the debtor are not to <em>he prejudiced </em>by making the attachment returnable to a <em>distant Court. </em>This attachment was taken out more than thirty days before the <em>next Court, </em>but is made returnable, nearly <em>twelve months </em>after its date. To apply the facts of this case to the requirements of the Act of 1799, in regard to the issuing and return of attachments, is to decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">Let the judgment of the Court below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
