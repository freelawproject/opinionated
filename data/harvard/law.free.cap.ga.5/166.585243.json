The declaration alleged that Harvey, since the indorsement, had become a certified bankrupt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-10\">It appeared on the trial, that Chastain &amp; Harvey, had been partners in trade, and it was in proof by the defendant, that the copartnership had been dissolved before the indorsement of the note; that the indorsement was made by Harvey ; that the firm\u2019s name was used by Harvey, without his (Chastain\u2019s) authority. The- plaintiff then proposed to prove that the note was indorsed by Harvey, to pay a debt due from the firm to the plaintiff. The Court refused to allow the proof, deciding that that would make no difference in the liability of Chastain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-11\">To this decision, the defendant excepted, and brought his writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-12\">Lyon, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-13\">Strozier, for defendant, cited\u2014 '</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-14\">2 <em>Bisset on Partn. </em>162, 90, 92. 1 <em>H.
