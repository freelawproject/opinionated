It was made at the August term, 1847, and dismissed at the ensuing term, on account of the failure of the applicant to file a brief of the testimony, as required by the 61st rule of practice. It is conceded that no <em>brief -was filed </em>under the <em>revision </em>and <em>approval </em>of the Court. It is contended, however, that a brief of the testimony was lodged in the Clerk\u2019s office, after having been submitted to the inspection of the opposite counsel. The record does not show that a brief of the <em>whole </em>testimony ever was <em>filed. </em>But even if it did, there being no evidence that it was agreed upon by the opposite counsel or approved by the Court, the motion was properly dismissed. <em>Petty and others vs. Mahaffy, 3 Kelly, </em>217.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Note. \u2014 See also <em>Charles Hartridge vs, D. &amp; A.
