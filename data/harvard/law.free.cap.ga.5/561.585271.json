subject to taxation, a tax of one fourth of one per cent, on the present valuation thereof, and that the clerk of council forthwith make out and deliver to the collector and treasurer of said city, a

certain ordinances of the City Council o\u00ed Augusta, therein mentioned, and to punish those who may injure their property,\u201d by which it is declared that all persons, then holding or who might

Houghton, Thomas J. \"Walton, Philip McGran, Benjamin F. Chew, David L. Curtis and John Phinizy, filed their Bill in Equity, in Richmond Superior Court, charging the foregoing facts, and farther, that they were owners, of real estate in the city of Augusta, upon which taxes had been assessed, agreeably to the provisions of the last ordinance, and executions issued against them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-7\">The bill charged, that it was not competent for the Legislature, constitutionally, to make them members of a corporation without their consent, and subject them to liability as such, and that they never consented to become members of said corporation \u2014 farther, that the City Council had no authority by law, to levy taxes on real estate, to be expended without the corporate limits, whereas tho canal was constructed from a point called \u201cBull\u2019s Sluice,\u201d some seven or eight miles from said city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-8\">The bill charged that said canal had not been constructed in accordance with the provisions of said ordinance, because it prescribed that it should be constructed along the high ground between Jackson and Washington streets, south of the Beaver Dam ; whereas the commissioners have stopped said canal at the street above the Upper Market, so that the owners of real estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>in the middle and lower part of said city, have been deprived of whatever advantage might have resulted from the construction of said canal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-5\">The bill farther charges, that the City Council have no authority to levy a tax upon one species of property, and not to include all upon which taxes are levied for the support and government of said city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-6\">The bill prayed an injunction, which was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-7\">The defendants answered, admitting the allegations in the bill as to the facts charged, except as to the location of the canal. They insist that the canal has been constructed as described in the\u2019 ordinance, so far as it is completed, and has not been completed the whole distance, simply from the want of funds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-8\">Upon coming in of the answer, a motion was made to dissolve the injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-9\">1st.

The power intended to be delegated to the corporate authorities of the city, by the Legislature, and the reasons, therefor, may be gathered from the preamble to the Act, which recites, \u201c Whereas, from the extent and population of 'the town of Augusta, its growing importance,\u2019 both with respect to increase' of inhabitants and diffusive commerce, it is indispensably necessary that many regulations should be made, for the preservation of peace and good order within the same: And whereas, from the many weighty and important matters that occupy the attention of the Legislature at their general meeting, it has hitherto-been found inconvenient, and may hereafter become more so, for them to devise, consider, deliberate on, and determine all such laws, and regulations, as emergencies, or the <em>local circumstances </em>of the said town may from time to time require, be it enacted, &amp;c.\u201d <em>Marbury and Crawford\u2019s Dig. </em>136. It was manifestly the intention of the Legislature, to delegate to the corporate authorities of the city of Augusta, the power and authority to make-such laws and regulations for the inhabitants of the city, as \u201c contingencies, or the <em>local </em>circumstances\u201d thereof, might from time to time require.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The Legislature, under the Constitution, as we have seen, had the power to make all laws and ordinances which they might deem necessary and proper, for the good of the State, not repugnant to the Constitulion.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">What power and authority did the Legislature delegate to, andconferupun the City Council of Augusta,by the Act of 1798 ? The Act declares, that the City Council of Augusta, \u201cshall be vested with full power and authority, from time to time, under their common seal, to make and establish such by-laws, rules and ordinances, respecting the harbor, streets, public buildings, workhouses, markets, wharves, public houses, carriages, wagons, carts, drays, pumps, buckets, fire engines, the care of the poor, the regulation of disorderly people, negroes, and in general, any other bylaw or regulation that shall appear to them requisite and necessary, for the <em>security, welfare, </em>and <em>convenience </em>of the said city, or fox preserving peace, order and good government within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>same, and the said City Council shall also be vested with full, power and authority, to make such <em>assessments </em>on the inhabitants of Augusta, or those who hold taxable property within the same, for-the <em>safety, benefit, convenience and advantage of the said city, as shall appear to them </em>expedient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Had the City Council of Augusta the power and authority, under their charter, to make and establish the ordinance, for the assessment of the tax in question, on the real estate of the complainants, located within the limits of the city, as stated in the record ? \"We are of opinion, the City Council had such power and authority, under their charter of'1798, but if they did not, the Act of 27th December, 1845, expressly adopts and confirms the ordinances of the City Council, in regard to the construction of the canal, which, in our judgment, it was competent for the Legislature to have done. <em>Truchelut vs. The City Council, </em>1 <em>Nott and McCord\u2019s Rep. </em>227. But it is contended, the tax assessed by the City Council on the property of the complainants, is against common right, and the principles of the social compact, and'operates <em>oppressively. </em>The answer to this argument is, that the City Council of Augusta had the authority delegated to them by the sovereign power of the State, to make the assessment on the inhabitants of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">When the law-making power acts within the scope of its delegated authority, the Courts cannot interfere. It is the duty of the judicial tribunals of .the country, to <em>execute </em>and <em>enforce </em>all <em>constitutional </em>laws, and not to <em>muhe </em>them. The remedy against the effect of oppressive legislation, delegated to municipal corporations, is in the hands of the people, or their representatives. It was competent for the Legislature to have <em>restricted, </em>the power of legislation by the corporation, in its charter, and the inhabitants of the city elect their own officers, whose ordinances are presumed to express the will of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\"><bracketnum>[1.]</bracketnum> A corporation, says Chief Justice Marshall, <em>(in Dartmouth College vs. Woodward,) </em>is an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law. Being the mere creature of the law, it possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it, either expressly, or as incidental to its very existence. These are such as are supposed best calculated to effect the object for which it was created. 4 <em>Wheat. </em>518. 4 <em>Cond. R. N. S. </em>543.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number><bracketnum>[2.]</bracketnum> The power delegated by the General Assembly to the City Council of Augusta, as appears by their charter, is to make assessments on the inhabitants of the city, or those who hold taxable property therein, for certain specific objects, (to-wit:) for the <em>safety, benefit, convenience and advantage of the said </em>city, <em>as shall appear to them expedient.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In pursuance of the authority thus delegated to them, the City Council have adjudged by their ordinance, that it is for the safety, benefit, convenience and advantage of the city of Augusta, that the canal mentioned in the record, should be constructed for the purpose of better securing an abundant supply of water for the city, as well as for manufacturing purposes, and have made an assessment upon the real estate, within the limits of the city, of one half of one per cent, on the value thereof, to enable them to accomplish that object.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The inhabitants of the city are to be furnished with an abundant supply of water, to protect their property against fire, and for other purposes, and the payment of the tax assessed by the City Council on the property of the inhabitants, so to be protected, is the means by which the contemplated benefits are to be enjoyed by them. We see nothing in the ordinance which is <em>unreasonable, </em>or which violates the charter, or the laws of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">It was urged on the argument, that to compel the complainants to pay the tax, would have the effect to make them stockholders in the canal company against their consent. It is true, when they shall have paid the tax, they will be entitled to receive a certificate of such payment, which will secure to them, and' their assignees, an interest in the canal stock <em>; </em>but it is at the option of the complainants, whether they will take a certificate, and be_ come stockholders in the canal company \u2014 this part of the ordinance was intended for their benefit, and they may renounce it if they should think proper to do so. The assessment of the tax is not made on their property, as <em>stockholders </em>in the canal company, but on their property as <em>citizens, </em>owning real estate, within the corporate limits of the city. Whenever the complainants shall be made stockholders in the canal company, against their consent, and an assessment shall be made on their property, as such stockholders, then it will be time enough to decide whether they can be made stockholders in the canal company, against their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>consent. With regard to the liability of the complainants to p&gt;ay the assessment of the tax as citizens, owning real estate within the corporate limits of the city of Augusta, the same principle prevails as in the community at large, that the acts of the <em>majority, </em>in cases within the charter powers, bind the <em>whole. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. </em>293. <em>The King vs. Buston, </em>3 <em>Term Rep. </em>592.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\">In .any view which we have taken of this case, as presented'by the record before us, we are of the opinion, the judgment of the Court below should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
