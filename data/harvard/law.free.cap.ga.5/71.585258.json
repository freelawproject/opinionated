The facts are as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-12\">At the April term of the Superior Court of Muscogee county, Abraham Key brought his action at Law, against Echols as the maker, and Ragan as the indorser of a promissory note for $516 12, dated March 25th, 1839, due 30th April, 1839, and payable to Ragan\u2019s order. At the April term, 1841, the cause was tried,' and Key had a verdict. The defendants then appealed to a special jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-13\">Before the trial on the appeal, Echols, the present defendant in error, filed his bill, charging that the n.pte had been obtained from him <em>through the fraud of Ragan, </em>and that Key purchased the note after it was due. The bill prayed an injunction, and a discovery and relief. The defendants answered the bill, replications were filed, the cause tried, and the defendants had a decree in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>their favor. Echols then appealed to another jury, and at the second trial, which was had at May term, 1848 there having been a settlement between Ragan and Echols, Echols moved the Court, after <em>orally waiving a decree vs. Kagan, </em>that he be permitted <em>to examine Ragan as a witness in the came in his behalf. </em>This motion was granted \u2014 Ragan was examined, and Echols had a verdict. Thereupon, Key filed his bill of exceptions, and brings his cause to this Court. The facts in the second case are these: The verdict above referred to, was obtained, on the 23d May, 1848. On the 30th, the plaintiff in error, Key, moved a rule\u00bb*'-* <em>si, </em>for anew trial, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-5\">\u201c And now comes the said Abraham Key, and asks the Court for a rehearing and new trial in the said cause, on the ground that the verdict and decree are contrary to law, and the rules and principles of Equity. And after hearing said application, it is ordered that the complainant show cause, <em>as soon as counsel can be heard, </em>why the same should not be granted.\u201d Appended to the rule, was the brief of the evidence and proceedings in the cause, as above set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-6\">During the term the motion for a new trial was argued in the Court below, and the motion denied; whereupon Key excepted, and brought his case by writ of error to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b84-7\">W.

The complainant charges in his hill, that the note was <em>fraudulently </em>procured from him by Ragan, and that Key purchased it after due. The record discloses, that Key had no participation in the fraud whatever, in procuring the note fronijthe -complainant, nor any <em>actual </em>knowledge of it when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>purchased the <em>paper, </em>and is only chargeable with <em>constructive ncf</em>tice, in consequence of having acquired his title to the paper from Ragan, subsequent to its maturity.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The whole equity of the complainant\u2019s bill, is founded on the alleged fraud of Ragan, in procuring the note from the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\"><bracketnum>[1.]</bracketnum> On the trial, the complainant proposed to examine Ragan as a witness, (having first obtained an order for that purpose,) against Key. The counsel for Key objected to his being examined as a witness against him, as Ragan was the principal defendant in the cause. The Court overruled the objection, andThe witness was examined, whereupon the counsel for the defendant Key excepted, and now assigns the same for error here. The record shows that the complainant <em>orally </em>waived any decree against Ragan, but did not move to strike his name out of the record, for the rea.son, as we suppose, if he had done so, his whole case would have went out. According to the case, as made by the complainant\u2019s bill, when he <em>orally </em>waived any decree against Ragan, he virtually waived his case out of Court \u2014 for Key can only be affected, by first establishing the alleged <em>fraud </em>on the part of Ragan. When Ragan\u2019s fraud shall be established, then Key\u2019s title to the note is affected, because he derived it from Ragan, after it became due. Without the allegation offraud, on thepart of Ragan, the Court would have had no jurisdiction of the cause, and to our minds it would present rather a novel spectacle, in a Court of Equity, for the complainant to <em>orally </em>waive a decree against the only party to his bill, whose <em>fraudulent </em>conduct alone, gave to the Court jurisdiction of his cause. If the complainant had moved the Court to strike out of the bill, the name of Ragan, and the charges made against him, which alone entitles him to a decree, the whole case would had been out of Court; but to avoid this consequence, the complainant is permitted to make an <em>oral </em>waiver of a decree, against the principal defendant, who perpetrated the fraud, and whose fraudulent conduct alone, entitled him to a decree against the other party, who derived title to the paper, through him. Where defendants have been made parties to a bill, for mere form\u2019s sake, and against whom no decree is prayed <em>in the hill, </em>they may be examined as witnesses, if necessary. <em>Gresley\u2019s Eq. Evidence, </em>243\u20144. 2 <em>Madd. Ch. Practice, </em>415.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><bracketnum>[2.]</bracketnum> The true rule, as applicable to this case, is stated by Mr. Maddock. \u201c If a plaintiff chooses to examine a defendant as a witness, he cannot have a decree against him, and if from the nature of the case, that defendant would be <em>primarily </em>liable to the plaintiff, and another defendant only in a <em>secondary </em>degree, the plaintiff loses his remedy altogether.\u201d 2 <em>Mad. Ch. Practice, </em>417. <em>Thompson vs. Harrison, </em>1 <em>Cox\u2019s cases, </em>344. <em>In Lewis vs. Owen, </em>1 <em>Iredell\u2019s Eq. Rep. </em>290, the same rule is recognized. In that case it washeld, if the defendant examined as a witness be the <em>cmo primarily </em>liable to the plaintiff and the other defendant only <em>secondarily </em>liable, the plaintiff, necessarily gives up his claim against both, by the examination of the former. The same rule is supported by <em>Ch. Walworth, in Bradley vs. Root, 5 Paige\u2019s Rep. </em>636. Ragan; as we have seen, is the party <em>primarily </em>liable for the fraud, the <em>actual perpetrator of it. </em>Key, the other defendant, had no actual participation in the frand of Ragan, in procuring the note, and as the record shows, had no <em>actual </em>knowledge of it, at the time he received it from Ragan; consequently, his liability to be perpetually enjoined from collecting it is <em>secondary, </em>depending on the establishment of the fraud of Ragan, through whom he derived his title to the note, after its maturity. By examining Ragan as a witness, who was the <em>actual perpetrator </em>of the fraud, and <em>primarily </em>liable therefor, the complainant precluded himself from having a decree against <em>him ; </em>and it follows, as a necessary consequence, under the rule laid down, that he could not have a decree against Key, the other defendant, who is only affected by <em>constructive </em>notice of the fraud, by purchasing the note after it was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Let the judgment of the Court below be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
