The executors named in the will of James Beal, were said Robert Beal, \"Walter Harris, and Bennett Crafton; the said Robert Beal alone, having originally qualified, and Bennett Crafton having qualified since the death of said Robert Beal. The executor Walter Harris, never did qualify.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-8\">On the part of the defendants below, testimony was submitted, showing that said Walter Harris, being the only trustee who resided in the neighborhood of said testator, though he had not qualified as executor, attended to the business of the estate gen \u25a0 erally, though concurrently with, and in subordination to the said Robert Beal. It was in proof, that said Robert Beal lent Harris the sum of $1262 544, and took his note therefor, due 1st January, 1839, with an indorsement thereon, that the money belonged to Samuel B.

That said Walter Harris, and Samuel B.

That there was evidence in the case, such as ought to be considered by the Court and jury, going to show that the devise in James Beal\u2019s will, to his executors in trust, for Samuel B.- and Elizabeth T. Crafton, of one half of the tract of land on Germany\u2019s creek, in Columbia county, on which Robert Beal lived,containing-five hundred acres, more or less, had been <em>adeemed or revoked </em>by the said James, before his death, by a sale of his said land, through his agent, Robert Beal, to Jesse Clark; and that therefore, the defendants ought not to be held to account for that devise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-5\">3d. That the fact that some of the trust money had been lent by Robert Beal_ to Walter Harris, without other security than the promissory note of said Walter Harris, was not conclusive evidence of the said Robert\u2019s personal liability to make good the loan to the <em>cestui que trust; </em>but that if it appeared that Robert Beal, in making said loan, had acted with <em>ordinary care and circumspection, </em>he-ought not to be required, personally, to account for the money so loaned, even if it had been lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-6\">4th. That in taking the account against the defendant, interest ought not to be calculated <em>continuously, </em>from the moment at which the trust fund, or parts of it, came into Robert Beal\u2019s hands, but that there were intervals during which it ought not to be counted; of which kind was the period of twelve months, next after the death of James Beal, twelve months next after the death of Robert Beal, and twelve months next after the marriage of Martha J. Beal to Nathan H. Beal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-7\">The Court below charged the jury, among other things,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-8\">First, That the complainant, Bennett Crafton, as qualified executor of said James Beal, deceased, was entitled to the trust property, for the purpose of executing the trust devolved upon him by the last will of said James Beal. That the bill ought not to be dismissed, and that the cause need not be ordered to stand over until either Walton Harris or Samuel B. Crafton, the <em>cestui que trust, </em>should be brought before the Court, as parties for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>purposes of complete equity between the partios, and all persons whose rights might be involved in this proceeding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-4\">Second, That an absoloto sale, either by James Beal, the testator, or by any other person by him authorised, in his lifetime, of any portion of the bequeathed and devised property in trust, by his will, would be held to be a revocation of the will, in respect to that particular property <em>; </em>but that nothing was to be received as evidence of such absolute sale of land by the testator, but his deed of conveyance ; and no valid authority could be given to any other person, to effect such absolute sale, but the written power of attorney, under the hand and seal of the testator, in his life-time, and that, in the absence of any such evidence as the deed of Jas. Beal, to the premises in question, or his written power of attorney, to convey under seal executed in his lifetime, and especially in the absence of any proof of recognition, by James Beal, in his life-time, of Robert Beal\u2019s bargain to sell the land, as his agent, they ought to conclude that the will in that respect, had not been revoked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-5\">Third, That the jury ought to consider the loan of any portion of the trust fund to Harris, as on the same footing with a loan to any other person,- that although said Harris was named executor and trustee in the will, yet, according to the decision of our Supreme Court already referred to, (1 <em>Kelly, </em>322, 323,) the complainant, as the only qualified executor of James Beal, had a right to the possession of the trust fund bequeathed to Elizabeth T. and Samuel B. Crafton, and of consequence, the right to have an account of it, with the representatives of the estate of said Robert Beal, the deceased executor and trustee, without respect to whom he had loaned it in his lifetime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-6\">Fourth, That in taking the account against the defendants, interest ought to be calculated from the time at which the trust fund, or parts of it, came to Robert Beal\u2019s hands, the intervals only excepted, during which the estates of Robert Beal, the defendant\u2019s intestate, and of James Beal, his testator, were without representation. That trustees were chargeable with simple interest as matter of course, unless satisfactory evidence was given to the jury, that with ordinary prudence and skill in the management of the fund, no interest could have been realized. That at all events, trustees were answerable to the <em>cestui que trust, </em>for all the actual earnings of the trust fund, as well as the fund itself, commissions allowed by the Statute of Georgia only excepted, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>for no more, unless in cases of gross negligence, or where they mixed up the trust fund with their .own, in business, of the profits of which they refused, in answer to a bill filed on behalf of their <em>cestui que </em>trust, to give any account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-5\">To which charge and instructions of the Court, the defendants excepted. - ,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-6\">Jones, Benning &amp; JoNes, for plaintiffs in error, submitted[:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-7\">1. 1.

It is now insisted that before a valid decree can be made, against the defendants, Walter Harris, one of the executors named in the will of James Beal, but who <em>never qualified as such, </em>and Samuel B. Crafton, one of the <em>cestui que trusts, </em>should be made parties. It does not appear from the record, that Harris is anything more than a mere <em>debtor </em>to the estate; that he borrowed a portion of the trust fund,' for which he. gave his note. It is true, he states, that being the only one of the executors, or trustees, who resided in the neighborhood of the deceased testator, he attended to the business of the estate, though concurrently with, and in <em>subordination </em>to, Robert Beal, the <em>only qualified executor </em>at that time. He never took upon himself the execution of the trusts, under the will. The complainant, Bennett Crafton, has qualified as executor, and has taken upon himself the execution of the trusts, declared by the testator\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\"><bracketnum>[1].</bracketnum> Nor do we think, Samuel B. Crafton, one of the <em>cestui que trusts, </em>under the will, was a <em>necessary </em>party in this case. The general rule laid down by Mr. Justice Story, as to parties, is stated be, \u201c that where any persons are made trustees for the payment of debts, and legacies, they may sustain a suit; either as plaintiffs or defendants, without bringing before the Court, the creditors or legatees for whom they are trustees, which, in many cases, would be impossible. And the rights of creditors, or legatees, for whom they are trustees, will be bound, by the decision of the Court, when fairly obtained, for or against the trustees. In such cases, the trustees, like executors, are supposed to represent the interests of all persons, creditors, or <em>legatees.\u201d Story Eq. Pleading, </em>14-5, <em>sec. </em>150. Here Crafton is made by the will executor and trustee. We do not pretend to say, such a case might not be made, as would make it necessary for the <em>cestui que trust </em>to be made a party for the protection of his interest. -</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\"><bracketnum>[2.]</bracketnum> In relation to the ademption of the land, on Germany\u2019s creek, by a sale thereof by the testator, in his life time, we think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>the general proposition as stated by the Court below, is too broad ; although, as applicable to the state of facts exhibited by the record in this case, no injury was done to the plaintiff\u2019s in error. The Court instructed the jury, \u201cthat nothing was <em>to be </em>received as evidence of such absolute sale of land by the testator, but his <em>deed of conveyance, </em>and no valid authority could be given to any other person, to effect such absolute sale, but the <em>written power of attorney, wider the hand and seal of the testator, </em>in his lifetime.\u201d Had such a contract been proved, on the part of the testator, for the sale of the land, in his lifetime, though not proved by <em>deed, </em>under his hand and seal, as would have eniitled the vendee to a <em>specific execution </em>of such contract, in a Court of Equity, we apprehend the devise under the will, would be considered as defeated by such contract. But the facts which are relied on here, to defeat the devise under the will, are, that Robert Beal sold the land to Clark, and gave him a bond for titles in his own name for one half the land, and as <em>agent </em>for his father, the testator, for the other half. When the money was paid by the vendee, Robert Beal took up the bond, made a title to one half, and as executor and trustee for the other half, and Walter Harris and Bennett Crafton as trustees, joined in the deed with him, for the half of the land, which he purported to convey, as executor and trustee. Now there is no evidence, either <em>parol or written, </em>that Robert Beal had any authority from his father, James Beal, to act as <em>his agent, </em>in making sale of the land, or that he ever recognized such sale in his lifetime. The only evidence of Robert Beal\u2019s <em>agency, </em>in making sale of the land, are <em>his own acts, </em>done without the assent, knowledge, or recognition of his father, in his lifetime, so far as the record informs us. If James Beal, the testator, made no contract, by himself or <em>authorised agent, </em>in his lifetime, for the sale of the land, the deed made by his qualified executor, and the two trustees, since his death, will not defeat his title, good at the time of his death, so as to prevent the land from passing to the <em>cestui que trust, </em>under his will. As it regards the loan of a portion of the trust fund to Harris, we concur in the view taken by the Court below, in its charge to the jury, that they ought to consider the loan as on the same footing with a loan made to any other person. Harris never qualified as executor, nor is there any evidence he accepted the trust under the will; although he attended to some of the business of the estate, in the neighbor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>hood where the testator died, but concurrently with, and <em>subordinate </em>to, Robert Beal, the qualified executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><bracketnum>[3.]</bracketnum> With regard to the question of interest, we do not think the defendants in the Court below, have any just cause of complaint to the charge of the Court, as the same appears in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The bequest of the Chavers and Longstreet notes, is a specific legacy, and the general rule is, that specific legacies, of a productive nature, bear interest from the death of the testator. <footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em>2 Williams on Executors, </em>876. The rule in respect to interest, as stated by the Court to the jury, was quite as <em>favorably </em>stated, for the defendants, as they had any right to expect under the law. Consequently, and for the reasons already given, in relation to the other grounds of error assigned upon the record, the judgment of the Court below must be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-14\">Note. \u2014 See <em>Graybill Butts vs. Warren, </em>4 <em>Ga.
