Tried before Judge Warren, May Term, 1848.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-7\">The action in this case, was brought by the plaintiff in error against the defendant in error, returnable to the November term of the Court below, in 1846, upon a note of hand for $464, made by the defendant\u2019s intestate, bearing date the 29th day of May, 1838, and payable twelve months thereafter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-8\">To this action the defendant pleaded the Statute of Limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-9\">It appeared upon the trial, and by way of reply to this plea, that Thomas G. Cowart, the maker of said note, departed this life in the fall of the year eighteen hundred and forty, and that administration upon his estate, was granted to the defendant in May, eighteen hundred and forty-one. No evidence having been submitted on the part of the defendant, the case was submitted to the Court and jury upon the foregoing facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-10\">On the part of the plaintiff it was insisted, that the death of the maker of the note, and the granting of letters of administration on his estate to the defendant, suspended the operation of the Statute of limitations, for, and during the term of twelve months, from and aftei the grant of letters of administration, when the plaintiff was prohibited by law from sueing the defendant; and that as the declaration had been filed in the Clerk\u2019s office of the Superior Court, on the 2d day of October, 1846, if the said term of twelve months be not computed, the said action was commenced in time, and the said plaintiff was not barred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-11\">On the part of the defendant it was contended, that the operation of the Statute of limitations, was not suspended or arrested by the death of Cowart, or the grant of letters of administration on his estate to the defendant, the same having occurred after the note fell due, and after the Statute had commenced to run.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Whereupon, the Judge below charged and instructed the jury, that the plaintiff\u2019s right of action was barred by the Statute of limitations, and the plaintiff was not entitled, therefore, to recover in this action; that as the Statute had commenced to run against the plaintiff before the death of defendant\u2019s intestate, and the grant of letters of administration to her, its operation was not suspended or affected thereby, although the plaintiff was prohibited from sueing by statute within twelve months from the grant of letters of administration. The jury found for the defendant,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-5\">To which charge and instruction of the Court below, the plaintiff, by his counsel, excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-6\">Kelly &amp; Giles, Warren &amp; Franks, and E.

Brown, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-7\">Dudley and Crawford, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-8\">Brief of Kelly &amp; Giles, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-9\">The only question presented by the bill of exceptions in this case is, -whether, under the plea of the Statute of limitations, the administratrix should be allowed to compute the 12 months after the grant of administration, during which no suit could have been brought against her in her representative capacity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-10\">The Judge who presided upon the trial of this case in the Court below, held that the 12 months must be computed, and to that decision, the plaintiff has excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-11\">The first and principal Statute of limitations of force iu Georgia, was passed in 1767. <em>Prince\u2019s Dig. </em>573.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-12\">Twelve months were allowed to executors and administrators, first by the Act of 1792, <em>(Prince, </em>229,) and afterwards by the 12th section of the Act amending an Act to revive and amend the Judiciary system of this State. <em>Prince, </em>422.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-13\">The Act of limitations requires, that suits on promissory notes shall be brought within <em>six years after they fall due, and not after. </em>The Legislature evidently intended to allow the whole six years to the creditor, within which to sue. The direction to sue within six years and not after, evidently permits him to sue within six years. But the Judiciary Act allows 12 months to executors and administrators, within which no suit can be brought against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>them. Now, if the construction given to these Acts be correct, then the Legislature forfeits a right of action, because, it was not brought within six years, when for twelve months of the time, the party was prohibited from sueing by statute. The injustice and absurdity of such a construction is palpable. There is no Sort of propriety in punishing a party for not sueing for a length of time, when during a portion of the time he was prohibited by law from sueing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-4\">It is the duty of the Court, if possible, to give effect to both of these statutes. They are both of great utility. And the Court is called upon to reconcile these apparently conflicting provisions, and the only way this can be done, is, to hold that the 12 months shall no tbe computed, in pleading the Statute of limitations. The Legislature evidently intended that both should stand. They are both undoubtedly of force, having been subequently recognized by numerous Acts of the Legislature. The 12th section of the Act of 1799. is recognized by the Act of 1843. <em>Pam. p. </em>121. <em>Cobb, 225. By tJie Act of </em>1839, <em>Pam. p. </em>146, <em>and the Act of </em>1818, <em>Prince\u2019s Dig. </em>443. These Acts virtually engraft an exception upon the Statute of limitations. It is true that they do not say expressly that the Statute of limitations shall bo suspended during the twelve mouths, but they do this virtually.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-5\">The Act of limitations is undoubtly, of force. <em>See the Act of </em>1839, <em>Pam. p. </em>147, for an amendment of the Act of limitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-7\">The uniform practice has been to consider both these Acts of full force.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-8\">It is the duty of the Court to effectuate the intention of the Legislature, by giving their acts a reasonable and beneficial construction. See 3 <em>U. S.

It is true, that the Statute mentions infants, those <em>non compos mentis </em>and feme coverts \u2014 but does not in so many words embrace a case like this. But it should be remembered that those exceptions are generally-mentioned by way of giving instances, as the Legislature could not always see .every, possible contingency that might arise. The Courts have, however, usually decided that when the statute once commences to run, it seldom ever allows itself to be suspended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-16\">The question has arisen in several of the States, (for it never has arisen in England) when the plaintiffs have been restrained from sueing for a limited period, and it may he safely said that the decisions have been all in favor of suspending the statute, even after the same has commenced to run, <em>Angel on Lim. </em>61. <em>Colwell vs. Irvine, </em>4 <em>J.

There is no doubt as to the general rule, that when the Statute of limitations once attaches, and commences running, it will continue to run ; but here the same authority which declares the holder of the note <em>must </em>sue within six years, and not after, also declares, no suit or action <em>shall be brought </em>against an executor or administrator, until the expiration of twelve months after probate of the will, or grant of administration. It is our duty to give such a construction to these Statutes, as that both may stand, and take effect according to the intention of the Legislature. Did the Legislature intend, that the Statute o\u00ed limitations should continue to run, during the time the plaintiff is <em>expressly inhibited </em>from sueing, by their command <em>% </em>We think not, and the general rale must yield to this express enactment of the sovereign authority, and the time during which the plaintiff is inhibited from sueing, ought not to be computed against him. This same construction was given to these Statutes, by the Judges in convention, and has been, so far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>as we know, the uniform rule of decision in our Courts. <em>Jordan vs. the adm\u2019r of Jordan, Dudley\u2019s Rp. </em>182.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Let the judgment of the Court below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
