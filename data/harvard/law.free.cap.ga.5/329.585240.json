The suit was brought on the 25th day of March, 1846.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-6\">It was insisted by the counsel for the defendant, that a qualified executor being in life at the time of her said removal from testator\u2019s said residence, the right of action accrued to such executor, and consequently, the Statute of limitations commenced <em>to </em>run, and the plaintiff having no more rights than his predecessor, the executor, would have had if he had been living, was barred by the Statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-7\">The testimony having closed, and the cause submitted, the Court below charged the jury, that under the letters of administration, and on account of the form of the declaration in this case, the said plaintiff could not legally assert or exercise any more power over the property belonging to the estate of Andrew Mc-Neely, and which was undisposed of by said will, and unadministered, than could John Whigham, one of said executors of said will, and that as were the letters of administration and said declaration, the said plaintiff stood before this Court in the same situation as would the said John Whigham, the executor, if he were in life and had brought the action ; and that if they believed, that more than four years had ela.psed since the said John Whigham had qualified, or since the qualification of any one of the executors named in the will, and since said defendant had converted said negroes, that then the executor or executors could not recover Chloe and her said children, and that said plaintiff, standing in their place and stead, could not in the present action, hut was also barred of his remedy by the Statute of limitations; and that as was the action, the Statute of limitations commenced to run against said plaintiff, when it commenced to run against the executor or executors. To the -charge, thus given, the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-8\">The plaintiff then requested the Court to charge the jury, that said plaintiff had, by virtue of his letters, all the power and rights of a general administrator ; and that if Chloe and her children, at the commencement of this suit, belonged to the estate of Andrew McNeely, and was <em>not disposed of by the said will, </em>and had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>been administered, that then, said plaintiff was entitled to recover. The Court refused to give the said charge as requested, but charged the jury, that whatever might be the construction to be placed on said letters, that in the form of the present action, the plaintiff occupied the place and position before the Court, as would the said John Whigham, if he had sued for said negroes; and that the Statute of limitations began to run against the executor, qualified when Esther McNeely, the widow of the testator, removed from the premises mentioned in said will; and that if more than four years had elapsed since her removal, and since the defendant had them in his possession, claiming them as his own, that then said executor was barred of a recovery by the Statute, and the present plaintiff, occupying the place of the executor, in this action, was also barred of a recovery. To the refusal of the Court to charge as requested, and to the charge as given, the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-5\">The plaintiff further requested the Court to charge the jury, that if they believed from the evidence that said negro, Chloe, and the children were hers, and belonged to the estate of Andrew McNeely, <em>and, had not been administered, and were undisposed of by will as aforesaid, </em>that the Statute of limitations did not commence to run against plaintiff, until his said letters of administration were granted unto the plaintiff; which charge, as requested, the Court also refused to give, and the plaintiff thereupon excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b343-6\">Johnson &amp; Williams, for plaintiff in error, cited\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-7\">1 <em>Chitty Pl. </em>284. 1 <em>Saunders, </em>111. 4 <em>Reports, </em>28. 2 <em>East, Doe vs. Guy, Summers' Ed. </em>71. 2 <em>Williams\u2019 Exrs. </em>987, 1373. 1 <em>Washington R.

From- the facts, as they appear on the- fbce* of'this- record, the plaintiff was clearly not entitled to recover tlie negroes, in- the- character in which* lie- sued*.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqd\"><bracketnum>[\u2022!.]</bracketnum> The negro, Chl\u2019oe, was bequeathed to the wife of the testator, during her residence on a- particular plantation*, and- no other disposition* made- of her by th\u00a9 will1 whatever. It appears that some* of the* executors to- the will qualified, and distributed the negro*, Chloe, to the* legatee, Mrs-. McNeely; as Mrs. Turner, one of the witnesses, states, Mrs. McNeely had the property in- her possession, <em>wider the -wild </em>of Andrew McNeely, the grand-father of the witness. When Chloe- was distributed to Mrs-. Esther McNeely, the legatee under the- will, by tlie executors) the will- was executed-,, so- Jar as the disposition* of that part of the- testator\u2019s* property was-concerned; in other-words, that portion' of the testator\u2019s- estate* <em>wasfulily. administered, </em>according toi the directions of his* will. The* plaintiff? sues as the administrator <em>da bonis non, with the will annexed. </em>The office and duty of am administrator <em>d'e bonis non,, </em>with, the will annexed;. is&gt; Co administer suchi portion of the testator\u2019s- estate, as has not been administered under the directions of bis will, or as we said in <em>Thomas vs. Hardwick, </em>\u201c be is appointed to finish a business already begun, and in most* cases partially performed, \u201cSofar as-the negro Chloe is concerned, she has been <em>fully administered, </em>in accordance with the wil-l* of the testator; and: the plaintiff has no right to recover possession of her, for the-purpose of making any <em>further adminisiratiomundar the wilVofthe testator.. </em>What rights a <em>general </em>administrator on* tlie estate of Andrew McNeely <em>might </em>have in. regard1 to-the property; we express no-opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">This view of the\u2019case being fatal to-tlie plaintiff\u2019s-right to recover, in the character in which lie has brought bis suit, it is not necessary to consider the Statute of limitations. Let the judgment of the Court below stand affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
