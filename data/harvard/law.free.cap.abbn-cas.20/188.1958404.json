Dawson, individually and as surviving partner of the J. M. Dawson Packing Company, a nonresident partnership, an attachment was issued on the ground of the defendant\u2019s non-residence. By virtue of this attachment, the sheriff of the city and county of. Mew York levied upon certain claims of said firm, and, under an order of court, received from the debtors of the firm the sum of $2,316.48.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-8\">Judgment having been recovered by the plaintiffs in the action, execution was issued, and placed in the hands of the sheriff, who subsequently made a return of \u201c no real or personal property.\u201d Thereafter, the plaintiffs began an action on the judgment .in the State where the firm was located, and subsequently began supplementary proceedings in this State under the judgment, for the purpose of reaching defendant\u2019s property in satisfaction of the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-9\">The defendant Dawson now made this motion to vacate the sheriff\u2019s return, and to compel bim or his deputy to make a return in accordance with the facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-10\">It appeared that the sheriff had embezzled the moneys attached, and absconded, and that the liability of his bondsmen had been exhausted by other claimants; and the question involved was whether the plaintiffs or the defendant should bear the loss.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>Robert S.

If he Has paid the judgment he is entitled to a statement of the truth upon the returned execution. A plaintiff may, m certain cases, be required to bring an action for a false return, but even he could by motion compel a sheriff with the money actually m his hands lo make a truthful return (see Todd <em>v. </em>Botchford, 86 <em>N. Y. </em>517 <em>Smith on Sheriffs, </em>p. 408, and cases cited).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The purpose of the motion is to obtain a ruling as to whether the creditor or the debtor must lose moneys m the late sheriff\u2019s hands under an attachment, which moneys such late sheriff is said to have converted to his own ase. If these moneys had been realized upon an execution there would be no question, under the cases, that the loss would be the creditor\u2019s. \u201c The judgment is satisfied, \u2019 said Bronson, J., m People <em>v. </em>Hopson (1 <em>Den. </em>574), <em>\u201c </em>when the execution has been so used as to change the title or m. some other way deprive the debtor of his property. This includes the case of a levy and sale ; and also the case of a loss or destruction of the goods after they had been taken out of the debtor\u2019s possessionjby virtue of the process. When the property is lost to the debtor m consequence of the legal measure's which the creditor lias pursued, the debt is gone, although the creditor may not have been paid. He must take his remedy against the officer, if he has been in fault; and if there be no such remedy, the creditor must bear the loss.\u201d And m Peck <em>v. </em>Tiffany (2 <em>N. Y. </em>451, 456), it was said that where \u201ca sheriff levies upon sufficient property, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>through his negligence or misconduct it is lost, destroyed or otherwise disposed of, so that the defendant is deprived of the benefit of it, there is no doubt it should be regarded as a satisfaction of the execution, and the plaintiff must in such case seek his remedy against the sheriff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">These rules are equally applicable, so far as the question of remedy is concerned, to the case of moneys actually reduced to possession under an attachment, and in contemplation of law m the hands of the sheriff when the execution is issued. It is true that the debt is not satisfied by the reduction of such moneys to possession under the attachment. They are, in fact, neld as security for the subsequent judgment if obtained. But the rule does not depend exclusively upon the satisfaction of the debt. It is that the debtor\u2019s property has been actually lost to him in consequence of the legal measures which the creditor has pursued. In other words, his property (reduced to money) is actually taken possession of by the sheriff under the attachment, and is still m the hands of that sheriff unapplied as specially directed by the Code, and the process issued pursuant to the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">This is a very different case, therefore, from McBride <em>v. </em>Farmers\u2019 Branch Bank (7 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>347), where the sheriff never had the moneys in ins actual possession, but merely levied the attachment upon moneys in a trust company. The trust company having failed between the levy and the judgment, the court held that the debtor was the loser. There, the debtor\u2019s claim agamst the trust company was not lost to him by the attachment, but by the delay caused by his fruitless defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Several other cases are cited, but m none of them had ' the debtor\u2019s property in the form of money been actually taken into the custody of the sheriff under the attachment. Under the latter state of facts, the sheriff, having the moneys in his hands, as the law presumes, is required \u201cto pay them over to the plaintiff\u201d m the execution (Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 708, subd. 1). If he fails to do so, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>must exhaust the law against him and Ins bondsmen. If he still fails, the plaintiff loses his claim. The law has given him an execution to be satisfied \u201c out of the personal property attached.\u201d It has given mm no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The defendant is entitled to the application of the moneys taken from him by the law as invoked by plaintiff, and lie cannot be required to pay the debt twice over merely because the plaintiff cannot induce or compel the officer of the law who holds his moneys to pay them over as required by the Code and the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u2022 The motion should be granted, but without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">II. <em>January, </em>1888.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The order entered pursuant to the foregoing decision, provided for a stay of proceedings thereunder, upon the plaintiff\u2019s stipulating to suspend the proceedings supplementary to execution, and the action brought on the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The plaintiffs appealed from this order, and the General Term (Van Brunt,. P. J., Brady and Daniels, JJ.), affirmed the order, with $10 costs and disbursements, on the opinion of Barrett, J., below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
