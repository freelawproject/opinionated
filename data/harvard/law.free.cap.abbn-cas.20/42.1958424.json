This was objected to, by plaintiff\u2019s counsel on the ground that it did not appear that the execution was issued by any authority of the plaintiff; and that, without such express authority, her attorney had no power under his general retainer to release by an unlawful act her right of action against the sureties; and, nothing having been collected, there was no evidence of any ratification. Ho evidence was offered by defendant to meet this objection. It appeared that the attorney who issued the execution was dead.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-11\"><em>John Brooks Leavitt (Leavitt &amp; Keith, </em>attorneys), for plaintiff</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5\">Cited: Gearon <em>v. </em>Bank for Savings, 50 <em>Super.

He had been the attorney acting for the plaintiff in the action, but his authority, strictly speaking, terminated on the entry of the judgment (Ward <em>v. </em>Sands, 10 <em>Abb. N.

This act was the act of the attorney, for which he alone was responsible, and the plaintiff is not estopped or deprived of any right to bring this action.
