The language of the statute under which these proceedings were had (Z. 1882, c. 410, \u00a7 1456) did not, prior to the amendment of Code Grim. Pro. \u00a7 749 (Z. 1884, c. 372), preclude the supreme court from reviewing the decision of the court of special sessions, in such cases upon a common law certiorari (People <em>ex rel. </em>Smith <em>v. </em>Comm'rs Public Charity, 9 Hun, 212; People <em>v. </em>Sanders, 3 <em>Id. </em>16). Code Grim. Pro. \u00a7 515, abolishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>writs of certiorari in criminal actions, and leaving an appeal as the only mode of reviewing a judgment or order in a criminal action, was decided in People <em>v. </em>Walsh, 33 <em>Hun, </em>345, to refer only to criminal actions as defined in the Code, and not to a special proceeding of a criminal nature. This distinction, however, has been abolished (Z. 1884, c. ^ 372 ; amd\u2019g Code Crim. Pro. \u00a7 749). In the same case the court in holding that an appeal was not authorized by Code Crim. Pro. \u00a7 749, prior to its amendment, and then in force, based its decision upon the ground that the proceedings were not had in a court of special sessions, but' in a police court, and that an appeal was limited to a judgment had in the court of special sessions. The old common law certiorari having therefore been superseded, an appeal is the only remedy under - which to review these proceedings. The defendant having been convicted of being a disorderly-person, and the judgment of the court being that he should in the alternative give an undertaking to comply with the order of the court, or be committed to jail for six months, this constitutes a judgment upon conviction within Code Crim. Pro. \u00a7 749.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-5\">II. The courts below acquired no jurisdiction of the person or subject-matter of this proceeding, as the main inquiry there and upon which it relied in rendering its judgment was as to whether defendant was a resident of the city of New York; and the evidence being wholly insufficient to establish this, the onljr remedy against defendant is in the place of his domicil (Bayne <em>v. </em>People, 14 <em>Hun, </em>181). The fact of defendant having a room in the city of New York is not inconsistent with a residence in Greenpoint, and having made his home there that is his domicil (Bartlett <em>v. </em>Mayor, etc. of New York, 5 <em>Sandf. </em>44). Not having abandoned this residence, or manifested any intention to settle in another place permanently, his domicil is unchanged (De Meli <em>v. </em>DeMeli, 67 <em>How. Pr. </em>20).</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-6\">III. The separation having taken place in Philadelphia, and-the offense being complete at the time of the abandon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ment (Bayne <em>v. </em>People, 14 <em>Hun, </em>181), the fact that a subsequent demand for support was made in the city of New York does not constitute a new offense, or give the court jurisdiction. The words <em>\u201c </em>being disorderly \u201d in the statute under which these proceedings were had, refer only to the present time, and the defendant being at the time of the issuing of the warrant a resident at Greenpoiut, ic was there that the offense, if any, was committed, and there only can he be punished (Bayne <em>v. </em>People, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-5\">IV. The relator having left the defendant without his consent, he is not to be charged with necessaries supplied to her unless he has committed acts justifying a suit against him for divorce (People <em>v. </em>Pettit, 74 <em>N. Y. </em>320), and the evidence does not show the commission of any such acts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-6\"><em>William A. Boyd, </em>corporation attorney, for the commissioners.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASf\">N. Y. Code Crim. Pro. \u00a7 749, under which defendant claims that an appeal lies to the court of general sessions from an order of the court of special sessions, does not apply to this proceeding, as it is not a judgment upon a conviction rendered by a court of special sessions, but an order of that court affirming an order made by a police magistrate upon an appeal under the provisions of L. 1882, c. 410, \u00a7 1456. Moreover, this section and section 899 do not apply to the case under consideration for the reason that in the division of the Code of Criminal Procedure, these proceedings come under Part VI., Title VIL, and section 1454 of \u2022 the Consolidation Act. By.Code Crim. Pro. \u00a7 963, and L. 1882, c. 410, \u00a7 2143, all provisions of the Consolidation Act in reference to disorderly persons have been in effect since January 1, 1882. There is no provision for an appeal to the court of special sessions in the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is the Consolidation Act, \u00a7 1456, which provides for that and governs this case; and if it had been the intention of the Legislature to grant an appeal to the court of general sessions, this section would have been amended to that effect. Section 1455 of the same act declares that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>every person abandoning his family in the city of Hew York is a disorderly person, and section 1456 declares that any appeal is exclusively for court of special sessions. The Code of Criminal Procedure gives no appeal exclusively to courts of special sessions, because its provisions relating to abandonment apply to the State of Hew York exclusive of _ the city of Hew York, and the provision? of the Consolidation Act apply exclusively to the city of Hew York, and therefore govern this case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b354-5\">Hon. R. Frederick Smyth, Recorder.</author>\n<p id=\"AaM\">[After stating the above facts.] The first question presented for the determination of this court, is as to whether an appeal lies to it from the court of special sessions, the respondent\u2019s counsel insisting that the court of special sessions alone has exclusive jurisdiction of.such appeals, under the provisions contained in section 1456 of chapter 410 of the Laws of 1882 (Hew York City Consolidation Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">So much of that section as refers to the question presented by the respondent\u2019s counsel, is as follows: \u201c And that any appeal from, or amendment to, said order (of conviction of the person as a disorderly person) shall be exclusively for the action of the court of special sessions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">' On the part of the defendant it is insisted that the language of that section of the statute did not, prior to the amendment of section 749 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, by chapter 372 of the Laws of 1884, preclude the supreme court from reviewing the decision of the court of special sessions on a common law certiorari, and he refers to the cases of People <em>ex rel. </em>Smith <em>v. </em>Commissioners of Public Charities (9 Hun, 212); People <em>v. </em>Sanders (3 <em>Id. </em>16), which sustain the position taken by him, as do also the later cases of People <em>v. </em>Walsh (33 <em>Id. </em>345); People <em>v. </em>Fuller (29 <em>Id. </em>47).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Prior to the amendment of section 749 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by chapter 372 of the Laws of 1884, the Code contained no provision for an appeal in proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>ings of this character ; and prior to the passage of the Consolidation Act, there was no method by which these proceedings could be reviewed except by certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">By section 515 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before its amendment, writs of errors and certiorari in criminal actions were abolished and appeal substituted for such writs. By chapter 372 of the Laws of 1884 this section of the Code was amended, so as to abolish writs of error and certiorari not only in criminal actions, but also in proceedings and special proceedings of a criminal nature ; and declaring that hereafter the only mode of reviewing a judgment or order in a criminal action or special proceeding of a criminal nature is by appeal, and it has been held, since the amendment of that section of the Code, that an appeal is now the proper and only method by which special proceedings of a criminal nature can be reviewed (People <em>v. </em>Ontario Co. Sessions, 45 <em>Hun, </em>54).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Prior to the passage of the Consolidation Art, it seems, that the method of reviewing the conviction of a person as a \u201c disorderly \u201d person in the city and county of New York, was by certiorari, and since the passage of that act the right to review the justice\u2019s judgment in such cases was by appeal to the special sessions of the county of New York, and the right of the supreme court by certiorari to review the proceedings of the court of special sessions. It is claimed by the counsel of the appellant, that by the amendment of section 749<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> of the Code of Grim. Procedure, the right of review, which the supreme court undoubtedly possessed, is conferred upon this court. Section 749 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>originally adopted, applied only to an appeal from a judgment of conviction in a criminal action rendered by a court of special sessions, but since the amendment of said section, by chapter 372 of the Laws of 1881, it'authorizes an appeal not only from a judgment of conviction in a criminal action rendered by a court of special sessions, but also from a-judgment of conviction by a police court., police magistrate,' or justice of the pence, in proceedings, or special proceedings of a criminal nature, and as the case under consideration is a special proceeding of a criminal nature, I am of the opinion, that, the right of appeal from the judgment of the court of special sessions, rendered therein, to this court is given, and that this court has the right to review the judgment of the special sessions in this proceeding. More especially does this appear to be so, as the right which a defendant has to review of the proceedings of the specials sessions by the supremo court has been taken away by the abolition of the writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Having arrived at the conclusion that this court has the right to entertain the appeal, and review the proceedings of the special sessions, an examination of the evidence becomes necessary for the pm pos\u00e9 of determining whether the charge of abandonment has been sustained; and, if so, whether it took place in the city and county of Hew York.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The parties, prior to their marriage, were residents of the city of Philadelphia, in which city they were married on September 20, 1878, and they continued to reside there for about live months after their marriage. The wife left her husband in that city, having, as she testified, \u201c decided that she would live separated from the defendant for awhile,\u201d and came to the city of Hew York to reside with her relatives; she resided hero for a short time, and returned to Philadelphia, where she resided for a short time, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>again returned to this city in 1881, and has since resided here.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Since the separation of the parties in Philadelphia they have never lived together, nor has the defendant contributed anything towards the support of his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The cause of the separation, according to the wife\u2019s testimony, wras acts of cruelty perpetrated by her husband, his, inability to support her, and her inability, by reason of sickness, to prosecute her business as a dressmaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The alleged acts of cruelty are positively denied by the husband ; and if they were perpetrated they appear to have been condoned by the wife. The defendant remained in. the city of Philadelphia for a short time after the separation, and then resided in Green point from the end of 1879-to 1881; from there he went to Europe, on business, and on his return to this country resided, from March to July, 1882,. in the city of New York, and from 1882 to the present time-he has resided in Williamsburgh, Kings County, where he has ever since been employed in a factory at that place.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">In 1884 the defendant took his meals at a house in this-city, but did not reside here. In that year he called upon his wife, at her place of residence, in response to a letter from her inviting him to do so. A conversation occurred between them in which the wife testifies: \u201c I then asked him, told him that we were both young, and there might be-hope of ns living happy together yet, and I asked him for-support. I was very sick at the time. lie said he would noverlive with me again, and I offered to go and live with him.\u201d The husband denies that any such conversation took place. No other demand was made for support, or offer on the part of the wife to return to. and live with her husband. The-evidence clearly shows, that at this time, and down to the-time the wife commenced these proceedings in December,. 1887, she had knowledge of the fact that her husband was. a resident of Kings County, and that he was employed, there.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Upon this evidence it is very clear, that, if there was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>.abandonment, it took place in the city of Philadelphia. The \u25a0evidence does not establish abandonment of the wife in this \u25a0city. At the time of the alleged offer by the wife to return \u00a1to her husband, and the demand for support and refusal on 'his part to live with or support her, they were living separate and apart, and had been for years doing so. Indeed, \u00a1the evidence establishes the fact, that, the wife, without \u00a1legal cause, left her husband in the city of Philadelphia \u25a0with the determination to live separate from him, and, that, .although she knew him to be a resident of another county, .she made no offer to return to and live with him at his place \u25a0O'f residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">It was her duty, under the circumstances of this case, if .she desired to compel her husband to support her, to go to 'his place of residence, and offer at least to resume the duties .and responsibilities of a wife ; and if he then refused to live \u00a1with or support her, she had a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The defendant committed no offense within this county. He .did not abandon his wife here ; on the contrary, the wife \u25a0voluntarily selected this city as her place of residence. Nor iis this comity bound to support her here. The right of the \u00a1husband to select his own and his wife\u2019s residence is un\u25a0donhted (People <em>v. </em>Pettit, 74 <em>N. Y. </em>320).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The -magistrate who issued the warrant for the arrest of \u00a1the defendant, did not acquire jurisdiction of cither the person of the defendant, or of the subject-matter of this pro\u25a0eceding.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">. The fact that the svife lived in this city on and prior to the time of the issuing of the warrant against the defendant, .and his refusal to support her upon a demand made here, did not con fer jurisdiction upon the magistrate. If it were otherwise, a wife, who had at some time been abandoned by her husband in another county or State, might, by taking up her residence in this county, confer jurisdiction upon a justice here to punish hirn for that offense. No authority sustaining such a proposition can be found (Bayne <em>v. </em>People, 14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number><em>Hun, </em>181). See, also, sections 1453, 1454 and 1455 of the N. Y. Consolidation Act <em>(L. </em>1882, c. 410).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">A careful examination of the evidence leads me to the conclusion that the offense of abandonment was not committed in this city and county, and an examination of the statutes and authorities regulating and bearing upon proceedings of the character of the one in question, convinces me that the magistrate, before whom the proceeding was instituted, acquired no jurisdiction of either the person of the defendant, or of the subject-matter of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The judgment of the special sessions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">As to the duty of the husband, under present statutes, see Lutes v.
