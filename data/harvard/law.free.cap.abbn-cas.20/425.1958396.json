The object of the publication is by a substituted service to bring the defendant into court, and the language of the case (\u00a7 638) that \u201c if publication has been or is thereafter commenced, the service must be made complete by the continuance thereof,\u201d means simply that when the service relied upon as the ground of jurisdiction is publication, that must be not partial and merely commenced, but continued and entirely complete. In our judgment the provision does not forbid or prevent the equivalent personal service permitted by section 424. Substantially this was decided in Coffin <em>v. </em>Rich (91 <em>N. Y. </em>608), and we are unwilling to hold that the fact of defendant\u2019s appearance after the thirty days, while publication was running, commenced before the thirty days, should compel a different decision. While the strict letter of the section might admit of such construction, we do not think that is its true meaning or intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The order should\" be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">All the judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">Order affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
