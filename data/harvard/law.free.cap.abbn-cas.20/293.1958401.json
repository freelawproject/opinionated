Mack, as assignee for the benefit of .creditors, sued Win. F. Kitsell for the price of goods sold and delivered by the assignors. The part of the answer setting up a separate and affirmative defense was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-5\">First.\u2014The defendant on information and belief avers that the plaintiff\u2019s assignors are entirely insolvent; that their schedule of liabilities and assets, filed in pursuance of law in the office of the clerk of the court of common pleas in and for the city and county of Hew York subsequent to the making of the assignment set forth in paragraph II of the complaint, shows $153,307.70 of liabilities and $23,843.22 of assets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-6\">Second.\u2014That heretofore and before said assignment was made, and on or about January 17, 1887, the plaintiff\u2019s assignors represented to the defendant that they were solvent and that their assets were greatly in excess of their liabilities, and then and there urged the defendant to make his certain promissory note for their accommodation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-7\">Third.\u2014That the defendant thus urged and relying upon said representations and upon their express promise to meet said note and to indemnify and save harmless the defendant from all costs and damage in consequence of his becoming such accommodation maker, then and there made certain notes payable to said assignors and delivered the notes to them without any consideration ; that the notes were of the' following denomination and five in number, viz.: $423.80 ; $423.80 ; '$423.80; $491.40 ; $521.60, making a total of $2,284.40, which notes the plaintiff\u2019s assignors had discounted for their own' sole and exclusive benefit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-8\">Fourth.\u2014The defendant was not aware of the plaintiff\u2019s assignors\u2019 true financial condition at the time of the delivery of the notes on or about January 17, 1887, or that they were about to fail and make an assignment within ten days after-wards, and the defendant believed their statement that they were solvent and that the defendant would not have made the notes but for such statement; on information and belief the defendant avers that the plaintiff\u2019s assignors were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>then hopelessly insolvent, and they well knew it at the time and that they made the false assertion of their solvency to deceive and defraud the defendant and entrap him into making said accommodation paper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-5\">Fifth.\u2014That said notes which the defendant made for the accommodation of plaintiff\u2019s said assignors have matured and the plaintiff and his assignors have failed, neglected and refused to pay said notes or either of them as the plaintiff\u2019s assignors had agreed to do, and the defendant has been sued by the Horth River Bank upon one of the notes which it had discounted for the plaintiff\u2019s assignors amounting to the sum of $491.40, and judgment went against the defendant on May 4, 1887, for $511.80, and there is now outstanding an execution against the defendant\u2019s property issued upon said judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-6\">Sixth.\u2014The defendant has suffered damages by the failure of the plaintiff and his assignors to meet said obligation as the plaintiff\u2019s assignors had agreed to do, and by their failure to indemnify and save harmless the defendant from all costs and damage in consequence of making said notes for their accommodation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-7\">Seventh.\u2014That the remainder of said notes will soon mature, greatly to the defendant\u2019s detriment; that by reason of said judgment and execution, and the defendant\u2019s liability under the other notes, the defendant has suffered and will suffer damages in a stun greater than any sum which the defendant may owe for goods sold to him by the plaintiff\u2019s assignors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-8\">' Wherefore the defendant pays for a judgment:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-9\">First.\u2014That the plaintiff\u2019s complaint be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-10\">Second.\u2014That the damages suffered by the defendant may be set off against any alleged claim for goods sold to the defendant.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-11\">Third.\u2014That as a condition precedent to the recovery by the plaintiff in this action that he carry out his assignors\u2019 agreement to save the de'fendent harmless against said judgment, execution and notes by discharging thorn all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Fourth.\u2014That the defendant have his costs and disbursements of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-5\">To this answer the plaintiff demurred for insufficiency.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-6\"><em>Fernando Solinger, </em>for defendant, in opposition to the demurrer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGq\">I. This [N. Y. City] court has jurisdiction of the defendant\u2019s defense if it sets forth facts constituting an equitable set-off to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, even though it is a court of limited jurisdiction, and that this action is an action at law <em>{Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 507, 3339, 3347).</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-7\">II. The defendant\u2019s answer shows a perfect defense, as the plaintiff\u2019s assignors are liable to the defendant for their breach of contract in a sum greater than that claimed in this action, and, on account of their insolvency, the plaintiff stands in the shoes of his assignors, and whatever would be a defense if his assignors were plaintiffs is a defense in this action (Warner <em>v. </em>Beardsley, 8 <em>Wend. </em>194; Gibbs <em>v. </em>Mennard, 6 <em>Paige, </em>258; Hannay <em>v. </em>Pell, 3 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>432; Loosemore <em>v. </em>Radford, 93 <em>M. &amp; W. </em>657; Decker v. Matthews, 12 <em>N. Y. </em>313; Maas <em>v. </em>Goodman, 2 <em>Hilt. </em>275;, Rothschild <em>v. </em>Mack, 3 <em>N. Y. State Pep. </em>471; Smith <em>v. </em>Felton, 43 <em>N. </em>Y. 419). A loan by the plaintiff of his own check which the borrower uses as money is like the loan of money, and it is not necessary that the check should be paid by him, before commencing a suit to recover the amount of it from the borrower (Hilliard <em>v. </em>Bothel, 4 <em>New Eng. R. </em>162; <em>Daniel on Inst. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 183, 1204). On demurrer, all reasonable intendments will be indulged in, in support of the pleading demurred to. The' remedy for indefiniteness and uncertainty in a pleading is by motion, not by demurrer (Lorillard <em>v. </em>Clyde, 86 <em>N. Y. </em>384).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-8\"><em>B. </em>Lewinson, for the plaintiff, opposed.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b348-9\">McAdam, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWp\">This case may be viewed in two as.pccts\u2014one legal, the other equitable. At law, if A makes promissory notes for the accommodation of B, the payee, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>they arc subsequently negotiated and dishonored, A has no cause of action against B until lie first pays the notes, and then his action is tor money paid to B\u2019s use <em>{Cow. Tr. </em>\u00a7 317, and cases cited). Tested by these common law rules, the outstanding liability pleaded by the defendant constitutes no defense to the demand in suit. But, A (the defendant) pleads, as lie lawfully may, to a common law action, an equitable defense <em>{Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 507), to wit: (1) the insolvency of B. (2) That as the notes given to B were for B\u2019s accommodation, B in point of fact is principal, and A merely surety thereon, and that B agreed to indemnify and save A harmless therefrom. It is true A has no claim till he has paid something on the liability, but in \u2022 equity he may, as surety, apply to the court for such relief as will compel B to discharge the liability (8 <em>Wend. </em>194; 6 <em>Paige, </em>258; 3 <em>Swanst. </em>368).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">A would be entitled to this relief if he had commenced* a suit in equity for that purpose; and the Code of Civil Procedure (\u00a7 507), in effect provides that he may obtain such relief by means of an equitable defense. The judgment for the plaintiff may provide that the defendant be allowed to pay the amount of any recovery in discharge of his liability (Hannay <em>v. </em>Pell, 3 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>432). The present action resembles very much the case last cited, and the relief claimed may' be granted (B being insolvent), though the liability of A has not as yet matured (Lindsay <em>v. </em>Jackson, 2 <em>Paige, </em>581). In the present instance part of the liability has matured and is in judgment, as in Hannay <em>v. </em>Pell <em>(supra). </em>The plaintiff is an assignee of B for the benefit of creditors, and this equitable defense is equally available against him (Smith <em>v. </em>Felton, 45 <em>N. Y. </em>419; Rothschild <em>v. </em>Mack, 3 <em>N. Y. State Pep. </em>471).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The Code provision in regard to equitable defenses applies to the city court as fully as to the supreme court of the State <em>{Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 3347, snbd. 4). It follows that the defendant has pleaded a good equitable defense, and that the demurrer thereto must be overruled, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
