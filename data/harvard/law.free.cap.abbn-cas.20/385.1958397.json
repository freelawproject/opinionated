Hubbell as treasurer, to compel the company to remove a metal awning or shed, about eighty-five feet in length and extending from the hnilding to the curb line of one of the company\u2019s offices, which, as alleged, hid from the view of pedestrians the signs on plaintiff\u2019s building.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-7\"><em>Ira </em>W. <em>Warren, </em>for the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_m\">The defendant has no right to maintain such an obstruction as against the adjoining owner (Trenor <em>v. </em>Jackson, 15 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>115; McCaffrey <em>v. </em>Smith, 11 <em>Hun, </em>117). While the legislature \u00a1has a right to devote a public street to a further or additional public use, neither the legislature nor the board of \u25a0aldermen have any authority to devote a part of a public street to the use of a private person to the injury of an adjoining owner (Hallock <em>v. </em>Scheyer, 33 <em>Hun, </em>111). Occupants of any part of public streets can acquire no vested rights therein either above or below the surface (Astor <em>v. </em>Arcade Railway, <em>N. Y. Daily Reg., </em>February 8th, 1887; Story <em>v. </em>N. Y. Elevated R. R. Co., 90 <em>N. Y. </em>124; Glover <em>v. </em>Manhattan Ry. Co., 51 <em>Super. Ct.
