I do not understand that it was part of his bargain that he should do so. What he undertook to do was to get the bill favored as a department measure. 1 do not see any objection to this. The law as it stood had been under discussion before the courts, and had been claimed to be an unjust and inequitable law. It was a general law, and the proposal to have it altered was submitted to the law officer and the financial officer of the State, and the arguments on the subject were had with them.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6O\">The plaintiffs in this action were attorneys and counselors of this court, and this action was brought to recover compensation for services rendered to the defendants in advising and consulting with the defendants concerning certain proposed tax legislation of the Legislature of the State of Hew York, and in advising and consulting with the attorney-general and comptroller of the State in behalf of the defendant respecting such legislation and. making arguments before said attorney-general and comptroller resulting in the adoption of said proposed legislation as a department measure by the comptroller\u2019s office, and for services in negotiating and accomplishing the settlement of certain tax litigations pending against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The answer of the defendant denies the contract as alleged, and further answering admits that certain services were rendered by one of the plaintiffs, Cary, but alleges that they were not of the value of over $500, and denies that the services so rendered by Cary were rendered upon a formal retainer or an actual contract, or that payment should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>be made therefor. By consent the case was referred, and the referee reported in favor of the plaintiff, finding the value of the services to have been $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">It is claimed upon the part of the defendants that the services for which compensation is sought were based upon an illegal contract, and that therefore no recovery could be had therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The learned referee in his opinion in dealing with this objection states that no such defense is set up in the answer and that the testimony which led to the point being raised carne up incidentally. The fact that no such defense is set up in the answer formed no objection to its consideration.. Under the general denial contained in the answer the defendants had a right .to establish, such facts as would show that no valid contract had ever been entered into between these parties. This subject seems to have been considered in the case of Oscanyan <em>v. </em>Arms Co. (103 <em>U. S. </em>261, 264), in which the court say: \u201c The position of the plaintiff that the-illegality of the contract in suit cannot be introduced because not formally pleaded, does not strike us as having-much weight. We should hardly have deemed it worthy off serious consideration had it not been earnestly pressed upon, our consideration by learned counsel. The theory upon, which tlie action proceeds is that the plaintiff has a contract, valid in law for certain services. Whatever shows the invalidity of the contract, shows that in fact no such contract, as alleged ever existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">A consideration, of the effect of a general denial in- ai case which presents precisely the same principle may serve-to illustrate the question under review. The complaint\" , alleges a contract. The answer denies it. The plaintiff.' proves an oral contract which, by the statute of frauds, is. required to be in writing or proves a contract in writing not subscribed as required by that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The defense under a general denial that there was no-valid contract would clearly be available, and that is all that is sought to be established in the case at bar. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>.alleges a contract, and in his proof of the contract introduces evidence which shows its invalidity. Under a general denial the defendant may avail himself of this evidence, and (insist that his denial has been established in that no legal or \u25a0\u00a1valid contract has been proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">This brings us to the consideration of the question 'whether the plaintiffs established any valid contract authorizing them to recover for the services which they rendered \u2022to the defendant. It appears from the evidence that the (State bad recovered a jndgmentfor taxes under the laws of 1880 against the defendant for a very large amount of money, and the defendants were anxious in regard to the \u25a0result of a decision in the court of appeals, to which court :the case was upon its way.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The president then requested the plaintiff'Cary to go to .Albany and see if some relief could be obtained from -the State officers in view of the claimed injustice of the 'judgment. The plaintiff went to Albany, saw the comptroller and attorney-general, who informed him they could .do nothing in the premises. He then associated himself with'his-.co-plaintiff, Mr. Wells, and they took-up the interest-of-certain mining companies who were affected in the ;same way with the telegraph companies under the tax law (referred to. The plaintiff and Mr. Wells went, to Albany \u00a1and made arguments there before the attorney-general on behalf of the mining companies with a view to the passage -of an act which they proposed to introduce which would \u2022relieve the mining companies from the tax. Upon discussion with 'the officers of the defendant they were requested to include the defendant, if possible, in the bill which they, bad then already prepared on behalf of the mining com'-panies. To this they consented, and the plaintiff Cary wont to Albany and had interviews with the comptroller and attorney-general. At these interviews he sought to get the State \u2022officers to adopt this bill as a department measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">This they agreed\" finally to do, upon the defendant settling up the original judgment. Thereafter Mr. Cary went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>two or three times to Albany, and on one or more occasions after the bills had been proposed, saw prominent members of both branches of the Legislature, explaining the bill to them, and urging them to take an interest in its passage, or to facilitate its passage as best they could. For these services a charge of $5,000 was made which was found by the referee to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">From this testimony it appears that compensation for these services was allowed by the referee, consisting of personal solicitation of the heads of departments and members of the Legislature. No other construction can be placed upon the testimony offered on the part of the plaintiff, and services of this kind have been repeatedly held in the United States courts, and in the courts of this State to entitle the party to no compensation, because contracts for such services are against public policy, and not enforceable in courts .of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In the case of Mills <em>v. </em>Mills (40 N. <em>Y. </em>543) it was held that such a contract was void as against public policy, in that it furnishes a temptation to the plaintiff to resort to corrupt means or improper devices to influence legislative action. In the case of Sedgwick <em>v. </em>Stanton (14 N. <em>Y. </em>289, 294) the grounds upon which the invalidity of such a contract rest are set forth with great distinctness and precision. The court say : \u201c Persons may no doubt be employed to conduct an application to the Legislature, as well as to conduct a suit at law ; and may contract for and receive pay for .their services in preparing documents, collecting evidence, making statements of facts, or preparing and making oral or written arguments, provided all these are used, or designed to be used, before the Legislature itself or some committee thereof as a body ; but they cannot with propriety be employed to exert their personal influence with individual members, or to labor in any form, privately, with such members out of the legislative halls. Whatever is laid before the Legislature in writing, or spoken openly or publicly in its presence or that of a committee, if false in fact may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>disproved, of if wrong in argument may be refuted, but that which is whispered in the private ear of the individual members is frequently beyond the reach of correction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The particular services for which compensation is sought in this action was for whispering into the ears of individual members of the Legislature \u201c urging that they take an interest in the passage of the bill and facilitate its passage as best they could.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In the case of Lyon v. Mitchell (36 <em>N. Y. </em>235) the right to employ counsel to appear before a legislative committee or before the Legislature itself to advocate the passage of a measure in which the individual has an interest is recognized. But it is held that personal solicitation of the President, the Governor, or the heads of the departments for favors or for clemency are not the lawful subjects of contracts. The apprehension that considerations. other than those of a high sense of duty and of the public interest may thus be brought to influence their determination forbids \"this employment. And this court, in the case &gt;of Harris <em>v. </em>Simonson (28 <em>Hun, </em>318), lays down the rule which must govern in the construction of contracts of the description under consideration with great clearness and force. The verdict was recovered for what -was claimed to have been the value of personal services rendered by the plaintiff under the employment of Samuel Wood, the testator, in and about procuring the passage of an act of the Legislature for the incorporation of musical colleges, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The court said, \u201c Claims for services of the nature of those alleged to have been performed require to be carefully, cautiously and minutely examined, in order to avoid the judicial sanction of demands arising out of the exercise of improper and vicious influences over members of the Legislature. Some portion of the services relied upon in support of the claim made consisted in direct appeals made to individual members of the Legislature. They were not of the character which has been \u2022 sanctioned, permitting recoveries in cases of this nature, for they were not clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>made to appear to consist of mere information or arguments tending to expedite the proper passage of the act. Such information and arguments are more appropriately directed publicly to the committee,.as such, having the bill in charge, or to the body considering the propriety of its enactments. The prevailing principles of law have been very cautiously adopted upon this subject, for the purpose of avoiding the effect of sanctioning direct or indirect influences brought to bear upon members of a legislative body, to secure the passage of an act required to be officially considered by them; \u2018 and for that reason it has been held that legislators should act with a single eye to the true interest of the whole people, and courts of justice 6an give no countenance to the use of means which may subject them to he misled by pertinacious importunity and indirect influences of interested and unscrupulous agents or solicitors ; and public policy and sound morality did therefore imperatively require that courts should put the stamp of tlicir disapprobation on every act, and pronounce void every act, the ultimate or probable tendency of which would be to sully the purity or mislead the judgments of those to whom the high trust of legislation is confided.\u2019 To warrant a recovery in such a case as this the evidence should be required to estab*! lisli the fact, with reasonable clearness, that the services' alleged to have been performed were such as the law will sanction in aiding and promoting legislative action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Under the principles thus enunciated it is clear that no\" recovery can bo had for services consisting of personal application to legislators or other officers of the Government. v</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">But it may be said that a recovery may be had for the services rendered in arguments before the attorney-general and comptroller. It is sufficient to say, as far as this appeal is concerned, that the judgment was recovered upon the services rendered, which included the personal solicitations of the members of the Legislature by one of the plaintiffs. But even if that fact did not exist it would appear from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>whole' nature of the transaction that the services such as were expected to be rendered were of a character which come within the definitions already referred to of illegal contracts, being against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The personal solicitations of the attorney-general and comptroller were evidently contemplated, and the application to members of the Legislature, in furtherance of the proposed legislation, was clearly within the scope of the employment,.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">This being the nature of the services rendered, there can be no question but that no recovery can be had therefor, without running counter to every principle which has heretofore been enunciated by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Daniels and Beady, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Note on What May be Proved Under a General Denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">\n<em>The General Rule.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">The general rule is that the defendants must under a general denial be permitted to controvert by evidence everything which the plaintiff is bound in the first instance to prove to make out his cause of action. [Citing Robinson v. Frost, 14 <em>Barb. </em>536; McKyring v. Bull 16 <em>N. Y. </em>297; Wheeler v. Billings, 38 <em>N. Y. </em>263; Weaver v. Barden, 49 <em>N. Y. </em>286.] <em>Ct. of App. </em>1886, Griffin v. Long Island R. R. Co., 101 <em>N. Y. </em>348.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">According to Benton v. Hatch, 43 <em>Hun, </em>142, he may also show that the plaintiff never had a cause of action against him. [Citing, Creque v. Sears, 17 <em>Hun, </em>123, 125; Schwarz v. Oppold, 74 <em>N. Y. </em>307.] Here, in an action to recover land claimed under a sheriff's deed, it was held that the court erred in excluding evidence tending to show that the judgment under which the execution had been issued was satisfied. Such evidence was admissible under the pleading. Judgment therefore reversed. But see <em>Add. Tr. Brief Jury Cas. </em>77, and Boozer v. Feagus <em>(So. Car. </em>1887), 3 <em>Southeastern Rep. </em>551.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">1. Roe <em>v. </em>Angevine, 7 Hun, 679.

Y. </em>52, aff'g 44 <em>Super. Ct. (J. &amp; S.) </em>391. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Whatever plaintiff is required to prove to establish his cause of actioit defendant may disprove under a general denial, but no more. Hence, under such a denial the defendant cannot show, in an action brought by the plaintiff to recover for personal injuries arising from the wrongful act of the defendant, facts merely tending to mitigate or justify such act. Thus, in an action brought to recover for injuries sustained by falling into a coal-hole in front of the defendant\u2019s premises, the defendant cannot prove permission or license given by the municipal authorities to make the coal-hole. In order to be available, such fact should have been pleaded by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Such an action is not based on negligence, but on a wrongful act.

A defense, that the contract in suit, apparently binding, was illegal and11 void by reason of some violation of the law, is new matter, and must be set up in the answer in order to be provable, 'therefore, in an action against a drawer of a check, evidence that the check was given for wines sold in violation of statute is inadmissible under an answer merely setting up a general denial and a failure of consideration; and even though the evidence may have shown that the sale of the wine was in violation of statute, there being no such defense pleaded, the plaintiff was entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">80.

The court, itself, is bound to raise the question in the interest of the due administration of justice, and it cannot be waived by a system of pleading or even express stipulation of the parties. Upon the question whether such fact should be specially pleaded, Field, J., says: \u201c Whatever shows the invalidity of the contract, shows that in fact no such contract as alleged ever existed. The general denial under the N. Y.

Therefore, in an action for goods sold and delivered, recovery cannot be defeated, because the plaintiff used the designation .\u201c &amp; Co.\u201d when he had no actual partner in violation of statute, where the defendant fails to set up such a defense in his answer. Nor is the defense rendered available, although the illegality appears by the proof given upon the trial.

The answer denied these allegations, and averred that the bonds were delivered to the defendant with authority to sell, <em>etc.,\u2014Held, </em>the pleadings admitted that the bonds were received by the defendant from the plaintiff, and the only dispute was the terms on which they were delivered; and that in absence of any averment of title in a third person, with which the defendant connected himself, or of a plea that the plaintiff was not the real party in interest, the evidence of such fact was clearly inadmissible.

The answer denied that the plaintiff was the owner and entitled to immediate <em>possession,\u2014Held, </em>under such a denial it was competent for the defendant to disprove the allegations of the complaint, by showing that the ownership and right of possession was in a third person.

The present defendants, indemnitors of the sheriff, the original defendant, put in a general denial, and also alleged title in Klinger Brothers. Upon the trial the plaintiff gave evidence, that she had bought the goods at sheriff\u2019s sale under an execution upon a judgment in her favor against Klinger Brothers. The defendant offered evidence to show that the judgment, under which the plaintiff bought, was fraudulent and <em>void,\u2014Held, </em>the allegation in the answer of title in a stranger was no defense, without an allegation connecting the defendant with such title. The plaintiff was only required to show possession, and possession cannot bo disproved by proving title out of the plaintiff. The defendants could not take the property from the plaintiff\u2019s possession, even if she had no title to it, without showing title in themselves, or title in another, with a right of possession, and connecting themselves in some way with such title or right.

Where the plaintiff alleged that the defendant so negligently-constructed a fence that the water of a stream was obstructed, whereby the plaintiff\u2019s bridge was <em>destroyed,\u2014Held, </em>a general denial having been interposed, that it was error not to permitth e defendant to show that his fence was built in the best manner to avoid injury to the bridge; but evidence that he offered to repair and reconstruct the bridge was not admissible. The defendant has a right under a general denial to show that there was no negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">105. Kendig v. Overhulser, 58 <em>Iowa, </em>195. (1882.) Under a general denial, the defendant may prove that he was not negligent, and one mode of doing this is to show affirmatively what acts of prudence and caution be employed. Such act need not be specially pleaded. Admission of such proof no error. Judgment reversed on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">106. Andrews v. Miles, 15 <em>Weekly Dig. </em>290. In an action for damages to crops by cattle, evidence is admissible, under a general denial, to show that one of the two defendants did not occupy the farm from which the cattle escaped through a defective fence, but worked for the other defendant as hired man, and that he did not own the cattle and had no interest in them, since, to recover, plaintiff must establish such occupation or ownership. [7 <em>Cow. </em>35.] Judgmentreversed as to such defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">107. Schular v. Hudson River R. R. Co., 38 <em>Barb. </em>653. In an action for injury to property, alleged in the complaint to have been caused by negligence of defendant\u2019s agents, an answer denying every allegation in the complaint, puts in issue defendant\u2019s liability ; and it is not necessary to aver that the injury was-\u2018done by others, and not by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">108. Schaus v. Manhattan Gas Light Co., 36 <em>Super. Ct. (J. </em>7 <em>S.) </em>262; s. c., 14 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>371. Under a general denial, a defendant may prove anything tending to show any material allegation of the complaint to be untrue. Thus, in an action to recover damages by reason of the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence in letting water into the plaintiff\u2019s cellar, while laying a gas pipe, under a general denial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>defendant may show that the injury did not arise from the ditch, but from a defective system of sewerage in the vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">109. Guiterman v. Liverpool, N. Y., etc., S. S. Co., 9 <em>Daly, </em>119.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In an action against a steamship company for injuries to the plaintiff\u2019s goods by reason of the negligence of the defendants, their master mariners and servants, in carrying the same, <em>it seems </em>that the defense that the injury occurred while the vessel was in charge of a pilot, who, x by the regulations governing the port, had exclusive charge of the vessel, and that by his neglect the accident happened, is not available, unless specially pleaded in the answer, it being a matter peculiarly within the defendant\u2019s knowledge, and to prevent surprise the plaintiff should have been apprised of it in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">110. Ellet <em>v. </em>The St. L., Kan. City and Nor. Ry. Co., 76 <em>Mo. </em>518. The petition alleged that the train, in which the plaintiff was, was overturned because of the negligence of the defendant's servants. The defendant put in a general denial; and also a special plea alleging that the accident was caused by an extraordinary rain storm, <em>\u2014Held, </em>that the special plea was properly stricken out, as the matter therein alleged could be shown under the general denial. Judgment reversed on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">111. Brown v. Elliott, 4 <em>Daly, </em>329; s. c., with points of counsel, in 45 <em>How. Pr. </em>182. Under a general denial, in an action for damage to plaintiff\u2019s goods through defendant\u2019s negligence, defendant may show that the goods injured did not belong to plaintiff. Such want of title need not be specially pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">\u2014 <em>contributory.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">112. McDonnell <em>v. </em>Buffum, 31 <em>How. Pr. </em>154. Contributory negligence may be proved, though not alleged. In an action for damages for negligence, the answer need not aver that plaintiff\u2019s negligence contributed to the injury, in order to prove that fact, as such evidence tends to show that the plaintiff never had a cause of action. It may be shown, under a general denial of the charge, that the injury was caused by defendant's negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">\n<em>Bona fide fur chase.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">113. Weaver <em>v. </em>Barden, 49 N. <em>Y. </em>286; rev'g, in part, 3 <em>Lans. </em>338. Under a general denial, defendant has the right to give evidence controverting any facts necessary to be established by plaintiff, but not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>prove a defense founded upon new <em>matter,\u2014e. g., </em>that defendant, in an action to recover certain stock, is a bona fide purchaser. Groveb, J. Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In tills case the complaint in substance charged that one W. had transferred to the defendant certain stock, held by him for the benefit of the plaintiff, without the plaintiff's authority or consent, and prayed that the defendant might be adjudged to assign and deliver such stock to the plaintiff,\u2014Ileld, under a general denial, the plantiff was only required to prove, in order to establish his cause of action, that ho was legal owner of the stock and equitably entitled to the same as against the defendant, and the defendant might controvert any fact necessary to be established by the plaintiff; but could not show that he was a bona fide holder for value, as such a defense was new matter.</p>\n<p id=\"AWC\">\u2022 114. Hennequin v. Butterfield, 43 <em>Super. Ct. </em>(J. <em>&amp; S.) </em>411. Where a complaint alleged a fraudulent hypothecation of plaintiff\u2019s securities to <em>defendants,\u2014Held, </em>that the action proceeded on the theory, as against the plaintiffs, that-defendants were not bona fide holders of the securities, and the latter could show, under a denial of the alleged fraudulent hj'pothecation, that they were bona fide holders for value.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">\n<em>Malicious prosecution.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">115. Radde v. Ruckgaber, 3 <em>Duer, </em>684. In an answer to a complaint, in an action for falsely, maliciously, and without reasonable or probable cause, procuring plaintiff to be arrested, it is not competent for defendant to set forth the minute facts and incidents which he expects to prove and rely on as sufficient to establish the general proposition, that there was probable cause. Such allegations will be stricken out on motion. It seems, he should merely deny plaintiff\u2019s allegation that there was not probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">\n<em>False imprisonment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">116. Catlin v. Adirondack Co.,* 12 <em>Weekly Dig. </em>4. Partial defenses must be pleaded, and facts in mitigation constitute a partial defense. Thus, in an action based on false imprisonment, caused by the issuing of an execution against the person.of the plaintiff for the costs of the defendant, on dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint in a prior action between the same parties, the defendant proposed to amend his answer by alleging that the plaintiff had collected the money back from the sheriff,</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">The proceeding out of which the alleged false imprisonment arose is reported in <em>(Ct. of App.) </em>11 <em>Abb. </em>N. <em>C. </em>377; holding that an action against a common carrier for the non-delivery of goods, in the form of an action on contract, is not an action for the \u201cinjury of property\u201d within <em>Code Gin. Pro. </em>\u00a7 549, so as to warrant an execution against the person. Reversing 20 <em>Hun, </em>19. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>which he had paid in satisfaction of the execution. The motion was denied on the ground that the facts could be proved under the answer <em>unamended,\u2014Held, </em>error, that such facts wore in mitigation, and should be pleaded, and no laches having been shown, motion to amend should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\n<em>Slander and libel.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">117. Brothers v. Fobes, 17 <em>Weekly Dig. 474. </em>In an action for slander, i where the communication is not of a privileged character, evidence for purpose of disproving malice and mitigation of damages is not admissible under a general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">118. Anonymous, 6 <em>How. Pr. </em>160. Evidence of general bad character of the plaintiff is inadmissible in an action of slander under a general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">\n<em>Deceit.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">119. Howell v. Biddlecom, 62 <em>Barb. </em>131. In an action for damages for fraudulently concealing a defect in a thing sold, the fact that defendant had communicated the defect to plaintiff, is admissible under a general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">The gravaman of the charge in such an action being fraudulent concealment, the plaintiff was bound to prove want of knowledge. It was competent, therefore, for the defendant, under a general denial, to prove the affirmative proposition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">120. Van Alstyne v. Norton, 1 <em>Hun, </em>537; s. c., as Van Alstyne v. Crane, 4 <em>Supm. Ct. (T. </em>&amp; C.) 113. Where the ground on which recovery is sought is fraud, and the facts constituting the fraud are alleged in the complaint, a denial of the fraud, as charged, puts the plaintiff on proof of it, and entitles the defendant to prove all such facts as they are able to produce, disproving the fraud charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">121. It is, therefore, error in addition to such a denial to specially plead evidence disproving the fraud, and such allegations should be stricken out on motion. The objection cannot, however, be taken by the demurrer to the answer. Order sustaining demurrer reversed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">\n<em>Breach of promise.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">122. Button v. McCauley, 1 <em>Abb. Ct. App. Dec. </em>282; s. c., 5 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>29. Under a general denial in an action for breach of promise, evidence that the plaintiff drank intoxicating liquor to excess, and would be an unfit companion for married life, although not competent as a defense, is admissible in mitigation of damages. Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-15\">\n<em>Alienation of affection.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-16\">123. Edwards v. Nichols, 21 <em>Weekly Dig. </em>238. Under a general denial, in an action for the alienation of the affections of the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>wife, where the complaint alleged that they \u201c were living together happily as man and wife,\u201d evidence is admissible to show that unhnppy relations existed between them. The purpose of such evidence is not to excuse or mitigate the conduct of the defendant, but only as bearing on the actual injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\n<em>Highway penalty.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">124. Saunders v. Townsend, 26 <em>Hun, </em>308. In an action by a commissioner of highways to recover a statutory penalty for obstructing a highway, the defendant, under a general denial, may controvert alike the user as a highway and the fact of the obstruction. [Citing Little <em>v. </em>Denn,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> 34 N. Y. 452.] Dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">\n<em>Quo warranto.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">125. People <em>v. </em>Platt, 10 <em>N. Y. State Rep. </em>717. In <em>quo warranto </em>a denial is not a sufficient defense, but defendant must plead his title. [Citing People v. Richardson, 4 <em>Cow. </em>97; People v. Utica Ins. Co., 15 <em>Johns. </em>357.]</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">\n<em>Damages.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">126. Booth v. Powers, 56 <em>N. Y. </em>22; rev'g Flint v. Craig, 59 <em>Barb. </em>319. Under a general denial in an action for conversion, any matter in reduction of damages is admissible; as, in case of conversion of a note, that the note as alleged included an authorized alteration by the plaintiff rendering the note uncollectable [41 <em>N. Y. </em>349], and inability of the maker to pay. Judgment reversed for error in excluding such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">127. Muser v. Lewis, 14 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>333; s. c., 50 <em>Super. Ct. (J. &amp; S.) </em>431. In an action for <em>conversion,\u2014Held, </em>partial satisfaction or payment of damages by one tort feasor, inures to the benefit of other joint tort feasors, not as a matter of defense, but by lessening the measure of damages. It is error for the court to refuse to direct the jury to deduct such payment. Judgment reversed, unless the plaintiff stipulated to deduct the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">128. Wehle v. Butler, 12 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>139; s. c., 35 <em>Super. Ct. (J. &amp; S.) </em>1. In an action for trespass for the wrongful taking and carrying away the plaintiff\u2019s goods, under the cover of an attachment,\u2014 <em>Held, </em>that under a general denial, evidence of subsequent retention and sale of the goods under proqess claimed to be valid, was inadmissible in mitigation of damages. Such a fact constituted a defense, and should have been specially pleaded. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-13\"> Reversed on other grounds in 83 <em>N.
