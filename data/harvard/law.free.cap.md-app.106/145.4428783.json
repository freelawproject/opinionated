He was sentenced to nine months detention on the driving under the influence conviction and was fined for the other convictions. Appellant raises the following questions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">I. Did the court err in admitting the officer\u2019s testimony about appellant\u2019s performance of the horizontal gaze nystagmus test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">II. Did the court improperly influence the jury with its remarks and questions of the officer?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">Officer Timothy Rossiter stopped appellant on March 1, 1994, about 11:30 p.m. Upon approaching appellant\u2019s vehicle and speaking with appellant, Officer Rossiter detected, among other things, the smell of alcohol and proceeded to administer several field sobriety tests: when asked to recite the alphabet, appellant jumbled several letters after Q; when asked to stand on one foot for thirty seconds, he had to use his other foot to maintain his balance within fifteen seconds; and, when asked to walk in a straight line heel to toe, he experienced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>some difficulty doing so. The officer also performed the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the officer explained at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">You measure each eye separately and one point is assessed as the object is passed in front of the eye, if it doesn\u2019t move smoothly, that\u2019s a point. Once you get to the 45 degree angle, if there\u2019s a quiver in the eye, that\u2019s a point; if there\u2019s not, then there\u2019s no point, and when you get to the furthest point, again, if there\u2019s a moving or a jumping of the eyeball, that\u2019s a point. If there\u2019s no movement, then there isn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">According to the officer, a person can receive a score as high as six on the test, and the higher the score, the more likely it is that the individual is intoxicated. The officer stated that a score of more than four indicates that an individual is intoxicated; a score of four indicates a borderline case. The officer then stated that appellant received a score of five or six on the test. No chemical tests were performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Officer Rossiter was the only witness that testified for the State. Appellant testified that he had had nothing to drink that day. On that day, he had flown home from Florida. He testified that he had stopped off at a tavern he owns and operates on his way home for about one-half hour, but had nothing to drink. He indicated that his truck might have exhibited the smell of alcohol because he sometimes uses it to haul empty alcoholic beverage containers. He also indicated that his difficulty in some of the sobriety tests might have been attributable to an injury that he suffered to his knees several years earlier. The injury causes stiffness when sitting for extended periods of time, as was the case on the day in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Appellant\u2019s nephew and a friend of his also testified on behalf of appellant. They both stated that they had been with him since about 3:00 p.m. that day, as they were flying back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>from Florida together. They stated that they did not observe appellant drink any alcohol. They drove with him from Baltimore-Washington International Airport and accompanied him into the tavern that he owns. They admitted that, once they went into the tavern, they socialized with other patrons and could not be sure that he did not have anything alcoholic to drink at the tavern, but they did not observe him doing so. The waitress who was working at the tavern that night stated that appellant only had a ginger ale to drink while he was there. Appellant\u2019s son picked him up at the police station and stated that he could not detect any alcohol on appellant\u2019s breath or any other signs of drinking. Appellant\u2019s wife was waiting for him when he returned home and she, too, testified that she was unable to detect any alcohol on his breath or any other signs that he had been drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">We first acknowledge that the HGN test, when used to detect the presence of alcohol in a person\u2019s system, has been the subject of attack, usually with respect to the qualifications of officers who administer the test. It has been noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As\">One of the test\u2019s shortcomings is that the officer administering the test may not be properly trained to understand all aspects of the test and to produce results as accurately as the NHTSA manual suggests....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">... To demonstrate a proper foundation, an officer must show that he is trained in the particular procedure, that he is certified in the administration of the procedure, and that the procedure was properly administered. [Footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Stephanie E. Busloff, Note <em>Can Your Eyes Be Used Against You? The Use of the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test in the Courtroom, </em>84 J.Crim.L. &amp; Criminology 216-33 (1993). <em>See </em>also Jonathan D. Cowan &amp; Susannah G. Jaffee, <em>Proof and Disproof of Alcohol-Induced Driving Impairment Through Evidence of Observable Intoxication, </em>9 Am.Jur. <em>Proof of Facts </em>3d 459 (1990); Lawrence Taylor, <em>Drunk Driving Defense, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>\u00a7 4.4.5 (3d ed.

Nichols, <em>Drinking/Driving Lit., </em>\u00a7 24.09 (1995).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">These requirements are faulty in one respect: the level of competency among the officers who administer the test is wide-ranging. The NHTSA manual defines the \u201cwell-trained technician\u201d as an individual who studies and properly adheres to the NHTSA.manuals. In all probability, not every officer would meet this standard. Therefore, this comment suggests that certification for administering the HGN test should not only guarantee that the officer will know how to administer the test and know what to look for, but that the officer will know that there are many other causes of HGN other than alcohol. The officer then could at least make a simple connection between alcohol and the effects on eye movement. With such knowledge, the officer could be required to question a suspect about his or her medical condition before administering the HGN test. The officer could carry a check-off card with relevant information to remember the requisite steps. Such an approach would be inexpensive and easy to implement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 234 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Appellant alleges in his brief, first, that HGN testing is scientific in nature and, thus, the trial court erred in concluding that it was not and admitting it without a proper foundation having been laid under the <em>Frye/Reed (Frye v. United States, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C.Cir.1923), and <em>Reed v. State, </em>283 Md. 374, 391 A.2d 364 (1978)) standard. Appellant also alleges that, in any event, a proper foundation as to the qualifications of the officer was not laid below and, thus, his testimony as to the HGN test should not have been permitted over appellant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">We agree that the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test is scientific in nature and depends, for its admissibility, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>satisfactory proof of its reliability and its acceptance in the relevant scientific and medical communities. Because we shall, however, take judicial notice of its reliability and its acceptance in those communities, we shall not reverse the trial court on the grounds that a foundation for the admissibility of the test itself was not laid. We shall hereafter hold that the results of HGN testing are admissible in evidence in the courts of this State, provided the administrator of the test is duly qualified and the testing procedure is conducted properly. But, we shall reverse appellant\u2019s convictions on the alcohol-related offenses because, under the circumstances of this case, the <em>record does not reflect </em>that the officer was in fact properly trained or certified to administer the test. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The majority of foreign jurisdictions that have addressed the issue have held that the test for HGN is a scientific test. Most of those few states that have held that it is not a scientific test opine that its admissibility depends upon a lesser standard because it is a mere field test and, thus, is admissible without a scientific foundation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, in both the states holding that the HGN test is a scientific test (the majority) and those states holding that it is only a <em>field test, </em>it is, nevertheless, admissible so long as certain predicates are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">One such case, which held that the HGN test is not a scientific test and is admissible based upon a lower standard, is <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>310 S.C. 311, 426 S.E.2d 766 (1993). There, the trial court, according to the Supreme Court of South Carolina, had ruled HGN testing inadmissible, expressing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">skepticism regarding HGN tests and not[ing] that nystagmus may be caused by physiological forces other than alcohol consumption. Additionally, the circuit court related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>reservations about police officers conducting and interpreting a medical/scientific test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><em>Id., </em>426 S.E.2d at 769 (footnote omitted). In reversing the trial court, the <em>Sullivan </em>court equated HGN tests with field tests and held that such results were \u201cadmissible when the HGN test ... [is] used to elicit objective manifestations of soberness or insobriety----\u25a0 HGN tests shall not constitute evidence to establish a specific degree of blood alcohol content.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">HGN as Scientific Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the results of the HGN test because the State failed to lay a foundation pursuant to <em>Reed v. State, supra, </em>283 Md. 374, 391 A.2d 364, that this test was based on well-recognized scientific principles so as to have gained general acceptance in the particular field to which it belongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">In <em>Reed, </em>the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-11\">[W]ith particular regard to expert testimony based on the application of new scientific techniques, it is recognized that prior to the admission of such testimony, it must be established that the particular scientific method is itself reliable. <em>People v. Kelly, </em>17 Cal.3d 24, 130 Cal.Rptr. 144, 549 P.2d 1240 (1976); Jones, <em>Danger\u2014Voiceprints Ahead, </em>11 Am. Crim.L.Rev. 549, 554 (1973). <em>See also Shanks v. State, </em>185 Md. 437, 440, 45 A.2d 85 (1945); 3 Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 795 (Chadbourn rev. 1970).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-12\">On occasion, the validity and reliability of a scientific technique may be so broadly and generally accepted in the scientific community that a trial court may take judicial notice of its reliability. Such is commonly the case today with regard to ballistics tests, fingerprint identification, blood tests, and the like. <em>See Shanks v. State, supra, </em>185 Md. at 440 [45 A.2d 85]. Similarly, a trial court might take judicial notice of the invalidity or unreliability of procedures widely recognized in the scientific community as bogus or experimental. However, if the reliability of a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>technique cannot be judicially noticed, it is necessary that the reliability be demonstrated before testimony based on the technique can be introduced into evidence. Although this demonstration will normally include testimony by witnesses, a court can and should also take notice of law journal articles, articles from reliable sources that appear in scientific journals, and other publications which bear on the degree of acceptance by recognized experts that a particular proc\u00e9ss has achieved. <em>People v. Law, </em>40 Cal.App.3d 69, 75, 114 Cal.Rptr. 708, 711 (1974).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">The question of the reliability of a scientific technique or process is unlike the question, for example, of the helpfulness of particular expert testimony to the trier of facts in a specific case. The answer to the question about the reliability of a scientific technique or process does not vary according to the circumstances of each case. It is therefore inappropriate to view this threshold question of reliability as a matter within each trial judge\u2019s individual discretion. Instead, considerations of uniformity and consistency of decision-making require that a legal standard or test be articulated by which the reliability of a process may be established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">The test which has gained general acceptance throughout the United States for establishing the reliability of such scientific methods was first articulated in the leading case of <em>Frye v. United States, </em>293 F. 1013, 1014 (D.C.Cir.1923)[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u201cJust when a scientific principle or discovery crosses the line between the experimental and demonstrable stages is difficult to define. Somewhere in this twilight zone the evidential force of the principle must be recognized, and while courts will go a long way in admitting expert testimony deduced from a <em>well-recognized </em>scientific principle or discovery, the thing from which the deduction is made must be <em>sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">That is to say, before a scientific opinion will be received as evidence at trial, the basis of that opinion must be shown to be generally accepted as rehable within the expert\u2019s particular scientific field. Thus, according to the <em>Frye </em>standard, if a new scientific technique\u2019s validity is in controversy in the relevant scientific community, or if it is generally regarded as an experimental technique, then expert testimony based upon its validity cannot be admitted into evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 380-81, 391 A.2d 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In a jurisdiction in which it was held that the HGN test was subject to the <em>Frye </em>standard of admissibility, it was noted that <em>Frye </em>required the State to satisfy a three-prong test prior to the admission of HGN evidence: 1) that the underlying scientific theory is rehable, <em>i.e., </em>that nystagmus is an indicator of alcohol consumption; 2) that the method used to test for HGN is accepted by scientists familiar with the phenomenon and test; and 3) that the particular officer involved has been trained to follow, and did follow, the procedures estabhshed by the scientists. <em>State v. Witte, </em>251 Kan. 313, 836 P.2d 1110, 1117 (1992). At trial, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the State did not lay any foundation as to the first two prongs of the test prior to Officer Rossiter\u2019s testimony. The State, however, contends that the HGN test is not scientific evidence at ah, citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>Crampton v. State, </em>71 Md.App. 375, 525 A.2d 1087 (1987), <em>aff'd, </em>314 Md. 265, 550 A.2d 693 (1988). In <em>Crampton, </em>this Court addressed whether the <em>Frye/Reed </em>standard applied to some of the same sobriety tests to which appellant was subjected in this case (excluding the HGN test). The field tests performed in <em>Crampton </em>are known commonly as reciting the alphabet, standing on one leg, heel to toe walking, and the finger to nose test. We stated there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">The <em>Frye-Reed </em>test is not, however, applicable to the case <em>sub judice. </em>Unlike the techniques employed in the above-cited cases, field sobriety tests are essentially personal observations of a police officer which determine a suspect\u2019s balance and ability to speak with recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">There is nothing \u201cnew\u201d or perhaps even \u201cscientific\u201d about the exercises that an officer requests a suspect to perform. Those sobriety tests have been approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and are simply guidelines for police officers to utilize in order to observe more precisely a suspect\u2019s coordination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">It requires no particular scientific skill or training for a police officer, or any other competent person, to ascertain whether someone performing simple tasks is to a degree affected by alcohol. The field sobriety tests are designed to reveal objective information about a driver\u2019s coordination. <em>See People v. Ramirez, </em>199 Colo. 367, 609 P.2d 616, 620 (1980). The <em>Frye-Reed </em>test does not apply to those field sobriety tests because the latter are essentially empirical observations, involving no controversial, new, or \u201cscientific\u201d technique. Their use is guided by practical experience, not theory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 388, 525 A.2d 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">We have noted that the HGN test is also a field sobriety test. Field sobriety tests are tests of sobriety conducted in the field. HGN certainly meets that definition. We acknowledge that the NHTSA has described the HGN test as \u201cthe first and most valid test in the standardized field sobriety testing battery,\u201d and that the United States Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>referred to this test as a \u201cstandard field sobriety test[ ]\u201d in <em>Pennsylvania v. Muniz, </em>496 U.S. 582, 585, 110 S.Ct. 2638, 2641, 110 L.Ed.2d 528 (1990). The HGN test is, nonetheless, a scientific test, in that the fact that one\u2019s eye may jerk or quiver more when one is intoxicated is not universally known.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Alcohol has been known to mankind since the dawn of civilization. It was probably not long after that it was recognized that alcohol affects one\u2019s balance, coordination, and ability to recollect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The HGN test, however, does not test a suspect\u2019s coordination or ability to recollect. It is based upon a scientific principle that the extent and manner in which one\u2019s eye quivers can be a reliable measure of the amount of alcohol one has consumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Nor does the mere fact that an officer may physically observe the jerking of a suspect\u2019s eyeballs without the aid of a machine make this test any less scientific. 1 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>(John W. Strong et al. 4th ed. 1992) \u00a7 206B states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALL\">It is said that more than 4,000 y\u00e9ars ago the Chinese would try the accused in the presence of a physician who, listening or feeling for a change in the heartbeat, would announce whether the accused was testifying truthfully. The modern \u201clie detectors\u201d operate on the same general principle. [Footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">It is the premise underlying lie detectors, <em>i.e., </em>that a physiological change is an accurate indication that a suspect is lying, that has failed to gain general acceptance in the scientific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>community, not the ability to measure the physiological change.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The principle underlying the HGN test, <em>i.e., </em>that it is an accurate measure of the intoxication of a suspect, is a scientific principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The admissibility of the results of HGN testing has been challenged in some foreign jurisdictions for failing to satisfy the <em>Frye </em>standard (or the standard adopted by that jurisdiction for determining the admissibility of scientific evidence). A relatively important early case in which the test was challenged and the results were ruled admissible as evidence of the presence of alcohol was <em>State v. Superior Court, </em>149 Ariz. 269, 718 P.2d 171 (1986). (Dennis L. Lusk, <em>Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus, </em>23 Arizona Bar Journal (December/January 1988)), states that Arizona was the \u201cfirst state to ... approve ... \u2018HGN\u2019.... \u201d (Citing <em>Superior </em>Court) <em>See also </em>the American Bar Association\u2019s Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Video Tape prepared for the American Bar Association by the Northwestern University Traffic Institute). The Arizona Supreme Court stated in <em>Superior Court:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">The HGN test is a different type of test from balancing on one leg or walking a straight line because it rests almost entirely upon an assertion of scientific legitimacy rather than a basis of common knowledge. Different rules therefore apply to determine its admissibility.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\"><em>Id., </em>149 Ariz. at 276, 718 P.2d at 178. In <em>Superior Court, </em>a scientific foundation, which satisfied the <em>Frye </em>standard, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>presented at trial. Thus, the court there was able to determine that the test conducted did satisfy <em>Frye </em>principles.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it held that the test could only be used for the limited purpose of challenging or supporting a chemical test. It was not then considered by the Arizona court sufficient, by itself, to be a basis for a conviction under a statutory provision requiring a chemical test for a conviction. The court noted several \u201cdue process\u201d concerns with the test, if it were to be used by itself to sustain a conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">The ... \u201creading\u201d of the HGN test cannot be verified or duplicated by an independent party. The test\u2019s recognized margin of error provides problems as to criminal convictions which require proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The circumstances under which the test is administered at roadside may affect the reliability of the test results. Nystagmus may be caused by conditions other than alcohol intoxication. And finally, the far more accurate chemical testing devices are readily available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\"><em>Id., </em>149 Ariz. at 279, 718 P.2d at 181 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">That early conclusion in <em>Superior Court, i.e., </em>that the HGN test is scientific evidence, represents what we perceive to be the majority position of foreign jurisdictions on that subject. Other opinions concluding that the HGN test is scientific in nature include: <em>Malone v. City of Silverhill, </em>575 So.2d 101 (Ala.Crim.App.1989) (Alabama\u2019s intermediate appellate court found that the test was scientific and then, adopting the finding of <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>that the test satisfied <em>Frye </em>and that the error in admitting the HGN test into evidence, without a foundation being laid, was harmless.), <em>rev\u2019d in part </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>sub nom.

In addition, as previously indicated, unlike the Ohio court in <em>Nagel, </em>we do not find that the use of a machine, or lack thereof, is a useful indicator of whether evidence is scientific in nature. The Supreme Court of Kansas in <em>Witte, </em>836 P.2d at 1116, noted that the <em>Nagel </em>decision had been subject to criticism:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">\u201cThe Ohio appellate court has apparently ignored the rule that the arresting officer\u2019s \u2018personal observations,\u2019 in this instance, constitute opinion testimony. That is, the officer\u2019s opinion (that the jerking and twitching of the suspect\u2019s eyes during the gaze nystagmus test indicated that the suspect had consumed alcohol) is an opinion which is based upon a so-called \u2018scientific\u2019 interpretation of observed facts which exist outside the common knowledge of the average lay person and therefore would require the testimony of an expert. The court also ignored the significance of the fact that the horizontal gaze nystagmus test draws its convincing force from the supposed scientific principle that alcohol affects the smooth pursuit mechanism of the human eye. It is clear that the horizontal gaze nystagmus test is scientific in nature, as are other numerous reflex response tests (such as Babinski\u2019s reflex,[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] which does not require the use of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>machine to administer, monitor or interpret).\u201d Rouleau, Unreliability of the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test, 4 Am Jur. Proof of Facts 3d 439 \u00a7 10, p. 458 (1989).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The court in <em>Witte </em>concluded that the HGN test was scientific evidence, stating: \u201cAlcohol\u2019s effect on a person\u2019s sense of balance is common knowledge. The same cannot be said for HGN. The HGN test is based upon scientific principles and exceeds common knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Witte </em>court, while noting that the authorities were not unanimous that the test was rehable, remanded that case back to the trial court for a determination of whether the test was sufficiently reliable and whether it was generally (not unanimously) acceptable in the scientific community.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">In holding HGN was a scientific test, the California Supreme Court in <em>People v.

The California court rejected the State\u2019s position, holding that it is in fact a scientific test. After listing states that had accepted HGN testing as valid scientific tests, the court went on to note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">The foregoing decisions, however, do not explain how police officers are competent to establish general acceptance of HGN testing <em>in the scientific community, or how they are qualified to relate the scientific bases underlying the nystagmus test. </em>[Some emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>Id., </em>34 Cal.Rptr.2d at 676, 882 P.2d at 334.

It should have been excluded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\"><em>Id. </em>The California court then opined that \u201ctestimony by police officers regarding the mere <em>administra,lion </em>of the test is insufficient to meet the general acceptance standard required by <em>Kelly.\u201d (People v.

(As we shall hereafter take judicial notice of the reliability and acceptability in the relevant communities of HGN testing generally, the <em>Leahy </em>court\u2019s (and the <em>Williams </em>court\u2019s) holding that officers cannot generally establish the foundational scientific reliability of the test will not be of direct importance to our subsequent determination.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Pennsylvania courts have noted that scientific evidence is \u201cevidence that draws its convincing force from some principle of science, mathematics and the like.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Miller, </em>367 Pa.Super. 359, 532 A.2d 1186, 1188 (1987). The <em>Miller </em>court noted that a proper <em>Frye </em>foundation must be laid before such evidence may be admitted. \u201c[T]he rationale for subjecting motorists suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol to the HGN test derives from the scientific principle that consumption of alcohol causes nystagmus.\u201d <em>Id., </em>532 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>at 1189.

In <em>Apollo, </em>the State attempted to lay a <em>Frye </em>foundation by introducing the testimony of a single expert, an optometrist who was also a certified instructor in respect to HGN testing. The court, in holding that a proper foundation had not been laid, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">Dr. Sisson conducted his own study of the incidence of gaze nystagmus in \u201csober\u201d persons. His study indicated that approximately one in five hundred sober patients would fail the HGN test, in contrast to national studies which have estimated a failure rate of two to four percent in a similar population. Dr. Sisson testified that he was aware of no studies evaluating the reliability of the HGN test that have reached any conclusion other than that it is the most accurate field sobriety test available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\"><em>Id., </em>603 A.2d at 1027. <em>See also Commonwealth v.

(The trial court had not allowed the evidence on the grounds that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value). The appellate court resolved the issue for the prosecution by, in effect, taking judicial notice of the reliability of the test. After discussing several of the cases from other states, emphasizing <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>and noting the reports of the United States Department of Transportation as cited in <em>Bresson, supra, </em>the Illinois Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">Such factors in conjunction with the reasoning in <em>State v.

City of Silverhill, supra, </em>575 So.2d 101, essentially took judicial notice of the reliability of HGN tests when it opined: \u201cThe fact that nystagmus can be caused by the consumption of alcohol is also accepted by the medical profession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102. It continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">Its [the HGN test\u2019s] use became so widespread that the United States Department of Transportation outlined the appropriate procedures for administering the test, in its National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Bulletin DOT HS 806 512.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 103. Then, it opined that the Arizona Court in <em>State v.

It did not address the intermediate court\u2019s apparent judicial notice and adoption of the <em>Superior Court </em>holding. In any event, the adoption language of the intermediate court remains hanging in legal limbo and, apparently, is inoperative in view of the higher court\u2019s resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In <em>State v. Bresson, supra, </em>554 N.E.2d 1330, the Ohio Supreme Court took judicial notice of the reliability of HGN testing. An intermediate appellate court had reversed a trial court opinion on the basis that the trial court had permitted evidence of HGN testing without there having been any foundation laid as to its reliability. The <em>Bresson </em>court noted that Ohio does not apply the <em>Frye </em>standard and acknowledged that no foundation had been laid at trial. It then opined that most of Ohio\u2019s intermediate appellate courts had allowed such evidence based only on an officer\u2019s testimony, on the grounds that HGN testing was merely another field test. The court then noted a split among other jurisdictions as to whether the test was a scientific test. Without deciding whether it was or was not a scientific test, and with no foundation having been laid in the case before it, the Ohio court, relying on the decisions of the courts of other states, and on its own intermediate appellate court, opined, at 554 N.E.2d at 1334:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">We find that the HGN test has been shown to be a reliable indicator of BAC levels.

The court noted that HGN testing had, under various studies,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> been found to be 77% accurate standing by itself, and when used with other field tests, as high as 88% accurate. It then noted that other jurisdictions had found the test sufficiently reliable, citing <em>Superior Court, supra; Bresson, supra; Murphy, supra, </em>and <em>Clark, supra, </em>before holding, at 768-69:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">\u2022After consulting the literature ... and considering case law from other jurisdictions ... we conclude that the theory underlying the HGN test is sufficiently reliable.... The scientific materials addressing the issue have reached the uniform conclusion that the consumption of alcohol has a cognizable effect on human eye movement. We believe that the accuracy of those sources cannot be reasonably questioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">Technique</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">We also conclude that the technique employed in the HGN test, as designed and promoted by NHTSA, is reliable .... In this jurisdiction, officers who administer the HGN test receive standardized training in its administration .... The test procedures ... require an officer to screen for factors other than alcohol ... such as other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>drugs, neurological disorders, and brain damage, prior to administering the HGN test.... We take judicial notice of the reliability of both the theory ... and its technique.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">We are unable to conclude, however, that the HGN technique is a sufficiently reliable indicator of <em>precise BAC </em>[blood alcohol content]. [Citation and footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az\"><em>See also Anderson v. State, </em>866 S.W.2d 685 (Tex.App.\u2014 Houston [1st Dist.] 1993); <em>City of Fargo v. McLaughlin, </em>512 N.W.2d 700, 706 (N.D.1994) (the North Dakota Supreme Court took judicial notice that intoxicated individuals exhibit nystagmus).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We note with some caution the dissent in <em>Emerson, supra, </em>which initially noted that, by taking judicial notice of the reliability of HGN testing and technique, the appellate court had relieved the State of its burden of establishing the reliability of the test at trial. We acknowledge that we, in taking judicial notice of the reliability of the test (though we reverse in respect to the qualifications of the officer), are likewise relieving the State of that burden. We shall, nevertheless, take judicial notice that HGN testing, a scientific test, is sufficiently reliable and generally accepted in the relevant scientific community. We do so considering the great weight of scientific support in the literature and in light of its adoption in most other jurisdictions that have addressed the issue.'</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">To do otherwise at this stage in the development of the science would leave to individual courts within the twenty-three jurisdictions of this State (and the various courts and judges within each jurisdiction) to determine, on a case-by-case basis, the scientific reliability of the test. In each of the various jurisdictions, the determination of the reliability and acceptability of such evidence would depend upon the competence, energy, and schedules (and even the budgets) of the various prosecutors throughout the State in obtaining, and producing the attendance of experts at the thousands of trials involving alcohol related offenses in which HGN testing is sought to be admitted. Disparate results and decisions might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>result in many instances, not from the actual scientific reliability of the tests themselves, but from the differing abilities and resources of prosecutors and the availability of witnesses from the scientific community.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">As we have attempted to show, the great weight of scientific literature supports its reliability and the majority of jurisdictions around the country have declared HGN testing to be reliable. We take judicial notice that the results of HGN testing, if the test is properly given by a qualified officer, are admissible to indicate the presence of alcohol in a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Officer Qualifications</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Before we discuss case law from other jurisdictions that refers to officer qualifications to administer the HGN test and to present testimony relative thereto, and the training, qualifications, and certification programs available in Maryland, we shall briefly describe the evidence presented at trial in respect to Officer Rossiter\u2019s qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Officer Rossiter testified that he had been a Hagerstown police officer for just under five years and that he was a duly qualified and certified <em>radar </em>operator using properly calibrated and certified <em>radar </em>equipment. He additionally testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">A. I asked him to exit the vehicle to perform some field sobriety tests....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-10\">Q. Have you receive training in how to conduct field sobriety tests?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-12\">Q. Where ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-13\">A. Western Maryland Police Academy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-14\">Q. Five years ago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-15\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-16\">Q.... [H]ave you had occasion to use field sobriety tests on other occasions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-17\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-18\">A. Close to 100 [times].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Q____ [W]hat is the purpose ... in giving somebody field sobriety tests?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">A. To check the subject\u2019s coordination and see if they can do two things at once....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">A. See if the person is able to pay attention....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">Q ... [W]hat [referring to the case <em>sub judice </em>] was the first test that you gave ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">A.... [T]he horizontal gaze nystagmus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">It tests the eyes, the muscles in the eyes as to how lax or smooth that the eyes can follow an object as it\u2019s passed in front of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">Q. Would you demonstrate how that test is performed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">MR. SALVATORE [appellant\u2019s trial counsel]. Your Hon- or, I\u2019m going to object. That test has never been proven to be reliable in the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">THE COURT: Overruled. The weight to be given to the test will be for the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-13\">A.... The point of it is, with the alcohol, it\u2019s a depressant and relaxes the muscles____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-14\">MR. SALVATORE: Objection, unless he\u2019s <em>qualified </em>to say that. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-15\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll overrule the objection. You may proceed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-16\">Officer Rossiter then described the tests. Later, he was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-17\">Q. And was he able to pass the test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-18\">A. No, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-19\">MR. SALVATORE: Objection as to passing or failing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-20\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-21\">When the officer began to describe the six-point scoring system for the test, appellant\u2019s counsel again objected: \u201cObjection ____ He\u2019s reached a conclusion and hasn\u2019t given any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the underlying basis for reaching that conclusion.\u201d The court overruled the objection. As the discussion of \u201cpoints\u201d continued, appellant again, unsuccessfully, objected as to a lack of foundation. Later, Rossiter\u2019s direct examination continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">Q. And who assigns the points?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">A.... [T]he Alcohol Influence Board.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">Q.... Somebody out there assigns how you\u2019re supposed to score the test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">MR. SALVATORE: Objection. It\u2019s leading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-10\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-11\">Q. Do you receive instruction on how to score this test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-12\">A. I was instructed in the Western Maryland Police Academy how to do it. I\u2019m not a certified instructor to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-13\">Q. But have you been taught how to perform the test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-15\">Appellant, in his brief, noted that he had objected to the officer\u2019s lack of qualifications, arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-16\">It must also be shown that the test was given in precisely the prescribed manner and that the tester was qualified to both administer the test and interpret the results. Officer Rossiter did none of these and should not have been permitted to testify regarding the Horizonal Gaze Nystagmus Test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-17\">Foreign Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b202-18\">The court in <em>Emerson, supra, </em>noted that Texas police officers must be certified in order to administer the test and must \u201ccomplete an NHTSA-approved, State-sponsored training course____\u201d 880 S.W.2d at 766. The Texas course consists of forty hours (twenty-four hours of classroom instruction and sixteen hours of field evaluation). During the sixteen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>hour field evaluation, the officer must complete and document thirty-five HGN test cases. Upon completion of the thirty-five HGN test cases, the results are submitted for the approval of the Texas Engineering Extension Service, Lav? Enforcement Training Division. If the results are satisfactory, the officer is then given a \u201cproficiency certification\u201d by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The Supreme Court of Iowa, in <em>State v. Murphy, supra, </em>451 N.W.2d at 156, recognized that Iowa\u2019s rules of evidence did not require strict adherence to a <em>Frye </em>standard, only that the reliability of the evidence be established. It noted that reliability was a necessary prerequisite for admission \u201c \u2018because unreliable evidence cannot assist a trier of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156-57. While joining the Ohio courts in holding that HGN testing is no more scientific than general field sobriety testing, the court emphasized the training of the police officer there involved and his testimony. The officer was an eleven-year veteran who had participated in specialized training in the administration of the HGN test. He was also certified by the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy as an instructor. The court concluded \u201cthat testimony by a properly trained police officer with respect to the administration and results of the horizontal gaze nystagmus test is admissible without need for further scientific evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In <em>State v. City Court, </em>165 Ariz. 514, 519, 799 P.2d 855, 860 (1990), the Arizona Supreme Court noted that it had previously decided that the HGN test was generally accepted in the relevant scientific community and, in light of that, opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">The proper foundation for such testimony, ... includes a description of the officer\u2019s training, education, and experience in administering the test and a showing that the test was administered properly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The Court, in <em>Clark, supra, </em>opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">Deputy Irby testified he was certified through the Montana Law Enforcement Academy, completing the required number of training hours. Further, Deputy Irby testified he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>administered the test in the proper manner. No other foundation need be shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">762 P.2d at 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The qualifications of the officer were directly challenged in <em>State v. Garrett, </em>119 Idaho 878, 811 P.2d 488, 491 (1991), where the court first held that HGN testing satisfies the <em>Frye </em>standard, noting that courts in Alaska, Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Ohio, and Texas had accepted it. The <em>Garrett </em>court then held that the expertise of the testing officer was first an issue for the trial court to resolve, noting that the officers there had been sufficiently qualified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">Fost [the officer] is attached to the Select Traffic Enforcement Team.... Fost is also an instructor in the use of field sobriety tests. Fost was trained by members of the Idaho State Police, and he also attended seminars conducted by Dr. Marcelline Bums of the Southern California Research Institute (SCRI). Dr. Burns worked with the NHTSA to develop reliable field sobriety tests, and was one of the designers of the test____ Even though the testimony elicited from Fost concerning the correlation between nystagmus and blood alcohol content was improper, the court nevertheless properly admitted Fost\u2019s expert testimony on the administration of the HGN test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-10\"><em>Id., </em>811 P.2d at 492-93 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">The <em>Armstrong </em>court held that a proper foundation had been laid for the introduction of the HGN test results in light of the officer\u2019s experience, training, and certification in respect to the test, and given that the evidence reflected that the test had been properly administered. <em>See also State v. Regan, </em>601 So.2d 5 (La.App. 3d Cir.1992), <em>writ denied, </em>610 So.2d 815-16 (1993). In <em>State v. Garris, </em>603 So.2d 277 (La.App. 2d Cir.), <em>writ denied, </em>607 So.2d 564 (La.1992), the court concluded that a sufficient foundation had been laid in that there was evidence that the officer had received HGN training, both in the Air Force, as a narcotics patrolman, and as a state trooper, that he had conducted HGN tests under supervision during the training, and that the officer had conducted the test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>properly. The court held that he had presented sufficient evidence of his qualifications, even though the officer never specifically stated that he was \u201ccertified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281. In <em>State v. Breitung, </em>623 So.2d 23 (La.App. 1 Cir.), <em>writ denied, </em>626 So.2d 1168 (La.1993), the evidence indicated that the officer had been trained in administering the HGN test; he had attended a two-week course that included actual practice tests on subjects and had been certified. The officer had administered the test to numerous other suspects and there was evidence that the tests had been properly administered. The court held that a proper foundation had been laid. In <em>Bresson, supra, </em>the court noted that the trooper had testified</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFS\">that he had received five days of training regarding the HGN test and described the methods he used in testing and evaluating appellee\u2019s performance.... His testimony ... corresponds to the testing methods devised by the United States Department of Transportation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">[T]he only requirement prior to admission is the officer\u2019s knowledge of the test, his training, and his ability to interpret his observations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\"><em>Id., </em>554 N.E.2d at 1334-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the record is, at best, minimal in regard to the level of Officer Rossiter\u2019s training. He was asked if he had received training in the general area of \u201cfield sobriety testing.\u201d He responded that he had trained at the Western Maryland Police Academy five years prior to testing appellant, but did not specify whether that training included testing for HGN. Again, he testified generally that he had performed field tests approximately 100 times but did not specify what experience he had had with HGN. Later, he responded that he \u201cwas instructed in the Western Maryland Police Academy how to do it. I am not a certified instructor to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">We have no way of knowing from the record the extent of the officer\u2019s actual HGN training, whether it was proper, whether it was supervised by certified instructors, or even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>whether Officer Rossiter was certified to administer the test. We hold, therefore, that a sufficient foundation as to the officer\u2019s qualifications to administer the test was not submitted below. His testimony should not have been allowed over the objection of appellant. In allowing this testimony, the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">We also note that, while the officer discussed how the actual test was performed, other than noting that appellant did not wear contacts, the officer\u2019s testimony is silent as to whether he checked for tracking and different size pupils, etc., designed to reduce the chances that nystagmus from nonalcoholic causes might be confused with alcohol-related nystagmus. The trial court thus also erred in admitting the testimony in that there was insufficient evidence that the proper precautions were taken or the proper considerations were accounted for prior to the administration of the test itself. This is especially important given the many other <em>possible </em>causes of HGN contained in the mass of literature we have reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The cases and literature indicate that, in addition to alcohol, many other factors have been <em>mentioned </em>as a possible cause of nystagmus. They include: (1) problems with the inner ear labyrinth; (2) irrigating the ears with warm or cold water under peculiar weather conditions; (3) influenza; (4) streptococcus infection; (5) vertigo; (6) measles; (7) syphilis; (8) arteriosclerosis; (9) muscular dystrophy; (10) multiple sclerosis; (11) Korchaffs syndrome; (12) brain hemorrhage; (13) epilepsy; (14) hypertension; (15) motion sickness; (16) sunstroke; (17) eye strain; (18) eye muscle fatigue; (19) glaucoma; (20) changes in atmospheric pressure; (21) consumption of excessive amounts of caffeine; (22) excessive exposure to nicotine; (23) aspirin; (24) circadian rhythms; (25) acute trauma to the head; (26) chronic trauma to the head; (27) some prescription drugs, tranquilizers, pain medications, anticonvulsants; (28) barbiturates; (29) disorders of the vestibular apparatus and brain stem; (30) cerebellum dysfunction; (31) heredity; (32) diet; (33) toxins; (34) exposure to solvents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>PCBS, dry cleaning fumes, carbon monoxide; (34) extreme chilling; (35) eye muscle imbalance; (36) lesions; (37) continuous movement of the visual field past the eyes, <em>i.e., </em>looking from a moving train; (38) antihistamine use. <em>See State v. Witte, supra; State v. Clark, supra; State v. Superior Court, supra; </em>Mark A. Rouleau, <em>Unreliability of the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test, </em>4 Am.Jur. <em>Proof of Facts </em>3d 439 (1989); Louise J. Gordy &amp; Roscoe N. Gray, 3A <em>Attorney\u2019s Textbook of Medicine </em>\u00a7\u00a7 84.63 and 84.64 (1990), and other cases and treatises hereinbefore mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">No chemical test was administered to appellant in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Evidence was proffered by appellant as to injuries that may have affected his ability to perform certain of the other field tests, and there was also evidence that the odor of alcohol smelled by Officer Rossiter may have come from a source other than appellant. Accordingly, we are unable to say that the error was harmless.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">We reverse appellant\u2019s convictions on the charges of driving under the influence of alcohol and driving with alcohol in his blood in violation of a court ordered alcohol restriction on his driver\u2019s license. We affirm his other conviction for speeding, as it is not otherwise challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Because appellant\u2019s second issue as to the trial court\u2019s questions relates only to the matter of HGN testing and we are reversing his alcohol-related convictions, we shall not address that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION FOR SPEEDING AFFIRMED; ALL OTHER JUDGMENTS OF CONVICTION <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID 20% BY APPELLANT AND 80% BY WASHINGTON COUNTY, APPELLEE.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\">.

The HGN test has been used by law enforcement officials for several decades. Appellate courts in this country began determining its admissibility as early as 1985. It was noted as long ago as 1826 that, in animals, nystagmus was a possible symptom of alcohol intoxication. Studies first conducted in 1897 indicated nystagmus in humans affected by alcohol. Gunnar Aschan <em>et al., Positional Nystagmus in Man During and After Alcohol Intoxication, </em>17 QJ. of Studies on Alcohol 381 (1956). <em>See also </em>Aschan &amp; Bergstelt, <em>Positional Alcoholic Nystagmus (PAN) in Man Following Repeated Alcohol Doses, </em>Acta Otolaryngal Supp. 330: 15-29, 1975 (identifies studies by B\u00e1r\u00e1ny (1911), B\u00e1r\u00e1ny &amp; Rothfeld (1913), Frenzel (1939), Plenkers (1943) and Walter (1954)) and notes that nystagmus effects of different types can increase for up to four hours after intake and still be present for up to several additional hours.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\">.

However, in certain diseases of the brain and spinal cord, ... stimulation of the sole causes the big toe to extend or bend upward, and the other toes to bend down and spread or fan out.\u201d <em>Schmidt\u2019s Attorneys\u2019 Dictionary of Medicine, </em>B-2 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b190-9\">. The American Bar Association states in the videotape we have referred to, <em>supra, </em>that the test has been accepted in all fifty states. Apparently it refers to trial court acceptance as we have found no prior Maryland appellate cases on the subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b198-8\">. Accuracy has been determined by comparing the HGN testing results with subsequent verification through chemical testing or through testing persons with a known blood alcohol content. Most studies, though varying slightly, result, generally, in accuracy levels of just under 80% if the HGN test is the only test administered. If combined with the other two tests in the NHTSA Standardized tests (walk and turn and balance), most studies indicate a reliability factor of between 85% to 90%. The various studies and articles we have reviewed include: Edward B. Tenney <em>The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test and the Admissibility of Scientific Evidence, </em>27 New Hampshire Bar Journal, 179 (Spring 1986) (Tenney noted that results from some agencies indicate a considerably higher reliability: Arlington County Police Force (345 arrests) 84%, Maryland State Police (451 arrests) 92%, North Carolina State Police (434 arrests) 91%); Theodore E. Anderson <em>et al. Field Evaluation of a Behavioral Test Battery for DWI\" </em>NHTSA Report DOT HS-806-475 (1983) (HGN tests performed on 1,506 drivers stopped for DWI during a three-month period. HGN deemed 82% accurate when used by itself in predicting BAC over .10.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b202-20\">.

The NHTSA provides a manual (written in large part by 1st Sgt. Tower of the Maryland State Police) entitled \"DWI Detection and Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Student Manual\u201d that is apparently utilized by the Maryland State Police in its training programs. It contains much information in respect to training, administering the HGN test and protocols designed to assure that the presence of HGN is not caused by factors other than the presence of alcohol. Satisfactory completion of the program results in certification and the program is open to officers of other agencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
