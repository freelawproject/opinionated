A 21-year-old defendant is before them on a two-count indictment, the first count charging the Theft of an automobile and the second, the Unauthorized Use of that automobile. Undisputed evidence established that the defendant, without the consent of the owner, broke the window of the automobile, \u201chot wired\u201d the ignition, and drove off, alone. He was apprehended by the police two minutes later, four blocks away. The defendant, with no criminal record, had apparently never spoken to anyone with respect to that or any other automobile. He gave no statement to the police and did not testify. There was no suggestion that the defendant was not both sane and sober. After several hours of deliberation, the jury returned with a question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">We are unanimously persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant unlawfully took the car and specifically intended to deprive the owner of it. As to the duration of that intended deprivation, however, we don\u2019t have a clue. We are not persuaded that the defendant intended to deprive the owner of the car <em>permanently </em>or <em>for such a period as to appropriate a portion of its value. </em>Neither are we persuaded that the defendant intended to deprive the owner of the car only <em>temporarily. </em>Given these findings and non-findings, must we acquit the defendant on all charges or may we resolve our doubt by convicting him of the less blameworthy charge? Please advise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">We would advise that hypothetical jury to convict of Unauthorized Use. There is no eye in the hurricane of guilt. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>reaching that conclusion, we are not unmindful of <em>Henry v. State, </em>273 Md. 131, 328 A.2d 293 (1974). We venture to suggest, however, that <em>Henry v. State </em>is no longer binding, inviting as we do so the full scrutiny of the Court of Appeals to be brought to bear on a vexing doctrinal problem. It is the problem of the relationship between two crimes that share every element of a common <em>corpus delicti, </em>but then differ only as to the levels of blameworthiness of their respective <em>mentes reae. </em>We believe that different gradations or degrees of culpability all rise in the same direction, with each level telescoping imperceptibly into the next higher level as fact finders are, one by one, persuaded that the pertinent boundary marker has been passed. We do not believe that related degrees of blameworthiness point in opposite directions, creating the anomaly (if not absurdity) of some intermediate \u201cfree zone\u201d where one might be not guilty enough for the greater crime but too guilty for the lesser crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">We venture to advance this position because of our belief that the whole mode of legal and semantic analysis typified by cases such as <em>Henry </em>and our own <em>McCarson v. State, 8 </em>Md.App. 20, 257 A.2d 471 (1969) has, in closely analogous situations, been superseded by a more sophisticated and semantically more finely tuned analysis exemplified by the Court of Appeals opinion in <em>Lightfoot v. State, </em>278 Md. 231, 360 A.2d 426 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\n<em>The Cases at Hand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">In each of the two juvenile delinquency adjudications in this consolidated appeal, the key issue is exactly the same. It is not at all fact-specific, but is presented to us as an abstract legal question in two appellate briefs that are essentially <em>verbatim </em>copies of each other. Consolidation is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">At an adjudicatory hearing before Judge Martin P. Welch in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the appellant Lakeysha P. was found to have committed the delinquent acts of Theft of a Motor Vehicle and the Unauthorized Use of that same Vehicle\u2014counts one and three, respectively, of the juvenile, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>multi-count petition filed against her. At the subsequent disposition hearing, Lakeysha was found to be a delinquent child. She was placed on probation for an indefinite period. Judge Welch indicated that he was merging the \u201clesser\u201d offense of Unauthorized Use into the \u201cgreater\u201d offense of Theft. Notwithstanding having merged the finding on the Unauthorized Use count, the judge then dismissed the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">It was also at an adjudicatory hearing before Judge Welch that the appellant Dontanyon T. was found to have committed the delinquent acts of Theft of a Motor Vehicle and the Unauthorized Use of that same Vehicle. It was at a subsequent disposition hearing before Judge Paul A. Smith that Dontanyon was found to be a delinquent child. He was placed on probation for one year. Judge Smith ordered restitution in the amount of $800 on the Theft count and opined that the Unauthorized Use count had merged into the Theft count.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\n<em>The Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Both appellants contend that their judgments of delinquency, based on findings that they had committed automobile Thefts, were fatally flawed because such findings were inconsistent with the companion findings that they had been guilty of the Unauthorized Use of the automobiles in question. The argument is that if they only intended to take the cars temporarily, findings they claim to be implicit in the Unauthorized Use convictions, they could not, <em>ipso facto, </em>have intended to take the cars permanently (or quasi-permanently), which would preclude Theft convictions. There is a surface appeal to such an argument, but it is fallacious.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The argument, we note, is not a complaint about multiple punishment, and <em>In re Montrail M., </em>325 Md. 527, 535, 601 A.2d 1102, 1106 (1992) (holding that a failure to merge two counts is not reversible error where only one penalty is imposed) is not apposite. The argument, rather, is that inconsistent verdicts of Theft and Unauthorized Use cannot stand, quite aside from any concern about multiple punishment. Nor is <em>State v. Anderson, </em>320 Md. 17, 30, 575 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>1227, 1233 (1990), apposite (where an apparent inconsistency in verdicts was explained away and shown not to have been an inconsistency at all).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">This contention poses squarely the question of whether the crime of Unauthorized Use of an Automobile is logically inconsistent with' the Theft (or larceny) of that automobile or is simply a closely related crime with a lesser included <em>mens rea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\n<em>What Did the Legislature of 1880 Intend?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The specimen on the dissecting table is the <em>mens rea </em>of Unauthorized Use. The crime itself is now codified as Md. Ann.Code, art. 27, \u00a7 349 (1993). The statute creating the crime was ch. 164 of the Acts of 1880. It was a companion provision to the Maryland \u201chorse stealing\u201d statute, which had been on the books since 1744 and which created a special penalty for the common law larceny of horses and other related chattels. As a mere sub-variety of common law Larceny, dealing with certain specific chattels, the crime of horse stealing required proof of an <em>animus furandi </em>or intent permanently to deprive the owner of the horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The newly created crime of Unauthorized Use was not a crime recognized at the common law and the 1880 statute had, therefore, to spell out all of its required elements. The essential difference between traditional larceny and the newly enacted crime of Unauthorized Use was that the latter did not require proof of an <em>animus furandi </em>nor of any other specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The question before us is whether the Legislature simply eliminated the requirement of a specific intent to deprive the owner of the chattel permanently\u2014a mere dropping of an element\u2014or whether it intended to create a substitute mental element of an affirmative intent to deprive the owner of the use of the chattel <em>temporarily. </em>Some latter-day champions of the \u201ctemporary\u201d position maintain that the crime requires affirmative proof of an intent to deprive that is: 1) temporary in duration, 2) nothing but temporary, and 3) proved to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>temporary beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cTemporary\u201d to them is not something that is merely \u201cless than permanent;\u201d it is the very opposite of \u201cpermanent.\u201d The indecisive thief, therefore, who has not yet decided whether to keep the horse (or the car) either temporarily or permanently would presumably be guilty of nothing. That is the unavoidable logical consequence of making an affirmative element out of an intended temporary deprivation. That, however, cannot be the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\n<em>Dealing With Horse Thieves</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">As we begin to probe legislative intent, much can be deduced about the legislators\u2019 collective purpose in 1880 by looking at the older law that the new Unauthorized Use statute was fashioned to complement. <em>Wright v. Sas, </em>187 Md. 507, 510, 50 A.2d 809 (1947), provides an excellent history of the horse-stealing statute; <em>see also In re Wallace W., </em>333 Md. 186, 191, 634 A.2d 53, 56 (1993); <em>Robinson v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 451, 456, 302 A.2d 659, 662 (1973). The <em>Wright </em>opinion points out how at early English law \u201chorse stealing had been punished more severely than other cases of larceny.\u201d 187 Md. at 510, 50 A.2d 809. A series of English statutes in 1547, 1549, and 1589, <em>see </em>1 Edw. 6, ch. 13; 2 &amp; 3 Edw. 6, ch. 33; 31 Eliz., ch. 12, had removed the benefit of clergy from horse thieves, whether they were principals or accessories before or after the fact, thereby making the stealing of a horse a capital offense. The Maryland Colonial Assembly of 1744 replicated the English penalty provision, making it punishable by death to \u201csteal any horse or horses, mare or mares, gelding or geldings, colt or colts.\u201d 1744 Md.Laws, ch. 20 \u00a7 1. Ch. 20 was entitled \u201cAn Act for Punishment of Horse Stealers and Other Offenders.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Following American independence, ch. 61 of the Acts of 1799 amended the 1744 statute modestly by eliminating the plural references and proscribing simply the stealing of \u201cany horse, mare, gelding, or colt\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and then adding to the list the entries, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\u201cjack,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> jenny,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or mule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201d 1799 McLLaws, ch. 61. By ch. 38, \u00a7 6 of the Acts of 1809, Maryland\u2019s first attempt to codify its criminal law, the penalty for violating the horse-stealing statute was reduced to one of not less than two nor more than fourteen years in the penitentiary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 1809 Md.Laws, ch. 38 \u00a7 6. It also eliminated the unnecessarily particularized references to \u201cjack\u201d and \u201cjenny\u201d and substituted the gender-neutral term \u201cass.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That was the \u201chorse stealing\u201d statute, unchanged after 1809, that was on the books in 1880, <em>see </em>Md.Code art. 30, \u00a7 68 (1860), when the Legislature chose to supplement it or complement it with an immediately succeeding section in the criminal code.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\n<em>The Birth of Unauthorized Use</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The Unauthorized Use statute was enacted by ch. 164 of the Acts of 1880. The best way to determine what a law means is to see what it says and what it does not say; the most revealing insight into legislative intent is to look at the words the legislators used. There is little need, as many opinions have done, to look at one-sentence characterizations of the 1880 law made seventy or eighty years after the fact, most of them no more than repetitions of an earlier one-sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>characterization, when one can readily look at the 1880 law itself.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">As we now do just that, we reiterate that our narrow focus is on the single question of whether the 1880 law merely eliminated the mental element of an intended permanent deprivation or substituted for it the mental element that there be an affirmatively intended temporary deprivation. Post-1880 amendments to the Unauthorized Use statute have, incidentally, not remotely affected the <em>mens rea </em>of the crime and it may not be necessary to look beyond the original statute itself. The 1880 law began by routinely reciting the persons covered by it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">ANY PERSON OR PERSONS, THEIR AIDERS OR ABETTORS, WHO SHALL ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">1880 Md.Laws, ch. 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">It then went on to set out two almost indistinguishable sets of circumstances in which the unlawful caption and asportation might occur. Sandwiched between them was the list of specific chattels covered by the law. The new crime first listed all of those special chattels then covered by the horse stealing statute, to wit, horses, mares, colts, geldings, mules, and asses, but then added 1) four varieties of other livestock and 2) four varieties of transportative conveyances plus a miscellaneous catch-all phrase.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The law expressly specified its coverage of the following chattels:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>... ANY HORSE, MARE, COLT GELDING, MULE, ASS, SHEEP, HOG, OX, OR COW, OR ANY CARRIAGE, WAGON, BUGGY, CART, OR ANY OTHER VEHICLE OR PROPERTY WHATSOEVER ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The arguably redundant geographic settings for the unlawful taking and carrying away of certain chattels first prohibits those unlawful acts from the premises of another and then prohibits them from any place whatsoever. <em>See Thomas v. State, </em>277 Md. 257, 269, 353 A.2d 240, 248 (1976). The first possible situs of the crime is from premises:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">... WHO SHALL ENTER, OR BEING UPON THE PREMISES OF ANY OTHER PERSON, BODY CORPORATE OR POLITIC IN THIS STATE, AND SHALL AGAINST THE WILL AND CONSENT OF SAID PERSON OR PERSONS, BODY CORPORATE OR POLITIC, OR THEIR AGENTS, WILFULLY TAKE AND CARRY AWAY ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">1880 Md.Laws, ch. 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">The second venue for unlawful caption and asportation (perhaps inadvertently omitting the adverb \u201cwilfully\u201d) is from \u201cwhatsoever place,\u201d a situs presumably broad enough to have embraced the first:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">... OR TAKE AND CARRY AWAY OUT OF THE CUSTODY, OR USE OF ANY PERSON OR PERSONS, BODY CORPORATE OR POLITIC, OR THEIR AGENTS, ANY OF THE ABOVE ENUMERATED PROPERTY AT WHATSOEVER PLACE THE SAME BE FOUND ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayo\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">At that point in the statute, the crime of Unauthorized Use is completely defined. All of its required elements are expressly set out. As a \u201cjunior varsity\u201d version of larceny law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>generally or of horse-stealing law specifically, the new crime includes all of the elements of the older crimes save one. The express elements are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">1. AN UNLAWFUL TAKING;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">2. AN UNLAWFUL CARRYING AWAY;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">3. OF CERTAIN DESIGNATED PERSONAL PROPERTY;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">4. OF ANOTHER.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Significantly, the new crime does not mention any specific <em>mens rea </em>or particular intent element at all. There is no larcenous <em>animus furandi; </em>neither is there any lesser or \u201cjunior varsity\u201d version thereof. The specific intent element has simply been eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">The crime having been fully defined, the statute then proceeded to set out the sanctions. A person convicted of the crime, as thus described, was: 1) deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, 2) obligated to restore the property, 3) subject to a fine, and 4) subject to imprisonment. As a crime without the <em>animus furandi </em>of the horse-stealing statute, it only carried a prison term of between one and six months<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> rather than a term of between two and fourteen years. The penalty provisions of the 1880 law were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-11\">... SHALL, UPON CONVICTION THEREOF IN ANY OF THE COURTS OF THIS STATE HAVING CRIMINAL JURISDICTION, BE ADJUDGED GUILTY OF A MISDEMEANOR, AND SHALL RESTORE THE PROPERTY SO TAKEN AND CARRIED AWAY, AND BE FINED NOT LESS THAN FIVE NOR MORE THAN TWENTY DOLLARS, OR BE IMPRISONED IN THE CITY OR COUNTY JAIL NOT LESS THAN ONE NOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS, OR BE BOTH FINED <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>AND IMPRISONED AS AFORESAID, IN THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\"><em>Id. </em>Then following the sanction-related verbal phrases \u201cshall ... be adjudged,\u201d \u201cshall restore,\u201d \u201c[shall] be fined,\u201d and \u201c[shall] be imprisoned,\u201d came the modifying (by way of being explanatory) clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">... <em>ALTHOUGH </em>IT MAY APPEAR FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT <em>SUCH PERSON </em>OR PERSONS, THEIR AIDERS AND ABETTORS, <em>TOOK </em>AND CARRIED AWAY <em>THE PROPERTY, </em>OR ANY PORTION OF THE SAME ENUMERATED IN THIS SECTION, FOR THEIR OR HIS PRESENT USE, AND <em>NOT WITH THE INTENT OF APPROPRIATING OR CONVERTING THE SAME.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-7\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">The transparent purpose of that final proviso was to make explicit what was already implicit, to wit, that the crime of Unauthorized Use did not include any element of an <em>animus furandi. </em>The modifying clause was not part of the setting out of the affirmative elements of the offense. It simply confirmed that the sanctions may be imposed on a violator even though the evidence may show that he did not possess an <em>animus jurandi. </em>Thus, an intent to deprive temporarily may be a sufficient condition, but it is not a necessary condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Significantly for present purposes, the word \u201ctemporary\u201d never appeared anywhere in the statute. Indeed, neither the word \u201ctemporary\u201d nor the notion of an affirmative intent to deprive temporarily would appear for another 83 years, and even then only in passing references in the case law. Later in this opinion, we shall discuss both the latter-day gloss on the 1880 statute and the common semantic error of subconsciously transforming a purely negative silence with respect to an element into an affirmative statement of the opposite of that element.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">By vivid contrast with the silence of 1880, the Legislature knew full well how to use the word \u201ctemporary\u201d or \u201ctemporarily\u201d when it intended to establish such an element. By ch. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>1007 of the Acts of 1943, it enacted what was then codified as Art. 66y\u00e9, \u00a7 154 under the subtitle \u201cOperation of Vehicles Upon Highways\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">Any person who drives a vehicle, not his own, without the consent of the owner thereof, and <em>with intent temporarily to deprive </em>said owner of his possession of such vehicle, <em>without intent to steal </em>the same, is guilty of a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuJ\">1943 Md.Laws, ch. 1007 (Emphasis supplied.) That was the traffic-related statute that <em>Wright </em>went to great lengths to contrast with the Unauthorized Use statute now before us, holding that the former differed in many significant regards from the latter and did not, therefore, repeal it by implication. <em>Wright, </em>187 Md. at 510-11, 50 A.2d at 810; <em>see also Thomas v. State, </em>277 Md. at 269, 353 A.2d at 248 (1976). Unlike that statute, now codified as Md.Code Ann., Transp. \u00a7 14-102(a), the Unauthorized Use statute <em>never </em>employed language such as \u201cwith intent temporarily to deprive\u201d or \u201cwithout intent to steal the same.\u201d It specified no particular intent requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\n<em>The Legislative Intent of 1880:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\n<em>The Probable Purpose of the Complementary Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Another insight into the legislative intent of 1880 may be had by looking at the probable reason for the enactment of the Unauthorized Use statute. The discovery of that probable purpose can be found in significant part in the inextricable linkage between the Unauthorized Use statute and the preexisting horse-stealing statute. They were complementary provisions in the various criminal codes from the moment of the birth of the Unauthorized Use statute in 1880, to the moment of the death of the horse-stealing statute in 1978. 1978 Md.Laws, ch. 849 (repealing Md.Ann.Code Art. 27, \u00a7 348). By then, it was designated as a provision dealing with \u201cLarceny\u2014 Horses or Vehicles\u201d and merged with the newly enacted Consolidated Theft Statute, Md.Ann.Code Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 340-343 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">Horse stealing and Unauthorized Use were, respectively, \u00a7\u00a7 164 and 165 of the Code of 1888; \u00a7\u00a7 269 and 270 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Code of 1904; \u00a7\u00a7 326 and 327 of the Code of 1924; \u00a7\u00a7 396 and 397 of the Code of 1939; \u00a7\u00a7 414 and 415 of the Code of 1951; and finally, \u00a7\u00a7 348 and 349 of the Annotated Code of 1957. Indeed, the Acts of 1918 amended both criminal provisions at the same time by adding to their respective lists of covered chattels \u201cmotor vehicles as defined in the laws of this State relating to such.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 1918 Md.Laws, ch. 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The almost perspicuous purpose of the Unauthorized Use statute in 1880 was to alleviate problems of proof caused by the <em>animus furandi </em>element in the larceny law. The penalty for a violation of the law dealing with the larceny of horses, etc. was harsh. In marginal cases, where judges or juries may have been loathe to subject a defendant to so harsh a penalty, the easiest way to avoid the imposition of such a sanction would have been to confess a failure of persuasion with respect to the <em>mens rea </em>of larceny. It was easy for the State to prove the mere physical elements or <em>actus </em>reus\u2014the unlawful taking and carrying away by the defendant of one of the designated chattels. Proof of intent to deprive permanently, on the other hand, was far more speculative in nature and gave a fact finder, wishing to mitigate, a convenient avenue to mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Even with <em>mens rea </em>mitigated, however, one who unlawfully took the designated chattels was nonetheless deserving of some punishment, regardless of his intent with respect to the duration of the deprivation. The Unauthorized Use statute plugged that loophole in the law. It applied, and still applies, to no less than four closely-related situations: 1) where there is a clearly established intent to deprive only temporarily; 2) where there is simply a failure of persuasion as to the intent to deprive permanently; 3) where the culprit has not, at the moment of the taking, yet decided whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>intended deprivation is to be permanent or temporary; and 4) where there is no evidence at all as to the duration of the intended deprivation. The solution to all four problems was not to burden the crime of Unauthorized Use with any special <em>mens rea </em>with respect to the duration of the intended deprivation. The law, therefore, was deliberately silent on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In <em>Robinson v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 451, 456, 302 A.2d 659, 662 (1973), we opined as to the purpose of the 1880 legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am_\">The present Unauthorized Use shoot branched off from the parent stem in 1880. <em>It filled the gap sometimes left by the absence in the unlawful taker of an animus furandi </em>.... The \u201cUnauthorized Use Statute\u201d is similar to its senior counterpart in all respects except that <em>there is no element of \u201can intent permanently to deprive the possessor of the item taken.\u201d </em>(Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-6\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <em>See also Shope v.

Many of the so-called unauthorized use statutes around the country were products of the 1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s and are, indeed, anti-joyriding statutes. As the Automotive Age came into full bloom, joyriding emerged as a significant problem. <em>See, e.g., </em>3 Francis Wharton, Criminal Law <em>&amp; </em>Procedure \u00a7 363 at 334 (14th ed. 1980), (\u201c[B]y statute in many jurisdictions, the mere unauthorized use of a motor vehicle\u2014sometimes called \u201cjoyriding\u201d\u2014has been made a crime\u201d); W. LaFave &amp; A. Scour, 2 Substantive Criminal Law, \u00a7 8.5(b) at 362 (1986), (\u201cA large number of states have singled out the motor vehicle for special treatment, making it a crime (generally called \u2018joyriding,\u2019 a crime somewhat less serious than larceny) to take such a vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>with intent to use it and return it.\u201d); B. Finberg, Annotation, <em>Automobiles: Elements of Offense Defined in \u201cJoyriding\u201d Statutes, </em>9 A.L.R.3d 633, 640 (1966); <em>see </em>Model Penal Code \u00a7 223.9 Comment, 270-71, entitled \u201cUnauthorized Use of Automobiles and Other Vehicles,\u201d which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">Nearly all states have legislation penalizing unauthorized taking, use, or operation of motor vehicles. These laws are designed to reach temporary dispossession. The typical situation dealt with is the \u201cjoyride,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the taking of another\u2019s automobile without his permission, not for the purpose of keeping it but merely to drive it briefly. The offense is typically committed by young people, and the car is generally recovered undamaged. Such behavior would not amount to larceny, which, as traditionally defined, requires proof that the actor intended to deprive the owner permanently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-6\"><em>Id. </em>(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">R. Perkins &amp; R. Boyce, Criminal Law 333-34 (3d ed. 1982), gives perhaps the best summation of the joyriding problem and the law\u2019s response thereto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">The social problem back of this legislation is well known. When the automobile began to appear and was limited to the possession of a few of the more fortunate members of the community, many persons who ordinarily respected the property rights of others, yielded to the temptation to drive one of these new contrivances without the consent of the owner. This became so common that the term \u201cjoyrider\u201d was coined to refer to the person who indulged in such unpermitted use of another\u2019s car....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">It was when \u201cjoyriding\u201d was at its height that most of the legislature enactments providing a penalty therefor were passed and the mere prevalence of this type of wilful trespass is sufficient to explain the creation of this statutory crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">Where the actual words of a particular statute permit, a plausible argument can be made that an anti-joyriding stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ute\u2014a product of the 1940\u2019s or 1950\u2019s dealing exclusively with automobiles\u2014is aimed narrowly at a circumstance in which the intended deprivation of the automobile is unequivocally temporary, when a teenager unlawfully takes someone\u2019s automobile on a lark for the clear purpose of riding around only for a few hours or only for the evening before returning it or abandoning it in some public place.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The only Maryland law that is a candidate for inclusion in the \u201canti-joyriding\u201d category, however, is the law enacted by ch. 1007 of the Acts of 1943 and now codified as \u00a7 14-102(a) of the Transportation Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\"><em>Driving vehicle without consent of </em>owner.\u2014A person may not drive any vehicle without the consent of its owner and <em>with intent to deprive the owner temporarily </em>of his possession of the vehicle, <em>even if without intent to steal it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abq\">Md.Code Ann., Transp. \u00a7 14-102(a) (Emphasis supplied.) The maximum penalty for a violation of that statute is a fine of not more than $500 or imprisonment for not more than two months or both. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 27-101(c); <em>Thomas, </em>277 Md. at 269, 353 A.2d at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The Maryland Unauthorized Use statute of 1880, now codified as Art. 27, \u00a7 349, was, from its birth, a far different creature. <em>Thomas, </em>277 Md. at 270, 353 A.2d at 248; <em>Wright, </em>187 Md. at 513, 50 A.2d at 811. It was on the books before the automobile itself was invented, let alone before the forbidden pleasures of joyriding in automobiles came into vogue. The Maryland law had, indeed, been part of the criminal law for 38 years before the phrase \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d was even appended to its lengthy list of endangered chattels.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">We are unaware, moreover, of any special social problem in the years immediately proceeding 1880 of persons\u2019 going joyriding on another\u2019s \u201chorse, mare, colt, gelding, mule, etc.\u201d One might, to be sure, unlawfully \u201cborrow\u201d a horse just to ride it, a cow just to milk it, or a sheep just to shear it; it is hard to imagine, however, why one would ever harbor an intent to deprive another temporarily of his hog. Although there is a decidedly revisionist tendency to look on the crime of Unau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>thorized Use as an anti-joyriding law, concerned primarily with motor vehicles, manifestly that was not the world view of the Maryland Legislature in 1880.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\n<em>The Weight of Authority:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\n<em>A Lesser Included Offense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Even in the context of anti-joyriding statutes\u2014frequently employing such phrases as \u201ctaking or using temporarily\u201d and \u201cwithout intent to steal,\u201d which the Maryland Unauthorized Use law does not\u2014the heavy weight of authority of the case law and the academic commentary alike is that even an anti-joyriding statute is a lesser included offense within the greater, inclusive offense of automobile larceny or automobile theft. Perkins &amp; Boyce, <em>supra, </em>at 384, observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">At the present time there is some tendency to reduce the grade of the offense and extend it to include the unauthorized temporary use of any vehicle. <em>This statutory crime, </em>whether called \u201clarceny\u201d or not, <em>is in effect an \u201cincluded offense. \u201d It has all of the elements of larceny except the intent to steal, </em>and is limited to a small portion of the general subject matter of larceny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-9\"><em>Id. </em>(Footnote omitted.) (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The Iowa anti-joyriding statute did not go on the books until 1978. Although it explicitly qualifies the unlawful taking with the words \u201cbut without the intent to permanently deprive the owner thereof,\u201d it goes on to provide that it is nonetheless a lesser included offense of theft. The Iowa Criminal Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-11\">Any person who shall take possession or control of any railroad vehicle, or any self-propelled vehicle, aircraft, or motor boat, the property of another, without the consent of the owner of such, <em>but without the intent to permanently deprive the oumer thereof, </em>shall be guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor. <em>A violation of this section may be proved as </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number><em>a lesser included offense on an indictment or information charging theft.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Iowa Code \u00a7 714.7 (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In <em>State v. Eyle, </em>236 Or. 199, 388 P.2d 110 (1963), the Oregon Supreme Court was dealing with what it described as the \u201coffense commonly referred to as \u2018joy-riding.\u2019 \u201d 388 P.2d at 111. The Oregon statute expressly applied to \u201c[ejvery person who takes or uses without authority any vehicle <em>without intent to steal it.\u201d Id. </em>(quoting Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 164.670) (Emphasis supplied.) Following his conviction for joyriding, the appellant there lodged two complaints. He first contended that the State had failed to prove the <em>mens rea </em>of his being \u201cwithout intent to steal.\u201d The Oregon court held squarely that, despite its mention in the statute, that negative notion was not an affirmative element of the crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">By employing the words \u201cwithout intent to steal,\u201d the legislature meant to clearly distinguish the crime of \u201cjoyriding\u201d from the greater crime of larceny and provide a specific penalty therefor. <em>The words were not included so as to constitute an additional element for the state to prove.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">We likewise hold that <em>the phrase \u201cwithout intent to steal\u201d is not part of the definition of the crime </em>of using a vehicle without authority <em>and need not be proved.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 111 (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">The appellant\u2019s second argument was that he should not have been found guilty of the lesser crime because the evidence established that he actually intended to steal the automobile. The Supreme Court responded that even if he was guilty of a greater offense, that did not relieve him of guilt for the lesser included offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">It is next contended that the evidence indicates that the crime committed was larceny rather than \u201cjoy-riding\u201d since the defendant did, in fact, intend to steal the automobile. Though this may well be true, defendant cannot complain of the conviction for the lesser offense. <em>The state may elect to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number><em>obtain a conviction for the lesser or included offense even though the accused is guilty of the greater offense.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">It is thus clear that the fact <em>that the defendant might have been guilty of the greater crime of larceny is no defense </em>to his conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 111-12 (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion was clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">Thus the \u201cjoy-riding\u201d statute stands as an \u201cincluded offense\u201d of larceny, having all the elements of larceny except the intent to steal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">388 P.2d at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">In <em>Stewart v. State, </em>187 So.2d 358 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1966), the issue was whether the Florida Unauthorized Use law was a lesser included offense within the crime of automobile larceny. Like the Maryland law, the Florida law covered broadly the unlawful taking of any boat, vehicle, horse, ass, mule, ox, or any other draught animal. It explicitly prohibited \u201c[tjaking or <em>using temporarily </em>any vehicle or animal of another without authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360 (quoting FlaFtatAnn. 811.21) (Emphasis supplied.) The statute itself expressly provided, moreover, that \u201c[njothing in this section shall be construed so as to apply to any case where the taking of the property of another is with intent to steal the same.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">Notwithstanding that verbiage, the Florida District Court of Appeal held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-12\">The crime declared in the just-quoted statute seems to us to be a lesser included offense within the crime of larceny of automobiles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 361. It elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-14\">[Wje find no difficulty in reaching the view that the misdemeanor of using a vehicle without the owner\u2019s consent <em>is a lesser included offense </em>within the crime alleged in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>amended information\u2014the felony of unlawfully taking, stealing, and carrying away a certain motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 362 (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In <em>Spencer v. State, </em>501 S.W.2d 799 (Tenn.1973), the Supreme Court of Tennessee came to a similar conclusion with respect to unauthorized use being a lesser included offense within larceny:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">Initially, this Court must determine whether \u201cjoyriding\u201d is a lesser included offense of larceny. This issue is one of first impression to Tennessee ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">Section 59-504 [Tenn.Code Ann.], describes the offense commonly referred to as \u201cjoyriding.\u201d The statute is designed to condemn the acts of a person who takes another\u2019s vehicle unlawfully, but without the intent to deprive the owner of its use permanently. However, the taking of a vehicle with the intent to steal or permanently deprive the owner of its use is prohibited, and is larceny. From a careful examination of the elements of both crimes, <em>it is clear that the only difference in the two is that in \u201cjoyriding\u201d there is not the element of intent to steal. Thus, we hold that the \u201cjoyriding\u201d statute stands as an included offense of larceny.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 800 (Citations omitted.) (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">In <em>State v. Cornish, </em>568 P.2d 360 (Utah 1977), the Supreme Court of Utah was dealing with an anti-joyriding statute that expressly provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">Any person who drives a vehicle, not his own, without the consent of the owner thereof and <em>with intent temporarily to deprive </em>said owner of his possession of such vehicle, <em>without intent to steal the same </em>is guilty of a misdemeanor ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 361. (quoting Utah Code Ann. 41-1-109) (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">That was a case where the fact-finding trial judge expressed the view that \u201cunder the evidence, he was uncertain of the intent of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361. Under the circumstances, the State had failed to prove beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>doubt, if it was required to do so, either 1) that the defendant had the \u201cintent temporarily to deprive\u201d or 2) that he was \u201cwithout intent to steal.\u201d The Utah Supreme Court had no difficulty rejecting the defense contention that these were fatal flaws in the State\u2019s case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">The only fact the state is not required to establish for joy riding, which is required for theft, is the intent to deprive permanently, or for such an extended period of time that a substantial portion of the economic value is lost.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">The phrases \u201cintent temporarily to deprive\u201d and \u201cwithout intent to steal\u201d do not indicate a legislative intention that an element of the crime, which must be established to sustain conviction, is the time element. <em>The state must establish an intent to deprive, but the negative \u201cwithout intent to steal\u201d viz., not permanently but temporarily, is not an element for the state to plead and prove.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-7\"><em>Id. </em>(Citation omitted.) (Emphasis supplied.) That Court went on to explain the obvious function of such phraseology in an anti-joyriding or unauthorized use statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">It is not incumbent upon the prosecution to prove the quantum of the intent, for <em>the terms \u201ctemporarily to deprive\u201d and \u201cwithout intent to steal\u201d express no more than a legislative intention to distinguish this crime from the greater offense of theft, </em>which requires proof of an additional element.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">568 P.2d at 362 (Citation omitted.) (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">The opinion, moreover, made it clear that a function of a crime with a lesser intent is not only to deal with those situations where a lesser intent is affirmatively proved but also with those situations where there is simply a failure of proof as to the greater intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\"><em>If the trier of fact </em>is convinced there was an unauthorized use of the vehicle, with an intent to deprive the owner, but <em>is not convinced </em>beyond a reasonable doubt <em>the prosecution has sustained its burden to </em>present and <em>prove one of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>factors set forth; then defendant should be found guilty of the lesser, included offense </em>...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><em>Id. </em>(Citation omitted.) (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977), the Supreme Court of the United States was dealing with the double jeopardy implications of sequential prosecutions and convictions in the Ohio courts for 1) joyriding in an automobile and 2) the theft of that same automobile. The Supreme Court first accepted the holding of the Ohio Court of Appeals that joyriding is a lesser included offense within automobile theft:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">Every element of the crime of operating a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner is also an element of the crime of auto theft. \u201cThe difference between the crime of stealing a motor vehicle, and operating a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner is that conviction for stealing requires proof of an intent on the part of the thief to <em>permanently </em>deprive the owner of possession.\u201d [T]he crime of operating a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner is a lesser included offense of auto theft.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-9\"><em>Id., </em>432 U.S. at 163-64, 97 S.Ct. at 2224, 53 L.Ed.2d at 193. In then discussing the double jeopardy implications of that holding, the Supreme Court made it clear that joyriding and automobile theft were, for double jeopardy purposes, \u201cthe same offense,\u201d with theft being the greater and joyriding being the lesser included.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">Applying the <em>Blockburger </em>test, we agree with the Ohio Court of Appeals that joyriding and auto theft, as defined by that court, constitute \u201cthe same statutory offense\u201d within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause. As is invariably true of a greater and lesser included offense, <em>the lesser offense\u2014joyriding\u2014requires no proof beyond that which is required for conviction of the greater\u2014auto theft,. </em>The greater offense is therefore by definition the \u201csame\u201d for purposes of double jeopardy as any lesser offense included in it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>432 U.S. at 168, 97 S.Ct. at 2226-27, 58 L.Ed.2d at 195-96 (Citation omitted.)

Only one interpretation of the 1880 statute seems plausible. Based on 1) the explicit and limited elements the 1880 law sets out, 2) its overwhelmingly probable purpose, particularly in view of its close relationship with the horse-stealing statute, 3) its provenance as a broad 19th Century law and not as a 20th Century anti-joyriding measure, 4) the weight of authority around the country in dealing with similarly related crimes, and 5) the inherent logic of coordinating closely-related <em>mentes reae </em>into an integrated whole, it is clear to us that the Legislature in 1880 never intended to establish, as an affirmative mental element, a requirement that the intended deprivation be temporary in nature. It simply intended to eliminate the <em>animus furandi </em>of an intended permanent deprivation necessary for a larceny conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">If we were to conclude that the 1880 law intended to establish 1) one crime (horse stealing or auto theft) requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt of an intended <em>permanent </em>deprivation and 2) a separate crime with a contrary <em>mens rea </em>requiring proof beyond a reasonable. doubt of an intended <em>temporary </em>deprivation, we would be attributing to that Legislature a design to create an eye in the hurricane of culpability, wherein an unlawful appropriator of horses and automobiles might stand completely unscathed. All sorts of culprits might slip between those very wide cracks. It is our belief that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Legislature intended for the related crimes cleanly to abut, with no troublesome crevices between.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">It follows that, when the Legislature enacted the Unauthorized Use law, it simply eliminated the <em>animus furandi </em>of larceny so that it could handle not only one but a number of circumstances in which the <em>mens rea </em>of the culprit might somehow be in question: 1) the situation in which it is clearly established that the intended deprivation was only temporary, 2) the situation in which the intended deprivation was probably permanent but where there is a failure to carry the burden of persuasion in that regard, 3) the situation in which the fact finder is actually persuaded that the intended deprivation was still of uncertain and undetermined duration in the mind of the culprit, and 4) the situation in which there was simply no evidence at all bearing on the duration of the intended deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">To reach any other conclusion would require us to attribute to the Legislature of 1880 the absurd scheme of saying to would-be horse thieves, \u201cIf you intend to keep the horse a long time, you go to jail; if you intend to keep the horse a short time, you go to jail; but if you truly don\u2019t know how long you intend to keep the horse or if we can\u2019t figure out how long you intend to keep it, you go free.\u201d That would be an inane legislative intent that we cannot ascribe to the lawmakers of the Gilded Age. The intended <em>temporary </em>deprivation notion, as an affirmative element, just won\u2019t fly.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\n<em>The Change, If Any,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\n<em>From Larceny to Theft</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">In assessing the possible inconsistency between companion guilty verdicts, we are, of course, no longer measuring a conviction for Unauthorized Use, under Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 349, against a conviction for the Larceny of a Vehicle, under the former \u00a7 348. We are now measuring it against a conviction for the Theft of an automobile, under \u00a7 342. Does that make any difference to the present analysis? No.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>By ch. 849 of the Acts of 1978, the Maryland General Assembly repealed a number of laws dealing with common law larceny, a variety of special larcenies of special chattels, and many other larceny-related offenses. It brought them together as part of a new Consolidated Theft Statute, codified as MdAnn.Code art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 340-344. Section 341 of the new law declared that the consolidation was not intended to abolish or to modify any of the preexisting crimes but only to treat them as instances of a single more broadly defined and more efficiently prosecuted crime known as Theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Section 342 defined Theft as a crime including, along with other elements, the <em>mens rea </em>of having \u201cthe purpose of <em>depriving </em>the owner of the property.\u201d Section 340(c) provided a series of definitions for that term \u201cdeprive.\u201d The definitions embraced four situations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">\u201cDeprive\u201d means to withhold property of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">(1) Permanently; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">(2) For such a period as to appropriate a portion of its value; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">(3) With the purpose to restore it only upon payment of reward or other compensation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-10\">(4) To dispose of the property and use or deal with the property so as to make it unlikely that the owner will recover it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">MdAnn.Code art. 27, \u00a7 340(c) (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">As part of a debate that is largely academic over distinctions without differences, some argue that that series of definitions of \u201cdeprive\u201d has broadened to some extent what was once the <em>animus furandi </em>of larceny. Others argue that the series of definitions is no more than declaratory of the way the case law had broadly applied the larcenous <em>animus furandi. </em>In any event, for present purposes, the only member of the series that concerns us is the second definition of \u201cdeprive\u201d as \u201cwithholding] property of another ... [f]or such a period as to appropriate a portion of its value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>It is clear that that definition of \u201cdeprive\u201d does not embrace every unauthorized use of another\u2019s property, no matter how minimal or how brief. If that were the case, what is now the crime of Unauthorized Use would be subsumed into the consolidated crime of Theft and \u00a7 349 would be repealed by implication. When ch. 849 of the Acts of 1978, however, meticulously listed the preexisting crimes that would be subsumed and the corresponding statutes that would be repealed, \u00a7 349, dealing with \u201cUnauthorized use of livestock, boat, or vehicle,\u201d was deliberately left untouched.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The critical distinction between it and the larceny-related crimes that were subsumed into consolidated Theft is that it does not possess the special <em>mens rea </em>requirement of Larceny. Even if we were to assume that \u00a7 340(c)(2) has ratcheted downward the former <em>animus furandi </em>of Larceny so as to embrace even less \u201cpermanent\u201d intended deprivations, it still possesses more of a <em>mens rea </em>requirement than does Unauthorized Use. The utility of \u00a7 349\u2019s elimination of any special <em>mens rea </em>is that it, unlike Larceny or Theft, is available to penalize unlawful captions and asportations when the intended deprivation is less than long enough to appropriate a portion of the value of the property, where the intended deprivation is of an indeterminate quality or duration, and where the intended deprivation is simply unproved. The change from the Larceny of Horses or Vehicles to consolidated Theft has not extinguished the issue we are still called upon to address.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\n<em>83 Years Later:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\n<em>Making Something Out of Nothing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Our biggest problem, of course, is that we are not writing on a clean slate. It is not enough, however, simply to read what is on the slate. If we are to be more than automatons, we must determine, if we can, how whatever is on that slate came to be there.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">In reference to the 1880 Unauthorized Use statute, the very notion of an intended \u201ctemporary\u201d deprivation, as an affirmative element, did not appear until 83 years after the law\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>enactment. Then it inexplicably was offered as an uncritical conclusion in a single sentence in <em>Fletcher v. State, </em>231 Md. 190, 193, 189 A.2d 641 (1963) (\u201cIt is obvious that the phraseology of this statute does not cover cases involving an intent to deprive an owner of his proper permanently, as in larceny or receiving, <em>but is designed to embrace only cases involving intent to deprive the owner of his custody or use of such property temporarily, </em>without intent to steal it.\u201d) (Emphasis supplied.) That sentence was unexceptionable in its description of what the Unauthorized Use statute did <em>not </em>cover or require.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">When it made an assumption as to what the statute <em>did </em>require, however, it committed the common semantic fallacy of transforming the purely negative phenomenon of a statute\u2019s silence with respect to an element into an affirmative statement of the opposite of that element. There was no analysis and no apparent awareness that there was even a question calling for analysis. It was simply assumed\u2014as a self-evident truism\u2014that anything not required to be <em>permanent </em>is thereby automatically required to be <em>temporary.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\"><em>Fletcher </em>cited as authority both <em>Wright v. Sas, </em>187 Md. 507, 50 A.2d 809 (1947) and <em>Anello v. State, </em>201 Md. 164, 93 A.2d 71 (1952). Neither case, however, supports that conclusion. <em>Wright </em>was no authority at all for the proposition for which it was cited. It was a case wherein a <em>habeas corpus </em>petitioner, having been convicted of a \u00a7 349 (then \u00a7 397) violation, claimed that the conviction was invalid because the 1880 crime had been repealed by implication by the passage of ch. 1007 of the Acts of 1943, the anti-joyriding statute then codified as art. 66/6, \u00a7 154 (now \u00a7 14-102(a) of the Transportation Article).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\"><em>Wright </em>rejected that argument, holding that the 1943 anti-joyriding statute did not preempt the field even with respect to motor vehicles. (It obviously did not preempt the field with respect to any \u201chorse, mare, gelding, colt, mule, etc.\u201d in that it did not even purport to cover chattels other than vehicles.) Reserving the possibility that future decisions \u201cmight or might not establish other differences between the two offenses,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>Wright </em>relied on two such differences. 187 Md. at 514, 50 A.2d at 811. The first was that the 1943 Motor Vehicle statute required the actual \u201cdriving\u201d of the vehicle, <em>id. </em>at 514, 50 A.2d at 811, whereas the 1880 Unauthorized Use statute could be satisfied by other modalities, <em>see id. </em>at 513, 50 A.2d at 811. <em>Wright </em>stated that \u201c[o]n the other hand, pushing ... or towing an automobile would be \u2018take and carry away\u2019 under Section 397.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The second significant difference is that the 1880 law, by its very terms, requires an actual caption and asportation from present possession, which the 1943 Motor Vehicle law does not. The 1880 Unauthorized Use statute applies expressly to one \u201cwho shall ... take and carry away [one of the designated chattels].\u201d It is like common law larceny in that regard and does not embrace other unlawful appropriations that would have constituted embezzlements or larcenies after trust. \u201c[I]t includes elements similar to larceny, <em>.e.g., </em>\u2018take and carry away.\u2019 Even if it includes \u2018take and carry away out of the custody and use of any persons\u2019 other than the owner, it can hardly include unauthorized use by a bailee, <em>e.g., </em>a garage keeper of an automobile already in his \u2018custody or use.\u2019 \u201d 187 Md. at 513, 50 A.2d at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">By contrast, the 1943 law does not require that a violator \u201ctake or carry away\u201d a vehicle. Its action words are \u201cto drive a vehicle ... with intent temporarily to deprive said owner of his possession.\u201d It was with unequivocal reference to the 1943 statute, by way of contrasting it with the 1880 statute, that <em>Wright </em>observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">In any event \u201cintent ... to deprive [the] owner of his possession\u201d includes future possession and is not limited, like common law larceny, to a taking out of the owner\u2019s present possession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">187 Md. at 513, 50 A.2d at 811. <em>Wright </em>did not in any way discuss the issue of intended <em>permanent </em>deprivation versus intended <em>temporary </em>deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">The other case cited as authority by <em>Fletcher </em>was <em>Anello. </em>It also turns out to be no authority at all for the proposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>for which it was cited. The only issue in <em>Anello </em>was the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction for the Unauthorized Use of an automobile. Anello claimed that someone else was the actual thief and that when he (Anello) accepted a ride in the automobile, he had no idea that it was stolen. The primary thrust of the opinion was that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that Anello had guilty knowledge from the outset. The second thrust was that since both Larceny and Unauthorized Use may involve a continuing trespass, one can be guilty of a caption and asportation by joining a trespassory taking already in progress. 201 Md. at 167-68, 93 A.2d at 72-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">As with <em>Wright, Anello </em>was not even considering any question of intended <em>permanent </em>deprivation versus intended <em>temporary </em>deprivation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> With neither <em>Wright </em>nor <em>Anello </em>supporting the proposition for which it was cited, there was, thus, no basis whatsoever for Fletcher\u2019s creating out of thin air an affirmative element of intended <em>temporary </em>deprivation. Under close examination, <em>Fletcher </em>simply vaporizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Unlike a chain\u2019s dependence on its weakest link, however, a legal error seems to grow in strength with each repetition. Within six years, what began as a mere semantic fallacy acquired a respectable pedigree. With a citation to <em>Fletcher, </em>it appeared as <em>dicta </em>one year later in <em>Ballard v. State, </em>236 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>579, 581-82, 204 A.2d 672, 673 (1964). This Court on four occasions, although only in passing <em>dicta </em>and once only by way of a footnote, reiterated the false affirmative that the crime of Unauthorized Use requires \u201can intent to deprive the owner of his property temporarily.\u201d <em>McCarson v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 20, 21-22 n. 1, 257 A.2d 471, 472 n. 1 (1969) (a passing observation in a footnote about a merger versus inconsistency issue that had not been raised by the appellant); <em>Sizemore v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 507, 515-16, 248 A.2d 417, 422 (1968) (legal sufficiency of evidence to support conviction for automobile larceny); <em>Anderson v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 85, 88, 237 A.2d 813, 815 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 1106, 89 S.Ct. 912, 21 L.Ed.2d 801 (1969) (dealing with the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction for automobile larceny); <em>Gopshes v. State, </em>1 Md.App. 396, 398, 230 A.2d 475, 477 (1967) (dealing only with the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support the acceptance of a guilty plea to automobile larceny). On each occasion, the only authority cited was the use of the word \u201ctemporary\u201d in a single sentence by <em>Fletcher, </em>231 Md. at 193, 189 A.2d at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">With <em>McCarson, </em>however, the unsupported semantic fallacy took on a new vitality. The <em>dicta </em>in the footnote added a rhetorical flourish that became a highly quotable soundbite: \u201c[i]t is patent that an automobile cannot be taken with the intent both to steal it and not to steal it.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 8 Md.App. at 21 n. 1, 257 A.2d at 472 n. 1. With that soundbite, the groundwork was prepared for <em>Henry v. State, </em>273 Md. 131, 328 A.2d 293 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\"><em>Henry, </em>to be sure, held squarely that a conviction for Unauthorized Use did not merge into a conviction for the Larceny of an Automobile, but was, rather, inconsistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>it. The inconsistency was predicated on the <em>contrary </em>intents of the two crimes\u2014permanent versus temporary deprivation. <em>See </em>273 Md. at 135, 328 A.2d at 297. The authoritative support for the <em>Henry </em>decision was essentially three-fold. <em>Henry </em>relied first on <em>Ballard, </em>236 Md. at 581, 204 A.2d at 673, which, in turn, relied primarily on <em>Fletcher, </em>231 Md. at 193, 189 A.2d at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Although there were some other peripheral references in <em>Ballard, </em>they do not sustain its conclusion. Two of the three out-of-state opinions cited by <em>Ballard\u2014Eastway v. State, </em>189 Wis. 56, 206 N.W. 879 (1926) and <em>People v. Tellez, </em>32 Cal.App.2d 217, 89 P.2d 451 (1939)\u2014compare automobile larceny not with a law such as Maryland\u2019s 1880 Unauthorized Use crime but with express \u201canti-joyriding\u201d statutes. Those statutes prohibited the driving of a motor vehicle on a highway \u25a0without the consent of the owner, crimes such as the one spelled out by Md.Code Ann., Transp. \u00a7 14-102(a). The third out-of-state opinion, <em>People v. Ramistella, </em>306 N.Y. 379, 118 N.E.2d 566 (1954), stands for the unremarkable proposition that one cannot be convicted of violations of both a specific automobile larceny statute and also general common law larceny. <em>See id., </em>118 N.E.2d at 569. <em>Ballard\u2019s </em>support dissolves into exclusive reliance on <em>Fletcher </em>and the authoritative weight of <em>Ballard </em>is, therefore, no greater than the authoritative weight of <em>Fletcher.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The second major reliance of <em>Henry </em>is on the rhetorical flourish or soundbite from the <em>dicta </em>in the <em>McCarson </em>footnote. This, as we have discussed, is nothing more than <em>Fletcher </em>with a flourish.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">A third, and significant, authority relied on by <em>Henry </em>was the opinion of the Supreme Court of Colorado in <em>Sandoval v. People, </em>176 Colo. 414, 490 P.2d 1298 (1971). The Colorado Court, to be sure, had held squarely that its anti-joyriding statute included, as an affirmative element, the intent to deprive the owner of the automobile <em>temporarily. Id., </em>490 P.2d at 1300. The Colorado statute, however, was in stark contrast to Maryland\u2019s 1880 Unauthorized Use statute. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>was a statute dealing expressly with \u201cJoyriding\u201d and confined exclusively to automobiles. The Colorado statute, moreover, unlike the 1880 Maryland statute, explicitly spelled out the following intent provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">... for the purpose of <em>temporarily depriving the owner </em>thereof of said automobile, or of the use of the same, or for the purpose of <em>temporarily appropriating the same </em>to his own use, or of <em>temporarily making use of the same </em>...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-13-2 (1963) (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\"><em>Henry v. State </em>rests on a tripod of authority. Under scrutiny, each of the three legs of that tripod collapses. What then becomes of <em>Henry ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">\n<em>The Semantic Fallacy of the False Affirmative</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Because the 1880 statute never used any phrase such as \u201cto deprive temporarily\u201d and never established any special <em>mens rea </em>with respect to the duration of any intended deprivation, the natural question arises: \u201cHow did such statements as those found in <em>Fletcher </em>and in <em>McCarson </em>and ultimately in <em>Henry </em>ever find their way into the Maryland case law?\u201d It was simply because of the way we use language.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">It has been a recurring phenomenon in the history of the criminal law that the classic major crimes sometimes present prosecutorial problems because of a failure of proof (or sometimes even a failure of perpetration) with respect to one or another of their required elements. As part of the continuing growth of the criminal law, legislatures plugged those perceived loopholes by enacting new statutory offenses that, precisely or essentially, tracked the older crimes except that one of the classic elements was eliminated from the definition. The process was one of subtraction. In comparing the newer crime to the older, the salient difference was the purely negative phenomenon that an element had been eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">Language, however, like nature, abhors a vacuum. As commentators, academic and judicial, over the years came to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>describe the newer crimes, they fell into the easy linguistic habit of expressing a negative in positive terms. The absence of a familiar element was casually transformed into an affirmative statement of the opposite of that element. The absence of required proof of \u201cnighttime,\u201d for instance, became affirmatively described as \u201cdaytime.\u201d The absence of required proof of a \u201cpremeditated\u201d intent to kill became affirmatively described as a \u201cnon-premeditated\u201d intent to kill. The absence of required proof that a crime be consummated became affirmatively described, in attempt law, as the \u201cfailure to consummate\u201d the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">This common linguistic phenomenon is what we here designate as the semantic fallacy of the false affirmative. It was an obvious instance of this particular fallacy when the mere absence of a requirement of an intent \u201cpermanently\u201d to deprive was transformed into an affirmative intent \u201ctemporarily\u201d to deprive.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">As a rough description of one of the newer, lesser crimes, adequate enough for ordinary communication, the use of the false affirmative poses no problem. It is only when the false affirmative is unwittingly elevated to the status of a required element that our thinking goes askew. The antidote should always be to look at the literal provisions of the statute itself rather than at intermediate and sometimes flaccid characterizations of it, but the case law is not always so painstaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">One of the inevitable problems of miscasting the absence of an element as an affirmative statement of the opposite of that element is that two closely related crimes end up pointing in opposite directions and the point at which one crime should blend gently into the other becomes, instead, a doctrinal \u201cno man\u2019s land.\u201d With respect to several of these possible applications of the false affirmative, however, Maryland has successfully avoided the semantic snare.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">\n<em>A. Daytime Housebreaking Does Not Mean \u201cDaytime\u201d:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Common law burglary required that the felonious breaking and entering of the dwelling of another occur <em>in the nighttime. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>To plug an obvious loophole in the criminal law, various statutes were enacted to criminalize even non-nighttime housebreakings. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>10 Md.App. 652, 658-59, 272 A.2d 422, 425 (1971). Until all of the burglary-related laws were recodified by ch. 712 of the Acts of 1994, art. 27, \u00a7 30(b) expressly proscribed \u201c... the crime of breaking a dwelling house <em>in the daytime </em>... \u201d. (Emphasis supplied.) The question naturally arose as to whether \u201cdaytime\u201d really meant \u201cdaytime\u201d or whether it was intended to cover any situation in which there was non-proof of \u201cnighttime\u201d or, indeed, to cover \u201canytime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In <em>St. Clair v. State, </em>1 Md.App. 605, 232 A.2d 565 (1967), the defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to prove the \u201cdaytime\u201d element of daytime housebreaking because the evidence showed only that the breaking had occurred sometime in the course of a four-day period. The State could not prove either <em>daytime </em>or <em>nighttime. </em>Notwithstanding the express use of the term \u201cdaytime\u201d in the law, this Court held that daytime housebreaking \u201cwas not a different offense from common law burglary but was merely a lesser degree of the same offense\u201d and that \u201cwhen the proof fails to show the time of the offense then the burglar may be punished under the statute providing the lesser penalty.\u201d 1 Md.App. at 622, 232 A.2d at 575. \u201cDaytime\u201d was correctly construed to mean \u201canytime.\u201d <em>Id. See also Gazaille v. State, 2 </em>Md.App. 462, 464, 235 A.2d 306, 307 (1967) (\u201cSince the time of the housebreaking could not be ascertained, the appellant was charged with and convicted of the lesser included offense\u2014daytime housebreaking as opposed to common-law burglary.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In <em>Reagan v. State, 4 </em>Md.App. 590, 244 A.2d 623 (1968), the defendant challenged the adequacy of his indictment for daytime housebreaking because of its failure to charge that the offense occurred \u201cin the daytime.\u201d In rejecting the contention, Judge Orth observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">We think that the time of the offense, <em>\u201cin the daytime, </em>\u201d <em>is not an essential element of the crime, </em>and is not used in the statute to define or characterize the offense, but merely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>distinguish it from burglary which must be committed in the nighttime.... <em>As it is not necessary to prove that the offense occurred in the daytime, it is not necessary to allege that fact.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">4 Md.App. at 595-96, 244 A.2d at 626 (Emphasis supplied.); <em>see also Williams v. State, </em>100 Md.App. 468, 477, 641 A.2d 990, 994 (1994); <em>Davis v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 581, 586-87, 514 A.2d 1229, 1231 (1986), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on different grounds, </em>310 Md. 611, 530 A.2d 1223 (1987) (\u201cThe \u2018daytime\u2019 aspect of \u00a7 30(b) is not used to define or characterize the crime, but merely to distinguish it from burglary.\u201d); <em>Reagan v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 477, 479, 251 A.2d 615, 616 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Maryland thereby not only handled logically the problem that occurs when there is no proof of exactly when a breaking takes place. It also resolved the dilemma of the \u201ctwilight burglar\u201d who strikes precisely when the world hangs in equipoise between night and day, and no one can say beyond a reasonable doubt that it is one and not the other. With respect to housebreaking, Maryland dodged the bullet of the false affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">\n<em>B. Wanton Indifference Does Not Mean \u201cIndifference\u201d:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Depraved-heart murder, committed with a <em>mens rea </em>that is generally described as \u201cwanton indifference or unconcern\u201d with the consequences of one\u2019s life-endangering acts, possesses a mental element less purposefully malignant than would be a specific intent to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm. Proof of <em>indifference </em>however, does not contemplate that there must be affirmative evidence of the absence of a more malignant purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">In <em>Robinson v. State, </em>307 Md. 738, 517 A.2d 94 (1986), the defendant challenged his conviction for \u201cdepraved heart\u201d murder. The defendant had previously, before the victim died, been convicted of an assault with intent to disable that victim. The defendant argued that the earlier conviction had established a deliberate and specific <em>intent or purpose </em>to inflict disabling harm and that principles of collateral estoppel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>therefore, precluded relitigating the state of the defendant\u2019s mind so as to find the requisite \u201cindifference\u201d to the consequences. <em>Id. </em>307 Md. at 744, 517 A.2d at 97. It could plausibly be argued that one is not indifferent to that which one specifically purposes or intends. Judge Adkins quoted with approval our description, in <em>DeBettencourt v. State, </em>48 Md.App. 522, 530, 428 A.2d 479 (1981), of'\u201cdepraved heart\u201d murder as something involving \u201cwanton unconcern and indifference as to whether anyone is harmed or not.\u201d 307 Md. at 744, 517 A.2d at 97 (quoting 48 Md.App. at 530, 428 A.2d at 484). Judge Adkins then rejected the contention that 1) a desired harmful consequence and 2) an indifference to the consequences are fatally inconsistent or contrary states of mind.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">Robinson seizes upon the last sentence we have just quoted and argues that \u201cdepraved heart\u201d murder does not exist if there is a specific intent to harm. <em>See also Lindsay v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 100, 104, 258 A.2d 760, 763 (1969) (\u201cdepraved heart\u201d murder exists where, \u201cconceding that there was no actual intent to injure, an act was done or duty omitted wilfully, the natural tendency of which was to cause death or great bodily harm\u201d); R. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>at 36 (2d ed. 1969) (\u201c... even if there is no actual intent to kill or injure\u201d). <em>But these authorities say no more than that the crime may be committed absent intent to injure. They do not hold that the crime is not committed if there is an intent to injure.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">The terms \u201crecklessness\u201d or \u201cindifference,\u201d often used to define the crime, do not preclude an act of intentional injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">307 Md. at 745, 517 A.2d at 97-98 (Emphasis supplied.).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Once again, Maryland avoided the semantic trap of the false affirmative. Proof of <em>indifference </em>does not imply the affirmative disproof of something worse than indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>\n<em>C. Reckless Endangerment Need Not Negate Intended Harm:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The implications of \u201cwanton disregard or unconcern with the consequences\u201d that <em>Robinson </em>dealt with in the context of \u201cdepraved heart\u201d murder were addressed by this Court in <em>Williams v. State, </em>100 Md.App. 468, 641 A.2d 990 (1994), in the context of reckless endangerment. The question in <em>Williams </em>was whether an assault with intent to maim was inconsistent with the <em>mens rea </em>of reckless endangerment. We stated the. problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">In one sense of the words, a \u201cdisregard\u201d of and an \u201cindifference\u201d to the consequences might seem categorically to preclude or be precluded by a deliberate and purposeful effort to inflict a harmful consequence, just as surely as they might seem categorically to preclude or be precluded by a deliberate and purposeful effort to <em>avoid </em>a harmful consequence. A willful and determined malefactor, such as one who assaults with the intent to maim, cannot, it would seem, be lightly dismissed as one who is <em>merely </em>disregardful of or indifferent to his own malevolent purpose. The malevolence is arguably more significant than that. One meticulously \u25a0contriving to bring about a harmful end cannot, in one sense of the word, be characterized as <em>merely </em>reckless. Precisely such a conclusion was reached in <em>People v. Coleman, </em>131 Ill.App.3d 76, 86 Ill.Dec. 351, 475 N.E.2d 565 (1985), a case in which the Appellate Court of Illinois held that the inconsistent <em>mentes reae </em>precluded convictions for both attempted murder and reckless conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">100 Md.App. at 475, 641 A.2d at 993 (Emphasis in original) (Footnote omitted). Our holding nonetheless was clear that proof of a lesser <em>mens rea </em>such as that involved in reckless endangerment does not require affirmative disproof of a greater <em>mens rea.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">To be guilty of reckless endangerment, the defendant must be shown to have possessed <em>nothing less than </em>a reckless disregard of the consequences of his life-threatening act. He may, however, be shown to have possessed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>more blameworthy <em>mens rea, </em>such as an intent to maim, but that excess culpability will be simply surplusage as far as the reckless endangerment charge is concerned. It certainly does not operate to exculpate him of the reckless endangerment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 476-77, 641 A.2d at 994 (Emphasis in original). As one <em>mens rea </em>escalates almost imperceptibly into another, what is involved is not an inconsistency between the two mental states but a merger of one into the other:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">[T]he proof of disregard or indifference necessary for reckless endangerment does not require disproof that a particular consequence was specifically intended or affirmatively desired. <em>A finding of disregard or indifference may imply nothing more than the failure of proof of specific intent. </em>Concern for a specifically intended consequence does not belie an unconcern for such a consequence but, all other conditions for merger being satisfied, simply subsumes it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar2\">100 Md.App. at 478, 641 A.2d at 994-95 (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Again, Maryland avoided the semantic siren call of the false affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">\n<em>D. The General Linguistic Problem:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">In rejecting in <em>Williams </em>the contention that the <em>mentes reae </em>there before us were inconsistent, we analyzed generally the linguistic problems that may occur when dealing with an escalating <em>mens rea:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">As we move up the continuum of escalating blameworthiness from negligence to gross negligence to recklessness to specific intent and beyond, at each level our descriptive concentration is on the last enhancing or incremental element that may bring us up to that level. The definitional focus at each step is on the additional element that may <em>raise </em>the level of blameworthiness to that level, not on what will hold it down to that level. Because the progression is upward, we employ language, in our statute law and in our case law, so as to contrast the level of blameworthiness in issue with those levels below it, not with those above it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>When, therefore, we describe the <em>mens rea </em>of reckless endangerment in terms such as \u201cthe wanton disregard of life-threatening consequences,\u201d what the law means is that <em>nothing less than </em>that <em>mens rea </em>will suffice. It does not mean that <em>neither less than nor more than </em>that <em>mens rea </em>will suffice. We are describing the minimum content for a finding of guilt in a particular degree, not the maximum content.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">100 Md.App. at 475-76, 641 A.2d at 993 (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Thus, it is always a defense to prove that one is less culpable than charged. It is never, however, a defense to prove that one is more culpable than charged. It is no defense to second-degree murder to prove that the killing was premeditated. It is no defense to involuntary manslaughter to prove that the killing was voluntary. The State is never called upon to disprove the greater guilt. Proof of guilt moves upward, not downward. Where there is doubt as to the appropriate level of guilt, the defendant receives the benefit of the doubt and is convicted only at the lower level, but a defendant is never entitled to total exculpation because there is ambiguity as to the level of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\n<em>Exposing the Semantic Fallacy:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\n<em>Lightfoot v. State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">In one significant area of the criminal law, by way of contrast, Maryland failed to dodge the semantic bullet. With the original Pleas of the Crown, the early common law punished only consummated crimes. By the late 15th Century, however, the Court of Star Chamber recognized the necessity to punish the inchoate crime of a criminal attempt. Since that time, one is guilty of the crime of attempt if one harbors a specific intent to commit a crime and then takes a significant step toward its consummation. A simple <em>mens rea </em>and a simple <em>actus reus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">In the minds and pens of academic commentators and jurists alike, however, it did not take long for the semantic fallacy of the false affirmative to insinuate its way into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>general description and layman\u2019s definition of attempt. Because its overarching utility was to proscribe criminal behavior that fell short of consummation, it was inevitable that an attempt would be conceived of by many as a crime that occurred only when there was <em>a failure of consummation. </em>The mere absence of the element of consummation was semantically transmuted into the opposite of that element.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><em>Wiley v. State, </em>237 Md. 560, 207 A.2d 478 (1965), with the support of reputable academic authorities, defined the crime of attempt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">An attempt to commit a crime consists of an intent to commit it, the performance of some act towards its commission, <em>and failure to consummate its commission. </em>22 C.J.S. <em>Criminal Law </em>Sec. 75(1), p. 228, and Hochheimer, <em>Crimes and Criminal Procedure </em>(2d Ed.), See, 266, p. 297.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">237 Md. at 563-64, 207 A.2d at 480. (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Franczkowski v. State, </em>239 Md. 126, 210 A.2d 504 (1965), repeated the definition of \u201cattempt\u201d from <em>Wiley:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">The elements of attempt to obtain money by a false pretense, like other attempts to commit a crime, are an intent to commit it, the doing of some act towards its commission, <em>and the failure to consummate its commission. Wiley v. State, </em>237 Md. 560, 207 A.2d 478 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">239 Md. at 127, 210 A.2d at 505 (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Early decisions of this Court contributed to the growing pedigree of the definitional error. <em>Boone v. State, 2 </em>Md.App. 80, 233 A.2d 476 (1967), was unequivocal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\"><em>A failure to consummate the crime is as much an essential element of an attempt as the intent and the performance of an overt act </em>towards its commission. Evidence that a crime has been committed will not sustain a verdict on an attempt to commit it because the essential element of interception or prevention of execution is lacking. <em>Consummation of the crime can take the behavior out of the definition of an \u201cattempt. </em>\u201d See Clark &amp; Marshall, <em>Law on Crimes, supra, </em>Sec. 4.14, citing <em>People v. Lardner, </em>300 Ill. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>264, 267, 133 N.E. 375, 19 A.L.R. 721 (1921), where a conviction for an \u201cattempt to commit larceny\u201d was reversed upon facts which showed the consummation of the larceny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAo\">2 Md.App. at 114, 233 A.2d at 495 (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In <em>Tender v.

State, </em>278 Md. 231, 360 A.2d 426 (1976), as well as this Court in <em>Lightfoot v. State, </em>25 Md.App. 148, 334 A.2d 152 (1975), did not hesitate to order a radical correction of course when more sophisticated analysis revealed that the earlier position, no matter how oft repeated, had been wrong. It was that dramatic correction of course that emboldens us to take our present action. <em>See </em>278 Md. at 237-38, 360 A.2d at 429-30; 25 Md.App. at 161-62, 334 A.2d at 159-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The factual situation in <em>Lightfoot </em>was neither marginal nor ambiguous and the question before the Court of Appeals was squarely posed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">The question here is whether a criminal defendant may properly be convicted of <em>attempted </em>armed robbery upon evidence clearly establishing a consummated armed robbery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">278 Md. at 231, 360 A.2d at 426 (Emphasis supplied.) If the failure to consummate were, indeed, an affirmative element, a requirement that had been espoused by Maryland for ten years, the impact on the conviction in the <em>Lightfoot </em>case would have been clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">It is often stated that failure to consummate the crime is one of the essential elements of a criminal attempt. <em>If this be so, it logically follows that if the uncontradicted evidence establishes the consummated crime, there can be no convic</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>tion for attempt, </em>and the courts of several states have so concluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">278 Md. at 233-34, 360 A.2d at 427 (Footnote omitted.) (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Judge Eldridge quoted with approval both <em>State v. Fox, </em>159 N.W.2d 492 (Iowa 1968) and <em>Crump v. State, </em>259 Ind. 358, 287 N.E.2d 342 (1972), as Iowa and Indiana explained why a conviction for attempt is subsumed within a conviction for a consummated crime and is not in any sense inconsistent with it. 278 Md. at 234-35, 360 A.2d at 428. In <em>Fox, </em>the Supreme Court of Iowa had stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">[A]s the greater includes the less, it is manifest that in every case where an attempt is charged proof of the actual commission of the offense establishes the attempt. <em>If the offender actually commits the offense, he necessarily attempted to do it, </em>and proof of the commission of the actual offense does not constitute a variance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">159 N.W.2d at 495 (Emphasis supplied.) In <em>Crump, </em>the Indiana Supreme Court had similarly observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">It should make no difference whether the criminal conduct is successful or unsuccessful when determining an included offense. The conduct is the same in both cases; the actor\u2019s intent is the same in both cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">287 N.E.2d at 345. The self-evident fact that the crime of attempt lacks one required element (commission of the offense) possessed by the consummated crime does not imply, as a false affirmative, the opposite of the subtracted element (the <em>non-commission </em>of the offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">By parity of reasoning, when the 1880 Legislature failed to impose upon the new crime of Unauthorized Use any larceny-like mental requirement of an intent to deprive <em>permanently, </em>it did not thereby create, <em>sub silentio, </em>an opposite mental requirement of an intent to deprive <em>temporarily.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">We have also been advancing in this opinion the proposition that an accused may not successfully defend against a criminal prosecution by proving that he was actually more guilty than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>charged. We have been urging that such a defense would be not only misbegotten, but absurd. We again find support in <em>Lightfoot, </em>as the Court of Appeals there quoted with approval <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>215 A.2d 839 (D.C.App.1966), 278 Md. at 235, 360 A.2d at 428, wherein the District of Columbia Court criticized such a defense as one creating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQG\">the anomalous situation of a defendant going free \u201cnot because he was innocent, but for the very strange reason, that he was too guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">278 Md. at 235, 360 A.2d at 428 (quoting <em>Fleming, </em>215 A.2d at 840-41). Indeed, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals referred to such a possible result as a \u201clogical absurdity.\u201d 215 A.2d at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Again, by parity of reasoning, one would not defend against an allegation of an intended <em>lesser </em>deprivation (even if such a mental requirement existed) by proving an intended <em>greater </em>deprivation. If there were intents that were <em>inconsistent, </em>on the other hand, such a defense would be plausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The more penetrating approach taken by <em>Lightfoot </em>also relied heavily on, and quoted extensively from, the perceptive analysis of Rollin Perkins, Criminal Law 552-54 (2d ed. 1969). Professor Perkins posed the dilemma that might occur if the mere absence of an element were to be misconceptualized as the opposite of that element. There would be created the \u201clogical absurdity\u201d referred to by <em>United States v. Flem</em>ing\u2014the \u201churricane\u2019s eye\u201d of paradoxical immunity in the midst of unquestioned persuasion of guilt. The Court of Appeals concurred that it would, indeed, be an \u201cabsurd result,\u201d that might flow from the paradox:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">Suppose in ... a trial the uncontradicted evidence shows beyond doubt that defendant attempted to commit the offense charged, but there is conflict in the testimony as to whether the attempt succeeded or failed. Some of the statements on the subject, if carried to their logical conclusion, would entitle the defendant to an instruction which would tell the jury in substance: (1) they must acquit the defendant of the completed offense unless satisfied beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>reasonable doubt that the attempt was successful; (2) they must acquit the defendant of an attempt to commit the offense unless satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the attempt failed. In other words <em>the position would he that defendant is entitled to a verdict of not guilty if there is doubt in regard to success or failure although no doubt that the attempt was made. </em>There is no proper basis for such a position, and probably no court would carry the unsound notion to such an absurd extreme.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">278 Md. at 235-36, 360 A.2d at 428-29 (Emphasis supplied.) (quoting Perkins at 553-54).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The literal holding of the Court of Appeals in <em>Lightfoot </em>was clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">[FJailure to consummate the crime is not an indispensable element of criminal attempt. The language in <em>Franczkowski </em>and <em>Wiley </em>to the contrary is disapproved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">Consequently, where a defendant is charged with both the crime and the attempt to commit it, and where he is acquitted of the crime and convicted of the attempt, the attempt conviction may stand even though the evidence established that the crime was fully consummated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">278 Md. at 238, 360 A.2d at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">The teaching of <em>Lightfoot </em>at a higher level of abstraction is that when an appellate court is called upon to examine the precise nature of a relationship between two obviously related crimes, it should bring to that task a philosophic long view and sense of historic purpose and not get \u201chung up\u201d on mere trivial characterizations of the relationship appearing haphazardly in the case law. That is <em>stare decisis </em>at a deeper level.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">\n<em>The Commonality of the Problem</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">The key to the solution of the problem before us is an appreciation of its commonality \"with similar problems arising out of the various relationships we have been discussing. Whenever one compares a newer crime to an older and more senior one, the focus is on the difference between them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>When that difference is that the junior crime lacks a key element of the senior, there inevitably emerges in the shadows of the mind the hidden trap of the false affirmative. Subconsciously, we conflate non-proof of nighttime with <em>proof </em>of non-nighttime, non-proof of malice with <em>proof </em>of non-malice, non-proof of consummation with proof of non-consummation, and non-proof of permanent intent with proof of non-permanent intent. These are not mere isolated and self-contained legal-semantic phenomena. They are instances of a common problem calling for a common and consistent solution.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Just as a consummated crime and an attempted crime do not, per <em>Lightfoot, </em>point in different directions, the Theft of an automobile and the 1880 crime of Unauthorized Use similarly do not point in opposite directions. In neither relationship does there lurk that unintended \u201ceye\u201d in the hurricane of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">To avoid multiple punishment, the conviction for Unauthorized Use, as a lesser included offense, merged into the conviction for automobile Theft in the case of each appellant. In neither case was there a fatal inconsistency between the two convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\n<em>Evidentiary Sufficiency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The appellant Dontanyon T. alone raises the additional contention that the evidence was not legally sufficient to support the verdict of Theft of the automobile. He claims that the evidence did not adequately establish the linkage between the white Chevrolet Blazer in which Dontanyon was apprehended, the tag number of which enabled the arresting officer to determine that it was a \u201cstolen car,\u201d and Deborah Samms\u2019s 1991 Chevrolet, described in the indictment. The claim is disingenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Prior to the testimony of the only State\u2019s witness, Officer Sean White, who made the \u201ccollar,\u201d the undisputed peripheral facts were disposed of by a brief and casual oral stipulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Ms. Olin: [TJhere is a stipulation as to ownership and the amount of the deductible, which is $300.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">The Court: Well, give me first [what] the stipulation as to ownership would be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">Ms. Olin: The ownership would be [that] the victim, Deborah Samms, owns a 1991 Chevrolet, tag number, Maryland tag 151688M.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Although in a court trial it is not literally necessary, of course, to move for a judgment of acquittal in order to preserve for appellate review the issue of evidentiary insufficiency, tacit acquiescence at significant junctures may nonetheless help to resolve arguable ambiguities. Dontanyon T. never contested the issue of the ownership of the vehicle in which he was apprehended, either by a motion for dismissal or in closing argument at the adjudicatory stage. If the stipulation as to the ownership of the \u201cstolen car\u201d in which he was found was arguably vague, Judge Welch was not alerted to seek further clarification, which could easily have been supplied within 60 seconds. Nor was any such contention raised at the disposition hearing at which Dontanyon readily consented to pay $300 in restitution to Ms. Samms.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Under the circumstances, the fact-finding trial judge could reasonably have inferred that \u201cthe\u201d vehicle referred to in the stipulation as to its ownership was, indeed, \u201cthe\u201d vehicle in which Dontanyon was riding at the time of his arrest. Any other reading would reduce the proceedings to an Abbott and Costello \u201croutine.\u201d The verdict was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">\n<em>JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS IN EQUAL AMOUNT.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\">.

Sas </em>], intent to deprive the owner of his possession includes future possession and is not limited, as in common-law larceny, to a taking out of present possession. Therefore, participation in the continued use of the car after the original taking would manifest an intent to deprive the owner of his possession during such participation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">201 Md. at 167-68, 93 A.2d at 72-73. <em>Anello </em>appears to be applying, unwittingly and inappropriately, to the 1880 Unauthorized Use statute the characterization that <em>Wright v. Sas </em>was indisputably making about the 1943 Motor Vehicle statute in the course of contrasting it with the 1880 law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\">. Despite its surface allure, the posited inconsistency is not necessarily true. It is easy to say, \u201cIt is patent that one cannot intend to take both more and less.\u201d That is not to say, however, that the \"more\u201d may not include the \"less.\u201d It is easy to say, \"It is patent that one may not simultaneously intend both a grand larceny and a petty larceny.\u201d That is not to say, however, that the intended theft of $301 may not include the intended theft of $299. The soundbite begs the question rather than answers it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
