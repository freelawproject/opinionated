Smith, was convicted at a bench trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine. Appellant was sentenced to four years imprisonment for possession with intent to distribute. The possession count merged. On appeal, appellant asks whether the trial court erred in denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>his motion to suppress physical evidence. For reasons hereinafter explained, we answer that question in the affirmative and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">I. <em>FACTS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The only witness who testified at the suppression hearing was Baltimore City Police Officer Sean White (\u201cWhite\u201d). His testimony was believed, in its entirety, by the trial judge. Unless otherwise indicated, all facts set forth in Part I are those testified to by White at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">About 10:50 p.m. on May 22, 1994, White received a police radio broadcast. According to the tape of that broadcast, which was admitted into evidence, the dispatcher said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a group of drug dealers selling drugs and discharging their guns in the air at the corner of Mount and Presstman Streets.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the radio dispatcher advised White that the citizen who had called in the complaint said, \u201cThe person doing the discharge is wearing a striped shirt, eighteen years old, number 1 [African American] male.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The corner of Mount and Presstman Streets is near the entrance to Mountmor Court, which is a high-crime area. White regularly patrols this area and had, in the five years prior to May 22, 1994, made numerous drug and weapons arrests in Mountmor Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">When White and several other police cruisers arrived at the corner of Mount and Presstman Streets, all was calm. White did not see anyone wearing a striped shirt. He looked, however, to his left toward the 1400 block of Mountmor Court and saw a group \u201cof four or five\u201d individuals standing on the curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">The arrival of the police caused the group at the curb to disband hastily. In particular, White noted the appellant running into Mountmor Court. While running, appellant took his right hand and put an object into his rear \u201cwaistband.\u201d White could not determine the size of the object and, in fact, \u201ccould not clearly see any object at that time.\u201d White radioed other units that he had seen a suspect running into Mountmor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Court and had \u201cobserved him tuck something into the back waist area of his pants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">White drove down Mount Street \u201cto a break which leads off Mountmor Court.\u201d Once at the break, he turned into it and drove into Mountmor Court. He made this maneuver because he knew it would enable him to intercept appellant if appellant did not change course. White next got out of his cruiser and jogged to a point where he saw appellant walking toward him. White ordered appellant to put his hands up where he could see them. Appellant complied, and as he did so, other officers approached appellant from the rear.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">White then did a pat-down around the outside of appellant\u2019s waist. Although White did not feel anything under appellant\u2019s clothing when he did the pat-down, he decided to \u201cdouble check\u201d by pulling at appellant\u2019s shirt \u201cso that [he] could see the back of [appellant\u2019s] waistband.\u201d As White pulled the shirt out, a plastic bag containing twenty ziplock bags of cocaine fell to the ground. Appellant was then placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Except for testimony that appellant had on a shirt, that the shirt was not striped, and that appellant wore \u201cpants,\u201d no evidence was introduced as to how appellant was dressed at the time he was apprehended.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> White did testify that appellant\u2019s shirt was \u201cover the waistband,\u201d which meant, apparently, that the shirt was not tucked into appellant\u2019s pants but hung loose over the waistband of his pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">White was an experienced and knowledgeable police officer, who was familiar with the customs and practices of drug dealers. He was also familiar with the Mountmor Court area. He had made or participated in seven hundred to eight hundred drug arrests, and of that number, fifty-five to sixty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>percent of the arrestees carried guns when apprehended. In White\u2019s experience, if drugs were being sold on the street, normally the seller or a confederate would stand nearby armed with a handgun. If White, while in a marked cruiser in the Mountmor Court area, approached any group, seven out of nine times the entire group would flee.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">In describing the circumstances surrounding typical street-level drug activity, White explained that it is common for an individual to yell \u201cFive 0\u201d (slang for \u201cpolice\u201d) to warn others that the police are coming. The group usually then splits up to make it more difficult for the police to observe or follow them. In White\u2019s experience, the individual who has the gun moves away from the police officer, rather than toward him.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Because of the contents of the police broadcast and appellant\u2019s actions, coupled with White\u2019s experience with drug sellers, White believed that appellant had placed a handgun in his waistband. Based on this belief, White frisked appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The motions judge denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the cocaine that fell from appellant\u2019s waistband area. In a lengthy oral opinion, the court reviewed the \u201cstop and frisk\u201d case law established by <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and its progeny. The court included in its remarks the following review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">The narrow scope of the <em>Terry </em>exception [to the warrant requirement] does not permit a frisk for weapons on less than reasonable belief or suspicion directed at the person to be frisked ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">Nothing in <em>Terry </em>can be understood to allow generalized cursory search for weapons or, indeed, any search whatever for anything but weapons[.] [Citation omitted]. The purpose of this limited search is not to discover evidence of crime but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence and thus the frisk for weapons must be equally necessary and reasonable[.] [Citation omitted].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-10\">If the protective search goes beyond what is necessary to determine if the suspect is armed, it is no longer valid under <em>Terry </em>and its fruits will be suppressedf.] [Citation omitted]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>... [I]f a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect\u2019s outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes the identity immediately apparent, there has been no invasion of the suspect\u2019s privacy beyond that already authorized by the officers search for weapons. If the object is contraband, its warrantless seizure would be justified by the same practical considerations that inhere in the plain view doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Applying the above principles, the court held that White\u2019s stop of appellant was constitutionally justified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">All of the facts in their context, I find as a matter of fact and as an issue of law that that confluence of facts under those circumstances were the kind of particularized facts that could be pointed to to lead the officer to a rational conclusion ... that the individual was armed sufficient for the purpose of conducting the limited pat-down that would, in fact, be known as a frisk for weapons under those circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">Those facts were that there was a call for people selling drugs who were armed, even though it only focused on the individual in the striped shirt having arms. That there was a discharge of firearms which the officers did not hear. That upon reaching the location that there was a crowd dispersing, and that this particular individual was dispersing away from the officers rather than at an angle as were the others, and that not only was that all being done, but that that individual was tucking something into the back of his waist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">And in the context of that location, that call, and those observations, the officer made the conclusion that that individual had tucked a firearm there, and I cannot say that he did not have a reasonable suspicion that what was tucked was a firearm....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">The court proceeded to rule that, based on the reasonable suspicion that appellant was armed, White was entitled to conduct a \u201climited pat-down ... for the kind of solid object that would have the same shape, weight, density, and bulk of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>gun.\u201d Regarding the pulling out of appellant\u2019s shirt, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\">And that upon completing that very cursory, short search, that the officer did one more thing, which was to tug at the shirt to see if tugging at the shirt <em>would reveal the outline of a gun, </em>and in such tugging out of the waistband, because of the way that they were tucked, fell the contraband, which the officer immediately determined was contraband and justified the arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">So under the circumstances that the officer had available here, I do not find that this was a situation like <em>Ybarra versus Illinois </em>where the mere presence of the person caused the officer to make the axiomatic conclusion, well, you know, anybody could be a danger to me, and I\u2019d better search them all, nor was it like the situation in <em>Alfred </em>where the frisk was more of an afterthought after a long interrogation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">That here as the escalating pieces of the puzzle were coming into the officer\u2019s mind the officer drew the inference that the individual disappearing into Mountmor Court rather than moving in the other direction was the member of the earlier referred to group that was selling drugs, that now had the gun, even though the earlier caller had talked about an individual with a striped shirt, because of what the officer observed the defendant doing, most importantly the tucking into the back of his waistband, which would be the normal place to secrete a weapon, and under those circumstances, the motion to suppress is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">II. <em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">The appropriate standard of review to be here applied was set forth in <em>Riddick v. State, </em>319 Md. 180, 183, 571 A.2d 1239 (1990):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-10\">When the question is whether a constitutional right, such as the one here, has been violated, we make our own independent constitutional appraisal. We make the apprais<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>al by reviewing the law and applying it to the peculiar facts of the particular case. <em>State v. Gee, </em>298 Md. 565, 571, [471 A.2d 712,] <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1244, 104 S.Ct. 3519, 82 L.Ed.2d 827 (1984). When the facts are in dispute, we accept them as found by the trial judge unless he is clearly erroneous in his judgment on the evidence before him. In ascertaining whether he is clearly erroneous, we give \u201cdue regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses,\u201d as commanded by Md.Rule 8-131(c). When the question of the dishonor of a constitutional right arises by the denial of a motion to suppress, the relevant facts which we consider \u201care limited to those produced at the suppression hearing, <em>see Trusty v. State, </em>308 Md. 658[, 521 A.2d 749] (1987), which are most favorable to the State as the prevailing party on the motion.\u201d <em>Simpler v. State, </em>318 Md. 311, 312 [, 568 A.2d 22] (1990).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">III. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Appellant first argues that, under the standard set forth in <em>Terry, supra, </em>Officer White did not have sufficient reason to either stop or frisk him. Appellant further contends that, even assuming the frisk was permissible, White\u2019s search went beyond the scope of an allowable <em>Terry </em>frisk.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">For the reasons set forth by the motions judge, which we have quoted above, we agree that Officer White\u2019s initial stop and pat-down of appellant was justified under <em>Terry. </em>The dispositive issue in this case is, however, whether the police officer who searched appellant was acting within the lawful bounds of <em>Terry </em>when he discovered the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">What the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit recently said in <em>U.S. v. Schiavo, </em>29 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir.1994), is apposite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">\u201c[S]earches and seizures conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate are <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment\u2014subject only to a few specifically established and well delineated exceptions.\u201d <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>113 S.Ct. 2130, 2135, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993) (internal citations and quotations omitted). One exception, recognized in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868 [, 20 L.Ed.2d 889] (1968), is that \u201cwhere a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot the officer may briefly stop the suspicious person and make reasonable inquiries aimed at confirming or dispelling his suspicions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotations omitted). Under <em>Terry, </em>an officer may also conduct a patdown search where the officer is justified in believing that the person is armed and dangerous to the officer or others. <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 24, 88 S.Ct. at 1881. <em>This protective search must be \u201climited to that which is necessary for the discovery of weapons which might be used to harm the officer or others nearby</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">In <em>Alfred v. State, </em>61 Md.App. 647, 669-70, 487 A.2d 1228 (1985), Judge Moylan, for this Court, explained the limited scope of a <em>Terry </em>frisk:-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">Under the ever-present minimization requirement of the Fourth Amendment, only a pat-down of the exterior of the clothing surface is permitted. The reason for this limitation is that a pat-down is enough- to reveal the presence of large and palpable weapons, such as guns, knives, blackjacks, and brass knuckles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">In the present case, the appellant was described as wearing a pair of snugly-fitting, body-clinging cutoff jeans. Even accepting the need for an actual pat-down rather than a visual scan ... the pat-down clearly did not reveal a weapon.... The sense of touch would clearly have revealed that it was not a gun, a knife, a blackjack, brass knuckles, or any other conceivable weapon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">In <em>Anderson v. State, </em>78 Md.App. 471, 477-78, 553 A.2d 1296 (1989), we explained the reason behind allowing only a limited search:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>The reason the Fourth Amendment permits a policeman to conduct a minimal search (a frisk) of a suspect upon such a lesser predicate is the necessity of protecting from harm the life and limb of the stopping officer. The danger is that the stoppee may be armed. Because almost all weapons\u2014guns, knives, blackjacks, brass knuckles\u2014are hard, palpable objects, their presence may be detected by a close pat-down of the exterior of the clothing surface. Because that is all that is necessary, that is all that is permitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">Later, the <em>Anderson </em>Court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">The limited frisk for weapons that was held to be reasonable in the <em>Terry </em>case itself has become the model for how the police should conduct this type of limited search permitted only for this limited purpose:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">\u201cThe scope of the search in this case presents no serious problem in light of these standards. Officer McFadden patted down the outer clothing of petitioner and his two companions. He did not place his hands in their pockets or under the outer surface of their garments until he had felt weapons, and then he merely reached for and removed the guns. He never did invade Katz\u2019 person beyond the outer surfaces of his clothes, since he discovered nothing in his pat-down which might have been a weapon. Officer McFadden confined his search strictly to what was minimally necessary to learn whether the men were armed and to disarm them once he discovered the weapons. He did not conduct a general exploratory search for whatever evidence of criminal activity he might find.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-8\"><em>Anderson, </em>78 Md.App. at 478-79, 553 A.2d 1296 (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 29-30, 88 S.Ct. at 1884).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">In <em>Anderson, </em>we held that the officer\u2019s frisk went beyond that allowable under <em>Terry </em>when a police officer reached into Anderson\u2019s pocket and pulled out a wristwatch. <em>Id. </em>at 479, 553 A.2d 1296. Anderson and a confederate had allegedly robbed a man, taking, <em>inter alia, </em>jewelry. <em>Id. </em>at 475, 553 A.2d 1296. Shortly after the robbery, the two men attempted to rob a young man of his bicycle. <em>Id. </em>at 475, 553 A.2d 1296. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>officer broadcasting a lookout for the individuals involved in the attempted bike robbery was also alerted to be on the lookout for the men who had robbed the man of jewelry. <em>Id. </em>at 475, 553 A.2d 1296. The officer concluded that the same men were involved in both crimes and proceeded to a liquor store where he saw Anderson and his partner. <em>Id. </em>at 475-76, 553 A.2d 1296. Another officer, Epperson, then arrived on the scene as reinforcement and performed a \u201cstop and frisk\u201d of Anderson. <em>Id. </em>at 476, 553 A.2d 1296. Officer Epperson described his pat-down of Anderson saying, \u201cI started from around the neck and moved my way down to the sides where he had a sweat jacket on and put my hands in his pocket and pulled everything out, a watch and a ring.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For the following reasons, we concluded that Officer Epperson\u2019s frisk went beyond that allowable under <em>Terry:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">Had Officer Epperson patted-down Anderson\u2019s clothing and felt the contents of the pocket from the outside, that would have been legitimate. Such, however, was not the case here. We do not even reach the possibility, suggested by the State at one point in its brief, that a wrist-watch or ring might, from the outside of the clothing, have felt like a weapon, thereby justifying a further intrusion into the pocket. There was no two-step intrusion involved in this case; Officer Epperson went directly to the interior of the pocket and came forth with its contents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 479, 553 A.2d 1296.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Likewise, in <em>Aguilar v. State, </em>88 Md.App. 276, 594 A.2d 1167 (1991), we held that the scope of the frisk went beyond that allowable under <em>Terry </em>and its progeny. In <em>Aguilar, </em>a group of policemen executed a search warrant in an apartment seeking to uncover drugs and drug paraphernalia. <em>Id. </em>at 279, 594 A.2d 1167. While the police were searching, Aguilar made an uninvited entry into the apartment with a \u201cwide-eyed look in his eyes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279, 594 A.2d 1167. Aguilar explained that he was looking for \u201cJamie,\u201d a person whom he was unable to describe. <em>Id. </em>at 279, 594 A.2d 1167. When Aguilar did not respond to a police officer\u2019s request for identification, the officer asked Aguilar if he were armed. <em>Id. </em>at 279, 594 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>1167. Aguilar \u201cstill did not reply, so the officer \u2018patted [Aguilar] down.\u2019 The officer did not feel anything during the pat-down, so he asked [Aguilar] again whether he was armed. [Aguilar] continued to remain silent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280, 594 A.2d 1167. The officer then asked Aguilar to unbuckle his pants, but, Aguilar failed to comply. The officer then unbuckled appellant\u2019s pants, pulled his pants down, and pulled his underwear out and down, whereupon a plastic baggie that was concealed in appellant\u2019s underwear fell out. <em>Id. </em>at 280, 594 A.2d 1167. We held that, under these circumstances, the search exceeded the scope allowed under the <em>Terry:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">[T]he required frisk was conducted but nothing was felt. The officer said he knew from experience that drug dealers frequently carry weapons under the clothing which cannot be felt. He pursued his search for the unfelt but suspected weapon. <em>From a security point of view the officer\u2019s action was eminently logical. The problem is that no legal basis exists for justifying the officer\u2019s further intrusion.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 287, 594 A.2d 1167 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">As this Court recently reaffirmed in <em>State v. Jones, </em>103 Md.App. 548, 568-69, 653 A.2d 1040 (1995), the \u201climitation [on a <em>Terry </em>frisk], of course, is that the frisk must be confined to a pat-down of the exterior of the clothing surface, careful and thorough, to be sure, <em>but not intruding beneath the clothing surface, </em>such as into a pocket.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">With all the above in mind, we turn to the facts in this case. Officer White testified that when he first saw appellant, he could not distinguish what it was that appellant had placed into his waist area, but based on the radio call and his past experience, he suspected that what he had seen appellant place in his back waistband was indeed a weapon. Officer White described the situation as he approached appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-I\">As I entered the court area and observed the defendant, he was walking in my direction. I approached him from the front for my safety. I asked him to place his hands up where I could see them. At that time I detained him.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>At that time I did a pat\u2014a stop and frisk pat down for my safety in the back of his waist area where I had seen him place an object. At that time I pulled out his shirt to check under it at which time the object fell to the ground.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuU\">Later, in response to a question from the court, Officer White explained that the \u201cobject\u201d fell out while he was \u201cdouble-checking\u201d appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">Your Honor, when I went up and I went to perform my stop and frisk, the shirt was over the waistband. Basically what I did is as I patted it, I pulled the shirt out just so I could see the waistband to make sure nothing was sticking out even though I patted him, like to double check, and as I tucked the shirt back to see the waistband, that\u2019s when the object fell out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">White admitted, on cross-examination from defense counsel, that he did not feel a weapon during the initial pat-down:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">Q [Defense Attorney]: And you did a cursory pat-down of his belt area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">A [White]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-9\">Q: And then you didn\u2019t find any weapon-like bulges at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-10\">A: When I patted him down, I didn\u2019t, feel anything. That\u2019s what I got to the back, I just double checked and pulled his shirt back to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ary\">White was within the bounds of a proper <em>Terry </em>frisk when he patted-down the outer portion of the clothing that covered appellant\u2019s waist area. But, as already noted, White went one step further\u2014he pulled back appellant\u2019s shirt. The State produced no evidence to show that, at the moment in time when White took this additional step, he continued to have reason to believe that appellant had a handgun in his waistband. He had patted the outer surface of appellant\u2019s clothing and felt nothing. Usually the sense of touch, when patting-down the exterior clothing of a suspect, is sufficient to disclose a large weapon such as a gun. <em>Anderson, </em>78 Md.App. at 477-78, 553 A.2d 1296. \u201cBecause that is all that is necessary, that is all that is permitted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>There was no showing that there was anything peculiar about the clothing appellant was wearing (such as bulk) that would make it difficult to detect a handgun by a pat down of the outside of appellant\u2019s waist area. <em>Compare, United States v. Mack, </em>421 F.Supp. 561 (W.D.Pa.1976), <em>aff'd, </em>568 F.2d 771 (3d Cir.1978) (suspect\u2019s clothing was bulky\u2014search of inner clothing allowed). If there was anything about the way appellant was dressed that would justify a more intrusive search than a pat-down, then the burden was on the State to prove it. <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1326, 75 L.Ed.2d 229, 236 (1983) (\u201cIt is the State\u2019s burden to demonstrate that the seizure it seeks to justify on the basis of a reasonable suspicion was sufficiently limited in scope and duration to satisfy the conditions of an investigative seizure\u201d). The State here failed to meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In justifying White\u2019s pulling back of appellant\u2019s shirt after White had felt nothing, the State cites the following excerpt from <em>Aguilar, </em>88 Md.App. at 287, 594 A.2d 1167:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">The scope allowed the police is limited by the requirement that as a prerequisite to whatever search is conducted, a pat-down or frisk of the outer surface (clothing, etc.) must be made before any more intrusive search is made. As earlier observed, if the pat-down reveals a hard object which could be a weapon, a further search is allowed. But, if the frisk reveals only a soft object, or a hard object which cannot be determined to be a weapon, further search is prohibited <em>unless the officer either observes conduct which leads him to believe the suspect is armed and dangerous or has some other reliable basis for believing that the suspect is armed and dangerous.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">The State seizes upon the emphasized portion of the above <em>Aguilar </em>excerpt and points to appellant\u2019s conduct and the other \u201creliable basis\u201d for the frisk that existed <em>before </em>the pat-down for weapons occurred. The State points out that appellant\u2019s conduct (fleeing and putting an object in his waist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>band), together with White\u2019s experience with, and knowledge regarding, narcotic sales, gave him a \u201creasonable basis\u201d to pull out appellant\u2019s shirt. It is quite obvious from reading in context the emphasized portion of <em>Aguilar </em>that the language was not intended to mean that, after a pat-down is completed, further search for weapons is justified every time an officer, prior to a pat-down, has either observed conduct on the suspect\u2019s part or has developed other \u201creasonable basis\u201d for believing the suspect was armed and dangerous. Such an exception to the rule that <em>Terry </em>stops must be limited in scope would swallow the rule because, to perform a pat-down frisk in the first place, the officer must always observe conduct on the part of the suspect or have other reasonable basis for the belief that the suspect is armed and dangerous. Read in context, the <em>Aguilar </em>exception applies only if 1) after the pat-down begins there is some additional conduct on the part of the suspect that supports a reasonable belief (even after the outer garments have been patted-down) that the suspect is armed with a weapon, or 2) after the frisk is completed, the police officer has some other reasonable basis to believe that the suspect is armed and dangerous. The exception is here plainly inapplicable because the State failed to show that, after the pat-down of appellant\u2019s waist area was completed, White still had a reasonable basis to believe that appellant had a handgun or other weapon in his waistband.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">For the foregoing reasons the court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the cocaine. Therefore, appellant\u2019s conviction will be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">JUDGMENTS REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-9\">.

At appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing, White said appellant had on \"pants-shorts\u201d but did not otherwise describe appellant\u2019s clothing. The transcript of the preliminary hearing was not provided to the motions judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b706-7\">GARRITY, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Af_\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion. If a suspect, while fleeing from a police officer responding to the report of a discharge of weapons in a high crime area, is seen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>to place an object that the officer believes to be a handgun into his waistband, the police officer ought to be allowed to conduct a thorough protective pat-down search of that particular area on stopping the suspect, even though a mere cursory pat-down failed to reveal the object that had been in fact tucked into a shirt-covered waistband in back of appellant\u2019s pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">On the foundation of <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and its progeny, including <em>Aguilar v. State, </em>88 Md.App. 276, 594 A.2d 1167 (1991), I would hold the motions judge\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence of twenty baggies of rock cocaine, which had fallen out of appellant\u2019s waistband when the shirt covering was \u201ctugged by Officer White,\u201d to be eminently correct. Under the circumstances known to the police officer, the scope of the protective search was, under the ambit of the Fourth Amendment, necessary and reasonable to disclose the handgun thought to have been tucked under the waistband. Not only did Officer White have a reliable basis for believing that the appellant was armed and dangerous, but the officer was engaged in the process of completing a careful and thorough protective pat-down search of the particular waistband area when the object fell to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The following colloquy between the motions judge and Officer White is most revealing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">THE COURT: And what was the purpose of the technique where you sort of tugged at the shirt or the waistband which caused something to fall out? Is that a specific kind of technique that you learned in the academy or something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">[OFFICER WHITE]: No, Your Honor, when I went up and I went to perform my stop and frisk, the shirt was over the waistband. Basically what I did is as I patted it, I pulled the shirt out just so I could see the waistband to make sure nothing was sticking out even though I patted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>him, like to double check, and as I tucked[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] the shirt back to see the waistband, that\u2019s when the object fell out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In rendering his opinion, the motions judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">That upon reaching the location that there was a crowd dispersing, and that this particular individual was dispersing away from the officers rather than at an angle as were the others, and that not only was that all being done, but that that individual was tucking something into the back of his waist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">And in the context of that location, that call, and those observations, the officer made the conclusion that that individual had tucked a firearm there, and I cannot say that he did not have a reasonable suspicion that what was tucked was a firearm. Therefore, he was permitted to conduct a limited pat-down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">And that upon completing that very cursory, short search, that the officer did one more thing, which was to tug at the shirt <em>to see if tugging at the shirt would reveal the outline of a gun, </em>and in such tugging out of the waistband, because of the way that they were tucked, fell the contraband, which the officer immediately determined was contraband and justified the arrest. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">That here as the escalating pieces of the puzzle were coming into the officer\u2019s mind the officer drew the inference that the individual disappearing into Mountmor Court rather than moving in the other direction was the member of the earlier referred to group that was selling drugs, that now had the gun, even though the earlier caller had talked about an individual with a striped shirt, because of what the officer observed the defendant doing, most importantly the tucking into the back of his waistband, which would be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>normal place to secrete a weapon, and under those circumstances, the motion to suppress is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In essence, although the motions judge found that the \u201cvery cursory, short search\u201d had been completed, he determined that Officer White was justified, under the totality of circumstances as known to the officer, to continue the search and \u201ctug at the shirt to see if tugging at the shirt would reveal the outline of a gun.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">When we consider the \u201cscope\u201d of a <em>Terry </em>frisk we are dealing with two limiting factors, its duration and its area. We have ruled that the duration of a <em>Terry </em>frisk is limited to the time it takes to effect the necessary pat-down and no longer. <em>Snow v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 243, 578 A.2d 816 (1990). The rule defining the area that may be frisked is not so easily stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Citing <em>Warden v. Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 310, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 1651, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967), the Court, in <em>Terry, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arp\">The scope of the search must be \u2018strictly tied to and justified by\u2019 the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">The distinctions of classical \u2018stop and frisk\u2019 theory thus serve to direct attention from the central inquiry under the Fourth <em>Amendment\u2014the reasonableness in all circumstances </em>of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen\u2019s personal security.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">392 U.S. at 19, 88 S.Ct. at 1878 (citations omitted, emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">The <em>Terry </em>Court observed that there is \u201cno ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search [or seize] against the invasion which the search [or seizure] entails.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>U.S. 392 at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1879-80 (citing <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 534-535, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1733-34, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">The Supreme Court further counseled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-12\">[I]n justifying the particular intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion. The scheme of the Fourth Amendment becomes meaningful only when it is assured that at some point the conduct of those charged with enforcing the laws can be subjected to the more detached, neutral scrutiny of a judge who must <em>evaluate the reasonableness of a particular search or seizure in light of the particular circumstances. </em>And in making that assessment it is imperative that the facts be judged against an objective standard: would the facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure or the search \u201cwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the action taken was appropriate? [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">When an officer is justified in believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others, it would appear to be clearly unreasonable to deny the officer the power to take necessary measures to determine whether the person is in fact carrying a weapon and to neutralize the threat of physical harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">A search for weapons in the absence of probable cause to arrest, however, must, like any other search, be strictly circumscribed by the exigencies which justify its initiation. Thus it must be limited to that which is necessary for the discovery of weapons which might be used to harm the officer or others nearby, and may realistically be characterized as something less than a \u2018full\u2019 search, even though it remains a serious intrusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">And in determining whether the officer acted reasonably in such circumstances, due weight must be given, not to his inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch,\u2019 but to the specific reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number><em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21-27, 88 S.Ct. at 1879-83 (citations omitted, footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Based upon these principles, the Supreme Court then examined the particular conduct of the police officer \u201cin <em>this </em>case to determine whether his search and seizure of petitioner were reasonable, both at their inception and as conducted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28, 88 S.Ct. at 1883 (emphasis added). The Court then determined that the facts and circumstances detailed by the police officer warranted a belief that the petitioner was armed and presented a threat to the officer\u2019s safety.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">In focusing on the scope of the search, the Court stated: the Fourth Amendment proceeds as much by limitations upon the scope of governmental action as by imposing pre conditions upon its initiation____ Thus, evidence may not be introduced if it was discovered by means of a seizure and search which were not reasonably related in scope to the justification for their initiation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 28-29, 88 S.Ct. at 1883-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">The Court went on to explain that it did not intend to carve in stone the particular limitations it sanctioned in <em>Terry </em>to apply to all protective searches. It stated rather,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-11\">We need not develop at length in this case, however, the limitations which the Fourth Amendment places upon a protective seizure and search for weapons. <em>These limitations mil have to be developed in the concrete factual circumstances of individual cases </em>... The sole justification of the search in the present situation is the protection of the police officer and others nearby, and it must therefore be confined in scope to an intrusion reasonably designed to discover guns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments for the assault of the police officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 28-29, 88 S.Ct. at 1883-84 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">The Court then examined the scope of the police officers\u2019 search and determined \u201cthe scope of the search <em>in this case </em>presents no serious problem in light of these standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 88 S.Ct. at 1883-84 (emphasis added). Although the Court recognized in that particular case the officer did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>invade the petitioner\u2019s person beyond the outer surface of his clothes, it is crucially important to note that the Court <em>did not </em>hold that under other facts and circumstances, a further intrusion would not be allowed. The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\"><em>Each case of this sort will, of course, have to be decided on its own facts. We merely hold today </em>that where a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous, where in the course of investigating this behavior he identifies himself as a policeman and makes reasonable inquiries, and where nothing in the initial stages of the encounter serves to dispel his. reasonable fear for his own or other\u2019s safety, he is entitled for the protection of himself and others in the area to conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of such persons in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 30, 88 S.Ct. at 1884-85 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Thus, while in <em>Terry </em>the officer only needed to frisk outer clothing to find the weapon, the Supreme Court did not rule under all circumstances that an investigatory protective search must be limited to outer clothing frisks. Indeed, as in the case at bar, it is clear that such a limitation, under the particular facts and circumstances that an officer encounters, unreasonably places him or her in immediate and direct jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">In <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 146, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972), a police officer had a reliable tip that an individual (Williams) seated in a nearby vehicle was carrying narcotics and had a gun at his waist. The Court examined the particular circumstances in relation to scope and held that \u201cthe policeman\u2019s action <em>in reaching to the spot where the gun was thought to be hidden </em>constituted a limited intrusion designed to insure his safety, and we conclude that it was reasonable. The loaded gun seized as a result of this intrusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>was therefore admissible at Williams\u2019 trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 92 S.Ct. at 1923 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">The Supreme Court clearly explained its previous holding in <em>Terry </em>as being \u201cwhen an officer is justified in believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others, he may conduct a limited protective search for concealed weapons ... So long as the officer is entitled to make a forcible stop, and has reason to believe that the suspect is armed and dangerous, he may conduct a weapons search limited in scope to this protective purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 92 S.Ct. at 1923. Again, it is crucially important to realize that the Court, as in <em>Terry, did not limit </em>a protective search to a mere cursory pat-down of outer clothing when the facts and circumstances known to the officer warranted further intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">In the case at bar, Officer White testified he believed the appellant had a gun because there had been a report of a recent discharge of a firearm and that the appellant had acted the way armed persons act when conducting drug security for a drug operation. Also, the officer testified that the appellant\u2019s shirt was positioned in such a way that hid the waistband and therefore he \u201cpulled the shirt out to see the waistband to make sure nothing was sticking out even though I patted him, like to double check....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">These facts, coupled with Officer White actually seeing the appellant place an object, which he reasonably believed to be a handgun, in the back of appellant\u2019s waistband, warranted Officer White <em>to continue to believe that appellant might be armed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Indeed, these facts operate to distinguish <em>Aguilar. </em>In <em>Aguilar </em>we ruled that once a pat-down reveals that the only object the detainee has secreted under his clothing is an object that could not be a weapon, the officer must end his frisk. We did not consider whether the search was illegal on the ground that it exceeded the scope allowed by law. In the instant case, Officer White <em>knew </em>that there was some object under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>appellant\u2019s waistband, but by his <em>initial </em>frisk was unable either to see or feel the object because of the manner in which the outer clothing had been arranged. The facts known to him caused Officer White actually to continue to maintain a reliable basis to believe a weapon was present. In essence, under the circumstances of this case, because of appellant\u2019s conduct indicating the secreting of a weapon, which suspicion was not dispelled by an initial 'cursory pat-down, the facts known to him warranted Officer White to continue to believe that the appellant might be armed and to extend his protective search to the waistband area.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">At the risk of being redundant, it is most important to realize clearly that <em>the Supreme. Court did not confine a weapons search to mere outer clothing if the circumstances otherwise warranted, </em>as expressly counseled in <em>Terry </em>and <em>Williams. </em>Indeed, there is absolutely nothing in the case law that holds that an officer must frisk a particular area only one time and in only one way. What happened here was that the officer tried first to conduct the frisk by being as unintrusive as possible. He did this by conducting a cursory frisk. When he felt nothing, even though he actually had observed the appellant put an object under his shirt and in the back of his pants, the officer knew that his cursory protective search had not been complete. He then pulled the appellant\u2019s shirt out in order to conduct a more intrusive frisk.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">I see absolutely nothing wrong with proceeding this way. In effect, the officer tried to complete his protective search by being as unintrusive as possible. The majority, by ruling as it does, actually penalizes the officer for trying to give added respect to the appellant\u2019s right of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Since the United States Supreme Court and our Court of Appeals has seen fit to extend the scope of protective frisks to containers a detainee is carrying, <em>Lee v. State, </em>311 Md. 642, 537 A.2d 235 (1988); to a car a detainee is occupying, <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983); and to the house that a detainee is occupying, <em>Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>(1990); it seems most logical to me that, in order to secure the safety of a police officer, we should also allow the unimpeded search of a waistband when by a mere cursory frisk of outer clothing, a police officer cannot determine whether the detainee has secreted a weapon in his waistband due to an overlapping shirt. I suggest that a frisk of a detainee\u2019s interior clothing is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">1. The officer first frisks the outer clothing and finds nothing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">2. The officer\u2019s reasonable belief that the detainee is armed and dangerous has not been dispelled; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">3. There is something about the detainee\u2019s clothing that has made it impossible with the exterior frisk alone to determine whether the detainee possesses a weapon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">All three of these conditions were met in this case. I would affirm the circuit court\u2019s ruling that the police officer conducted a reasonable limited intrusive search of the area where he believed a weapon to be hidden.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-10\">. Although neither parly corrected the phonetic record, it would appear that the word \"tucked\u201d should have been \"tugged,\u201d in response to the court\u2019s question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
