We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On April 30, 2013, Tracie Keaton was looking outside her apartment window in Hartford when she saw the defendant, who was a friend of her son, sitting on the porch. Keaton asked the defendant what was wrong, and the defendant replied, \"[N]one of your business, mind your business you raw head\n   bitch.\" Keaton told the defendant that he could not sit on her porch anymore. Before leaving, the defendant retorted that he would \"burn this shit down.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the defendant obtained a red plastic container, which contained gasoline, and returned to Keaton's apartment building. The defendant poured the accelerant on the back porch of the apartment building and lit it on fire. Keaton's neighbor, Jessica Watts, saw the defendant pour gasoline on the porch and light\n   it on fire. After seeing the fire start, Watts called Keaton on the phone and told her to evacuate the building. Keaton immediately called the fire department and began knocking on the doors of the other occupants to inform them about the fire. Meanwhile, Watts returned to her residence and told her husband about the fire. He went to the apartment building and put the fire out with buckets of water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 10, 2013, a member of the Hartford Police Department arrested the defendant. The defendant then provided a written statement to the police, in which he described his strained relationship with Keaton and admitted to lighting fire to Keaton's apartment building, with the aid of gasoline, after a dispute with Keaton. The defendant explained that he had been drinking, smoking marijuana, and using PCP all day and, as a result, was \"pretty fucked up\" and not \"thinking straight.\" He further stated that \"[w]henever I smoke [PCP] I lose my mind and have no idea what I am doing.\" He maintained that he \"didn't even know the porch was lit on fire. I wasn't trying to light the house on fire or hurt anyone. I was just pissed off at that woman for trying to call the cops on me. My intention was just to scare her.\" The defendant was charged with arson in the first degree and violation of probation. After his initial bail hearing, the defendant privately retained counsel to represent him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 11, 2014, trial commenced. The state presented the testimony of members of the Hartford Police Department and Hartford Fire Department. On August 12, 2014, the final day of evidence, the state's first two witnesses were the defendant's probation officer and Keaton. The third anticipated witness was Watts, but a brief recess was held to address an issue concerning her testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After that recess, the defendant stated\n   that he wanted \"to say something for the record.\" The court informed the defendant that he should speak to his attorney before addressing the court and ordered another recess. When the trial resumed, at approximately 11:15 a.m., defense counsel requested more time to speak with the defendant, and the court extended the recess until 2 p.m. After that recess, defense counsel stated that the defendant was refusing to return to the courtroom and moved for a continuance so that he could speak with the defendant further. The court denied the motion and advised the defendant, by way of an intercom in lockup, of his trial rights and that it found that the defendant was waiving those rights by refusing to return to the courtroom. The court informed the defendant that the trial would resume and that he could speak with counsel after the next witness testified.\n   Prior to the testimony of the next witness, however, the defendant returned to the courtroom and, through counsel, asked to address the court. After advising the defendant of his rights, the court engaged in the following colloquy with the defendant:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The Court: Now, with respect to what you address this court, you know, this is not an opportunity for you to vent, this is an opportunity for you to tell me what you think your concern is, and then we're going to continue with the trial today.

The defendant then insisted on leaving the courtroom and refused to participate in the proceedings. Defense counsel requested, and the court granted, another continuance so that he could speak with the defendant. When the defendant continued to refuse to return to the courtroom, defense counsel moved for \"a continuance so [the defendant] can get a new lawyer to finish the trial.\" The state objected, and the court denied defense counsel's motion. When the jury returned to the courtroom, the court instructed it not to draw an adverse inference from the defendant's absence. Watts proceeded to testify, and, after her testimony, the defendant returned to the courtroom to hear the testimony of the state's final witness. On August 13, 2014, the jury found the defendant guilty of arson in the first degree, and the court found the defendant guilty of violating his probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court erred (1) by not canvassing him concerning\n   his right to counsel and right to self-representation after he clearly and unequivocally invoked his right to self-representation, and (2) if his invocation of his right to self-representation was not clear and unequivocal, by not canvassing him concerning whether he wanted to invoke his right to self-representation. The state responds that the defendant did not invoke his right to self-representation clearly and unequivocally, but, instead, he expressed a desire to substitute counsel. As a result, the trial court\n   was not required to canvass the defendant concerning his right to counsel and his right to self-representation, and did not abuse its discretion by not canvassing the defendant concerning his right to self-representation. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   It is well established that the sixth amendment to the United States constitution \"embodies a right to self-representation and that a defendant in a state criminal trial has a constitutional right to proceed without counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pires\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20222\">\n    310 Conn. 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20A.3d%2087\">\n    77 A.3d 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). \"State and federal courts consistently have discussed the right to self-representation in terms of invoking or asserting it ... and have concluded that there can be no infringement of the right to self-representation in the absence of a defendant's proper assertion of that right.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20A.3d%2087\">\n    Id., at 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20A.3d%2087\">\n    77 A.3d 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After the testimony of Keaton, it became apparent that the defendant wanted to delay or stop the trial. Initially, he attempted to forestall the trial by refusing to return to the courtroom. When the court explained that the trial would continue in his absence, the defendant expressed his anxiety about the trial and the quality of the representation he was receiving from defense counsel. The court explained that it believed that the defendant was receiving a fair trial and that defense counsel was working to protect his rights and informed the defendant that the trial would continue. When the court further observed that the defendant had \"an absolute right to be represented by an attorney\" and \"ha[d] an attorney,\" the defendant informed the court that he had fired defense counsel and, therefore, did not have an attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The defendant never stated clearly, however, what he wanted after he fired defense counsel, i.e., a continuance, new counsel, or to represent himself. The defendant argues that \"the only reasonable inference is that, by attempting to fire his privately retained attorney, he\n   was seeking to represent himself.\" We disagree. Based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the defendant's statements, it is reasonable to infer that the defendant wanted a continuance, a new attorney, or both, not to represent himself. Indeed, the court understood the defendant to be seeking to delay the trial, and defense counsel understood him to be asking for a continuance so that he could hire a new attorney to finish the trial. The defendant's refusal to return to the courtroom on two occasions certainly does not indicate that he wanted to represent himself. The defendant did not disavow his counsel's request for a continuance either; he merely disputed whether defense counsel was still his attorney. Accordingly, the defendant did\n   not invoke his right to self-representation clearly and unequivocally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Alternatively, the defendant argues that even if his invocation of his right to self-representation was \"less than clear and unequivocal,\" the court abused its discretion by not canvassing him concerning his right to self-representation.
