Judge Fuger subsequently denied the petition for certification to appeal. The principal issue raised by the petitioner in this appeal is that the court erred in not finding counsel ineffective for an alleged failure to present a closing argument that the restraint or abduction of the victim was not a kidnapping, but merely incidental to his other crimes, and to properly file a motion for a judgment of acquittal as to the charge of kidnapping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Our examination of the record on appeal and the briefs and arguments of the parties persuades us that the petitioner's appeal should be dismissed.

Specifically, the petitioner in the three count complaint alleges that: (1) he is actually innocent of the crimes of which he was convicted; (2) his trial defense counsel, Attorney Gerald Beaudoin, was ineffective in his representation of the petitioner at his criminal trial; and (3) that his appellate counsel, Attorney Beaudoin, was ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   During the July 29, 2014 trial on the merits of this habeas petition, the court received testimony from the petitioner, his trial defense counsel, Attorney Beaudoin, Attorney John Walkley, inmate Stephen Nelson, and inmate Ian Wright. Finally, the court received various pieces of documentary evidence, including the petitioner's criminal trial transcript, into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   FINDINGS OF FACT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   1. The petitioner was a defendant in a criminal case proceeding in the judicial district of Hartford under Docket No. CR-08-06918868T in which, after a trial to a jury on October 22, 2009, he was found guilty of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134a (4), conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-134a (4), as well as kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (B) and 53a-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   2. These charges arose out of a home invasion that took place in Bloomfield on August 10, 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   3. The jury could reasonably find the following facts to be true. \"At approximately 11:30 p.m. on August 10, 2004, Stephan Julian arrived at her home in Bloomfield. At that time, her son, Damien Gardner, resided with her but was not present that night. As Julian entered the house, she was confronted by a man with a gun. A second man, also armed with a gun, quickly emerged. Because the faces of both men were covered, Julian\n   could not recognize them, but she was able to determine that they were both dark skinned with Jamaican accents. The men repeatedly asked Julian where money was located in the house and forced her to lie on the floor in a downstairs bathroom while they searched the house. The men periodically checked on Julian, and she could hear them going up and down the stairs of her home. At one point, she heard an upstairs toilet flush. Eventually, when Julian no longer heard the men in her home, she peeked out of the bathroom and saw that it was light outside. She exited the bathroom and called the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   4. \"Detective Eric Kovanda was primarily responsible for processing the crime scene. In addition to other forensic evidence, Kovanda collected two urine samples from the rim of the toilet located in one of the upstairs bathrooms. The DNA profile developed from the urine swabs did not match any in the existing offender databases. In 2006, two jailhouse informants identified the [petitioner] as a suspect,\n   and, consequently, on February 11, 2008, the police collected a DNA sample from the [petitioner] for comparison to the DNA profile developed from the urine samples that had been collected from the crime scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   5. \"On February 28, 2008, Kovanda met with the [petitioner] to discuss the August 11, 2004 incident. The [petitioner] indicated that he knew Julian's son, Gardner, and that he had been at their house a week or a few days prior to August 11, 2004.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   6. The petitioner was sentenced by the court (\n   <em>\n    Dewey, J\n   </em>\n   .) to a prison term of twenty years on the charge of robbery in the first degree, twenty years to run concurrent on the conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, and twenty-five years,\n   <em>\n    to run consecutive\n   </em>\n   on\n   the count of kidnapping in the first degree. The total effective sentence was a commitment to the custody of the respondent for forty-five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   7. Additional facts will be discussed, as necessary, in subsequent portions of this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The petitioner now comes before this court seeking to have this court order that the petitioner's conviction be set aside and the matter returned to the docket for further proceedings. The petitioner's major argument is that his trial defense counsel was constitutionally deficient in his performance of duties and that therefore, the petitioner was deprived of the assistance of the competent counsel guaranteed to him by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution, thereby rendering his confinement by the respondent illegal. While there are other claims, the petitioner mounts his primary attack upon his trial defense counsel for his failure to file a motion for a finding of not guilty as to the charge of kidnapping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It is important to understand that this instant proceeding is an action seeking the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. This case is now in what is often termed the \"court of last resort.\" A petition for a writ of habeas corpus is, therefore, an application for\n   <em>\n    extraordinary\n   </em>\n   judicial relief in which, contrary to the criminal trial court, the burden rests with the petitioner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Notwithstanding the arguments raised by counsel and the petitioner, the court disagrees with the position of the petitioner and will deny the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   At the outset, one must understand that there is a critical difference between the legal status of a person who has been accused of a crime as opposed to one who has been convicted of a crime. While the person who has been accused of a crime is entitled to a presumption of his or her innocence, the petitioner in a habeas corpus petition is not. \"It is undoubtedly true that '[a] person when first charged with a crime is entitled to a presumption of innocence, and may insist that his guilt be\n   established beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    In re Winship\n   </em>\n   , 397 U.S. [358,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054393\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/358/\">\n    90 S.

Consequently, the burden of proving entitlement to the grant of a writ rests with the petitioner. \"Thus, in the eyes of the law, [the] petitioner does not come before the Court as one who is innocent, [but, on the contrary, as] one who has been convicted by due process of law ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

The petitioner is not, therefore, in the role of a \"defendant,\" but is instead, a \"convict.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The writ of habeas corpus is an ancient and time-honored component of our Anglo-American jurisprudence. \"We do well to bear in mind the extraordinary prestige of the Great Writ, habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, in Anglo-American jurisprudence: 'the most celebrated writ in the English law.' 3 Blackstone Commentaries 129. It is 'a writ antecedent to statute, and throwing its root deep into the genius of our common law. ...

It is axiomatic that at the time of the petitioner's\n   criminal trial, \"to commit a kidnapping in conjunction with another crime, a defendant must intend to prevent the victim's liberation for a longer period of time or to a greater degree than that which is necessary to commit the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Whether the movement or confinement of the victim is merely incidental to and necessary for another crime will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of each case.\n   <em>\n    Consequently, when the evidence reasonably supports a finding that the restraint was not merely incidental to the commission of some other, separate crime, the ultimate factual determination must be made by the jury\n   </em>\n   . For purposes of making that determination, the jury should be instructed to consider the various relevant factors, including the nature and duration of the victim's movement or confinement by the defendant, whether that movement or confinement occurred during the commission of the separate offense, whether the restraint was inherent in the nature of the separate offense, whether the restraint prevented the victim from summoning assistance, whether the restraint reduced the defendant's risk of detection and whether the restraint created a significant danger or increased the victim's risk of harm independent of that posed by the separate offense.\" (Emphasis altered; footnote omitted.) Id., at 547-48,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20A.2d%201092\">\n    949 A.2d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The petitioner's theory of defense at his trial was that he did not commit these crimes, which, given the inability of the victim to identify the perpetrators, was not an altogether bad decision. The petitioner complains in his habeas petition that his trial defense counsel was deficient in his performance by neither raising the\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   defense in a motion for a finding of not guilty before the trial judge and by failing to make that argument to the jury. It is uncontested that the trial defense counsel did neither, and this court makes that\n   specific finding of fact. It is also uncontested that in her instructions to the jury, the trial court correctly and clearly gave a proper\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   instruction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The issue having been submitted to the jury after having received appropriate instructions, of course, left the determination as to whether the restraint involved in this case was incidental to the robbery as a question of fact to be made by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Notwithstanding, the issue as to whether this factual determination should have been presented to the jury was not resolved at the petitioner's criminal trial. Trial defense counsel never moved for a finding of not guilty on the kidnapping charge on this basis, nor did he make such an argument to the jury. At the habeas trial, counsel clearly explained that he made the conscious decision not to do so because he did not want to lose credibility with the judge or the jury. Although it is clear that lawyers are free to make conflicting, mutually exclusive arguments to juries, there is the inherent risk that in so\n   doing the credibility of a defense could suffer. In this case, the defense strategy was that the petitioner did not commit the crime. To make the argument to the jury, even though he was not the perpetrator, that the restraint involved in the case was merely incidental to the robbery was a risky strategy. Even though such an argument would be permissible, trial defense counsel was correct in believing that doing so could cause him to lose credibility with the jury and thereby harm the petitioner's case. Consequently, he made the strategic decision to eschew such an argument. This court cannot find that this strategic decision was unwarranted or unsound and, therefore, will not find that the failure\n   on the part of trial defense counsel to do so was deficient performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The same finding cannot be made in regard to the decision not to move for a finding of not guilty with the trial judge before the case even went to the jury. This court will find it was deficient performance on the part of trial defense counsel not to raise such a motion with the trial judge. The main distinction between raising the motion to the judge and making a similar argument to the jury is that the judge would be deciding the motion as a matter of law, while jury would be finding facts. Simply put, while there could be some blowback from making a seemingly incongruous argument to the jury, there was no risk of that in presenting the motion for a finding of not guilty to the judge. Consequently, this court finds that the trial defense counsel was deficient in his performance of duty to the petitioner by not raising the motion to the trial court judge. This finding is but the first hurdle the petitioner must clear in order to prove ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This court must now evaluate whether the deficient performance by trial defense counsel prejudiced the petitioner. In other words, is it reasonably probable that the deficient performance caused the result of the trial to be unreliable. The answer to this will turn upon a determination by this habeas court as to whether it is reasonably probable that had the trial court judge been presented with that motion, would she have granted it? To answer that question, this court has carefully [reviewed] all of the testimony in the petitioner's criminal trial focusing on the issue of whether there was any evidence that a reasonably prudent jury might use to decide the restraint issue adversely to the government. First of all, we have the fact that the jury did not make such a finding. Moreover, there is nothing in the\n   record that in any way makes that finding clearly erroneous or unreasonable. In other words, a reading of the transcript clearly shows that the facts surrounding the movement and restraint of the victim in this case shows that there is more than ample evidence by which any reasonable jury could conclude that \"\n   <em>\n    that the restraint was not merely incidental to the commission of some other, separate crime\n   </em>\n   .\" It is expressly found that any reasonable jurist, and in particular, the trial judge in the petitioner's criminal case, would agree with that assessment and would deny a motion for a finding of not guilty and allow the factual issue to go to the jury. Consequently, the petitioner has failed to show the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , that is, prejudice, and relief shall not be forthcoming.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   CLAIM OF ACTUAL INNOCENCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In count one of the amended petition, the petitioner has alleged a claim of actual innocence. This claim shall fail as well for\n   the following reasons.

Employing the same standard for both petitions would ignore the legislative determination embodied in the statute of limitations. The principal purpose of the writ of habeas corpus is to serve as a bulwark against violations of fundamental fairness. ... Whether there has been such a violation must be determined, not only with regard to the petitioner's claim, but also with regard to the effect of the issuance of the writ on the strong interest in the finality of judgments ... and the other interests embodied in the statute of limitations. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"[The Supreme Court has], therefore, imposed on a habeas corpus petitioner certain requirements that reflect these policy interests.

[The Supreme Court has] also adopted the 'cause and prejudice' standard for the reviewability in a habeas corpus proceeding of constitutional claims not adequately preserved at trial ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \"Those requirements, which stem largely from the fact that a habeas corpus petition may properly be brought at any time, rest in significant part on the costs to the public interests that are incurred when the state is required to retry a defendant many years after the events in question. ... The wholesale transplanting of the petition for a new trial standard to a habeas corpus petition based on a claim of actual innocence would not give due respect to those considerations. The petitioner who thinks that there is newly discovered evidence sufficient to overturn his verdict would have no incentive to bring that evidence before the court\n   within the three year limitations period, and there would be no consequence of his failure to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   ...

Consequently, even though the final resolution of the newly discovered evidence standard has yet to be addressed by the Supreme Court, it is beyond argument that insofar as any Superior Court considering a [claim] of actual innocence in a habeas petition, the matter is closed. The Appellate Court has spoken, and that precedent is binding in Superior Court unless and until changed by the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To summarize, then, the newly discovered evidence requirement is satisfied if the evidence is: (1) not cumulative; (2) was not available to the petitioner at the time of his criminal trial; and (3) could not have been discovered by him at that time through the exercise of due diligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The newly discovered evidence in these petitions that has been alleged by the petitioner consists entirely of the testimony of one Ian Wright, currently an inmate in the Department of Correction and a self-styled \"jailhouse lawyer.\" Mr. Wright, a convicted felon, testified in the instant habeas case and reported that, about one year ago, he engaged inmate Stephen \"Sticky\" Nelson in conversation and that Mr. Nelson admitted he had lied in his testimony before the petitioner's trial. Putting aside the obvious credibility issues inherent with this testimony, it is arguable that the testimony of Mr. Wright was not available to the petitioner at his trial and, since the alleged conversation took place some four years after the conclusion of the petitioner's trial, could not have been discovered by him at that time even with the exercise of due diligence. However, the evidence is certainly cumulative and cannot be considered newly discovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The discrediting of the testimony of Mr. Nelson was a key component of the trial strategy of trial defense counsel, and he did so in a highly professional manner. Indeed, the cross-examination went a long way to discredit the testimony of Mr. Nelson at trial. Notwithstanding, the petitioner was convicted in large part because there was DNA evidence linking him to the crime, cell phone records linking him to the crime and his evasive answers given to the police as to his location at the time of the crime. Had inmate Wright been available for trial and testified as he did in the habeas trial, his testimony, even if deemed credible by the jury (a most unlikely event, given everything surrounding it) would not have been likely to have swayed the jury to an acquittal. Moreover, while inmate Wright's hearsay testimony was admissible under \u00a7 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence at the habeas trial only because inmate Nelson exercised his fifth amendment right to silence, Nelson\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   testify at the petitioner's\n   criminal trial, so Wright's testimony would not have been admissible. Consequently, the \"evidence\" would have been cumulative, and the actual innocence claim falls on that basis.\n   As a result of all of the foregoing, the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is, therefore, denied and the petition dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Affirmed.\n    <em>\n     Thompson v.
