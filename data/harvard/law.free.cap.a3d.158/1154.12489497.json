Caron imposed money bail as a condition of Smith's release. Smith became angry and shouted at Caron. As a result, Smith was charged with threatening a State or local official.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 27, 2016, a jury trial was held in the Circuit Court for Washington County. Smith was convicted by the jury and sentenced to three years' incarceration, all suspended, with nine months to be served in home detention, followed by a period of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Smith timely appealed, asking:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   I. Did the trial court commit plain error in failing to require the jury to find that\n   the Appellant intended to threaten the complainant?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   II. Did the trial court err in finding sufficient evidence to convict the Appellant for threatening a State or local official in the manner charged in the State's indictment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   III. Did the trial court err in admitting testimony that the Appellant spat in the direction of the complainant?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 13, 2015, Caron met with Smith following his arrest (the \"Initial Appearance\"). Caron testified that after she set money bail, Smith became furious. Caron testified that Smith \"exploded and started cursing, yelling profanities. He said, 'Fuck you bitch.' \" Caron testified that Smith also shouted, \"I'm going to find you,\" and \"You better find another job.\" Caron further testified that Smith put his finger up, made eye\n   contact with her, and said, \"I'm going to find you\" while thrusting his finger into the glass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The guards then came to take him away. Deputy John Hinman of the Washington County Detention Center testified that, as Smith started to leave the room, \"he turned back around and spit towards the Commissioner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In a pretrial motion\n   <em>\n    in limine,\n   </em>\n   defense counsel moved to exclude any mention of why Smith had been arrested, citing Maryland Rule \u00a7 5-404(b), which generally prohibits admission of evidence of the defendant's prior bad acts, outside of the crime charged. The prosecutor and defense counsel agreed that there would be no mention of the arrest warrant or Smith's criminal history. Rather, they agreed to stipulate to the jury that Smith had been at the Initial Appearance to be given information about his rights, and that the case for which he was coming in was subsequently dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defense counsel also moved to exclude any testimony that Smith spat in the direction of Caron at the conclusion of the meeting. The spitting occurred out of Caron's view. The circuit court denied the motion, finding that the testimony about the spitting was admissible to provide context to Smith's words. Defense counsel objected when Deputy Hinman testified that Smith spat in the direction of Caron.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Before the circuit court instructed the jury, defense counsel renewed a motion for judgment of acquittal. Defense counsel noted that the charging document in this case narrowed the charge by alleging that Smith threatened to create bodily injury to a State official, while omitting mention of other modes of threatening. That motion was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Additional facts will be provided as they become relevant to our discussion, below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Intent to Threaten\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Smith avers that the circuit court committed plain error, which requires reversal, by failing to require the jury to find that Smith intended to threaten Caron.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Smith relies on\n   <em>\n    Elonis v.

According to the Supreme Court, the pattern jury instruction requiring the government to prove only that a reasonable person would regard the communication as a threat was erroneous and, thus, it reversed the conviction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589931\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2001/#p2012\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Smith asserts that the jury instruction in\n   <em>\n    Elonis\n   </em>\n   is \"substantially similar to the instruction propounded in the instance case\" and, therefore, employs a negligence standard of intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The State responds by distinguishing the law under which Smith was convicted, Md. Code (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-708(b) of the Criminal Law Article (\"CL\"), which includes an intent element, from the federal threats statute, which did not include an intent element. The State also avers that the jury instructions adequately addressed the intent requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Smith recognizes that this issue was unpreserved for appeal because defense counsel did not object at the time of the jury instruction. However, Smith asks that we exercise our discretion to recognize plain error under Maryland Rules 4-325(e) and 8-131. \"Plain error is 'error which vitally affects a defendant's right to a fair trial.' \"\n   <em>\n    Richmond v.

He argues that each of the factors weigh strongly in his favor, most notably that this is an issue of first impression since this is the first time the question has been raised since\n   <em>\n    Elonis\n   </em>\n   . He also asserts that it would afford this Court an opportunity to address the question of if a jury must be instructed to determine whether the defendant intended to threaten as an element of the crime.

The following exchange occurred regarding the admission of the spitting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   THE COURT: Well, and to me that's an uncharged act.

I mean, it's part of the, his, part of his conduct as to his person and how is it not admissible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: Well, I think it simply paints a picture that is not necessary to the charge of actually making a threat to a State official in this case. It's outside of her presence. He's not charged with an assault. If he'd been charged with an assault in this case we'd be having a different discussion but he's not. He's simply charged with an oral threat with a State official. There's nothing in the language of Section 3709 that says a gesture or a motion can constitute a threat. It has to be an oral or written statement that's a threat. Spitting is not an oral or written statement so I think it is outside of what is relevant to the charge of threatening a State official.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   THE STATE: Your Honor, often times when you have a statement that is not\n   completely explicit like you do in this case you have to take the context. The context is important. If he were laughing and joking and said this we may not\n   even be here. But the fact that he spit at the end of it after having several outbursts is part of the context of whether he meant it as a threat and whether the trier of fact can determine that it was a threat or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   THE COURT: I do think that it's necessary information. For example, if instead of that if he, you know, were making a punching motion while it may not have been charged as an intent to frighten assault it certainly would be part of his demeanor and character during the time that these statements were made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: And if it had happened during the Initial Appearance again I think it's something that we'd be having a difference discussion over but this happened outside the Initial Appearance. She doesn't even see it happen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   THE COURT: Right. But the statute-The purpose of the statute is not to limit what the person sees or is exposed to. The purpose of the statute is to get to any, any threat made. I do think it's a part of the relevant context. I think it's probative as to what was meant by the statements that were made. And it's not unfairly prejudicial. It's not going to mislead the jury. It's not going to confuse the jury. It's simply part of the context of what was said or done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defense counsel objected during the trial when a State's witness testified about the spitting, properly preserving this question for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Maryland Rule 5-403 provides that \"[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" Whether evidence is relevant under Maryland Rule 5-403 is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Brooks v.

The Court held that the trial court properly allowed the jury to consider evidence of the robberies, carjacking, and murders that surrounded the kidnapping for which the defendant on trial, because these acts took place \"during the criminal episode.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688205\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/412/593/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688205\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/412/593/\">\n    at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688205\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/412/593/\">\n    989 A.2d 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the prohibition against \"other crimes\" evidence does not apply to evidence of wrongs \"that arise during the same transaction and are intrinsic to the charged crime[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688205\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/412/593/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688205\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/412/593/\">\n    at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688205\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/412/593/\">\n    989 A.2d 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Odum\n   </em>\n   Court defined \"intrinsic\" in this context to mean, at a minimum:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   other crimes that are so connected or blended in point of time or circumstances with the crime or crimes charged that they form a single transaction, and the crime or crimes charged cannot be fully shown or explained without evidence of the other crimes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688205\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/412/593/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Therefore, before turning to the merits of Smith's assertion that the circuit court did not property apply the three-prong test, we must first determine whether the spitting occurred during \"the criminal episode,\" and we hold that it did. Here,\n   Smith's spitting at Caron was sufficiently connected with the orally communicated threats to form a \"single transaction\" as identified by the\n   <em>\n    Odum\n   </em>\n   Court. The entire interview lasted only approximately half an hour. No events intervened between the communications to Caron and the spitting. The oral communications and the spitting all occurred in the same geographic location. For these reasons, we agree that the spitting was sufficiently connected to the single episode so as to be offered for context to the act, not as an \"other\" act under Md. Rule 5-404(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Moreover, the purpose of the rule would not be served by excluding this testimony. The purpose of the rule is to keep a jury\n   from assuming the commission of one crime based on the commission of another crime or act. Here, Smith's conduct is undisputed. Rather, it was the significance of the conduct that mattered. Therefore, the spitting did not unfairly suggest that Smith committed the act, but rather, appropriately provided context for the act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Accordingly, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony, and we need not turn to the merits of the argument regarding the application of the\n   <em>\n    Faulkner\n   </em>\n   three-prong test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY AFFIRMED.
