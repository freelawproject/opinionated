In May, 2012, A.C. was terminated from her position as an assistant attorney general with appellee, the Office of the Attorney General (\"the OAG\"). Thereafter, A.C. filed a charge of race discrimination and retaliation against the OAG with the Commission. Almost three years later, the Commission issued a finding of no probable cause that a discriminatory act occurred. The Commission further denied A.C.'s subsequent request for reconsideration. A.C.'s\n   complaint was then forwarded to the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which ultimately upheld the Commission's findings. Pending the EEOC's review, A.C. filed a petition for judicial review of the Commission's decision to deny her request for reconsideration in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. On April 5, 2016, the circuit court dismissed the petition for judicial review.\n   A.C. presents four issues for our review, which we have reworded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   1. Whether the circuit court erred when it denied A.C.'s petition for judicial review of the Commission's decision to deny A.C.'s request for reconsideration, where no statute conferred authority on the circuit court to hear the petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   2. Whether the circuit court erred when it permitted the Commission and the OAG to file motions to dismiss more than thirty days after each received notice of the petition for judicial review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   3. Whether the circuit court erred when it dismissed A.C.'s petition for judicial review without requiring the Commission to transmit its investigative files to the circuit court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   4. Whether the circuit court erred when it denied A.C.'s motion to amend her complaint to include a motion for a writ of mandamus to require the OAG to provide certain disciplinary procedures permitted to certain employees under Md. Code (1984, 2014 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 11-106(a) of the State Personnel and Pensions Article (\"SP\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2005, A.C. was appointed as an Assistant Attorney General in the Office of the Attorney General. On May 4, 2012, A.C. was terminated from her position. On October 29, 2012, A.C. filed an administrative complaint with the Commission alleging that her termination was based on race discrimination and retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 1, 2015, the Commission issued its written decision in which it found that A.C.'s performance \"proved less than satisfactory.\" A.C. asserts that she was not provided with any information regarding the reason for her termination on the day she was terminated. The Commission agreed with A.C.'s assessment, but found that the absence of information was consistent with the OAG's procedure regarding the termination of an employee who serves as a \"Special Appointment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Commission's written findings provide that A.C.'s termination was the \"result of her documented consistent unwillingness to comply with her supervisor's requests,\" her unprofessional conduct (as documented in email exchanges between her and her supervisor), and other short-falls, such as her failure to recognize settlement opportunities. The Commission found that in addition to her unprofessional conduct, A.C. failed to put forward evidence of any discriminatory conduct towards her based on race. The Commission, therefore, determined that there was \"[n]o Probable Cause to believe that the [OAG] discriminated against [A.C.] because of race under Title 20, Subtitle 6 of the State Government Article.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Along with the written findings of the Commission, A.C. received a letter, dated October 1, 2015, explaining her right to pursue the claim and that she had additional appeal rights with the EEOC.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Please note that this charge was dually filed with the [EEOC]. Accordingly, the Complainant has additional appeal rights with the EEOC. The Complainant is entitled to request EEOC to perform a \"Substantial Weight Review\" of the Commission's final finding. To obtain a\n   Substantial Weight Review, the Complainant must make [his or her] request in writing, within 15 days of receipt of this letter. The request for review should contain the Complainant's name, charge number and any other additional information the Complainant believes would be helpful for the EEOC's review. Otherwise, the EEOC will generally adopt the Commission's findings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Additionally, the Complainant has the right to request a Federal Notice of Right to Sue from the EEOC which would enable the Complainant to file a complaint in Federal District Court. The issuance of a Notice of Right to Sue will normally result in EEOC terminating all further processing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 15, 2015, A.C. submitted a request for reconsideration with the Commission. On November 15, 2015, after a review of the investigative file, the Commission denied reconsideration\n   pursuant to COMAR 14.03.01.08C. The letter included the following paragraph:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   You have the right to pursue your complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or in the United States District Court for Maryland upon obtaining a Notice of Right to Sue from the EEOC. You must notify the EEOC in writing within 15 days of this letter to request a review of the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights final decision ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On or around the same day that A.C. submitted a request for reconsideration with the Commission, she also submitted a request for review to the EEOC. Thereafter, the\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   EEOC reviewed the findings and investigative file of the Commission and the additional information provided by A.C. The EEOC upheld the findings of the Commission. A letter dated December 15, 2015 to A.C. included the following information:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   This review failed to reveal that the [Commission] was deficient in its investigation of your charges, and specifically, that it did not correctly apply the laws that EEOC enforces when examining the evidence and reaching its findings of facts. As a result, I am recommending that the previous findings of the [Commission], that there was no probable cause to believe that the law had been violated, be upheld.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   In view of the above, your charge with EEOC is dismissed. Enclosed herein is a Notice of Rights which will enable you to file a lawsuit in Federal Court, should you so desire, within 90 days. We regret that we cannot be of further assistance to you in this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A separate document, included with the letter, provided notice to A.C. of her right to bring a claim under federal law (i.e. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) based on race discrimination in federal court and that, if brought in federal court, it must be brought within 90 days of receiving the document. Finally, additional information regarding A.C.'s right to pursue the case was attached to the notice, which included the following information and instructions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   At\n   the time you filed your charge with the [Commission], you were notified in writing by the [Commission] that it would dual-file your charge for you with the [U.S. EEOC] in order to preserve your right to file a lawsuit in Federal District Court. The [Commission] ... notified you in writing of the reason for its closure of your charge .... EEOC has reviewed and adopted the [Commission's] findings, and has closed the dual-filed EEOC charge. ...\n   <em>\n    This Dismissal &amp; Notice of Rights authorizes you to file a lawsuit in Federal District Court\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    within 90 days if you choose to do so\n   </em>\n   .... EEOC does not encourage or discourage such legal action; [...]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   If however, you do elect to file a lawsuit,\n   <em>\n    you must do so with a Federal District Court within 90 days of the date you received the Dismissal &amp; Notice of Rights\n   </em>\n   , not the date it is dated. [ ...]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   If you are going to file a lawsuit and need to obtain a copy of the information obtained during the [Commission's] processing of your charge, make your request promptly in writing to the [Commission] that investigated your charge (NOT EEOC). EEOC does not obtain the [Commission's] investigative case file.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Emphasis Added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Rather than file a discrimination claim in either federal or state court, A.C. filed a petition for judicial review of the Commission's \"no probable cause\" finding on December 4, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 16, 2015, the Commission sent A.C. a letter confirming that it had received a copy of her petition for judicial review and that the Commission would not be participating as a party. Nevertheless, on February 18, 2016, the Commission filed a \"Motion to Dismiss Petition for Judicial\n   Review and Preclusion from Transmitting Investigative File.\" In its motion, the Commission argued that A.C. was not entitled to judicial review in circuit court, pursuant to Md. Code (1984, 2014 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 20-1005(d) of the State Government Article (\"SG\"), and that \"the Commission was barred from submitting its investigative file as the agency record because the petition is improper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On March 1, 2016, the OAG also filed a motion to dismiss A.C.'s petition for judicial review, pursuant to Rule 7-204(b), and adopted and incorporated the arguments presented in the Commission's motion to dismiss. The OAG asserted, as both the OAG and the Commission continue to argue on appeal, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The [EEOC], which assumed jurisdiction over [A.C.'s] claims for discrimination and retaliation, has dismissed her claim of discrimination and issued her Notice of Right to Sue .... Thus, the Commission's finding of no probable cause for discrimination and retaliation is not subject to judicial review by this [c]ourt. SG \u00a7 20-1005(d)(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Neither A.C. nor the OAG or the Commission requested a hearing on their motions to dismiss filed in the circuit court. On April 5, 2016, the circuit court granted the OAG's motion to dismiss, granted the Commission's \"Motion to Dismiss Petition for Judicial Review and Preclusion from Transmitting Investigative File,\" and denied A.C.'s request for leave to amend her complaint to include a request for a writ of mandamus. The court's decision was based, in part, on its finding that a \"no probable cause\" finding by the Commission in this case was \"not an appealable final order subject to judicial review in [the circuit court],\" and that A.C. \"has, and has had, an avenue through which to seek legal recourse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Federal and State Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In Maryland, both state and federal agencies provide a remedy for individuals who bring claims of race discrimination in employment. At the federal level, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees from discrimination in his or her \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2. The EEOC is the federal agency charged with enforcing Title VII and other anti-discrimination statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   When a complaint is filed with the EEOC, the agency investigates the complaint and determines whether there is reasonable cause to believe the allegations of discrimination.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201601.21\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If reasonable cause exists, the EEOC may decide to pursue a claim on behalf of the aggrieved party. The EEOC, however, does not have the authority to fully adjudicate claims of discrimination and impose sanctions on employers-a power that remains with the federal courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-4 ;\n   <em>\n    Laber v.

If the EEOC does not find reasonable cause, or in some situations upon request from the claimant prior to the conclusion of the investigation, the EEOC issues a \"Right to Sue\" letter allowing the claimant to file a private civil action in a U.S. District Court.\n   <em>\n    Laber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"997009\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/404/#p416\">\n    438 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   416 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201601.28\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As in the instant case, the EEOC works with state and local fair employment practices agencies (\"FEP\") who administer similar state anti-discrimination laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-8(b). The Maryland Civil Rights Act protects the same classes as those covered by Title VII, including race, as well as additional classes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SG \u00a7 20-606(a). In Maryland, the Commission, a FEP agency, is authorized under SG \u00a7 20-207 to hold investigatory hearings \"[w]henever any problem of racial discrimination arises .... to resolve the problem promptly by gathering all of the facts from each interested party and mak[e] recommendations as necessary.\" SG \u00a7 20-207(d)(1). If the Commission's investigation does not find probable cause that the alleged discriminatory act occurred, it must issue its written findings and dismiss the complaint. SG \u00a7 20-1009. If the EEOC subsequently reviews the complaint, the EEOC \"may utilize the information\n   gathered by\" the Commission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201601.15\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   If the Commission finds no probable cause that the discriminatory act occurred, or if the claimant wishes to bring her claim in state court prior to the conclusion of the investigation, she may elect to file a civil action in the circuit court in the county where the alleged unlawful act occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SG \u00a7 20-1013. To bring a private action, the claimant must have \"initially filed a timely administrative ... complaint;\" \"at least 180 days have elapsed since the filing of the administrative ... complaint;\" and the claimant must file the civil action in state court \"within two years after the unlawful employment practice occurred.\" SG \u00a7 20-1013(a). Filing a civil action terminates any ongoing proceedings before the Commission and shifts the authority to provide remedies available under SG \u00a7 20-1009(b) to the circuit court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SG \u00a7 20-1013(c) -(d). In contrast to the two-year statutory limitations period under\n   state law, however, receipt of a \"Right to Sue\" letter from the EEOC upon completion of its review provides the claimant ninety days to file a civil claim in federal court, regardless of the date of the alleged unlawful act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We analyze A.C.'s arguments on appeal through the lens of this state and federal framework. A.C.'s claim was reviewed by both the Commission under Maryland law and the EEOC under Title VII. Ultimately, the EEOC upheld and adopted the Commission's findings and dismissed A.C.'s EEOC complaint. In accordance with the procedures outlined\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the EEOC included a \"Notice of Rights\" (i.e. \"Right to Sue\") letter along with the notice of the EEOC's dismissal of her claim. At this point, because A.C. did not file a civil action in state court within two years of the date of her termination in 2012, the time for A.C. to file a private action in state court had expired. In contrast, upon receiving the \"Right to Sue\" letter-sent on or around December 15, 2015-A.C. was permitted to file a civil action in the U.S. District Court for Maryland under federal law within ninety days. Rather than filing in federal court, however, A.C. filed a petition for judicial review of the Commission's decision in the circuit court in an attempt to appeal the Commission's finding of no probable cause and denial of reconsideration. As we discuss below, a petition for judicial review of the Commission's decision is not a proper avenue available to A.C. for pursuing her claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Circuit Court Did Not Err When It Dismissed A.C.'s Petition For Judicial Review.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The issue before us is whether the circuit court erred-as a matter of law-in granting the OAG's and the\n   Commission's motion to dismiss. Stated differently, we determine whether the circuit court was authorized to consider the petition for judicial review of the Commission's ultimate determination. We conclude that no statute, rule or case law authorized the circuit court to entertain A.C.'s petition for judicial review. As a result, the court was legally correct in dismissing A.C.'s petition for judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A statute must authorize judicial review for the circuit court to have authority\n   over a petition for judicial review from an administrative agency's order or action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Rule 7-201(a) (\"The rules in this Chapter [Judicial Review of Administrative Agency Decisions] govern actions for judicial review of ... an order or action of an administrative agency, where judicial review is authorized by statute ....\"). As we observed in\n   <em>\n    Oltman v. Maryland State Bd. of Physicians\n   </em>\n   ,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Title 7, Chapter 200 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure explicitly applies to \"judicial review of ... an order or action of an administrative agency,\n   <em>\n    where judicial review is authorized by statute\n   </em>\n   [.]\" Md. Rule 7-201(a) (emphasis added). This is consistent with the well-established principle that, \"in order for an administrative agency's action properly to be before ... any court[ ] for judicial review, there generally must be a legislative grant of the right to seek judicial review.\"\n   <em>\n    Harvey v.

Here, the Commission is the administrative agency that rendered the challenged decision. As such, it was clearly entitled to respond to the petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oltman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837680\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/182/65/#p73\">\n    182 Md.App. at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837680\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/182/65/#p73\">\n    957 A.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that an administrative board that issued the challenged decision may \"challenge a petitioner's right to obtain judicial review of its decision via a 'preliminary motion.' \"). Thus, under these circumstances, the Commission is a proper respondent to A.C.'s action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   A.C.'s argument that the OAG did not have standing to challenge her petition for judicial review rests on A.C.'s view that the OAG \"does not have a stake in the application for reconsideration process.\" A.C. describes the process the Commission follows in reviewing an application for reconsideration and points out that the OAG would not be able to participate in the process of the Commission's review of her application for reconsideration. Therefore, A.C. argues that the OAG is not a stakeholder in the outcome of her petition for judicial review. Had A.C. filed a proper action, the federal or state trial court's review of the case would not have focused on the Commission's decision denying A.C.'s request for reconsideration. As explained,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , A.C. improperly petitioned for judicial review of a decision that the circuit court does not have the statutory authority to review. As a result, the OAG\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   was certainly entitled to file a motion to dismiss, and to include as a basis for its motion the circuit court's lack of authority to entertain the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, A.C. argues that both the Commission and the OAG's responses were filed too late. Pursuant to Md. Rule 7-204, a respondent must to file a response to a petition for judicial review within thirty days of notice of the petition, unless the court extends that time. The Commission did not file a response until more than two months after it received notice of the petition, and the OAG filed its motion more than a week later. A.C. contends that \"had the situation been reversed and a private party like A.C.... did not comply with the time limits for filing a response, ... the private party would not have been allowed\n   to participate in the review.\" A.C. overlooks the vastly different roles that a petitioner and a respondent play in the course of bringing an action in the circuit court. Indeed, separate statutes govern a petitioner's and a respondent's pleading requirements. In\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs. v. Neal\n   </em>\n   , a case in which the administrative agency petitioned for judicial review and the respondent was a private person, we explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Unlike Rule 7-203 ..., Rule 7-204 expressly grants the court discretion to extend the time for filing a response to the petition; and the language of Rule 7-204 does not preclude the court from exercising that discretion to extend the filing deadline retroactively, after it has passed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"446126\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/160/496/#p509\">\n    160 Md.App. 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 509,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"446126\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/160/496/#p509\">\n    864 A.2d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Although the rule permits the trial court to reject a late response, it does not require the court to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md.

The Commission Was Not Required To Transmit Its Confidential Investigative Files To The Circuit Court.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A.C. contends that she was entitled to have the Commission's investigatory file transmitted to the circuit court. Section \u00a7 20-1101(a), State Government Article, provides the following statutory framework regarding the Commission's requirement to keep its investigative files confidential:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   during an investigation of a complaint alleging a discriminatory act, and until the matter reaches the stage of public hearings:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (i) the activities of all members and employees of the Commission in connection with the investigation shall be conducted in confidence and without publicity ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   SG \u00a7 20-1101. Additionally, pursuant to COMAR 14.03.01.19, \"request[s] for information relating to investigative files before the charge has reached the public hearing stage will be denied, except those made pursuant to [SG \u00a7 20-1101 ].\" A \"public hearing\" is a \"public hearing before either the Office of Administrative Hearings or any federal or State court of law.\" COMAR 14.03.01.18B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As we have explained, the circuit court did not have the statutory authority to entertain A.C.'s petition for judicial review of the Commission's denial of A.C.'s request for reconsideration. The circuit court, therefore, properly dismissed the petition without a hearing. The Commission was entitled to keep its investigation of A.C.'s complaint confidential until the charge of discrimination and retaliation was properly filed and reached the public hearing stage in either a federal or state court. The circuit court, therefore, did not err when it dismissed the case without requiring the transmission of the Commission's investigative file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. The Circuit Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Denying A.C.'s Motion To Amend Her Complaint To Include A Request For A Writ Of Mandamus.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Finally, A.C. appeals the circuit court's decision to deny her motion to\n   amend her petition for judicial review to include a request for a writ of mandamus, in order to allow her to compel the OAG to provide the procedures available to certain state employees under SP \u00a7 11-106.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our review of a trial court's decision denying a motion to amend a pleading, is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   With respect to procedural issues, a trial court's rulings are given great deference.

Pursuant to SP \u00a7 11-108(b)(1), \"[i]f an employee fails to appeal a decision in accordance with this subtitle, the employee is considered to have accepted the decision.\" Additionally, A.C. was not entitled to the disciplinary procedures she sought to compel under SP \u00a7 11-106, because she was a \"specially appointed\" at-will employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Under SP \u00a7 11-106, certain disciplinary procedures are available to state employees in the skilled and professional services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SP \u00a7 11-102 (providing that the subtitle applies \"to all employees in the State Personnel Management System within the Executive Branch except temporary employees\").

Because of her \"at-will\" status, as well as the post-termination\n   appeals procedures that apply specifically to specially appointed employees, the Court of Appeals has held that SP \u00a7 11-106 protections are afforded to specially appointed employees only for disciplinary actions\n   <em>\n    prior to\n   </em>\n   or other than termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Forster v.

In\n   <em>\n    Smack v.

On the other hand, it is undisputed that \u00a7 11-303 does as well. This being the case, the statutes would appear to be irreconcilably in conflict. Section 11-303 is more narrowly focused, however, than \u00a7 11-106, referring only to one form of disciplinary action, termination. Thus, they can be reconciled by treating \u00a7 11-303, the more specific of the two, as an exception to \u00a7 11-106, the more general. Of course, if there were no \u00a7 11-303, \u00a7 11-106 undoubtedly would apply to the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   . Where, however, as here, there is a provision that specifically, and without any doubt, addresses the termination, as opposed to the discipline generally, of probationary employees, that provision must control over a provision that applies, but only generally, as \u00a7 11-106 does.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Smack v.

Pursuant to SP \u00a7 11-113, however, the employee must file a\n   written appeal within fifteen days after the employee receives notice of the disciplinary action. SP \u00a7 11-113(b)(2)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   A.C. was notified of her termination on May 4, 2012. She did not file an appeal with the OAG until June 21, 2012. The OAG denied A.C.'s appeal based on her failure to submit the appeal within the 15-day appeals period. A.C. was, therefore, not entitled either to an internal appeal of her termination under \u00a7 11-113 due to her delay in submitting an appeal, nor was she afforded the post-termination procedures provided to various other state employees under SP \u00a7 11-106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Therefore, A.C. was not entitled to judicial review of the Commission's decision. Further, the decision to deny A.C.'s motion to amend her complaint was within the sound discretion of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schmerling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"455010\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/368/434/#p443\">\n    368 Md. at 443-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"455010\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/368/434/#p443\">\n    795 A.2d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the court would have been inclined to grant her leave to amend for these reasons, it would have only delayed the same result,\n   as A.C. had no right to the internal pre-termination procedures she sought. Under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying A.C.'s motion to amend her petition for judicial review to seek relief through a writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In sum, A.C. was not entitled to file a petition for judicial review of the Commission's decision to deny reconsideration of her complaint, or upon receipt of the EEOC's \"Right to Sue\" letter. To pursue her race discrimination and retaliation claims in the circuit court, A.C. was required to file a claim within two years of the alleged discriminatory action-in this case, A.C.'s termination. Further, the Commission was not required to transmit the confidential investigative file of the agency to the circuit court upon the filing of A.C.'s unauthorized petition for judicial review. Lastly, A.C. was not entitled to a writ of mandamus compelling the OAG to afford her the internal pre-termination procedures available under SP \u00a7 11-106, or the appeals procedures under SP \u00a7 11-305, for her termination in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The circuit court, therefore, did not err in dismissing A.C.'s petition for judicial review and denying her leave to amend. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court's order (1) granting the OAG's motion to dismiss; (2) granting the Commission's \"motion to dismiss petition for judicial reviewed preclusion from transmitting its investigative file,\" and (3) denying A.C.'s request for leave to amend her complaint to include a request for a writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.
