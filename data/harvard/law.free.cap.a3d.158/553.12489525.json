The voir dire process is critical to ensuring that the courts honor the defendant's right to an impartial jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We decide in this case whether the voir dire process reasonably assured that Petitioner, Ruben Arnez Collins, was tried before an impartial jury. We conclude that the constitutional standard was satisfied and therefore affirm the judgment of conviction. We use this opportunity, though, to encourage trial judges to adopt certain best practices to help achieve the constitutionally-mandated goal of an impartial jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Background and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The issue before us does not require an extensive rendition of the factual and procedural underpinnings of this case. It is enough to note that Collins was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County on charges related to the robbery of a convenience store in Delmar, Maryland. The evidence presented to the jury permitted it to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Collins entered the convenience store brandishing a box cutter, demanded money from the store clerk, and fled with over $100 in cash. The jury found Collins guilty of armed robbery, robbery, second degree assault, theft under $1000, and wear, carry, and transport of a weapon with intent to injure. The court sentenced Collins to twenty years imprisonment for armed robbery and merged the remaining offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Collins noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing, among other claims, that the trial judge had abused his discretion in conducting the voir dire of the prospective jurors. The Court of Special Appeals rejected that argument and in an unreported opinion affirmed the judgment of conviction. We granted Collins's petition for writ of certiorari to review that holding of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    The Voir Dire Process in the Present Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the prospective jurors were sworn,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial judge began the voir dire process with the following: \"All right,\n   ladies and gentlemen [of the venire], I'm going to ask you a series of questions; I'll ask them to you as a group. If your answer to any question is yes, please stand up so I may ask you some additional questions.\" The judge then described the nature of the case to the venire, listing the charges and the name and location of the convenience store where the robbery occurred. The judge did not indicate whether follow-up questions would be asked in open court or at the bench, and did not inform venire members that they could request to answer\n   follow-up questions in relative privacy at the bench.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   No member of the venire responded affirmatively to Questions One through Five. Those questions addressed prior knowledge of the case, predetermined views on guilt, relationship to Collins, relationship to the attorneys, and previous involvement \"in the criminal justice system either as the victim of, a witness to or a person accused of a crime such as that with which the Defendant is charged.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Question Six asked whether any member of the venire or his or her immediate family was employed currently or in the past by a law enforcement agency or a prosecutor's office. That question elicited eleven affirmative responses from the venire. The judge advised those who responded in the affirmative that he would be asking follow-up questions of each of them, individually. At that point, defense counsel asked, \"Your Honor, we're not going to the bench?\" The court replied, \"No.\" Twice thereafter, as the judge questioned other venirepersons who had answered Question Six in the affirmative, defense counsel asked the judge \"that we be permitted to have these answers at the bench.\" The judge denied both requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The first venireperson to be questioned in open court was Juror 582. The judge asked whether he or a family member was employed by law enforcement. Juror 582 replied that he had been employed with the New York City Police Department from 1984 to 2004. The judge then asked: \"Would that affect in any way your ability to fairly and impartially decide a criminal case such as this?\" Juror 582 answered \"no,\" and the judge directed him to take his seat. The judge questioned in the same way the ten other venirepersons who had indicated an affirmative answer to Question Six, asking in some instances for additional detail. Save for Juror 538, each of the others who had responded affirmatively to Question Six advised the judge that, notwithstanding the connection with law enforcement, he or she could fairly and impartially decide the case. The judge brought Juror 538 to the bench for further questioning, asked follow up questions, and, in light of his responses, informed him that he was struck for cause and, once the jury had been picked, he would be dismissed. Juror 538 was dismissed at the conclusion of jury selection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As voir dire progressed, the judge asked additional questions of the full venire, including whether any of the prospective jurors would be more or less inclined to believe a person was guilty because of his race; whether any of them had such strong feelings about the charges in the case that they could not fairly weigh the evidence; whether any of them had religious, moral, or other reasons that would prevent them from deciding the guilt or innocence of another human being; whether any of them knew the possible witnesses in the case; and a final catch-all question asking whether there was any other reason they could not serve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The judge received affirmative responses to two of these questions: whether venire members had religious, moral, or other reasons they could not judge another person; and whether members knew any of the possible witnesses. The judge had those prospective jurors approach the bench for follow-up questions. Thus, only those prospective jurors who responded affirmatively to Question Six, concerning connections\n   with law enforcement or prosecution agencies, were asked follow-up questions in open court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    A. The Parties' Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Collins argues that the trial judge abused his discretion in his handling of the\n   voir dire process and thereby violated Collins's right to a fair and impartial jury. He claims that the violation stemmed from the judge's decision not to invite all venirepersons who provided affirmative responses to approach the bench for follow-up questions, and the judge's failure to inform the venirepersons that they could request to answer at the bench. Collins argues that this procedure discouraged the venirepersons from completely and honestly answering the questions asked of them. He claims that, because many of the questions asked during voir dire could be embarrassing to venirepersons, the trial court's method does not provide the \"reasonable assurance that prejudice would be discovered if present,\" as our jurisprudence requires in order to satisfy the constitutional guarantee of an impartial jury.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"750738\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/374/232/#p242\">\n    374 Md. 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"750738\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/374/232/#p242\">\n    821 A.2d 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The State argues in response that the trial judge acted within the bounds of his discretion in conducting voir dire, which is the standard by which the appellate courts assess the propriety of the trial court's chosen process. In support of that argument, the State notes the following: the judge posed \"single-topic questions\" that were read one at a time; he engaged in individual voir dire of the prospective jurors who indicated an affirmative response by asking them single questions; and he brought to the bench jurors who gave an \"affirmative response to any remotely 'sensitive' topics.\" The State further argues that the standard we have set for review of the conduct of voir dire \"is not that there be no possibility of undiscovered prejudice.\" Rather, as Collins recognizes, \"the standard is that the procedures created a 'reasonable assurance' that prejudice will be discovered.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We have described the voir dire process as \"critical\" to assuring that the federal and state constitutional \"guarantees of a fair and impartial trial [are] honored.\"\n   <em>\n    Stewart v.

We disagree.

The\n   problems identified in the cases above are not present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Collins argues that the potential embarrassment that venire members may anticipate from answering questions in open court is, on its own, such a serious procedural problem that questions in open court should constitute an abuse of discretion. He contends that the mere presence of the other venire members should be considered sufficient to prevent necessary information from reaching the judge-that potential embarrassment is so powerful a force that it should be reversible error to question a venire as a group. But Collins's argument asks for a much higher bar than we have set through our prior cases on this matter, based in a deferential standard of review that seeks only \"\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   assurance that prejudice would be discovered if present,\"\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"750738\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/374/232/#p242\">\n    374 Md. at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"750738\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/374/232/#p242\">\n    821 A.2d 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added), and grants broad latitude to the trial judge in the scope and form of questioning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Collins points out that the trial judge did not assure the venire that, should they have an embarrassing response to any question, they might discuss the response in relative privacy\n   with the judge, in the presence of counsel and Collins, rather than in open court. But, neither did the judge tell the venire that he would engage in public discussion of their responses-he said merely that, \"[i]f your answer to any question is yes, please stand up so I may ask you some additional questions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We agree with Collins that a better method is to inform the jury that follow-up will occur at the bench. Yet, use of a different process, such as the one in the present case, is not automatic grounds for reversal. Maryland law does not require the trial judge to question the venire at the bench. Instead, \"[i]n Maryland, unlike some of our sister jurisdictions, the trial judge may, at his or her discretion, conduct individual voir dire out of the presence of other jurors but is not required to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"750738\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/374/232/#p242\">\n    374 Md. at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"750738\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/374/232/#p242\">\n    821 A.2d 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, the trial judge here asked follow-up questions in open court in regards to only one question-the non-sensitive inquiry into whether any member of the venire was employed or had close relatives employed in law enforcement. For all other questions that elicited affirmative initial responses, including the more sensitive religious and moral concern question, the judge conducted follow-up inquiry at the bench.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We review a judge's conduct of voir dire for abuse of discretion and, when a judge's approach provides reasonable assurance that prejudice will be discovered, the judge has acted within his or her discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"750738\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/374/232/#p242\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"750738\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/374/232/#p242\">\n    at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"750738\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/374/232/#p242\">\n    821 A.2d 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the trial judge asked the questions required by our jurisprudence and in an acceptable form.

We understand, too, the urge to adopt a methodology for conducting voir dire in a manner that expends the least amount of time to select a jury, while remaining compliant with the dictates of our jurisprudence on the subject. We therefore take this opportunity to comment on a best practice for conducting voir dire to provide guidance to judges seeking an efficient, yet thorough jury selection process that seeks to uncover cause for disqualification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As Collins has argued, we have expressed concern regarding questions posed to the venire in open court. In\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , we acknowledged that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [E]ven where the scope of the proposed\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   questioning is otherwise permissible but potentially embarrassing or humiliating, the trial judge should exercise discretion in structuring the questions in a manner which would avoid\n   unnecessarily embarrassing the venire panel. Such questions should be worded in a way that potentially embarrassing responses should be given at the bench, rather than before open court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2023746\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/333/27/#p34\">\n    333 Md. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   36 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2023746\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/333/27/#p34\">\n    633 A.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nevertheless, attention should be paid to how best, in every case, to reasonably ensure the federal and state constitutional guarantee of an impartial jury. \"While we have every confidence in our jurors' abilities to respond intelligently and effectively to inquiries posed during voir dire, we are also\n   duty-bound to eliminate any doubt or error in the process, inasmuch as is possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3686642\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/411/503/#p514\">\n    411 Md. at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3686642\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/411/503/#p514\">\n    983 A.2d 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Guidance on how best to achieve that goal has been further developed by the Maryland State Bar Association's Special Committee on Voir Dire. The Committee's Model Jury Selection Questions for Criminal Trials provides a flexible script with committee notes as a tool for judges in the voir dire process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MARYLAND STATE BAR ASS'N, MODEL JURY SELECTION QUESTIONS FOR CRIMINAL TRIALS , http://www.msba.org/committees/voirdire/default.aspx [https://perma.cc/SCG4-4XAK] (last visited on April 17, 2017). We recommend the procedure outlined in the following committee note:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Before proceeding, judges should advise counsel whether the judge will ask all general questions before asking any follow-up questions. If the judge will take follow-up responses during the general questioning, the judge should also advise counsel whether they may ask follow-up questions directly to prospective jurors or must request that the judge ask specific follow-up questions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Judges (and counsel) must conduct all juror questioning on the record-both general questions of the full jury panel and follow-up questions of individual prospective jurors. Follow up questioning of a prospective juror should usually be conducted out of the hearing of the full panel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   To improve the efficiency of juror questioning and to accommodate persons who may have difficulty walking or standing, judges may choose to ask all general questions first, noting affirmative responses for follow-up questions after the general question period. Judges may conduct individual questioning at the bench or in a conference room where the record and security will be maintained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Committee's document also offers useful model language explaining to the prospective jurors why the voir dire process is important to securing a fair and impartial jury, and outlining how the process will proceed, including that the members of the venire will be sworn-that they will be asked to declare under the penalty of perjury to answer truthfully all\n   questions asked of them. The model provides as well that, if the answer is \"yes\" or \"maybe\" the prospective juror should stand until the judge calls upon him or her, and when called upon, to give only the juror's number.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The proposed practice further suggests that the trial judge should choose one of the following alternatives for handling follow-up questions, and inform the jurors that follow-up questions may be asked at the bench:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Alternative 1\n    </em>\n    : If the judge will ask all general questions before individual follow-up responses, continue:\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   After I finish asking all general questions, I will ask you to come to the bench\n   <em>\n    [conference room]\n   </em>\n   to explain your response out of the hearing of your fellow prospective jurors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Alternative 2\n    </em>\n    : If the judge will ask follow-up questions immediately after initial responses, continue:\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   After you tell me your number, I may ask you to explain or discuss your response. If you do not wish to answer in open court, please let me know. I may ask you to come to the bench at that time, or at a later time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   No one can deny that open court is a formal, public place, staffed with authority figures. Persons called for jury service are among strangers and-except for the rare individual who is familiar with a courtroom setting and the trial process-may be confused by the process or substance of voir dire, much less its importance to the constitutional guarantee of a trial by an impartial jury. The setting alone is likely to intimidate many venirepersons. It is also likely that many prospective jurors have little or no experience speaking in public, much less in answer to a judge's questions, in the formality of a courtroom, and in the presence of a crowd. Finally, it goes almost without saying that the more intimidating the process, the greater the chance that a prospective\n   juror will simply refuse to answer or shy from responding with complete candor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Of the two alternatives proposed by the Committee, we prefer the former because it suggests an approach that provides all venirepersons the greatest degree of privacy while decreasing anxiety and encouraging full disclosure of information relevant to cause for disqualification. Alternative 1 calls for public disclosure, through non-verbal assent only, by those prospective jurors who believe the answer to any given question is \"yes\" or \"maybe\", followed at the appropriate time by subsequent communication with the judge or lawyers at the bench. This alternative avoids both the requirement that the responding juror speak in public as well as the possibility that the juror, wittingly or otherwise, communicates to other venirepersons information that could adversely affect their qualification to serve on the jury. Alternative 1 also eliminates any anxiety that might attend a prospective juror's having to request to respond at the bench, as is contemplated by Alternative 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We appreciate the good work of the Committee and commend to bench and bar alike a review of the model questions in their entirety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The thoughtful commentary and recommendations in the report should make it as easy as practicable for venire members to disclose information fully and with candor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Judges in this State make various decisions based in judicial economy, recognizing that \"[i]n a world of finite resources, if the fabled 'day in court' is permitted casually to multiply into twenty days in court, the inevitable consequence is that, by the inexorable law of mathematics, nineteen other litigants are denied any time in court at all.\"\n    <em>\n     Davis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2023746\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/333/27/#p34\">\n     333 Md. at 42\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2023746\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/333/27/#p34\">\n     633 A.2d 867\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Davis v.

Collins, through counsel, performed an extensive review, examining the procedure and responses in twenty-nine criminal cases tried in Wicomico County in 2014. He found that, in every case except this one, the trial judge invited venire members to the bench for questioning, and that in every other case examined, affirmative responses were recorded regarding involvement in the criminal justice system.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Collins's thorough research of these practices is laudable, but that other judges employ a different approach to voir dire in a criminal case does not alter our decision on whether the process here violated the legal standard. We also note that the trial judge in this case phrased his question as follows: \"Have you or has any member of your immediate family ever been involved in the criminal justice system either as the victim of, a witness to or a person accused of a crime\n    <em>\n     such as that with which the Defendant is charged?\n    </em>\n    \" (emphasis added). It would not be particularly surprising if no member of the venire or their family had been previously involved in an armed robbery. This question may have elicited responses if the trial judge had dropped the emphasized clause; it is also possible that some or even all responses Collins's counsel identified in other Wicomico County cases may have been in response to such a broader question. Still, that such is possible does not dictate a modification of our current standard of review for abuse of discretion, nor does it alter the outcome in the present case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    In one study, researchers observed voir dire in thirty-one criminal cases in the trial courts of the District of Columbia, then conducted post-trial interviews of 190 of the prospective jurors that had been empaneled, and compared their voir dire answers to their post-trial answers. Richard Seltzer et al.,\n    <em>\n     Juror Honesty During the Voir Dire\n    </em>\n    , 19 J. Crim. Just. 451 (1991). The researchers found that nearly twenty-five percent of jurors who admitted post-trial that they or members of their family had been victims of crime did not come forward when questioned during voir dire.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 455. The researchers also found that nearly thirty percent of the jurors interviewed should have, but did not, come forward in response to questions regarding their employment or friends and family's employment in law enforcement.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 456.
