Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. (1973, 2013 Repl.

On the day that his trial was scheduled to begin, Bennett entered into a guilty plea agreement, pursuant to which he made a proffer inculpating Lewis in the murder of Heidi Bernadzikowski (\"Bernadzikowski\"). Afterward, Lewis was arrested in Maryland and, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (\"the circuit court\"), the State, Respondent, charged Lewis with crimes that were related to the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At no point did Lewis assert the issue of a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) in the circuit court. Instead, Lewis raised the issue for the first time on appeal. The Court of Special Appeals held that Lewis waived any issue as to a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a). We agree, and hold that an out-of-State witness who enters Maryland to testify at a trial in a criminal case pursuant to a summons under the Maryland Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Without a State in Criminal Proceedings, and who is arrested and charged with a crime in Maryland, waives the issue of a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) by failing to raise the issue pretrial as required by Maryland Rule 4-252, which governs mandatory pretrial motions and matters that are capable of determination before trial, without trial of the general issue. We decline to exercise our discretion pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131(a) to review the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v. Bennett\n    </em>\n    and Filings in the Colorado Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The facts and circumstances giving rise to this unusual case are summarized below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the circuit court, the State charged Bennett with first-degree murder of Bernadzikowski and other crimes. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Bennett\n   </em>\n   , the State filed an \"Application to Secure Attendance of a Person Outside the State as a Witness in a Criminal Action in the State\" under CJ \u00a7 9-303, seeking to secure the attendance of Lewis, a Colorado resident, as a witness at Bennett's trial. The circuit court issued a \"Certificate for Attendance of Witness from Colorado State,\" certifying that Lewis was a material witness in\n   <em>\n    State v. Bennett\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the District Court of City and County of Denver, Colorado (\"the Colorado court\"), the District Attorney for the Second Judicial District of Colorado filed a \"Motion for Hearing and Appearance of Witness for Witness To Testify in Another State,\" advising the Colorado court of the attempt to secure Lewis's presence as a witness in Maryland and noting that, under Colorado law, Lewis had a right to a hearing to determine whether he was a material and necessary witness in\n   <em>\n    State v. Bennett\n   </em>\n   and whether it would cause undue hardship to be compelled to testify at Bennett's trial. In the motion, the District Attorney stated that Lewis would be required to attend Bennett's trial for two days, and possibly afterward if the circuit court so ordered; and the District Attorney requested that the Colorado court issue a summons ordering Lewis to testify at Bennett's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Colorado court issued an \"Order for Hearing and Appearance of Witness, and for Contingent Summons for Witness to Testify in Another State[.]\" In the order, the Colorado court scheduled a hearing, at which Lewis would be required to show cause why he should not be compelled to testify at Bennett's trial; and ordered that the show cause hearing would be vacated if the District Attorney filed an Acceptance of Service and Waiver of Hearing signed by Lewis. The Colorado court found that Lewis was a material and necessary witness in\n   <em>\n    State v. Bennett\n   </em>\n   , and that compelling Lewis to testify at Bennett's trial would not cause undue hardship. The Colorado court ordered Lewis to testify at Bennet's trial and stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [T]he laws of the [S]tate in which the prosecution is pending, and of any other [S]tate through which [Lewis] may be required to pass by ordinary course of travel, will give to [Lewis] protection from arrest and service of civil and criminal process in connection with matters which arose before entering into that [S]tate under this summons[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the Colorado court, the District Attorney Investigator filed a \"Certificate of Service,\" averring that he had served on Lewis, among other documents, the Motion for Hearing and Appearance of Witness for Witness To Testify in Another\n   State, the Order for Hearing and Appearance of Witness, and for Contingent Summons for Witness to Testify in Another State, the Application to Secure Attendance of a Person Outside the State as a Witness in a Criminal Action in the State, and the Certificate for Attendance of Witness from Colorado State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the Colorado court, Lewis filed an \"Acceptance of Service and Waiver of Hearing,\" in which he acknowledged service of the above-listed documents, waived his right to a show cause hearing, and agreed to testify at Bennett's trial. On March 18, 2014, the day on which Bennett's trial was scheduled to begin, Bennett pled guilty in exchange for a sentence of life imprisonment with all but thirty years suspended. On the same day, Bennett agreed to testify about his involvement in the murder and made a proffer in which he implicated Lewis as an accomplice to Bernadzikowski's murder. On March 19, 2014, after an investigation,\n   Lewis, who had been in Maryland to testify against Bennett, was arrested. At the time of his arrest, Lewis did not assert the exemption from arrest under CJ \u00a7 9-304(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Circuit Court Proceedings in\n    <em>\n     Lewis v. State\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the circuit court, the State charged Lewis with first-degree murder of Bernadzikowski and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder of Bernadzikowski. The evidence adduced at trial showed that Bennett and Lewis had been childhood friends in Colorado and attended the Denver School of Performing Arts together. In 2000, the two devised a plan to make money that involved placing online advertisements for \"cleaning services,\" a cover term for contract killings. According to Lewis, the pair planned to defraud potential customers by taking money and not actually performing any murders. By contrast, according to Bennett, there was no intent to deceive; he and Lewis intended to commit murder in exchange for payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Specifically, at trial, as a witness for the State, Bennett testified that Lewis was responsible for designing and placing the online advertisement. In or before Spring 2000, as a result\n   of the internet advertisement, Stephen Cooke (\"Cooke\"), a man living in Dundalk, Maryland contacted Lewis and requested a contract killing of Bernadzikowski, who was his roommate and girlfriend, for $60,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cooke wanted Bernadzikowski's death to look like an accident so that he would be able to collect the proceeds from an insurance policy on Bernadzikowski's life. Cooke provided his address to Lewis, who gave Bennett a map from Baltimore/Washington International Airport\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"BWI\") to Cooke's and Bernadzikowski's house. Natalie Ott (\"Ott\"), one of Bennett's high school classmates, drove him and Lewis to an airport in Colorado. Using a ticket that Lewis had bought, Bennett flew from Colorado to BWI. Because he had no money, Bennett started walking from BWI to Dundalk. While Bennett was walking along a highway, a law enforcement officer stopped him. Bennett told the law enforcement officer that he was stranded, and the officer gave him a ride to Dundalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Bennett stayed in Dundalk for weeks, stealing food and sleeping at a bus stop, in a van, or wherever else he could find a place to sleep. Two or three times a day, Bennett called Lewis via pay phones, asking whether Cooke had e-mailed Lewis, or whether Lewis had any information to share. One day, Cooke e-mailed Lewis to arrange a meeting with Bennett. At the meeting, Cooke told Bennett that, at some point, he would leave a key outside the house so that Bennett could enter the house and kill Bernadzikowski. On another day, Cooke and Bennett met again; Bennett asked for an up-front payment; and Cooke said that he would not have any money until he collected the proceeds from the insurance policy on Bernadzikowski's life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A day or two after Cooke's and Bennett's second meeting, Bennett telephoned Lewis, who said that Cooke had e-mailed him, stating that he would drop off Bernadzikowski in about twenty minutes and\n   that a key was outside of the house. Bennett went to Cooke's and Bernadzikowski's house, found the key, entered the house, and waited. Within three or four minutes, through the window, Bennett saw Cooke drive up outside the house, and saw Bernadzikowski get out of the car. Bennett waited behind the front door. Bernadzikowski entered the house, and Bennett put his hand over her mouth and unsuccessfully tried to break her neck. Then, Bennett put his hand around Bernadzikowski's throat and started choking her. Bernadzikowski struggled and scratched Bennett's face, but she eventually became unconscious. To make sure that Bernadzikowski was dead, Bennett cut her throat with a knife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To make it seem as though a burglary had occurred, Bennett went upstairs and ransacked the bedroom. To confuse law enforcement officers, Bennett used Bernadzikowski's lipstick to write \"Number 1\" on the wall. Bennett waited approximately thirty to thirty-five minutes, left the house, and threw the key and knife into a dumpster. Bennett telephoned Lewis and informed him that he had killed Bernadzikowski. Lewis told Bennett that he was using a satellite to ensure that no law enforcement officers were in the area. After returning to Colorado, Bennett told Lewis about the killing in more detail. According to Bennett, Cooke never paid him, and Bennett and Lewis had never discussed simply stealing money from Cooke without killing Bernadzikowski.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As a witness for the State, Sergeant Alan Meyer (\"Sergeant Meyer\") of the Baltimore County Police Department testified that, on April 20, 2000, Sergeant Meyer responded to 2008 Codd Avenue in Dundalk to investigate Bernadzikowski's death. An investigation revealed that Bernadzikowski's boyfriend, Cooke, had taken out a $700,000 insurance policy on Bernadzikowski's life, and that she was preparing to end their relationship. At the time of the initial investigation, DNA tests conducted on Bernadzikowski's fingernail clippings revealed DNA belonging to Bernadzikowski and an unknown individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Years later, in September 2011, after advances in DNA technology, DNA testing of Bernadzikowski's fingernails revealed that the DNA profile of the previously unknown individual matched Bennett, causing him to become a suspect. Additionally, Sergeant Meyer learned that, on March 30, 2000, a Maryland State Trooper had stopped Bennett while he was walking toward I-895. Sergeant Meyer traveled to Colorado, interviewed Bennett, and obtained Lewis's name from Bennett. Sergeant Meyer believed Lewis to be a witness and interviewed him in Colorado on four separate occasions. On January 19, 2012, Bennett was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As a witness for the State, Ott, Bennett's high school classmate, testified that Bennett and Lewis were best friends. In Spring 2000, Ott drove Bennett and Lewis to Denver International Airport. On the way, Bennett said that he and Lewis were two of the biggest members of organized crime in Colorado; that Bennett was going to Baltimore to do a job; and that he and Lewis were going to make a lot of money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As a witness for the State, Rebecca Love (\"Love\"), the mother of Lewis's two children, testified that, in Spring 2000, while she and Lewis were in her apartment, Lewis told her that an out-of-State woman owed him money and had \"reneged[,]\" and that he had sent Bennett to kill her while he watched on his computer via satellite. Love ran out of her apartment and cried. Lewis followed Love and told her that he had made up the planned killing to impress her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As a witness on his own behalf, Lewis testified that he and Bennett developed a\n   \"silly scam\" in which they would accept money for contract killings without following through. Lewis acknowledged that he created an online advertisement for \"professional and discreet cleaning services,\" and that in response to the online advertisement, Cooke offered to pay $20,000 up front, and another $20,000 upon completion, for a contract killing of Bernadzikowski. Cooke e-mailed Lewis to provide his and Bernadzikowski's address, and Bennett flew to Baltimore, where he was supposed to collect the up-front payment from Cooke. Once Bennett was in Baltimore, over\n   time, Lewis heard from Bennett and Cooke that Cooke wanted to lower the amount that he would pay up front, and eventually that Cooke wanted to cancel the contract killing. Lewis also heard from Bennett that he accosted and threatened Cooke, who then agreed to proceed with the contract killing. After Bennett returned to Colorado, he told Lewis that he had entered Cooke's and Bernadzikowski's house, where he planned to extort money from Cooke. According to Lewis, Bennett said that, after Bernadzikowski entered the house instead, Bennett panicked and killed her. Lewis testified that he was \"horrified at what had transpired[,]\" that he had never intended to carry out a murder, and that he had never believed that Bennett would do so. Lewis denied having told anyone else about his and Bennett's scam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A jury found Lewis guilty of first-degree murder of Bernadzikowski and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder of Bernadzikowski. The circuit court sentenced Lewis to life imprisonment for first-degree murder, and five concurrent years of imprisonment for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Lewis noted an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Lewis did not allege, pretrial or during trial, that his arrest violated the Maryland Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Without State in Criminal Proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Subsequent Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On appeal, for the first time, Lewis raised the exemption from arrest under CJ \u00a7 9-304(a). Specifically, before the Court of Special Appeals, Lewis contended that the State's prosecution of him violated CJ \u00a7 9-304(a), and argued that, accordingly, the circuit court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction and improperly exercised personal jurisdiction over Lewis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals disagreed and affirmed the convictions, holding that the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction and properly exercised personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See Lewis v.

Lewis acknowledges that a court's ability to exercise personal jurisdiction over a criminal defendant is not generally affected by the manner in which a defendant is brought into court. Lewis asserts, however, that the Doctrine of Specialty-which provides that a court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over a person who is extradited to the United States for an offense that is not specified in the demand for surrender of the person-is an exception to the general rule, and applies in this case. Lewis maintains that, like the Doctrine of Specialty in extradition matters, CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) prevents the circuit court from exercising personal jurisdiction over him for any matter other than the purpose for which he was brought to Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Lewis concedes that he did not preserve the issue as to the alleged violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) for appellate review, but asks us to exercise our discretion under Maryland Rule 8-131(a) to review the unpreserved issue because of this case's \"extraordinary circumstances.\" Lewis contends that both the prosecutor and circuit court were or should have been aware that his prosecution violated CJ \u00a7 9-304(a), and that the circuit court and the State had a substantial opportunity to correct the error. Lewis argues that the purpose of fairness in judicial proceedings would be furthered by this Court exercising its discretion to review the matter, and that addressing the issue would avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As to the merits, Lewis argues that an out-of-State witness does not waive the issue of a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) by failing to file a pretrial motion under Maryland Rule 4-252 (Motions in Circuit Court). Lewis points out by analogy that an implicit waiver is not permitted under Maryland's extradition laws, which require an express waiver of the right to challenge extradition. Lewis asserts that permitting an implicit waiver under CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) would permit the circumvention of an explicit waiver that would be required to extradite him from Colorado. Lewis maintains that a waiver of the issue as to a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) should be the same as the\n   general requirement for a waiver of extradition-the waiver must occur in open court, before a judge, and after an advice of the right to challenge extradition. According to Lewis, permitting an implicit waiver would render trial courts \"unaccountable\" for violations of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a). Lewis contends that, in this case, although there is no evidence of bad faith\n   on the circuit court's part, there is an appearance of impropriety because the same circuit court judge issued the Certificate for Attendance of Witness from Colorado State and presided over his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The State responds that Lewis forfeited the ability to challenge his arrest and prosecution by failing to raise the issue in a pretrial motion pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-252. The State contends that a challenge to a trial court's personal jurisdiction over a defendant falls under \"[a] defect in the institution of the prosecution\" under Maryland Rule 4-252(a)(1), and thus must be the subject of a mandatory motion. The State argues that Maryland Rule 4-252 requires a defendant-not the State or a trial court-to raise an issue as to a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) before trial, or the issue is waived. The State asserts that a knowing and voluntary waiver is not required under CJ \u00a7 9-304(a). The State maintains that the analogy to waiver under extradition laws is misplaced because: (1) the procedure to protect an out-of-State witness is not comparable to the procedure to protect the rights of a defendant who has already been charged with a crime; (2) errors in the extradition process that are not timely raised are forfeited without a knowing and voluntary waiver; and (3) Maryland Rule 4-252 does not require a knowing and voluntary waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The State contends that Lewis fails to demonstrate that this Court should exercise its discretion to review his unpreserved challenge to his arrest and prosecution, as doing so would not correct a recurring error, provide guidance where there is likely to be a new trial, or offer assistance if there is a subsequent collateral attack on the convictions. The State argues that it would be unfair to allow Lewis to raise an issue as to a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) for the first time on appeal, as he could have known of the issue, yet decided not to raise it\n   before trial. The State points out that, had Lewis raised the issue of a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) before trial and been permitted to return to Colorado, the State could have immediately sought to extradite him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    The Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"An appellate court reviews without deference a trial court's interpretation of a statute[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Howard v.

Indisputably, instituting prosecution in a criminal case involves, among other things, the arrest of the defendant or issuance of process to secure the defendant's appearance in the matter. In addition to the requirements of Maryland Rule 4-252(a)(1) and (b), Maryland Rule 4-252(d) applies. The matter of whether CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) has been violated is capable of determination before trial and does not involve trial of the general issue, as the facts that would be relevant in a determination of such a matter are wholly independent of the alleged criminal conduct. Specifically, the facts that would be at issue in deciding whether CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) has been violated include: whether the defendant received a summons pursuant to the Maryland Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Without a State in Criminal Proceedings; whether the defendant entered Maryland pursuant to such summons; and whether the defendant was arrested or served with process \"in connection with matters which arose before his [or her] entrance into this State under the summons.\" CJ \u00a7 9-304(a). Because a trial court is capable of determining before trial whether a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) occurred, Maryland Rule 4-252(d) requires the defendant to raise the issue in a pretrial motion; if the defendant fails to do so, the issue is waived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Independent of the requisites of Maryland Rule 4-252(a)(1), (b) and (d), where, as here, a defendant not only fails\n   to raise an alleged violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) in a pretrial motion, but also fails to raise the issue at any time in the trial court, a defendant may forfeit appellate review of the matter under Maryland Rule 8-131(a), which provides, in pertinent part, that \"the appellate court will not decide any [non-jurisdictional] issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court[.]\" As this Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Nalls v.

Allowing a defendant to raise the issue of an alleged violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) for the first time on appeal would enable defendants to refrain from raising the issue, wait to see the outcome of trial, and, if the defendant is convicted, attempt to secure reversal by raising the alleged violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) for the first time on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   It is fair to require a defendant from outside Maryland to assert an issue as to a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) before trial. Given that such a defendant would have entered Maryland pursuant to a summons for an out-of-State witness and then been charged with a crime, the issue of whether the defendant was arrested or served with process in violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) would have been known, or should have been known, to\n   the defendant well in advance of trial, thereby giving the defendant an opportunity to raise the matter in a pretrial motion pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-252.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   At oral argument, Lewis contended that the circuit court had the burden to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raise the issue of a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) because the same circuit court judge issued the Certificate for Attendance of Witness from Colorado State and presided over Lewis's trial. We do not accept the notion that a trial court has the burden to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raise the issue of a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a). We see no valid reason, even where the same judge issues the summons and presides at trial, to treat an alleged violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) differently from any other defense that a defendant, not a trial court, is obligated to raise prior to trial under Maryland Rule 4-252 -such as any other issue that Maryland Rule 4-252 requires to be raised before trial. Thus, the defense must be raised by motion filed at any time before trial,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the defense must be timely asserted and the circuit court has no obligation to raise the issue on the defendant's behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md.

Code Ann., Crim. Proc. (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.) (\"CP\") \u00a7 9-124, which is part of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, and states in its entirety:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    In general.\n   </em>\n   -(1) Any person arrested in this State charged with having committed any crime in another state or alleged to have escaped from confinement, or broken the terms of bail, probation, or parole, may waive the issuance and service of the warrant provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 9-107 and 9-108 of this title, and all other procedure incidental to extradition proceedings, by executing or subscribing in the presence of a judge of any court of record within this State a writing that states that the person consents to return to the demanding state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   (2) Before a waiver is executed or subscribed by the person, it shall be the duty of the judge to inform the person of the right to the issuance and service of a warrant of extradition and the right to obtain a writ of habeas corpus as provided in \u00a7 9-110 of this title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    Action on consent.\n   </em>\n   -(1) If and when a consent has been duly executed, it shall forthwith be forwarded to the office of the Governor of this State and filed therein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   (2) The judge shall:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   (i) direct the officer having the person in custody to deliver forthwith the person to a duly accredited agent of the demanding state; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   (ii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the agent a copy of the consent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   (c)\n   <em>\n    Construction.\n   </em>\n   -(1) This section does not limit the rights of the accused person\n   to return voluntarily and without formality to the demanding state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   (2) This waiver procedure is not an exclusive procedure and does not limit the powers, rights, or duties of the officers of the demanding state or of this State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   According to Lewis, because CP \u00a7 9-124(a)(1) requires an express, written waiver of service of a warrant for extradition,\n   an express waiver of any issue as to a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) is also required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   We disagree. Simply put, Lewis's contention is misguided. Entering Maryland pursuant to a summons, and then being arrested or served with process in connection with a crime in Maryland, is not comparable to being extradited to Maryland. Obviously, as a threshold matter, because Lewis was not extradited to Maryland, CP \u00a7 9-124(a)(1)'s requirement of an express waiver does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   And, in actuality, CP \u00a7 9-124(a)(1) supports our holding that an express waiver is not required under CJ \u00a7 9-304(a). In drafting CP \u00a7 9-124(a)(1)'s language, the General Assembly chose to require an express waiver where another State initiates extradition proceedings of a person who has been arrested in Maryland. By contrast, in drafting CJ \u00a7 9-304(a)'s language, the General Assembly did not include a requirement of an express waiver where the State charges a person who entered Maryland pursuant to a summons. We decline to read such a requirement into CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) ; in interpreting a statute, a court does not \"add ... words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words that the General Assembly used [.]\"\n   <em>\n    Bottini v.

Lewis argues that, like the Doctrine of Specialty, CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) prohibits the State from securing a person's presence in Maryland, and then exercising jurisdiction over him in a separate matter.

Grounded in concerns of international comity, contrary to Lewis's contention, the Doctrine of Specialty involves policy considerations that are not at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   We are also unpersuaded by Lewis's argument that, unless we require an express waiver of the issue of a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a), trial courts will be \"unaccountable\" for violations of law, and an out-of-State witness will lack a remedy on appellate review. There is a simple way for a defendant to ensure that an appellate court will consider an issue as to the protections afforded by CJ \u00a7 9-304(a), which is: raise the issue in a pretrial motion. That way, the trial court will have the opportunity to address the matter, which will be preserved\n   for appellate review, and the issue of the need for an explicit waiver would be non-existent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Applying our holding to this case's facts, we conclude that Lewis waived the issue of a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) by failing to raise the issue pretrial in the circuit court. Pursuant to the Maryland Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Without a State in Criminal Proceedings, the State secured Lewis's presence in Maryland to testify at Bennett's trial. On the day on which Bennett's trial was to begin, Bennett entered into a guilty plea agreement, and made a proffer in which he inculpated Lewis. At oral argument, Lewis's counsel acknowledged that \"there is no evidence that the State knew in advance, prior to the proffer, that [ ] Bennett was going to give the proffer that he did.\" Lewis's counsel acknowledged that \"[t]here is no evidence of bad faith\" on the State's part. In short, before Bennett's proffer, the State had no reason to treat Lewis as a suspect or a potential defendant. As a result of Bennett's proffer, an investigation occurred, and Lewis was arrested and charged with crimes. Lewis never asserted an issue as to a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) in the circuit court, whether in a motion pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-252 or otherwise; instead, Lewis raised the issue for the first time on appeal. Indeed, Lewis concedes that he failed to preserve the issue as to the violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) for appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Lewis asks us to exercise our discretion, pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131(a), to review the unpreserved issue. We decline to do so. In\n   <em>\n    Ray v.

There is no indication that there are recurring violations\n   of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a). Indeed, since the provision was recodified as CJ \u00a7 9-304 forty-four years ago, this Court has never been called upon to decide an issue involving an alleged violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a). And, there is no case law interpreting CJ \u00a7 9-304's predecessors. The facts of this case are unusual. Lewis was present in Maryland pursuant to an out-of-State witness summons and, prior to the scheduled trial, the person against whom Lewis was summonsed to testify gave a proffer implicating him in the murder for which the person was to be tried. These are not circumstances that happen on a recurring\n   basis. There is not a need to provide guidance for purposes of a new trial, given that the issue concerning the propriety of Lewis's arrest does not involve resolution of matters that occurred during trial. Finally, there is no need to offer assistance for purposes of a collateral attack on Lewis's convictions, given that, to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Lewis would have to satisfy the \"prejudice\" prong under\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

In other words, Lewis would be required to establish that the result of the criminal proceeding would have been different if his trial counsel had raised the issue of a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a) in a pretrial motion. This would be difficult to do because, if Lewis had not been arrested in Maryland and had returned to Colorado, the State would have been able to initiate extradition proceedings, and prosecute Lewis in the same manner that it did at his trial in this case. Stated differently, Lewis's trial would have proceeded, and the State would have presented the same evidence against him, if he had been extradited from Colorado rather than arrested while he was in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Having held that Lewis waived the issue as to a violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a), we conclude that the circuit court had personal jurisdiction over Lewis by virtue of his physical presence\n   before the circuit court. Under the\n   <em>\n    Ker\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Frisbie\n   </em>\n   Doctrine, a trial court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a criminal case where the crime was committed within the trial court's jurisdiction and the defendant is physically present before the trial court, regardless of how the defendant was brought before the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See Rigor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2065715\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/101/465/#p470\">\n    101 Md. at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20A.%20631\">\n    61 A. at 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he right to try is founded on the fact that the crime was committed within the jurisdiction of the court, and upon the further fact that the [defendant], after being indicted, is present in person before the court during the trial.

As in\n   <em>\n    McGuire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2231806\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/200/601/#p603\">\n    200 Md. at 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20A.2d%20582\">\n    92 A.2d at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , any unlawful act in arresting Lewis in Maryland and bringing him before the circuit court would not have undermined the existence of the circuit court's jurisdiction. Rather, as the Court of Special Appeals explained, the issue is whether the circuit court should have exercised personal jurisdiction, not whether the circuit court possessed such jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767269,12486310\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/229/86/\">\n    229 Md.App. at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767269,12486310\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/229/86/\">\n    143 A.3d at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Indeed, in his brief, Lewis notes that he does not dispute that the circuit court had personal jurisdiction over him, but instead contends that the circuit court should have refrained from exercising personal jurisdiction over him because he was arrested in violation of CJ \u00a7 9-304(a).
