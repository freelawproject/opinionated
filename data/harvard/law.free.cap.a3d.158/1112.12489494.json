Rupp, Jr., in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on December 10, 2015 and the more academically nuanced contention now being presented on appellate review. We do not mean to be critical of the more nuanced argument. It may well be a stronger argument than that actually made at the suppression hearing. It has been thoroughly researched. It has been articulately delivered, both in appellate brief and in oral argument before this Court on March 9, 2017. None of that, however, matters. The argument's fatal flaw is that it is not the one that was made at the suppression hearing. Our jurisdictional authority is limited to reviewing the suppression hearing that was and not the law school hypothetical that might have been.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   It would be tempting to dismiss the entire suppression issue, which is the heart of the present appeal, on the ground that what was argued at the suppression hearing is not the subject of an appellate contention and, conversely, that what is now contended on appeal was never raised at the suppression hearing. That, however, might be too glib, so we will at least give the appellant the benefit of several \"\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   considerations in the course of announcing several alternative holdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    The Case Before Us\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The appellant, Abdullah Malik Joppy, a/k/a Richard Joppy, was convicted in a jury trial, presided over by Judge Marielsa Bernard, of 1) possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance (\"CDS\") and 2) of conspiring to do so. On appeal, he raises two contentions, the first one of which is in three parts.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   I. Judge Rupp erroneously failed to suppress the physical evidence seized in a warranted search of the apartment of Victoria Gaines at 3320 Teagarden Circle,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   A. because the evidence was not legally sufficient to establish a nexus between the criminal activity of the appellant and 3320 Teagarden Circle;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   B. because any evidence tending to establish such a nexus was stale; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   C. because, refuting in advance an anticipated\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   argument by the State, the Good Faith Exception to the Exclusionary Rule is not available when the judicial error is one involving the nexus between the crime and the place to be searched.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   II. Judge Bernard erroneously failed to grant in part a Motion for Acquittal because the State's evidence was not legally sufficient to support the conviction for possession of CDS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    The Bigger Picture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Beginning in mid-2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") and the Montgomery County Police Department began a joint investigation into illegal drug dealing in crack cocaine and heroin in the area surrounding the Bel Pre Square apartments in Montgomery County. The investigation involved the extensive use of surveillance, wiretapping, pen registers, and controlled drug buys by undercover agents. The investigation was conducted by over fifty local officers and federal agents in a year-long effort. The primary target of the investigation was George Gee, the kingpin of the illicit drug distribution network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In early February 2015, the investigators obtained a warrant to conduct the electronic surveillance of telephones used by George Gee. When the initial authorization expired, the officers obtained renewed authorization through May 2, 2015. One of the key investigators was FBI Special Agent Charles Adams. It was Special Agent Adams who applied for the search warrant that was issued, executed, and subsequently submitted to Judge Rupp for his review at the suppression hearing of December 10, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   It was in the course of this larger investigation that the appellant was discovered to be one of the operatives of the drug distribution network run by George Gee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    The Search of 3320 Teagarden Circle\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The broad search warrant for which Special Agent Adams applied was aimed at three separate residences: 1) 51 Baileys Court in Silver Spring, which was described as the \"primary residence\" of drug kingpin George Gee, 2) 11 Farmcrest Court in Silver Spring, which was described as the \"primary residence\" of co-conspirator Andre Napper, and 3) 3320 Teagarden Circle, Apartment 104, which was described as the \"primary residence\" of the appellant. It is not without significance that not one of the \"primary residences\" was formally owned by or leased to George Gee, Andre Napper, or the appellant. Patterns do begin to emerge when\n   looking at the totality that would completely escape us when looking only at an individual instance. We are less likely to believe that\n   <em>\n    all three men\n   </em>\n   were just casual \"overnight guests.\" We must never ignore the totality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The search warrant was issued by Chief Magistrate Judge William Connelly in the United States District Court on June 1, 2015. When it was executed at 3320 Teagarden Circle on the morning of June 8, 2015, both the appellant and his girlfriend, Victoria Gaines, were still asleep in the bedroom. In a closet in the bedroom, the investigators found, in a jacket pocket, a prescription pill bottle with two baggies of crack cocaine, weighing a total of five grams. In a suitcase in the same closet, the investigators found a digital scale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    The Yawning Disconnect Between Suppression Hearing and Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It is not we, of course, who are called upon to decide whether Special Agent Adams's application established probable cause to support a warrant to search the appellant's \"primary residence\" of 3320 Teagarden Circle. Chief Magistrate Judge Connelly decided that on June 1, 2015. In reviewing that decision on December 10, 2015, Judge Rupp decided that Magistrate Judge Connelly had had a substantial basis for issuing the search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Our limited role is to decide whether Judge Rupp was in error when he declined to grant the appellant's motion to suppress the physical evidence. The propriety of Judge Rupp's decision was based, of course, upon the evidence that was presented to him at the suppression hearing, to wit, the warrant application itself, and the arguments made by counsel. That hearing of December 10, 2015 produced a 13-page transcript. Eleven of the 13 pages reflect the argument of defense counsel. As he analyzed each intercepted phone call and each visual surveillance, the total thrust of the attack was that there was no probable cause to believe that the appellant was engaged in any criminal activity. Counsel announced his position as he began his argument, \"It's our position that the application for the search warrant ... does not show probable cause as it relates to [the appellant].\" He went on more fully:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    There is nothing\n   </em>\n   in here\n   <em>\n    to indicate that Mr. Joppy was distributing anything or possessing with intent to distribute anything.\n   </em>\n   There is no indication that the agent applying for the search warrant has observed any transaction between Mr. Joppy and any other individual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After a very brief and pro-forma response by the State, Judge Rupp ruled almost summarily that Magistrate Judge Connelly had had a substantial basis to issue the search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Of present pertinence is the fact that nothing at that suppression hearing made the remotest allusion to the issue of nexus. The word \"nexus\" was never used, nor even implied. No judicial opinion dealing with nexus was ever cited. The exclusive battle was over whether the appellant was in any way a criminal agent. The degree of attenuation between his behavior and 3320 Teagarden Circle was never raised. Judge Rupp was never called upon to make a ruling about nexus. There was no suggestion by anyone at the hearing that a potential sub-issue such as nexus even existed. The present contention, therefore, appears out of nowhere. It challenges nothing that was at issue at the suppression hearing of\n   December 10, 2015. It raises a totally new issue for the first time on appeal. The very wording of the sub-contention leaves no doubt with respect to its exclusive argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The Magistrate Did Not Have a Substantial Basis to Issue the Search Warrant Because\n   <em>\n    the State Did Not Establish a Nexus Between the Suspected Criminal Activity and the Residence\n   </em>\n   that Was Searched.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Emphasis supplied). The very opening bar of the argument announced unequivocally its unmistakable leitmotif:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court erred in deciding not to suppress evidence found during the execution of the search warrant because\n   <em>\n    the warrant application did not establish the required nexus between suspected criminal conduct and the location to be searched.\n   </em>\n   In the absence of such a connection, there was no substantial basis for the magistrate to approve the warrant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Emphasis supplied). Indeed, at the very beginning of oral argument on March 9, 2017, this Court put what was, in effect, the following inquiry to counsel for the appellant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   In an effort to reduce the clutter, let us see if we can narrow the key issue before us. It seems clear from your brief that you are not contesting, as an issue on the subject of suppression, the criminality of the appellant himself but only the nexus between the observed criminal behavior of the appellant and 3320 Teagarden Circle as the place to be searched. Is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Counsel gave us express reassurance that our reading of the brief was correct and that the exclusion issue raised in the key sub-contention was the adequacy of the proof of nexus. That concession, however, was not critical, because a reading of the appellant's brief itself would permit no other conclusion. Our bottom line holding is that this entire line of argument, raised for the first time on appeal, was never mentioned at the suppression hearing ostensibly under review and has, therefore, not been preserved for appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    \"Even If,\n    <em>\n     Arguendo\n    </em>\n    , ...\" No.1: Proof of the Nexus\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Even if, purely\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , the appellant's challenge to the proof of the nexus had been preserved by having been raised and ruled upon at the suppression hearing, we would not hesitate to hold as an alternative resolution of this appeal that the evidence was sufficient to establish the necessary nexus. This three-month long investigation by over 50 agents, using telephone wiretaps, pen registers, and visual surveillance, was not aimed at low-level drug pushers making street sales. It was aimed at high-level operatives in the George Gee network, at the communication among these operatives, and at the subsequent movement of drug supplies in one direction and of cash in the other direction. Far more so than in the case of mere street dealers, the expert observation of Special Agent Adams in the application for the warrant, based upon his training and experience, places the issue of nexus at this level of a drug distributing network in necessary perspective.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    [I]t is common for drug dealers to conceal contraband, proceeds of drug sales, and records of drug transactions in secure locations within their residences\n   </em>\n   , vehicles and/or businesses for ready access; that it is common for drug dealers to conceal proceeds from law enforcement authorities and rival narcotics traffickers; that\n   <em>\n    drug dealers routinely use cellular telephones to facilitate their drug distribution operations\n   </em>\n   ; that\n   <em>\n    drug dealing\n   </em>\n   is an ongoing process that\n   <em>\n    requires the development, use, and protection of a communications network\n   </em>\n   to facilitate daily drug distribution; that\n   <em>\n    drug dealers use telephones to thwart law enforcement efforts\n   </em>\n   to penetrate the drug dealers' communication networks;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   and that\n   <em>\n    narcotics traffickers commonly use \"coded\" language\n   </em>\n   when speaking with other drug traffickers in order to thwart detection by law enforcement agents who may be intercepting their communications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The appellant is being na\u00efve when he focuses on the lack of evidence of low-level street sales at or near the residences of the three key operatives in this case. Such evidence is not to\n   be expected. Once the criminal nature of the network itself is established, the nexus challenge is largely one of identifying the primary residences of the three key operatives (a particularly vexing problem when they do not assist the police by formally signing up for the ownership or rental of their primary residences). Significantly, at the suppression hearing when Special Agent Adams's warrant application was being reviewed, the appellant neither challenged the accuracy nor the pertinence of the agent's observation about the close connection between the high-level drug dealer and his residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Three of the intercepted telephone calls involving the appellant coupled with the visual surveillance conducted after each of those telephone intercepts tie down the nexus between the appellant's criminal activity and 3320 Teagarden Circle. On February 27, 2015 at 3:00 p.m., the investigators intercepted a call from the appellant to George Gee. The warrant application described the substance of the call and of the surveillance that followed.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Based on my training, experience, and knowledge of this investigation, your affiant believes that GEE and [the appellant] are arranging a drug transaction. During the conversation,\n   <em>\n    GEE directed [the appellant] to meet him \"around Joe Thomas' joint,\" which your affiant believes to be the area of Bel Pre Drive\n   </em>\n   , also known as \"Bel Pre Square.\" After intercepting this call, law enforcement officers conducted surveillance of Bel Pre Drive. At approximately 3:24 pm,\n   <em>\n    officers observed [the appellant] exiting Bel Pre Drive\n   </em>\n   driving a green Honda sedan, Maryland registration number 5BL6871.\n   <em>\n    Law enforcement officers\n   </em>\n   kept constant surveillance of [the appellant] and\n   <em>\n    observed him driving to and entering SUBJECT PREMISES\n   </em>\n   # 1 at approximately 4:10 pm. Based on the above described call,\n   <em>\n    your affiant believes that, at the time he entered the SUBJECT PREMISES # 1 [the appellant] was in possession of drugs.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The investigation on March 4, 2015 involved two intercepted calls from the appellant to George Gee and the intervening\n   surveillance between the calls. The first call, from the appellant to George Gee, was at 4:59 p.m. Special Agent Adams described the call and the surveillance that followed.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Based on my training, experience, and knowledge of this investigation, your affiant believes that [the appellant] and GEE were arranging a meeting to conduct a drug transaction. During the conversation, GEE asked [the appellant] what quantity of drugs he wanted (\"what you trying to do\"). [The appellant] replied that he wanted two ounces of drugs (\"two\"). GEE then directed [the appellant] to meet him at a specified location near Bel Pre Square (\"oh yeah that's perfect, shit\n   <em>\n    meet me over there\n   </em>\n   , uh,\n   <em>\n    on the Good Hope [Road]\n   </em>\n   side man\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   22. After intercepting this call, law enforcement officers conducted surveillance in the area of GEE's prior residence, 1367 Elm Grove Circle, Silver Spring, Maryland and in the area of SUBJECT PREMISE # 1. At approximately\n   5:15 pm, officers observed [the appellant] enter SUBJECT PREMISE # 1.\n   <em>\n    At approximately 5:45 pm, [the appellant] exited SUBJECT PREMISE # 1, entered the green Honda sedan, and drove out of the neighborhood toward Good Hope Road\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   At 5:43 p.m., the appellant placed a follow-up call to George Gee. Special Agent Adams interpreted that call as one signaling a slight change in plans.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Based on my training, experience, and knowledge of this investigation, your affiant believes that [the appellant] called GEE to let him know he is close to the agreed upon location for the drug transaction. GEE then informed [the appellant] that he was sending another person (\"my son bout to come out there and see you\") to conduct the drug transaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   25. At approximately 5:49 pm, law enforcement officers intercepted an incoming call to GEE's CELLPHONE from a cellular telephone number utilized by Andre NAPPER.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Based on my training, experience, and knowledge of this investigation, your affiant believes that GEE wanted to meet with NAPPER to provide NAPPER with drugs to give to [the appellant]. Law enforcement officers subsequently observed NAPPER, driving a black Toyota Camry bearing Maryland tag number 2BL6017, pull into GEE's neighborhood and park in front of GEE's prior residence at 1367 Elm Grove Circle. A short time later, GEE was observed exiting his residence and meeting with NAPPER at NAPPER's Toyota Camry. After this meeting, GEE returned to his prior residence at 1367 Elm Grove Circle and NAPPER left the area.\n   <em>\n    Officers continued to conduct surveillance on NAPPER, who drove to the area of Twig Road\n   </em>\n   in Silver Spring, Maryland. A short time after NAPPER arrived on Twig Road,\n   <em>\n    law enforcement officers observed [the appellant] leaving the area of Twig Road\n   </em>\n   . Although officers did not observe NAPPER and [the appellant] meet, based on my training, experience, and knowledge of this investigation,\n   <em>\n    your affiant believes\n   </em>\n   that NAPPER served as a \"middle man\" and\n   <em>\n    delivered the drugs from GEE to [the appellant] on Twig Road\n   </em>\n   . Shortly after this transaction, officers observed NAPPER's Toyota Camry parked in front of SUBJECT PREMISE # 2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A conclusory call from the appellant to George Gee assured Gee that everything had gone according to plan.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Based on my training, experience, and knowledge of this investigation, your affiant believes that [the appellant] called GEE to ensure GEE knew that [the appellant] met with NAPPERS (referred to as \"my son\") and conducted the drug transaction (\"I wasn't trying to look around. I was just, you know, making sure, you know\"). GEE also confirmed that [the appellant] received two ounces of drugs (\"that was two joints there\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   At 9:42 a.m. on April 9, 2015, the agents intercepted a call from the appellant to George Gee. Special Agent Adams interpreted the call. His interpretation was that the appellant\n   was at 3320 Teagarden Circle (\"Subject Premise # 1\"), had cash with him at that location, and referred to that location as \"the crib.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Based on my training, experience, and knowledge of this investigation, your affiant believes that [the appellant] wanted an ounce of drugs from GEE (\"[a]in't nothing, trying to grab one time\"). GEE then directed [the appellant] to meet at\n   a specific location, Good Hope Road, to conduct the transaction (\"go around the Hope, young\").\n   <em>\n    [The appellant] also indicated that he was at the SUBJECT PREMISE # 1 3320 Teagarden Circle (\"Alright, bout to leave the crib now\") and presumably had drug proceeds with him at the SUBJECT PREMISE # 1 to complete the transaction with GEE\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Quite aside from the telephone intercepts and the visual surveillance, there was direct evidence establishing 3320 Teagarden Circle, Apartment 104, as the primary residence of the appellant. Such evidence makes counsel's reference to the appellant as \"an overnight guest at the apartment where the warrant was executed\" deliberately disingenuous. On April 2, 2015, the investigators interviewed the manager of the Knightsbridge Apartments, where 3320 Teagarden Circle is located, to inquire about the residential status of the appellant. The application for the search warrant recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   On April 2, 2015, law enforcement officers showed the manager of the \"Knightsbridge Apartments\" a photograph of JOPPY and\n   <em>\n    the manager immediately recognized JOPPY as an individual that lives with GAINES in apartment # 104, but is not on the lease.\n   </em>\n   The manager stated that\n   <em>\n    he has observed JOPPY at the apartment frequently\n   </em>\n   and he believes JOPPY drives a Honda. Additionally, while conducting physical surveillance,\n   <em>\n    law enforcement officers have observed JOPPY routinely entering and exiting SUBJECT PREMISE # 1.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In support of this sub-contention, the appellant cites two opinions by the Court of Appeals:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Holmes v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"455062\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/368/506/\">\n    368 Md. 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"455080,455062\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/796/90/\">\n    796 A.2d 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) and\n   <em>\n    Agurs v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693871\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/62/\">\n    415 Md. 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693871\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/62/\">\n    998 A.2d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). The citation seems to be of dubious utility. In\n   <em>\n    Agurs\n   </em>\n   , the failure of the State to establish a nexus between observed criminal activity and one of the appellant's residences was not in dispute. It was a given. The legal question that was the subject of the opinion was whether the Good Faith Exception to the Exclusionary Rule should apply to the case. The overarching disutility of the citation, however, is that in\n   <em>\n    Agurs v. State\n   </em>\n   there was no authoritative opinion of the Court. Seven judges produced five opinions (one of which was a non-opinion). Judge Greene wrote a plurality opinion, joined by Chief Judge Bell and Judge Harrell. Judge Battaglia joined in the decision not to apply the Good Faith Exception, but she expressly declined to join in the opinion. Judge Barbera filed a dissenting opinion. Judge Adkins filed a dissenting opinion. Judge Murphy filed a concurring and dissenting opinion, expressly declining to join in the result. The appellant nonetheless quotes the plurality opinion as if it were the unblemished repository of authoritative law. It is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The authoritative Court of Appeals case on nexus is\n   <em>\n    Holmes v. State\n   </em>\n   (wherein seven judges produced a single opinion).\n   <em>\n    Holmes\n   </em>\n   , however, is not the best candidate for a \"color patch\" comparison with the case now before us, because it involved a direct police observation of Holmes engaging in a single street sale of drugs immediately after walking out of his home, which was less than a block away. That's easy.\n   <em>\n    Holmes v. State\n   </em>\n   held, of course, that the nexus was solidly established. The appellant now uses\n   <em>\n    Holmes\n   </em>\n   to argue that the more circumstantial nexus here is not as indisputable as was the directly observed nexus there. To be sure!\n   <em>\n    Holmes v. State\n   </em>\n   is a good teaching example of how not to over-read an opinion. In reciting, quite properly, the unusually strong set of facts then before it,\n   <em>\n    Holmes\n   </em>\n   was not promulgating\n   a\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   by which to disdain all less overwhelming proffers of nexus that might follow. The appellant, however, would seem to argue, in effect, that no baseball team could ever aspire to be a World Series champion unless it could compare favorably with the 1927 New York Yankees (\"Who are these presumptuous upstarts from 2016 Chicago?\n   They don't have a Babe Ruth or a Lou Gehrig in their lineup, let alone both.\").

Those observations did \"not punch a clock.\" They ran from February through June of 2015. The \"character of the crime\" was that of \"a regenerating conspiracy\" and not \"a chance encounter in the night.\" The conspiracy in this case had been fully operational for between three and four months. The appellant was \"entrenched\" and not \"nomadic.\" He remained at 3320 Teagarden Circle throughout the life of the conspiracy. The \"place to be searched\" was a \"secure operational base\" and not a \"mere criminal forum of convenience.\" This was no random street crime. Each of the three key conspirators operated from an unchanging primary residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Once a nexus between the appellant and 3320 Teagarden Circle is established, it is not only the visual surveillance of the residence itself that will serve to keep the probable cause fresh. The continuing criminal activity of the appellant himself will do so. Absent indications that the appellant has in the meantime moved away from his primary residence, his criminal activities in April and May served to keep alive the nexus that was established in February and March. The appellant frames much too narrow a focus. 3320 Teagarden Circle remained the appellant's primary residence and it was his ongoing criminal activity that kept the nexus fresh.\n   <em>\n    See Connelly v.

The modality of keeping the evidence of nexus alive and fresh is a broad one. The observation, both by telephonic wiretap and by visual surveillance, of both George Gee and Andre Napper revealed that the criminal network was still functioning and, absent any indication to the contrary, the permitted inference is that the appellant remained an active member of that network and that his primary residence had not moved. What the appellant conveniently forgets is that once the appellant's participation in the George Gee conspiracy was established (as it most assuredly was), he and his primary residence were implicated by the criminal behavior of his co-conspirators as well as by his own. That larger complicity applies, moreover, not simply when proving guilt at trial but also when proving both probable cause and nexus in a warrant application. The appellant and his primary residence will be viewed in their fuller context and not in a vacuum. Had this sub-contention of staleness been properly preserved for appellate review, we would not hesitate to decide, as an alternative holding, that the proof of the nexus was not stale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    \"Even If,\n    <em>\n     Arguendo\n    </em>\n    , ...\" No.3: The Good Faith Exception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The possible applicability of the Good Faith Exception to the Exclusionary Rule is always available as an alternative holding to a ruling on a Fourth Amendment warrant.

The condemnation does not apply to every warrant application that is inadequate, even if a well-trained police officer might be able to second-guess the judge in that regard. If we truly wish to know, therefore, what\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   meant by a \"purely conclusory\" or \"bare bones\" warrant applications, we must look to the three examples of such given in\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   . We must then measure the application now before us against the applications found to have been \"purely conclusory\" in the\n   <em>\n    Aguilar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nathanson\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Giordenello\n   </em>\n   cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The application before us was made by Special Agent Charles Adams of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It was a tightly packed 29-page affidavit, recounting in full detail a three-month investigation by over 50 local and federal agents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   It included a controlled buy of narcotics by an undercover officer. It included the full report of and interpretation of 13 separate telephone intercepts. It included details of six separate automobile surveillances. This was the polar opposite of\n   <em>\n    Aguilar\n   </em>\n   's\"received reliable information from a credible person and do believe\" or of\n   <em>\n    Nathanson\n   </em>\n   's\"has cause to suspect and does believe.\"\n   <em>\n    Giordenello\n   </em>\n   does not allege even that much. To characterize the fully fleshed out affidavit in this case as a \"bare bones\" application is to push the metaphor beyond its limit. There is no comparison. This warrant application was not \"conclusory\" or \"bare bones.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   This is the view of the Good Faith Exception that has been applied consistently by the Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    Connelly v.

The State makes the threshold challenge that the appellant's Motion for Judgment of Acquittal was unilluminatingly generic and did not satisfy Rule 4-324(a)'s requirement that such a motion \"state with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted.\" In this case, however, we believe that a holding of non-preservation would be a bit harsh. We would agree that an issue as subtle as nexus would not be preserved by a non-particularized motion for acquittal, nor would an issue as nuanced as staleness. On the other hand, even a non-particularized motion packs more preservative punch than does a non-motion. We will treat the motion as sufficient to challenge whether the State has met the single, linear, one-on-one requirement of offering some evidence of guilt of the core crime charged. We will permit a generic motion for acquittal to preserve for appellate review the question of generic legal sufficiency. We will not, however, indulge a generic motion more broadly than that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   We make another threshold observation. The appellant has not challenged the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for conspiracy. He was convicted of conspiracy and received a concurrent sentence of 17 years for conspiracy. The appellant's contention makes its limited coverage expressly clear.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE MOTION FOR ACQUITTAL BECAUSE THE STATE PRESENTED INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AS A MATTER OF LAW TO CONVINCE A REASONABLE TRIER OF FACT THAT MR. JOPPY\n   <em>\n    POSSESSED THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE FOUND IN HIS GIRLFRIEND'S RUNNING JACKET\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   In reading the contention carefully, we also note that it is confined to \"the controlled substance found in his girlfriend's running jacket.\" The appellant thus does not challenge the finding of the scales found in the closet of what could inferentially be deemed to be his bedroom. Nor\n   does the appellant challenge the possible inference that the appellant was in constructive possession of other drugs during the course of the three-month old conspiracy. He was, after all, convicted of being actively engaged in a conspiracy to distribute something, and that something was not Girl Scout Cookies. The appellant, significantly, raises no challenge to such a permitted inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   The appellant insists that he was nothing more than a casual overnight guest at the apartment of his girlfriend. That, of course, is a possibility. There is also another possibility, however, namely that, as the warrant application alleged, 3320 Teagarden Circle was his primary residence throughout the three-month life of the conspiracy. To help us resolve a choice such as this, we are enjoined, as a matter of law, to take that version of the evidence most favorable to the prevailing party, to wit, the State. We are dealing with the burden of production and not with the burden of persuasion. That version of the evidence most favorable to the State is that 3320 Teagarden Circle was the primary residence of the appellant throughout the life of the investigation. According to that version, the appellant was asleep in his own bedroom when the search party barged in. The closet that was searched belonged to that bedroom. The jacket in the pocket of which the pill bottle was found may have belonged either to the appellant or to his girlfriend. The State's best version of the evidence requires\n   that we draw the former conclusion. The ownership of the jacket, however, was inconsequential. The body of evidence that permitted the jury to find that the appellant was a distributor, and not a mere possessor, of drugs was the entire four-month investigation and not the gender of the jacket containing a pill bottle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   When the police searched 3320 Teagarden Circle on the morning of June 8, 2015, they found the appellant asleep in his bedroom, along with his girlfriend. The closet searched was the closet of that bedroom. The closet contained men's clothing and women's clothing. Assuming that the evidence could not connect both the appellant and Victoria Gaines to the drugs and that a choice had to be made between them, the more likely candidate would certainly be the one who had been, for three months, an active participant in a drug distribution network rather than Victoria Gaines, against whom no such involvement had been demonstrated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Testifying as an expert on the drug trade, Sergeant Jason Cokinos stated that the quantity of drugs found in the bedroom closet on June 8 suggested drug distribution and not personal use. It was the appellant whom the evidence showed to be a drug distributor. During the search, a pill bottle was found in a jacket pocket. The pill bottle contained two baggies of what turned out to be cocaine. Each baggie contained approximately 3.5 grams of cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   We hold that the evidence was legally sufficient to connect the appellant with the cocaine found in his bedroom closet on June 8, 2015. We further hold that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the conviction of the appellant for the possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
