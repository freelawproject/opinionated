The appellees, Brett Austin and Joshua Foti, are the contract purchasers of the License (the \"Contract Purchasers\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The question presented, slightly rephrased, is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Did the circuit court err in its determination that the License had not expired by operation of law when the transfer of the License to the Contract Purchasers was not completed within 180 days after the Board approved the transfer?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We hold that it did and reverse the decision of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Notwithstanding the extended procedural history of this case, the dispositive facts are not in dispute. Turner's closed for business on or about July 11, 2009,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   during the license year\n   ending April 30, 2010. The first application to the Board to transfer the License to the Contract Purchasers was filed on June 19, 2009. That application was approved by the Board on July 23, 2009. On January 19, 2010, Samuel Daniels (the then-Executive Secretary of the Board) signed a memorandum recommending that the deadline to complete the transfer be extended 180 days (to July 5, 2010) \"[b]ased on discussion w/ Mr. Austin and receipt of projected completion schedule.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board granted three additional sixty-day extensions to complete the transfer, all of which were granted after the prior extension period had ended. The last extension was granted on November 15, 2012. In the meantime, the License was renewed in the name of the Contract Purchasers for the license years ending on April 30 in 2011, 2012, and 2013.\n   On February 25, 2013, a second Application for Transfer and Expansion was filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The validity of the License itself was raised when, \"despite having prevailed in their case in chief,\" the Association sought judicial review on that issue. On December 13, 2013, a hearing was held, and on December 23, the circuit court remanded the case to the Board to create a record on the validity issue. On February 20, 2014, the Board held the remand hearing \"to determine the status of the license under the provisions of [Maryland Code (1957, 2011 Repl. Vol.) Article 2B, \u00a7 10-504(d) (\"Article 2B \u00a7 10-504(d)\") ]\" related to liquor license transfers and the expiration of a license 180 days after a license holder has closed the business or ceased actual alcoholic beverages business operations in Baltimore City. At that hearing, the Association argued that the License had \"sat dormant since July 2009,\" and even though the \"Board approved the application for a\n   transfer of ownership to a new location and repeatedly extended [the] approval, no transfer was ever completed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Contract Purchasers argued that the annual renewal of the License without protest \"can certainly be construed as a tolling of the period under Article 2B.\" Moreover, the \"validity\" of their License for May 1, 2013-April 30, 2014, \"was ruled upon,\" and because they had relied on the renewals and the direction they received from the Board, \"principles of collateral estoppel\" and res judicata precluded revisiting the validity issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Board, in the \"decision phase\" of the February 20, 2014 hearing, concluded that \"even with an extension, legal or otherwise, the [L]icense would have been considered dormant\" as of October 17, 2011, notwithstanding extensions or \"a transfer of ownership hearing after that time.\" Characterizing the Contract Purchasers' arguments as \"generally center[ing] around estoppel,\" the Board concluded \"that the only way to avoid the injustice ... is to declare the [L]icense viable as of today.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Association again sought judicial review of the Board's decision. On August 13, 2014, a Stipulation of Dismissal and Agreement for Remand to the Board was entered at the request of the Board and the Association and, on September 17, 2014, the circuit court issued an order remanding to the Board and dismissing the case. The stated purpose of the remand was \"so the [Board] can conduct further proceedings on this matter within sixty (60) days after the date of the dismissal of this appeal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The second remand hearing was held on September 25, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Contract Purchasers moved to dismiss the proceeding on the grounds that the Board had failed to inform them of\n   the judicial review proceedings challenging the Board's February 20, 2014 decision that the License was \"viable.\" In response, the Chair noted that the Contract Purchasers had actual notice of the judicial review proceedings because their counsel, by \"letter dated April 9, 2014,\" wrote the then-Chairman of the Board acknowledging that the Association\n   \"had filed an appeal in the Circuit Court.\" Observing that the Contract Purchasers had not appealed the circuit court decision, the Board denied the motion to dismiss and the hearing proceeded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As to the Board's right to reconsider the viability of the License, the Association argued that the issue was not one of fact, but one of law that the Board was entitled to review. It pointed out that the Board's prior decision had been based on a theory of estoppel resulting from the Board's acceptance of renewal fees after the License had expired. But, it argued, \"the government cannot be estopped under the same terms as other litigants,\" and the Contract Purchasers could not rely on the \"unauthorized acts\" of the Board's agents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Association called as a witness former Senator George Della, who had sponsored the 2000 legislation creating Article 2B \u00a7 10-504(d), which is commonly referred to as the \"180 day rule.\" According to Senator Della:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   It basically says [a] license can remain dormant for 180 days. And then if there's a hardship, then that licensee can come back to the [B]oard and make their case, if they're in a hardship situation. And then the Board could then grant them another extension of 180 days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Beyond that, if they don't activate that license, that license is dead. That's what the legislative intent is behind the 180 day rule. And the Board knew it. The Board knew it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Counsel for the Contract Purchasers stated that they were not arguing estoppel or a mistake by the Board or its agents. Nor were they relying on the hardship extension provisions of the statute. Rather, they were contending, citing\n   <em>\n    Yim, LLC v. Tuzeer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673648\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/211/1/\">\n    211 Md.App. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673648\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/211/1/\">\n    63 A.3d 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), that, notwithstanding\n   cessation of the business itself, the successive renewals of the License \"tolls the 180 period.\" In addition, the Contract Purchasers advanced a policy argument that the Board's adoption of the Association's position would thwart redevelopment efforts in the city because these projects can \"take years\" to complete. The better policy, in their view, was to permit a developer to \"preserve\" an existing license by renewals rather than issuing a new license. That, they argued, would satisfy the legislative \"goal [of] reduc[ing] the number of licenses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In response, counsel for the Association asserted that the Contract Purchasers' policy argument \"is essentially something to be taken up with the legislature,\" but it did not reflect the intent of the current legislation, and thus, its adoption by the Board would be a \"rewrite [of] the law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Board expressly ruled on the validity of the License and, by implication, on the Contract Purchasers' recently filed hardship extension request, which would fail in the absence of a viable License to transfer. The Chairman concluded that \"the license has expired.\" He based his decision on the \"clear command of the law,\" and which had been \"ignored\" by the Board in granting the earlier purported extensions and license renewals \"outside the scope of its authority.\" Commissioner Petersen Moore \"agree[d]\" with the Chairman \"for all the reasons stated.\" Although Commissioner Jones also agreed that \"the license is dead,\" he voted \"no\" because, under the circumstances, he thought that a \"second chance is needed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On October 7, 2014, the Contract Purchasers filed a Petition for Judicial Review. A hearing was held on May 1, 2015, and on May 5, 2015, the circuit court reversed the Board, stating that its decision \"was not supported by substantial evidence\n   and was clearly erroneous as a matter of law.\" The court explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   failure to complete a transfer of a license within 180 days pursuant to Art. 2B \u00a7 10-503(d)(4) does not carry a sanction of expiration of the license. To hold that such a sanction applies is illogical in the face of Art. 2B \u00a7 10-504(d)(2)(i),\n   which provides an exception to the 10-504(d)(2) 180 day expiration provision when a transfer \"has been approved or is pending.\" Furthermore, in the instant case the Board approved the transfer on July 23, 2009, and the record contains several references to the approval and the fact that the transfer \"remains pending.\" Thus, the 2B \u00a7 10-504(d)(2)(i) exception for approved or pending transfers would apply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Board filed its timely appeal on May 29, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"On appellate review of the decision of an administrative agency, this Court reviews the agency's decision, not the circuit court's decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Long Green Valley Ass'n v.

Once the 180 day expiration period provided for in the statute was \"no longer suspended,\" the License \"which had already been inactive for well over 180 days-expired as a matter of law.\" Therefore, according to the Board, any \"purported\" extensions were invalid because they are not authorized by the statute. And, \"[t]he same analysis applies\" to the Board's acceptance of renewal fees \"for the inactive License,\" because the renewal of the License does not \"reset\" or \"extend\" the \"180 day rule.\" The Board recognizes, however, that there may be a situation where the transfer deadline \"overlap[s] two licensing periods.\" When that happens, the license would have to be renewed \"before the transfer has been completed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Contract Purchasers mount a two pronged attack on the denial of their motion to dismiss the remand proceedings.

The second is the contention that the Board was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   barred from holding a second hearing on the same issue when a substantial record has already been created before it, it rendered a decision based on that record ... and no hearing of any kind, nor ruling made on any substantive issue, has been heard nor rendered by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As to the Board's interpretation of the statute at the September 17, 2014, remand hearing, the Contract Purchasers appear\n   to object to the fact that Senator Della had been called as a witness and had testified to the intent of the \"180 day rule\" legislation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   They further contend that the Board \"accepted legal conclusions drawn by [Senator] Della as the basis for its decision.\" More particularly, however, they point to \"the lack of recognition by both [Senator Della] and [the Board] of the pertinent section of Article 2B, namely \u00a7 10-504(d)(2)(i).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   They argue that the subsection's \"then pending\" language \"expand[s] upon the 180 day rule,\" and, citing\n   <em>\n    Yim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673648\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/211/1/\">\n    211 Md.App. at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673648\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/211/1/\">\n    63 A.3d 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that a purchaser of such a license can keep a license from expiring by annual\n   renewals of the license as long as the intended transfer remains \"pending.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Board, in its reply brief, contends that the Contract Purchasers' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Yim\n   </em>\n   is \"misplaced\" because the\n   <em>\n    Yim\n   </em>\n   Court \"merely held that a liquor license did not expire when the licensee had filed a timely request for a hardship extension under \u00a7 10-504(d)(2)(iii) of Article 2B, even though the licensee did not file his annual renewal application on time while the hardship request was pending.\" As to \"impermissibly\" relying on the testimony of Senator Della \"as the basis\" for its interpretation of the statutory language, the Board \"made clear that it was not seeking a legal conclusion\" but \"only background information on the legislative history\" from Senator Della and it made only a mention of legislative history in its \"methodically summarized\" opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In regard to the Contract Purchasers' argument that the Board was not authorized to hold the September 25, 2014 hearing and reconsider its February 20, 2014 decision, the Board states that it denied the Contract Purchasers' motion to dismiss and the circuit court had agreed. Therefore, in the absence of an appeal of the circuit court decision by the Contract Purchasers, the denial of the motion to dismiss was not \"properly\" before the Board in the September 25, 2014 hearing but had it been, it would fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Regarding the Board's failure to provide notice to the Contract Purchasers of the Association's petition for judicial review, the Board argues that the record demonstrates actual notice to the Contract Purchasers within three weeks of the petition being filed. Nevertheless, they took no action to participate in the proceeding in the months leading up to the circuit court's remand to the Board. Moreover, any \"technical deficits\" resulting from the Board's failure to provide notice \"were cured\" because there was no judicial review as a result of the remand and the Contract Purchasers had a full opportunity\n   to participate in the subsequent proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As to Contract Purchasers' res judicata argument, the Board, citing\n   <em>\n    Board of County Comm'rs of Cecil Cty. v.

Regarding the latter, the Association contends that the remand meant that there was no final judgment. The February 20, 2014, decision of the Board went to the circuit court on the Association's petition for judicial review and was then remanded to the Board for further proceedings without a ruling on the merits.

They also argued that the Board violated its Administrative Rule Number One, which was adopted to avoid the Board \"reviewing the decisions of past liquor boards\" and required motions for reconsideration to be filed within sixty days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The circuit court expressly rejected the argument related to Administrative Rule Number One because there was no motion for reconsideration in this case. The circuit court otherwise found the \"denial of the motion to dismiss was appropriate\" and moved directly to the issue of whether the License had \"expired.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Contract Purchasers did not press the notification argument or question the court's failure to expressly address it, and they did not appeal the court's decision. Therefore, the issue is not before us on appeal, but, if it were, they would fare no better.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Not only did the Contract Purchasers have actual notice of the petition for judicial review \"as early as April 9, 2014,\" they took no action in that proceeding in the 161 days between that date and September 17, 2014, when the court signed the order for remand. And, because of the remand, there was no judicial review on the merits. In short, the purpose of the rule was effectively satisfied, and the Contract Purchasers were not deprived of an opportunity to assert their legal rights before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As to any concern regarding Senator Della's testimony, the circuit court did not \"find any error,\" and it is clear from the record that the Board's decision that the License had expired was based on the plain language of the applicable statutory provisions and not on Senator Della's testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The\n   Contract Purchasers argue that the Board was \"barred from holding a second hearing [because] a substantial record ha[d] already been created before it, it [had] rendered a decision based on that record, and no hearing of any kind, nor ruling made on any substantive issue, ha[d] been heard nor rendered by the Circuit Court of Baltimore City.\" In support, they cite\n   <em>\n    Gaywood Comty.

The 180 days can be tolled by \"[a]n application for approval of a transfer to another location or an application for assignment to another person\" which \"has been approved or is then pending.\" In context, \"pending\" clearly refers to a transfer application that is awaiting Board action and not the intended completed transfer. In the absence of a \"hardship extension\" by the Board, the transfer of the License had to be completed not more than 180 days after the Board\n   <em>\n    approved\n   </em>\n   the transfer on July 23, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Not only is the plain language of the statute clear, paragraph (5) of the subsection states the legislative intent, that is,\n   \"the total time period for which a license may be deemed unexpired ... is 180 days if no undue hardship extension is granted, and no more than 360 days if an undue hardship extension has been granted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=331%20A.2d%2055\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10-503(d)(5).
