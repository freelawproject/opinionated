Proc.\") \u00a7 8-301 was improperly denied prior to a hearing, when the petition alleged \"newly discovered evidence\" that a trial witness stated, twenty years later, that he \"lied[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 1993, Jeffrey D. Ebb, Sr. (\"Respondent\") was convicted of two counts of felony murder, one count of attempted murder, one count of attempted armed robbery, and three counts of first-degree assault, stemming from a 1992 armed\n   robbery that resulted in two deaths. Respondent was sentenced to life without parole for the murders, and additional periods of incarceration for the remaining unmerged offenses. At trial, Jerome House-Bowman (\"Mr. House-Bowman\") testified regarding Respondent's intent to commit an armed robbery and identified Respondent as the individual who shot the victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Twenty years later, Mr. House-Bowman, in a signed statement, alleged that he \"lied\" during Respondent's trial \"to save [his] niece, (Stephanie Stevenson) from prosecution and conviction ....\" Based on Mr. House-Bowman's recantation, Respondent filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petition for writ of actual innocence under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301, alleging that Mr. House-Bowman's recantation constituted \"newly discovered evidence\" that created a \"substantial or significant possibility that the result [of Respondent's trial] may have been different.\" Respondent appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals reversed the circuit court, concluding Respondent was entitled to a hearing on the merits of his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we shall vacate the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Underlying Criminal Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the afternoon of November 28, 1992, a gunman entered Brodie's Barbershop in Catonsville, Maryland. During the course of an attempted robbery, two people were killed and another was wounded. Witnesses identified Respondent as the gunman. At a six-day trial, the State called several witnesses, including Stephanie Stevenson (\"Ms. Stevenson\") who testified regarding Respondent's criminal agency. Ms. Stevenson also testified that she participated in the attempted robbery, but that Respondent was the person who shot all three victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Stevenson's testimony was corroborated by Mr. House-Bowman, her uncle. Mr. House-Bowman testified that sometime in December 1992, Respondent told Mr. House-Bowman, in confidence, that Respondent was involved in the \"[b]arbershop\n   murder,\" and that \"it first started out as a robbery. It was supposed to be a robbery and somehow it got fouled up and [Respondent] had to shoot two people.\" Mr. House-Bowman also testified that Respondent told him that Respondent knew where the money was kept in the barbershop, which was why he decided to rob it. Mr. House-Bowman also stated that Respondent described to him in detail how Respondent escaped from the barbershop after he shot the victims.\n   At trial, the State also introduced into evidence a Browning semi-automatic 9 mm pistol that was alleged to have been used during the course of the incident, and purchased by Todd Timmons from Respondent sometime in November 1992. Additionally, the State called Joseph Kopera (\"Mr. Kopera\"), a ballistics and firearm expert employed by the Maryland State Police Crime Laboratory, who testified that all the spent cartridge casings and bullets recovered from the bodies of the victims were fired from the same Browning semi-automatic 9mm pistol that was introduced into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Respondent was convicted of two counts of first-degree felony murder, one count of attempted second-degree murder, one count of attempted armed robbery, and three counts of first-degree assault. The court imposed a sentence of life without the possibility of parole on the murder counts, and imposed an additional 80 years of incarceration, to run concurrently, as to the remaining unmerged counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Respondent's convictions were upheld in an unreported,\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   opinion in the Court of Special Appeals.\n   <em>\n    See Jeffrey D. Ebb, Sr. v. State of Maryland\n   </em>\n   , No. 1809, Sept. Term, 1994 (filed July 20, 1994).

Respondent also filed a petition for writ of actual innocence in 2011, based on the trial testimony of Mr. Kopera-the ballistics expert. That petition was denied after a hearing in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The denial of Respondent's petition was affirmed on appeal in an unreported opinion in the Court of Special Appeals.\n   <em>\n    See Jeffrey D. Ebb, Sr. v. State of Maryland\n   </em>\n   , No. 1342, Sept. Term, 2012 (filed June 16, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 7, 2015, Respondent filed a new petition for writ of actual innocence,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. In the new petition, Respondent alleged that one of the witnesses from his original trial, Mr. House-Bowman, \"recanted his statement and testimony[.]\" Respondent attached a statement\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   from Mr. House-Bowman, dated January 5, 2013, which stated in relevant part, \"I lied, in court, at the trial of Jeffrey Edd [sic] to save my niece, [Ms. Stevenson] from prosecution and conviction, facing her, I just did not tell the truth at the trial, I was trying to help my niece.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 17, 2015, the circuit court denied Respondent's petition without a hearing. In its order, the circuit court concluded that Respondent's petition contained \"merely impeaching evidence, and not material evidence, because [Respondent] was linked to the crime by several other witnesses-including eye witnesses.\" The circuit court noted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Stephanie Stevenson testified in detail about [Respondent's] involvement in the crime, and Charles Dunlop, an eye witness, identified [Respondent] from photographs. Kevin Johnson, another eyewitnesses [sic], testified that he recognized\n   the [Respondent] as the shooter in this case when he saw [Respondent's] picture on the news and notified the police. More importantly, ballistics reports linked the murder weapon to [Respondent].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On July 24, 2015, Respondent filed a motion for reconsideration that was denied in an order dated August 26, 2015. In its denial, the circuit court reiterated there was \"overwhelming evidence, independent from Mr. House-Bowman's testimony, support[ing] [Respondent's] conviction. This evidence includes testimony from [Respondent's] accomplice, two eye witnesses, and [a] ballistic report[ ] that linked the murder weapon to [Respondent].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Thereafter, Respondent filed a timely notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Court of Special Appeals' Reversal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, reversed the circuit court's denial of Respondent's petition without a hearing.\n   <em>\n    See State of Maryland v.

The pleading requirement mandates that the trial court determine whether the allegations could afford a petitioner relief, if those allegations would be proven at a hearing, assuming the facts in the light most favorable to the petitioner and accepting all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the petition. That is, when determining whether to dismiss a petition for writ of actual innocence without a hearing pursuant to [Crim.

We conclude, therefore, that these statements are sufficient to satisfy the pleading requirement of Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   We concluded in\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   that Hardy's petition satisfied Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(7) because the petitioner attached a\n   <em>\n    Baltimore Sun\n   </em>\n   article that raised questions about Mr. Kopera's academic qualifications and an affidavit from the public defender\n   who represented the petitioner that recounted her discovery of Mr. Kopera's misrepresentations, and this information was included in his petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4279258\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/443/238/#p250\">\n    443 Md. at 254-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4279258\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/443/238/#p250\">\n    116 A.3d at 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Respondent attached the statement from Mr. House-Bowman recanting his original testimony to his petition, and in his petition he alleged that \"[Mr. House-Bowman] has now come forward to renounce the testimony and statements he gave against Petitioner and revealed they were all false.\" Respondent also noted in his petition that \"[o]n January 5, 2013, Mr. Floyd Turpin, a private investigator, conducted an interview with [Mr. House-Bowman]. During this interview, [Mr. House-Bowman] signed an affidavit, recanting his statement and testimony at trial, which constitutes newly discovered evidence.\" We conclude the statements included in Respondent's petition and the attachment of Mr. House-Bowman's recantation statement are sufficient to satisfy the pleading requirement in Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(7). Additionally, as discussed more fully\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , we conclude Respondent's petition also satisfied the requirement in Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(8) requiring the alleged newly discovered evidence to create a substantial or significant possibility that the result in Respondent's trial may have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The parties both acknowledge that Respondent's petition does not comply with the requirement in subsection (d)(9) that the petition include an averment \"that the conviction sought to be vacated is based on\n   an offense that the petitioner did not commit.\" Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(9).

Newly Discovered Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The State argues that Mr. House-Bowman's statement is not \"evidence,\" let alone \"newly discovered,\" as those terms have previously been defined. The State avers that \"evidence\" is defined as \"testimony or an item or thing that is capable of being elicited or introduced and moved into the court record, so as to be put before the trier of fact at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hawes v.

Additionally, the State argues that \"newly discovered\" means that the evidence could not have been found through the exercise of due diligence within the time allotted for seeking a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301(a)(2) (\"[a] person... may, at any time, file a petition for writ of actual innocence...if the person claims that there is newly discovered evidence that ... (2) could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under [Maryland] Rule. 4-331.\"). Under both these definitions, and in the favorable light in which we view a petitioner's assertions, we conclude that Respondent properly asserted that Mr. House-Bowman's statement is \"newly discovered evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Respondent included a statement in his petition from Mr. House-Bowman asserting that he \"lied, in court...to save [his] niece, (Stephanie Stevenson) from prosecution and conviction, facing her, [he] just did not tell the truth at the trial, [he] was trying to help [his] niece.\" It is reasonable to infer\n   that if Respondent was granted a hearing on his petition, Mr. House-Bowman would be able to provide testimony that would expound on what he lied about at Respondent's trial. We also note that in his petition, Respondent alleged that Mr. House-Bowman \"has now come forward to renounce the testimony and statements he gave against [Respondent] and revealed they were all false.\" A reasonable inference could be drawn that Mr. House-Bowman may renounce his previous trial testimony. We therefore disagree with the State's argument that Respondent did not include any \"evidence\" in his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We also conclude that Respondent sufficiently asserted that the \"evidence\" is \"newly discovered.\" Mr. House-Bowman's statement is dated January 5, 2013-twenty years after Respondent was originally convicted. Respondent also references in his petition that Mr. House-Bowman \"[came] forward\" to recant his testimony in January 2013. Although the State contends that Respondent failed to explain why this \"newly discovered evidence\" was not ascertained in sufficient time to seek a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331, we conclude that Respondent's assertions are sufficient, at this stage, to satisfy this requirement. We also note that, absent evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to infer that Respondent had \"no way of knowing that a witness who falsely implicated him under oath would later come forward and recant[,]\" until Mr. House-Bowman\n   actually came forward in January 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Significant or Substantial Possibility of a Different Result\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   We also conclude Respondent's \"newly discovered evidence\" could \"create a substantial or significant possibility\" that the outcome of Respondent's trial may have been different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301(a)(1). In Respondent's petition, he notes that at trial Mr. House-Bowman testified that: (1) Respondent confided in Mr. House-Bowman that he was the person police were looking for concerning the barbershop murders; (2) Respondent went to the barbershop to rob it, but he saw a guy reaching for a gun, so he shot the man in the barber chair; (3) because the barber knew Respondent, he\n   also shot him; and (4) Respondent discarded his clothes as he ran through some woods, and exited on a highway and made it to his home from there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Respondent also quoted at length the State's opening, trial presentation, and closing arguments to highlight the State's reliance on Mr. House-Bowman's testimony during his trial. For example, Respondent notes at trial, the prosecutor stated \"[t]he [Respondent] in his statement to [Mr. House-Bowman], 'I went to rob Brodie's Barbershop. I knew he had money and I knew where he kept it.' That is specific intent to rob, ladies and gentlemen.\" Respondent also notes that in his closing statement, the prosecutor stated, in relevant part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   some of the most damning testimony of this trial, the [Respondent] met his friend, [Mr. House-Bowman] and he said [Mr. House-Bowman], I got something to tell you, but you have to take it in the utmost confidence. Absolutely, [Mr. House-Bowman] says. The [Respondent] say I feel that we are that kind of friends where I can tell you what I am about to say. Absolutely, [Mr. House-Bowman] says. You heard about the barbershop murders. Brodie's barbershop? Yeah, I heard about it, [Mr. House-Bowman] said. He dropped the bomb. I am the one the police are looking for. I am the one who did the murders in the barbershop. [Mr. House-Bowman] asked him to expound upon that a little bit. [Respondent] tells [Mr. House-Bowman] that he went to rob the barbershop because he knew the barbershop kept money. [Respondent] told [Mr. House-Bowman] that he shot the man with the gun. Ladies and gentlemen, the man with the gun was Kevin Johnson. The barber was James Brodie. The man in the chair was Michael Peters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   No one knew it: The other thing [Ms. Stevenson] could not have told [Mr. House-Bowman] is that [Respondent] planned to rob Brodie's barbershop, because she didn't know that. She went in expecting to get money. She had called two minutes earlier on the telephone from the pay phone behind the station and Brodie said yeah, come on over, I will finish this up, I will give you the money. She had\n   no expectation of murder and robbery, so she couldn't have told [Mr. House-Bowman].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   So how did [Mr. House-Bowman] know? Because [Respondent] told him. Remember the circumstances of the conversation between [Mr. House-Bowman] and [Respondent]. [Mr. House-Bowman] was very frank about it. We are sitting around, we are getting high. I have known him for about a year. Not a year from the date [Mr. House-Bowman] testified, but a year from the day he gave the statement. [Respondent] told me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   That is what happened. Ladies and gentlemen, you clearly can't dismiss people because of their criminal record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   At this stage of the proceedings, it is reasonable to infer that Mr. House-Bowman's statement that he \"lied, in court, at the trial of Jeffrey Edd [sic] ...\" was a reference to his testimony regarding statements Respondent allegedly made to him about robbing the barbershop.

While it is unclear at this juncture whether Respondent will prevail on his petition, we hold that he has alleged sufficient \"newly discovered evidence\" that could create a \"substantial or significant possibility\" that his original trial may have been different, and is therefore entitled to a hearing under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301(e)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In summary, we hold that a petition that otherwise complies with the pleading requirements contained in Maryland Rule 4-332(d), but fails to include an averment of innocence, may be amended under Maryland Rule 4-332(i)(1)(B) and (h) if the\n   circuit court determines that allowing the petitioner to amend his or her petition\n   would do substantial justice. Here, for Respondent to be entitled to a hearing on the merits of his petition, recognizing that Maryland Rule 4-332(h) indicates that \"[a]mendments to the petition shall be freely allowed in order to do substantial justice[,]\" the circuit court must first determine whether allowing him to amend his petition to comply with the mandatory pleading requirement in Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(9) would do substantial justice, and must articulate its reasoning on the record. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals should be vacated and the case remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS VACATED. CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID BY MONTGOMERY COUNTY.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   McDonald and Watts, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Concurring Opinion by McDonald, J., which Watts, J., joins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   I concur in the very thorough Majority opinion. I write simply to emphasize the significance of the requirement in Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(9) that a petitioner like Mr. Ebb must affirmatively assert that he is actually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted before a circuit court would be required to hold a hearing on a petition. This might be considered a fine point, but it goes to the heart of the statute that allows for a writ of actual innocence-Maryland Code, Criminal Procedure Article (\"CP\"), \u00a7 8-301.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In his petition, Mr. Ebb did not assert, as required by Rule 4-332(d)(9), that \"the conviction sought to be vacated is based on an offense that [Mr. Ebb] did not commit.\" This is not mere boilerplate. As this Court recently stated, \"[o]nly defendants who can allege that they are 'actually innocent,' meaning they did not commit the crimes for which they are convicted, may bring a petition for relief under [the writ of actual innocence\n   statute].\"\n   <em>\n    Smallwood v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314769,12488930\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/451/290/\">\n    451 Md. 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 320,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314769,12488930\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/451/290/\">\n    152 A.3d 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   It is true that a petitioner might be found to be in \"substantial compliance\" with this requirement where the record establishes that the petitioner has previously asserted actual innocence under oath, particularly when the State has never objected to the failure to repeat that assertion in the petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGhie v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778729,12486895\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/449/494/\">\n    449 Md. 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 509 n.6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778729,12486895\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/449/494/\">\n    144 A.3d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). It is also true that the rule was drafted in recognition that many such petitions would be filed by\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petitioners and therefore provides that amendments should be \"freely allowed in order to do substantial justice.\" Rule 4-332(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   But here there is no indication, at least in the materials available to us, that Mr. Ebb has ever asserted under oath (or otherwise) that he was actually innocent of the offenses for which he was convicted. Nor has Mr. Ebb apparently ever sought to amend his petition to that effect. And the State has certainly raised the issue of compliance with Rule 4-332.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The closest that Mr. Ebb has come is his assertion, in his brief to the Court of Special Appeals, that he \"has maintained his innocence as being wrongfully convicted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is not an assertion of actual innocence. In our system of criminal justice,\n   even one who has actually committed a criminal offense may legitimately maintain that he was wrongfully convicted. A criminal defendant has the right to put the State's evidence to the test and, if that evidence was obtained in violation of the Constitution or if there is some other serious defect with the prosecution, may quite correctly assert that he was \"wrongfully convicted\" and obtain reversal of a conviction. But that is a far cry from actual innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In his brief, Mr. Ebb argues that his \"newly discovered evidence\"-actually, an alleged recantation of inculpatory trial testimony by a prosecution witness-would lighten the weight\n   of the evidence against him such that it would no longer satisfy the standard of \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" That may be an assertion that he was wrongfully convicted, but it is not an assertion that he is actually innocent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   As this Court's detailed analysis of the legislative history of CP \u00a7 8-301 in\n   <em>\n    Smallwood\n   </em>\n   demonstrated, the statute was designed to provide relief to a \"narrow subset\" of convicted defendants who are actually innocent of the offense for which they had been convicted, but have no other means of litigating the claim of innocence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smallwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314769,12488930\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/451/290/\">\n    451 Md. at 316-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314769,12488930\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/451/290/\">\n    152 A.3d 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
