Goodbody &amp; Company made no motion addressed to the bill and since the order denying Townsend\u2019s motion to strike, they filed an answer and a counter-claim against complainant and Townsend.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-6\">\u201cThe bill shows that Townsend\u2019s account with Goodbody <em>&amp; </em>Company has been running for two years prior to filing the bill. This account was operated on a margin and during that period there may have been many transactions of purchase and sale. Complainant requested Goodbody <em>&amp; </em>Company to sue Townsend for the purpose of fixing the amount of Townsend\u2019s indebtedness, but Goodbody <em>&amp; </em>Company refused and threatened to sell complainant\u2019s collateral to pay the sum which they claim Townsend owed them. It is apparent that complainant could not, with safety, pay the amount claimed by Goodbody &amp; Company, unless Townsend admitted its correctness and the bill charges, in effect, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Townsend declined to make such admission; therefore, it is necessary that an account be taken for the purpose of determining exactly how much Townsend owes Goodbody &amp; Company, but such an accounting, to be binding on Townsend, cannot be had unless Townsend is made a party to it. The bill does not specifically pray that an account be taken of the amount due from Townsend to Goodbody &amp; Company, but under chancery rule 60, relief other than that prayed for may be given (without a prayer for general relief) to the same extent as if general or other relief had been prayed for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-4\">\u201cFurther, the bill shows that Goodbody <em>&amp; </em>Company hold a lien for Townsend\u2019s debt on two deposits of securities, one made by Townsend and the other made by complainant. The complainant insists that in equity, Goodbody &amp; Company, should be required to resort to the security given by Townsend, before Goodbody <em>&amp; </em>Company can sell the complainant\u2019s collateral. It also appears that complainant has no adequate remedy at law against Goodbody <em>&amp; </em>Company, or Townsend. He cannot redeem the stock he pledged for Townsend\u2019s debt without satisfying such indebtedness and he cannot sue Townsend at law until he first pays Goodbody &amp; Company. In both cases it is necessary that an account of Townsend\u2019s indebtedness to Goodbody &amp; Company be taken to fix Townsend\u2019s primary liability, so that an accounting by Goodbody <em>&amp; </em>Company, to which Townsend is a party and can be bound by decree, is a necessity. It further appears that if the complainant cannot have the relief he seeks in this action, a multiplicity of suits may be necessary: (1) An action by complainant against Goodbody &amp; Company, alone, to redeem his securities and payment by complainant of the amount which may be established in that suit as Townsend\u2019s debt. (2) A suit by complainant against Townsend for the amount of the decree as paid by complainant in the first action, in which suit against Townsend, the latter may contest the amount due from him to Goodbody <em>&amp; </em>Company. (3) If in the suit against Townsen'd complainant cannot establish Townsend\u2019s debt to Goodbody <em>&amp; </em>Company, at the amount decreed in complainant\u2019s action against Goodbody &amp; Company, then another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>suit by complainant against Goodbody &amp; Company, to recover complainant\u2019s overpayment to Goodbody &amp; Company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-4\">\u201cI am of the opinion that this action is properly brought to determine Townsend\u2019s liability to Goodbody &amp; Company, complainant\u2019s liability to Goodbody &amp; Company, and Townsend\u2019s liability to complainant and that Townsend is a necessary party for the complete and final settlement of the issues presented by the bill. Townsend has such an interest in the whole controversy that no decree could be made on the issues presented in a suit merely between complainant and Goodbody &amp; Company. No suit to which Townsend is not a party would make possible a complete determination of the rights of all parties, or settle the whole controversy and particularly could no decree be made fixing the amount of Townsend\u2019s liability to Goodbody &amp; Company, and directing sale of his securities to satisfy such indebtedness, unless the court has jurisdiction over Townsend as a party to the suit.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-5\"><em>Mr. Merritt </em>Lane, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-6\"><em>Mr. George G. </em>Tennant, for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b110-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The order appealed from will be affirmed, for the reasons stated in the opinion delivered by Vice-Chancellor Fielder in the court of chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\"><em>For affirmance </em>\u2014 The Chief-Justice, Trbnchard, Parker, Lloyd, Case, Bodine, Donges, Heher, Van Buskirk, Kays, Hetfield, Dear, Wells, Dill, JJ. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 None.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
