Such they cannot do collaterally as is attempted in the instant case. The law courts afforded defendants ample remedy for the determination of questions of alleged illegal procedure relating to the tax sale of the property in question, mooted herein. Defendants neglected to avail themselves thereof. It appears from the proofs herein that the owners of record of the property in question were fully aware of the manner in which the property was assessed. If they considered themselves aggrieved by reason thereof, ample statutory remedies were afforded for the relief of their alleged grievances, upon resort thereto and ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>propriate application therefor. Eecourse may not be had to the court of chancery to remedy the alleged grievance. The matter of illegal assessment (if illegal it was) could have been remedied by application to the supreme court in <em>certiorari </em>proceedings therefor. Defendants could have obtained an apportionment of the property, for taxing purposes, if apportionment thereof was proper, upon . application to the municipal authorities therefor, and if the municipal authorities refused to grant the desired apportionment the property owners (if they were entitled to such apportionment) could have resorted to the supreme court, in <em>mandamus </em>proceedings, to require the municipal authorities to make such apportionment. Furthermore, defendants might have sought recourse to the procedure prescribed by <em>P. L. 1925 p. 480, </em>but failed to do so, and in view thereof this court is required to strike out such part of defendants\u2019 answer as denies the validity of the tax, or the legality of the proceedings to sell, or the legality of the sale, and proceed as if no such defense had been interposed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-4\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 principal argument in the case <em>sub judice </em>is that they are entitled to an apportionment of the property in question herein, ostensibly in order that a portion only of said property may be redeemed. As stated in defendants\u2019 trial memorandum submitted to me: 'The only question involved is an apportionment of the tax valuation against a parcel already officially defined and separately valued during three of the five years involved in the present sale.\u2019 In defendants\u2019 trial memorandum it, is said: 'Under the prayer of the hill as well as the terms of the statute which prescribes the procedure, we submit that it is the defendants\u2019 right to have the taxes apportioned and the equitable part thereof chargeable against each parcel determined and fixed as the amount to be paid in redemption.\u2019 I am not in accord with defendants\u2019 claim. The defendants have no right, in my judgment, to have the taxes apportioned in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Defendants claim that the tax sales were illegal. The court of chancery is without authority to determine such claim. The supreme court is the appropriate tribunal to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>such- claim. I will advise an order accordingly, and direct therein that an account be taken of what is due and owing to the complainant on account of the tax sale, and the subsequent taxes, water rents, -recording fees, search fees and all legal expenses, authorized by law, and also -that the- defendants be ordered to pay what may be found to be \u25a0 due,. together with costs of suit, -at a- time to be designated by the court in the decree for the payment thereof, and- that in default thereof the defendants and all persons claiming by, through, dr under them, be barred and foreclosed \u2022 of and from all equity of redemption in or to said premises in said certificate of sale mentioned and described and every part thereof.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-4\"><em>Messrs.
