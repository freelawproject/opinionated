By moving to proceed IFP, Muzny is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. </em>Taylor, 117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">Muzny contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying a sentencing reduction because it gave too much weight to his criminal history and not enough weight to other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, including unwarranted sentence disparities, as well as his post-sentence rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">Contrary to Muzny\u2019s assertions, the record reflects that the district court considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, expressly determining that relief was unwarranted especially in light of Muzny\u2019s significant criminal history. The district court further determined that Muzny\u2019s 188-month sentence fell within the amended guidelines range. Thus, Muzny cannot show an abuse of discretion.on the district court\u2019s part. <em>See United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-18\">Muzny has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Additionally, because this appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b203-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir, R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
