Saint-Surin, who was in fugitive status, was arrested in Ecuador by local authorities on November 12, 2009, and transferred to United States custody on November 13, 2009. On April 9, 2010, represented by retained counsel, he pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to conspiracy to import five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a). Prior to sentencing, he moved the District Court withdraw his guilty plea, claiming among other things that his retained counsel was laboring under a conflict of interest. The court denied his motion, but appointed the Federal Public Defender to represent him. The court subsequently sentenced him to prison for a term of 180 months. Saint-Surin appealed, challenging the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw and claiming that his signature on a legal services agreement (dealing with his representation by the Public Defender) was forged. We affirmed. <em>United States v. Saint-Surin, </em>477 Fed.Appx. 683 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-16\">On January 12, 2015, Saint \u2014 Surin, appearing <em>pro se, </em>moved the District Court to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 782 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. The amendment lowered the base -offense level for most drug offenses. The court denied his motion, and he appeals the decision, arguing that the court improperly denied his motion based on claims he made in his earlier motion to vacate filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He also contends that the purposes of a criminal sentence set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) support a reduction in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>We review the District Court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment based on a Guidelines sentence range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 782 provides a two-level reduction in the base offense level for most drug offenses. U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 782. In considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the court must engage in a two-part analysis. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court recalculates the sentence under the amended guidelines, determining a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine the sentence it would have imposed. <em>Id. </em>Second, the court decides whether, in its discretion, it will elect to impose the newly calculated sentence under' the amended sentence range or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781. In exercising this discretion, the court should consider the \u00a7 3553(a) purposes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(B)(i)). The court must also consider the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or community that may be posed by a reduction, and it may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing. conduct. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 927 (11th Cir.2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(B)(ii),(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">We find no abuse of discretion here. The record discloses that the District Court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) purposes. While the court did not specify which of the purposes guided its decision, the court did consider its previous finding that Saint-Surin\u2019s testimony during his motion to withdraw his guilty plea was \u201cknowingly false.\u201d The court acted within its discretion in doing that. Moreover, it was within the court\u2019s discretion to consider SaintSurin\u2019s post-sentencing filings where he continued to challenge the authenticity of the legal services agreement and his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>waiver. <em>See Smith, </em>568 F.3d at 927 (the court \u201cmay consider the post-sentencing conduct of the defendant\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). While Saint-Surin had a right to challenge the proceedings, he did not have the right to testify falsely or submit false pleadings. <em>See Nix, </em>475 U.S. at 173, 106 S.Ct. at 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">.
