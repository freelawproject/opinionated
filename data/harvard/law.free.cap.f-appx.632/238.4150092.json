HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b264-17\">Willard Mahavier defaulted on his home mortgage held by PNC Bank. PNC posted the property for foreclosure. Mahavier then sued PNC in state court, seeking to enjoin the foreclosure. Mahavier claimed, among other things, that PNC breached its contract with Mahavier by failing to properly credit payments that it had received from him. PNC moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted. The district court held that Ma-havier- could not bring a claim for breach of contract because he had breached his contract with PNC first by defaulting on his payment obligations. The court dismissed his remaining claims on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-22\">Mahavier now appeals, challenging only the district court\u2019s dismissal of his breach-of-contraet claim. We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Harris Cnty. Texas v. MERSCORP Inc., </em>791 F.3d 545, 551 (5th Cir.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-23\">The summary judgment record shows the following undisputed facts. In August 2000, Mahavier took out a residential mortgage to buy a house in San Antonio. In February 2006, he refinanced the mortgage with Merrill Lynch. To provide security for the refinanced loan, Mahavier signed two documents in Merrill Lynch\u2019s favor: (1) a deed of trust, which secured the loan with a lien on the house, and (2) a \u201cmortgage pledge agreement for securities account,\u201d which secured the loan with a security interest in Mahavier\u2019s Merrill Lynch brokerage account, then worth about fifty thousand dollars. Merrill Lynch later assigned the loan and the related security interests to PNC.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-24\">On appeal, Mahavier challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim against PNC for breach of the deed of trust. To prove his breach-of-contract claim under Texas law, Mahavier must be able to show, among other things, that he \u201cperform[ed] or tendered performance\u201d under the deed of trust. <em>Woodhaven Partners, Ltd. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number><em>Shamoun &amp; Norman, L.L.P., </em>422 S.W.3d 821, 837 (Tex.App.2014). Here, the deed of trust provided, in relevant part, that \u201c[Mahavier] shall pay when due the principal of, and interest on, the debt evidenced by the Note and any prepayment charges and late charges due under the Note.\u201d In 2010, Mahavier defaulted on the note. By May 2013, he was \u201cseriously in default.\u201d Thus, by May 2013, Mahavier was in breach of the deed of trust \u2014 which means he cannot establish the second element of his breach-of-contract claim. So the district court properly dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In response, Mahavier argues that money taken by PNC from his brokerage account cured his default. It did not. In 2013, when Mahavier had been in default for three years, PNG exercised its power under the pledge agreement to liquidate the brokerage account, then worth $56,680.12, and apply the proceeds to the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The pledge agreement provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">6. Remedies Upon Default Under Loan Documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">(a) In the event that Borrower fails to make any payment due under the Loan or otherwise is in default under the Loan Documents<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d), [lender] may at its option sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the [account] and may apply to the proceeds ... to any and all amounts due and owing on the Loan ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">(d) Neither the sale or other disposition of Collateral by [Lender] ... shall be deemed (i) to cure any default under the Loan Documents; (ii) a tender of arrear-ages or of performance sufficient to require reinstatement of the Loan; (iii) a waiver of acceleration or of the right to accelerate the Loan; or (iv) a waiver of any of [Lender\u2019s] other rights under the Loan Documents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">PNC applied $37,184.68 from the brokerage account to Mahavier\u2019s mortgage and sent Mahavier a check for the remaining $19,495.44. Of the amount that PNC applied to the mortgage, $19,047.28 went to interest and $18,137.36 to outstanding principal. The brokerage-account funds reduced Mahavier\u2019s principal balance from $112,210.48 to $93,073.06. By the plain terms of the pledge agreement, PNC was permitted, in the event of default, to apply the brokerage-account funds to Mahavier\u2019s loan. That is exactly what PNC did. The pledge agreement also expressly provides that those funds would not be \u201cdeemed ... to cure any default.\u201d Thus, Mahavier has not shown that the district court erred by 'finding him in default and therefore in breach of his agreement with PNC. That means he also has not shown that district court erred by holding that his breach-of-contract claim was barred by his own breach. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-10\">. \"Loan Documents\" is defined as the \"[N]ote, the Security Document (as defined below), any Assignment of Lease and any other documents (other than this Agreement) executed by Borrower and delivered to [lender], evidencing or securing the Loan.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
