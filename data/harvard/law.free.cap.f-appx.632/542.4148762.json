Hum-bert argues that his conviction is imper-missibly tainted by improper remarks by the government and extraneous influences on the jury. Neither of his arguments warrants vacating his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-15\">At Humbert\u2019s jury trial, the government called his co-defendant, Antonio Norris, as a witness. Norris testified that he pleaded guilty before Humbert\u2019s trial, but had no plea agreement with the government and received no benefit for his plea. He further testified that he was not immune from prosecution for violent crimes and that his testimony could be used against him if he testified falsely.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-16\">On cross-examination, the defense questioned Norris about a recorded phone conversation in which a woman said Norris had killed someone. Norris explained that two men with guns had tried to rob him and he had killed one of them in the ensuing struggle. Norris testified that, although people had tried to rob him on numerous occasions, he didn\u2019t carry a gun. Norris later said that he had committed \u201cno violent crimes, [and had] never committed any violent things in [his] life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-17\">During closing arguments, the defense characterized Norris as an inveterate liar who would \u201csay anything that he needed to say here in court so he can get a break in his sentence.\u201d In particular, the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>argued that Norris lied to the jury when he testified that he did not carry a gun and was not a violent person. The defense asserted that Norris lied about the violent crimes because he was subject to prosecution for any violent crimes he had committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">In rebuttal, the government argued that Norris had no immunity for any violent crimes he may have committed, saying, \u201cif he killed somebody, I hope he gets prosecuted for it.\u201d The government went on to note that all participants in a conspiracy are liable for the foreseeable actions of their co-conspirators, so that, if \u201cNorris killed someone, in furtherance of [the conspiracy in which Humbert was involved], there will not only be one defendant sitting at the table, there could very well be two.\u201d The prosecutor explained that the government had \u201cno interest\u201d in failing to prosecute someone for an offense as serious as murder, and further remarked that he believed law enforcement took their responsibilities seriously and would not \u201chold back\u201d if they had evidence that someone had committed murder. Finally, the government stated that any unconfirmed murders \u201cfrom [Humbert\u2019s] business\u201d would \u201cbe answered [for].\u201d The defense immediately objected to the suggestion that \u201cthe murders that Antonio Norris committed have anything to do with [Humbert].\u201d In response to the objection, the district court promptly instructed the jurors to \u201crely on [their] recollection of the testimony in evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">While the jury was deliberating, it sent the district court a note explaining that a juror lived and worked in the area where the offenses occurred and was afraid \u201cthat a verdict endangered] their life.\u201d The court called the parties in and asked how they wanted the court to handle the note. Humbert argued that the note \u201cimplie[d] somebody might have information about that area that they have brought into the jury room,\u201d but also stated that he did not \u201cknow what that person who lives and works in the area may have said to the other jurors with regard to the area.\u201d He said that he wanted \u201cto know whether or not this juror ... discussed with the other members of the jury anything that was not introduced at the trial.\u201d Humbert therefore requested that the court individually question the juror to determine \u201cwhat, if anything, he or she [] disclosed to the panel regarding the fear expressed.\u201d The court elected not to interview the juror, but agreed to instruct the jury \u201cto consider only the evidence introduced at trial\u201d and to advise the court if \u201canyone [had] introduced other matters into the deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Humbert moved for a mistrial, contending that the note showed that \u201cextrinsic matters [had] been entered into the jury deliberations and that,\u201d contrary to the court\u2019s instructions, \u201cthe foreperson and all of the other jurors [had] decided not to disclose that to the court.\u201d Alternatively, Humbert asked that the district court interview the foreperson to ascertain which jurors might have been tainted by outside information. After a hearing, the court denied Humbert\u2019s requests, concluding that mere statements that jurors were concerned for their safety did not present the sort of danger that warranted a mistrial or juror interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The jury eventually returned a verdict finding Humbert guilty on all counts. Humbert appeals that verdict, arguing: (1) that the government\u2019s closing statement was riddled with improprieties, and (2) that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial or an interview with the foreperson.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">The government didn\u2019t engage in misconduct when it pointed out to the jury that Norris was still potentially criminally</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>liable for any violent crimes he committed. That argument was permissible because it directly responded to the part of the defense\u2019s closing argument characterizing Norris as someone who would \u201csay anything that he needed to say here in court so he can get a break in his sentence.\u201d One way to rebut that characterization was to remind the jury, as the government did, that Norris\u2019s testimony didn\u2019t entitle him to \u201ca break in his sentence\u201d or any other type of leniency. \u201cThe prosecutor, as an advocate, is entitled to make a fair response to the arguments of defense counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Hiett, </em>581 F.2d 1199, 1204 (5th Cir.1978). The government\u2019s argument that Norris was still criminally liable for violent crimes he committed \u2014 indeed, was likely to be prosecuted in the event there was evidence of those crimes \u2014 was permissible under the \u201cfair response\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The government\u2019s remark at trial, ostensibly linking Humbert to an uncharged killing, also does not warrant reversal. Remarks by the government are reversible error only if: (1) they are improper, and (2) they prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Reeves, </em>742 F.3d 487, 505 (11th Cir.2014). \u201cA defendant\u2019s substantial rights are prejudicially affected when a reasonable probability arises that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir.2006). Assuming the government\u2019s remark about the killing was improper, Humbert hasn\u2019t shown substantial prejudice from the remark. It is unlikely the remark prejudiced Humbert\u2019s substantial rights because, immediately after the remark was made, the district court instructed the jurors to rely only on their recollection of the evidence presented at trial, instead of on the lawyers\u2019 arguments. When a district court takes a curative measure in response to possible prosecuto-rial misconduct, we will reverse only if the evidence is so prejudicial that it is incurable by that measure. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>590 F.3d 1238, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). The government\u2019s . remark speculating about the killing doesn\u2019t rise to that level. It is also significant that, throughout the trial, the district court repeatedly instructed the jurors to consider only the evidence in the record, not the lawyers\u2019 arguments. We presume jurors follow instructions, <em>United States v. Mock, </em>523 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir.2008), which further diminishes the potential prejudice from the remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">And the evidence of Humbert\u2019s guilt is overwhelming. The jury heard eyewitness testimony about Humbert discarding crack cocaine and a firearm, a recording of Hum-bert talking about drug trafficking, and extensive testimony from one of his co-conspirators about Humbert\u2019s role in the drug-trafficking operation. Thus, even if the government\u2019s remark about the killing was improper, it did not affect Humbert\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">That leaves Humbert\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion for either a mistrial or an interview with members of the jury. To prevail on such an argument, a defendant must make a colorable showing of improper extraneous influence on the jury. <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>782 F.3d 1251, 1260 (11th Cir.2015). Humbert has failed to make that showing here. The juror in question had simply stated that he or she lived and worked in the area where the offenses occurred and was afraid a verdict would endanger his or her safety. That information, without more, does not constitute concrete evidence that the juror introduced extraneous information into the deliberations. At most, it gives rise only to speculation about what else the juror <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>might have said. \u201cWhere allegations are speculative or unsubstantiated,\u201d we have said, \u201cthe [district court\u2019s] burden to investigate does not arise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1258. It\u2019s also significant that, in an abundance of caution, the district court did issue a curative instruction to the jury and directed the jurors to tell the court if anyone had introduced extraneous evidence into the deliberations. That instruction reduced the likelihood of prejudice from extraneous information. Humbert\u2019s contention that the jury may have ignored that instruction is just more speculation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
