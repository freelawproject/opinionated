She claims disability as of November 4, 2010 due to diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, neuropathy, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>ruptured Achilles tendons in both ankles. After the Commissioner denied her application for benefits, she received a hearing in front of an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). Frisby testified at that hearing that she had been working full-time as an apartment manager until November 2010, when her employer closed down her apartment community. She testified that she returned to work as an apartment manager for the same company in September 2011, earning about $2,000 per month. She drew unemployment benefits in between. She also testified that her employer allowed her to live in a corporate apartment on the property. Though employed full-time, her testimony indicated that she was \u201cnot being very productive right now.\u201d A co-worker submitted an affidavit that Frisby had physical difficulty at work and required assistance from other employees to do her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The ALJ evaluated Frisby\u2019s claim using the \u201cfive-step sequential analysis\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">(1) whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity (whether the claimant is working); (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) whether the claimant\u2019s impairment meets or equals the severity of an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R., Part 404, Subpart B, Appendix 1; (4) whether the impairment prevents the claimant from doing past relevant work (whether the claimant can return to his old job); and (5) whether the impairment prevents the claimant from doing any other work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-7\"><em>Perez v. Barnhart, </em>415 F.3d 457, 461 (5th Cir.2005) (citations omitted); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). The ALJ denied her claim at Step One. It found she had engaged in \u201csubstantial gainful activity\u201d since September 2011. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1572. Specifically, the ALJ found that she had engaged in \u201csubstantial work activity,\u201d <em>see id., </em>since September 2011 when she returned to work and had worked for \u201csubstantial earnings\u201d in that capacity, <em>see 2 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1574(a)(1). The ALJ also noted the inconsistency in Frisby\u2019s claim for disability benefits and her receipt of unemployment benefits, which requires an individual to hold herself out as being \u201cready, willing, and able to work.\u201d <em>See Thibodeaux v. Astrue, </em>324 Fed.Appx. 440, 443 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Barrett v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 1019, 1024 (8th Cir.1994). The ALJ denied her claim because the evidence indicated Frisby\u2019s condition did not prevent her from engaging in substantial gainful activity for the required continuous twelve-month period. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">The Appeals Council denied Frisby\u2019s request for review, rendering the ALJ\u2019s decision as the Commissioner\u2019s final administrative action. She further appealed to the district court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), which affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision for the Commissioner. She now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to two inquiries: (1) whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, and (2) whether the Commissioner applied the proper legal standard. Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. It is more than a mere scintilla and less than a preponderance. In applying the substantial evidence standard, the court scrutinizes the record to determine whether such evidence is present, but may not reweigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for the Commissioner\u2019s. Conflicts of evidence are for the Commissioner, not the courts, to resolve. If the Commissioner\u2019s fact findings are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>supported by substantial evidence, they are conclusive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><em>Perez, </em>415 F.3d at 461 (internal citations and quotations omitted). Applying these standards, we affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Frisby\u2019s own testimony indicates that she received substantial earnings after she returned to work in September 2011. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1574(b)(2) (setting the substantial earnings level). Generally, working for substantial earnings indicates an ability to do substantial gainful activity absent a contrary showing by the claimant. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1574(a)(1); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 404.1574(b); <em>Copeland v. Colvin, </em>771 F.3d 920, 924 (5th Cir.2014); <em>White v. Heckler, </em>740 F.2d 390, 394 (5th Cir.1984). To, be found disabled, an individual must be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of a medical impairment for a continuous period of at least twelve months. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). Since Frisby returned to substantial gainful activity in September 2011, less than twelve months after the alleged onset of her disability in November 2010, she is not disabled and cannot receive benefits. <em>See Barnhart v. Walton, </em>535 U.S. 212, 217-22, 122 S.Ct. 1265, 1269-72, 152 L.Ed.2d 330 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Frisby does not contest this on appeal. Instead, she argues the ALJ erred by failing to address evidence that she returned to work under special conditions. These are that she was not supervised at work, lived onsite in a corporate apartment, and received assistance from other employees. Work done under special conditions may not support a finding that a claimant is able to do substantial gainful activity. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1573(c). Frisby\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our analogous decision in <em>Ellis v. Bowen, </em>where we held \u201cthe fact that a person works in a sheltered environment or at some other subsidized job does not alone establish- disability if the claimant receives substantial earnings.\u201d 820 F.2d 682, 684 (5th Cir.1987). Thus, even if Frisby could establish that she worked under special conditions, disability payments are precluded by the ALJ\u2019s finding that she engaged in substantial gainful activity by means of her substantial earnings. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, even if the evidence supporting Frisby\u2019s claim of special conditions is true, it falls short of the burden she must meet because she has not demonstrated her employer permitted her to work at a lower level of productivity or consented to, or was even aware of, the alleged accommodations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1573(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">For these reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b252-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R, 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\">. We need not address Frisby\u2019s argument that the district court affirmed the AU\u2019s decision on grounds different from those relied upon by the ALJ. <em>See Randall v. Astrue, </em>570 F.3d 651, 663 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cIt is well established ... that even though the case comes to us on appeal from a final judgment of the district court, we focus our review not on the district court\u2019s decisional process but on the ALJ\u2019s.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
