California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent- review of the record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Dixon\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-23\">Because the final judgment incorrectly listed the offenses of conviction, we VACATE and REMAND for the limited purpose of correcting this clerical error. Dixon\u2019s conviction as to Count 1 was under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2119(2) and 2, and his conviction as to Count 2 was .under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 2. Finally, given our resolution of Mallonee\u2019s <em>Anders </em>motion, Dixon\u2019s motion for the appointment of new counsel is DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-19\">. We acknowledge that Dixon expressed dissatisfaction with trial counsel\u2019s performance and that he might wish to argue that his counsel was ineffective. Such claims, however, generally \"are not considered for the first time on direct appeal,\u201d but rather are best reserved for postconviction proceedings. <em>United States v. Tyndale, </em>209 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
