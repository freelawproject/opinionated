By moving to proceed IFP, Doyle is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Doyle argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a reduction of sentence. He contends that the district court did not meaningfully review his motion and considered only the facts of the case and his criminal history. Doyle also asserts that the court did not consider his eligibility for the reduction under Amendment 782. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">In its order denying relief, the district court recognized that Doyle was eligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). However, the district court denied Doyle\u2019s motion as a matter of discretion, referring specifically to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors of the nature and circumstances. of the offense, the need to promote respect for the law, and the need to provide adequate deterrence. The court also referenced Doyle\u2019s criminal history in denying the motion. Doyle has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by denying him a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">This appeal does not present a non-frivolous issue. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Doyle\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b201-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
