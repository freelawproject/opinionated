Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) for delivering cocaine and for possessing cocaine with intent to deliver it are \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d for purposes of the federal Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). They are. That much is clear from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cserious drug offense,\u201d which expressly covers state-law offenses that involve \u201cdistributing controlled substances\u201d \u2014 like cocaine \u2014 or possessing controlled substances with intent to distribute them. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A). It follows that the district court did not err in concluding that Felix Warren\u2019s prior convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) for delivering cocaine and for possessing cocaine with intent to sell or deliver it qualify as serious drug offenses under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">In 2014 a federal grand jury indicted Warren on two counts of possessing a gun as a convicted felon and one count of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute it. He pleaded guilty to all three counts. The presentence investigation report (PSR) recommended sentencing Warren as an armed career criminal. Under the ACCA, a felon convicted of possessing a gun is an armed career criminal if he has previously been convicted of at least three predicate offenses. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(1). There are two types of ACCA predicate offense: \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d and \u201cserious drug offense[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The PSR identified three such offenses in Warren\u2019s criminal record: a 1991 conviction for aggravated assault, a 1996 conviction for violating Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) by possessing cocaine with intent to sell or deliver it, and a 2007 conviction for violating \u00a7 893.13(1) by delivering cocaine. Finding that Warren\u2019s three predicate offenses qualified him as an armed career criminal, the PSR calculated his guidelines sentence to be 188-235 months in prison, a longer sentence than the guidelines would prescribe for someone in Warren\u2019s shoes who was not an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">At sentencing, Warren asked for a continuance so he could brief an argument that a crime could not be a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA unless remuneration was an element of the crime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Warren asserted that, because Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) does not make remuneration an element of the crimes of delivering cocaine or possessing cocaine with intent to deliver it, his convictions under \u00a7 893.13(1) did not involve \u201cserious drug offenses,\u201d with the result that he had not been convicted of three ACCA predicate offenses. The district court denied Warren\u2019s request for a continuance, but stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-8\">Any calculations or sentence enhancements that would be predicated on prior offenses, predicate offenses, whether as a career criminal, armed career criminal, or simply an enhancement in a nonca-reer category, I\u2019ll note for the record that you\u2019re preserving your appellate rights with respect to those predicate offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>The district court then adopted the PSR\u2019s guidelines calculations, although it ultimately varied downward to a sentence of 180 months for each count of conviction, to be served concurrently. After the district court imposed the sentence, Warren objected that it was procedurally and substantively unreasonable inasmuch as the district court had not addressed his argument about the relationship between remuneration and the ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d The district court responded that Warren\u2019s argument was foreclosed by Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit precedent. It then entered judgment including the sentence it had imposed and Warren timely appealed that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Warren challenges, on two grounds, the district court\u2019s conclusion that he committed three ACCA predicate offenses. First, he argues that, because Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) does not require proof of remuneration, neither of his prior convictions under that statute counts as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. Second, he contends that, because \u00a7 893.13(1) does not require the government to prove <em>mens rea </em>to obtain a conviction for delivering cocaine, his conviction for delivering cocaine in violation of \u00a7 893.13(1) does not qualify as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">Warren\u2019s first argument \u2014 that only crimes having remuneration as an element count as \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d \u2014 is belied by the text of the ACCA, which provides that a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d is simply \u201can offense under State law,\u201d punishable by at least ten years in prison, that involves \u201cmanufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). The ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cserious drug offense\u201d is clear and unambiguous and neither expresses nor implies a remuneration requirement. \u201cWhere the language Congress chose to express its intent is clear and unambiguous, that is as far as we go to ascertain its intent because we must presume that Congress said what it meant and meant what it said.\u201d <em>United States v. Steele, </em>147 F.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir.1998) (en banc). In defining \u201cserious drug offense,\u201d Congress said nothing about a remuneration requirement, so we hold that Congress did not mean for such a requirement to be part of the ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">Warren contends that <em>Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013), requires us to read a remuneration requirement into the ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cserious drug offense,\u201d but it does not. <em>Moncrieffe </em>involved the meaning of \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d in the Controlled Substances Act, which is not at issue in this case. The ACCA does not use the phrase \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d in defining \u201cserious drug offense,\u201d and there is no obvious reason why \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d and \u201cserious drug offense\u201d should have the same elements, particularly when Congress employed the two different terms in different contexts. <em>Moncrieffe </em>addressed a question unrelated to the one Warren presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">Warren\u2019s second argument \u2014 that a crime only qualifies as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA if the statute of conviction includes a <em>mens rea </em>element \u2014 is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1268 (11th Cir.2014), where we held that the ACCA\u2019s definition of serious drug offense does not \u201crequire[] that a predicate state offense include[] an element of <em>mens rea </em>with respect to the illicit nature of the controlled substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">We DISMISS Warren\u2019s appeal to the extent that it challenges the district court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines\u2019 career of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>fender enhancement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b). To the extent Warren\u2019s appeal otherwise challenges his sentence, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">. Warren also sought briefing so he could argue that, because his convictions under Fla, Stat, \u00a7 893.13(1) did not include an element of remuneration, they should not qualify as \"controlled substance offense[s]\u201d under the guidelines\u2019 career offender enhancement, U.S.S.G, \u00a7 4B1.1(b). The district court rejected that argument and Warren appeals that determination, as well. Warren lacks standing to challenge the district court\u2019s interpretation of the career offender enhancement because the district court never applied the \u00a7 4B 1.1(b) enhancement in calculating Warren's guidelines range. Standing requires an actual or imminent injury, <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, </em>560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). A defendant is not injured by a district court\u2019s interpretation of a guidelines provision that was not actually applied in calculating the defendant\u2019s guidelines range. The PSR in this case, which the district court adopted, calculated Warren\u2019s guidelines range by applying the ACCA enhancement in lieu of the guidelines career offender enhancement. The court\u2019s construction of the career offender enhancement thus did not affect Warren's guidelines range. Accordingly, we dismiss the part of Warren\u2019s appeal challenging the district court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines' career offender enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
