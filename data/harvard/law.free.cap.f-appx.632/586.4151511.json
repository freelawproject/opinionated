The district court dismissed his complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). It construed the complaint to allege that Nationstar\u2019s only communication with Tharpe that violated the FDCPA was its filing of the foreclosure action. The court held that, construed in that manner, the complaint failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted because the FDCPA covers only debt collection activity and \u201c[a] foreclosure action does not count as debt collection activity for FDCPA purposes.\u201d Tharpe appeals that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Our decision in <em>Reese v. Ellis, Painter, Ratterree &amp; Adams, </em>678 F.3d 1211 (11th Cir.2012), makes two points that are significant for this appeal. First, <em>Reese </em>noted that none of our published precedents decide the question on which the district court in this case rested its holding: \u201cwhether enforcing a security interest is itself debt-collection activity covered by the [FDCPA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1218 n. 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, <em>Reese </em>held that \u201c[a] communication related to debt collection does not become unrelated to debt collection simply because it also relates to the enforcement of a security interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1218. That means, regardless of whether Nationstar was otherwise attempting to foreclose on the mortgage bearing Tharpe\u2019s name, if it also communicated with him in order to collect from him on the underlying debt, that communication is subject to the FDCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">The question, then, is whether Tharpe\u2019s complaint sufficiently alleges that in addition to acting to foreclose on his property Nationstar communicated with him in an attempt to collect on the note. We think that it does given that Tharpe is <em>pro se </em>and we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>complaints. <em>See Saunders v. Duke, </em>766 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2014). Liberally construed, Tharpe\u2019s complaint alleges more than that Nationstar undertook to foreclose on his property. It also alleges that \u201cNationstar and its predecessors\u201d have been attempting to collect from him on the underlying note \u201cfor the last 7 years,\u201d including at times when Nationstar was not pursuing foreclosure. The allegations in the complaint thus extend beyond the foreclosure action, necessarily implying communications about collecting on the underlying debt. That, along with the fact Tharpe has plausibly alleged Nationstar is a \u201cdebt collector\u201d of the sort covered by the FDCPA,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> makes this case analogous to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>Reese. </em>Nationstar\u2019s motion to dismiss should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">In reaching this conclusion, we leave unanswered whether foreclosing on mortgaged property is, by itself, debt collection activity within the scope of the FDCPA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> All that we decide today is that Tharpe\u2019s complaint states a claim under the FDCPA because, liberally construed, it fits within the parameters staked out in <em>Reese.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-10\">. Other federal courts of appeals have issued published decisions on this issue that reach the opposite conclusion from the one the district court reached here. <em>See, e.g., Glazer v. Chase Home Fin., LLC, </em>704 F.3d 453, 455 (6th Cir.2013) (holding \"that mortgage foreclosure is debt collection under the [FDCPA].\u201d); <em>Wilson v. Draper &amp; Goldberg, P.L.L.C., </em>443 F.3d 373, 376 (4th Cir.2006) (rejecting argument \"that foreclosure by a trustee under a deed of trust is not the enforcement of an obligation to pay money or a 'debt' \u201d for purposes of the FDCPA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-15\">. Nationstar contends that Tharpe\u2019s allegations that it is a \"debt collector\u201d are vague and conclusory. They are not. Tharpe has alleged that Nationstar\u2019s business involves the regular collection of thousands of debts from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>thousands of consumers. That allegation, if true, would support a finding that Nationstar is a \"debt collector\u201d within the scope of the FDCPA. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b614-23\">. The district court repeatedly referred to the \"general rule\u201d from <em>Warren v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>342 Fed.Appx. 458 (11th Cir.2009), and <em>Dunavant v. Sirote &amp; Permutt, PC, </em>603 Fed.Appx. 737 (11th Cir.2015), that a \"foreclosure action does not count as debt collection- activity for FDCPA purposes.\u201d <em>Warren </em>and <em>Dunavant </em>are unpublished panel decisions, so any \u201cgeneral rules\u201d derived from them are not binding. <em>See </em>11th Cir. R. 36-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
