The sentence was imposed after Dougherty pleaded guilty to armed bank robbery and to discharging a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (b) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(iii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dougherty\u2019s sentence varied 183 months above the top end of the advisory guidelines range of 166 to 177 months. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-14\">Briefly stated, Dougherty and her two brothers, by a show of force, robbed a bank in Georgia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each sibling carried a gun during the robbery (including an AK-47); upon entering the bank, Dougherty and one brother each actually fired a shot into the ceiling. Several days after the robbery, the siblings were located in Colorado, where they engaged in a high-speed car chase. During the chase, multiple shots were fired at pursuing officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-15\">We review Dougherty\u2019s final sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence may be procedurally unsound if the district court calculates incorrectly the guidelines range, treats the guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, chooses a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>Id,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-16\">After determining a sentence is procedurally sound, we evaluate the substantive reasonableness of a sentence \u2014 whether one inside or outside the guidelines range \u2014 under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In reviewing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, we examine \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>including ... whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">When a sentence is above the guidelines range, we \u201cmay consider the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). \u201cWe may vacate a sentence because of the variance only if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted). \u201c[T]hat we might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">Dougherty bears the burden of establishing that her sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the section 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Dougherty first contends that the district court applied incorrectly a two-level enhancement for reckless endangerment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2. We rejected this argument in our initial decision in this case, concluding expressly that application of the reckless-endangerment enhancement to Dougherty\u2019s sentence was proper. <em>See Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d at 1360. Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, we are bound by the findings of fact and by the conclusions of law made in an earlier appeal in the same case. <em>United States v. Stinson, </em>97 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir.1996). Because none of the doctrine\u2019s three exceptions apply in this instance, our initial decision on this issue is binding; and we are precluded from reviewing Dougherty\u2019s argument in this appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">Dougherty has failed to demonstrate that her sentence is procedurally unreasonable. The district court calculated properly the guidelines range and treated the guidelines as advisory. In determining Dougherty\u2019s sentence, the district court said expressly that it had considered the section 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (a district court\u2019s acknowledgment that it considered the section 3553(a) factors suffices to demonstrate that it did so). The district court also explained that an above-guidelines sentence was necessary \u2014 particularly in the light of the nature and circumstances of Dougherty\u2019s offenses, Dougherty\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to reflect the seriousness of the offenses, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment, to afford deterrence, and to protect the public. That the district court did not discuss individually each section 3553(a) factor does not render the sentence unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>(the district court is not required \u2019 to discuss each of the section 3553(a) factors on the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">In explaining why an upward variance was warranted in this case, the district court also noted that it had considered the death threats made to bank customers and employees, the number and kinds of guns used during the robbery, the number of shots fired during the robbery, and the substantial risk to the officers and to the public resulting from Dougherty\u2019s attempt to flee police in Colorado.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">On this record, we cannot say that the district court failed to explain sufficiently its reasons for sentencing Dougherty above the advisory guidelines range. Nor can we say that the district court relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>clearly erroneous facts. Instead, the district court relied upon unobjected-to facts contained in the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d). <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cfailure to object to allegations of fact in a PSI admits those facts for sentencing purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">Dougherty has also failed to demonstrate that her above-guidelines sentence substantively was unreasonable. Dougherty\u2019s total sentence is below the total statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006) (affirming an upward variance and observing that the ultimate sentence was appreciably below the statutory maximum). And Dougherty\u2019s sentences for each count \u2014 240 months for armed robbery and 120 months for the firearm offense \u2014 are also well below the respective statutory m\u00e1ximums for each offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) (providing a 25-year maximum sentence); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) (maximum sentence of life imprisonment).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Although Dougherty was sentenced substantially above her advisory guidelines range, we have affirmed as reasonable upward variances of a similar degree. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Overstreet, </em>713 F.3d 627, 631, 639 (11th Cir.2013) (affirming a 420-month sentence where the advisory guidelines range was 180 to 188 months); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>772 F.3d 1262, 1267 (11th Cir.2014) (affirming a 240-month sentence where the advisory guidelines range was 78 to 97 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Dougherty argues that the district court failed to weigh properly the section 3553(a) factors and failed to consider adequately the mitigating factors. But \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 832 (quotations and alterations omitted). That the district court afforded more weight to some factors, such as the serious nature of Dougherty\u2019s offenses and the need to afford adequate deterrence and to provide just punishment than it did to other mitigating factors does not make Dougherty\u2019s sentence unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">We reject Dougherty\u2019s argument that a variance was unnecessary because her offense conduct was already accounted for in her guidelines range. In imposing a variance under section 3553(a), the court can permissibly consider conduct that already has been considered in calculating the guidelines range. <em>See Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1324. We also reject Dougherty\u2019s contention that the upward variance amounts to double counting: the district court applied a variance based on the section 3553(a) factors, not a departure under the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>665 F.3d 1380, 1382 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201cImpermissible double counting occurs only when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment on account of a kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by application of another part of the Guidelines.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Dougherty contends that her sentence creates an unwarranted disparity between similarly-situated defendants. Dougherty has identified no case, however, involving a truly similarly-situated defendant: one who committed armed robbery, discharged a gun during a crime of violence, and engaged in a high-speed chase with weapon use. Moreover, Dougherty fails to take into consideration the sentences of her similarly-situated codefendants, who were sentenced to 428 and to 360 months for the same offense conduct. <em>See, e.g., Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d at 1363-64 (affirming as substantively reasonable Dougherty\u2019s codefendant\u2019s 428-month sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>On this record, we cannot say that Dougherty\u2019s above-guidelines sentence was unreasonable or that \u201cthe district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>See Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1238. Dougherty has failed to meet her burden of showing that her sentence is unreasonable, either procedurally or substantively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1020-11\">.
