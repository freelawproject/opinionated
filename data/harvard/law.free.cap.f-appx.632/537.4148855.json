Barker sued Garrison and Garrison\u2019s boss, Sheriff Frank McKeithen, alleging among other things that Garrison and McKeithen violated his rights under the federal Driver\u2019s Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2721 <em>et seq., </em>by accessing his information for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>impermissible purpose. The district court granted summary judgment to Garrison and McKeithen, concluding that Barker had not raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Garrison\u2019s use of DAVID had been for a legitimate law enforcement purpose. That conclusion is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The district court summarized the facts underlying this ease as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">[Barker] alleges that in the summer of 2012[he] found in his possessions certain items belonging to [] Garrison\u2019s wife from when [Barker] and M[r]s, Garrison dated nearly ten years earlier. After [Barker] shipped the items to Mrs. Garrison, without an explanatory note or a return address, his mother, Ms. Parcell, received a call at her unlisted home phone directing her and [Barker] to stop contacting Mrs. Garrison. The call was purportedly made by a local law enforcement officer, but [Barker] and his mother believe that the caller was [ ] Garrison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">Subsequent to receiving the phone call, in August 2013, [Barker] made a public records request and determined that [] Garrison had used [DAVID] to conduct inquiries regarding [Barker\u2019s] information six times on January 5, 2011, and January 6,2011. According to [Barker], [ ] Garrison had no legitimate law enforcement or official purpose for accessing [Barker\u2019s] or his mother\u2019s DAVID information in January 2011. As support, [Barker] claims that neither of them lived in the jurisdiction [where] Garrison worked as a law enforcement officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">On the contrary, [] Garrison alleges that on January 5, 2011, his wife, Rhonda, contacted him while on duty to advise him that she thought she had seen a person that looked like her former boyfriend, [ ]\u2022 Barker. Then, when she returned home, Mrs, Garrison saw a vehicle that resembled the last vehicle she knew [Barker] to drive parked across the yard from their home. According to [] Garrison, his wife was terrified of [Barker]. Therefore, she asked him to contact the deputy, who was on duty in the zone in which they resided, to make a check of the neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">[] Garrison believed [] Barker was stalking or otherwise engaging in threatening behavior toward Mrs. Garrison, so [he] conducted an inquiry of the DAVID system on January 5, 2011 to ascertain [Barker\u2019s] physical description and the type of vehicle he drove. According to [ ]\u2022 Garrison, he communicated the information obtained to the deputy on duty in the zone where the Garrisons lived and asked that he check the area. He repeated the DAVID inquiry the following morning, January 6, 2011, to confirm the information so it could be provided to the zone deputy for the following shift to check the area as well. Although the checks were completed, the presence of [Barker] was never confirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-11\"><em>Barker v. Bay Cnty. Sheriff\u2019s Office; </em>No. 5:14-cv-102-RS-GRJ, 2015 WL 300431, *1-2 (N.D.Fla. Jan. 22, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">Barker alleged that Garrison violated the DPPA by accessing his personal information for an impermissible purpose, and that McKeithen, in his official capacity as Garrison\u2019s boss, was vicariously liable for Garrison\u2019s DPPA violations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Garrison and McKeithen moved for summary judgment. In support of the motions, Garrison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>submitted a sworn affidavit attesting that he had accessed Barker\u2019s information on DAVID for a legitimate law enforcement purpose. Barker opposed the motions, attaching to his response a copy of Garrison\u2019s affidavit, records documenting Garrison\u2019s use of DAVID to access Barker\u2019s information, and an unverified version of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The district court granted summary judgment to Garrison and McKeithen. It correctly noted that the DPPA allows the disclosure of DAVID information \u201c[f]or use by any government agency, including any court or law enforcement agency, in carrying out its functions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at *3 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2721(b)(1)), and that the DPPA puts the burden on the plaintiff to show that the defendant obtained his personal information \u201cfor a purpose not permitted under the act,\u201d <em>id. </em>at *8 (quoting <em>Thomas v. George, Hartz, Lundeen, Fulmer, Johnstone, King and Stevens, P.A., </em>525 F.3d 1107, 1112 (11th Cir.2008)). None of Barker\u2019s supporting evidence, the court explained, carried that burden or rebutted Garrison\u2019s sworn statement about his permissible reasons for using DAVID.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Barker maintains that Garrison\u2019s sworn account of events is not believable, but he hasn\u2019t identified evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to reach that conclusion. His whole argument is that Garrison lied about his reasons for accessing Barker\u2019s DAVID profile, and that Garrison\u2019s dishonesty is evidence that his real reason for accessing Barker\u2019s profile was improper. According to Barker, a jury could reasonably infer that Garrison lied in his affidavit because a normal person in Garrison\u2019s shoes would not respond to a frantic call from his spouse by pulling up information on DAVID and relaying it to the police. To adopt that particular argument, a reasonable jury would need at least some evidence suggesting that Garrison\u2019s response to his wife\u2019s call was, in fact, atypical. Barker hasn\u2019t provided any such evidence. He\u2019s offered only sweeping assertions and unsubstantiated conjecture that \u201cmost reasonable people would likely\u201d not do what Garrison says he did upon receiving the call from his wife. Conjecture and conclusory statements won\u2019t defeat a properly supported summary judgment motion unless they\u2019re supported by specific facts. <em>See Paylor v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>748 F.3d 1117, 1122 (11th Cir.2014); <em>Rodriguez v. Farrell, </em>280 F.3d 1341, 1352 n. 20 (11th Cir.2002). Because Barker hasn\u2019t identified any specific facts supported by admissible evidence showing that Garrison lied in his affidavit, he hasn\u2019t met his burden at summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\">. Barker\u2019s complaint contained two other counts not relevant to this appeal. Count II alleged that, by accessing Barker's information on DAVID, Garrison had violated Barker\u2019s privacy rights as protected by the DPPA and the Fourth Amendment. Count III alleged that McKeithen, in his official capacity, was vicariously liable for Garrison\u2019s alleged violations of Barker\u2019s privacy rights. Barker does not argue that the district court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>granting summary judgment to Garrison and McKeithen on either count, and \"a legal claim or argument that has not been briefed before th[is] court is deemed abandoned and its merits will not be addressed.\u201d <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
