HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b248-22\">Cynthia Garza\u2019s mother died intestate, leaving a house in Irving, Texas. Garza <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>and her family moved into the house and attempted to make the monthly payments to Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo refused the payments and would not speak with Garza regarding the mortgage account: the Note and Deed of Trust were executed solely by Garza\u2019s mother. Wells Fargo foreclosed and purchased the property at the foreclosure sale approximately eight months after Garza\u2019s mother\u2019s passing. Two months later, the probate court awarded Garza 50% interest in her mother\u2019s house (Garza\u2019s brother disclaimed his 50% interest in the house). Wells Fargo filed an eviction lawsuit and Garza sued. The district court granted Wells Fargo\u2019s motion to dismiss. Garza appeals the conclusion that Section 51.002(d) of the Texas Property Code does not give rise to a private cause of action. Having reviewed the briefs and the record, we affirm on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">We take the allegations in the Appellant\u2019s complaint as true. <em>See Lone Star Fund V (U.S.), L.P. v. Barclays Bank PLC, </em>594 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.2010). We also consider the documents that the Appellant attached to her complaint and the documents that the Appellee attached to its responsive pleadings that were both central to and mentioned by the complaint. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">In the summer of 2000, Mary Angelita Trevino purchased a house in Irving, Texas, executing a Note and Deed of Trust to secure financing for the property, Trevino refinanced in 2009, executing a new Note and Deed of Trust. Trevino died intestate in 2013. Shortly thereafter, Trevino\u2019s daughter and the Appellant in this case\u2014 Cynthia Garza \u2014 and her family moved into her mother\u2019s house. Garza attempted to make the monthly payments on the house, but Wells Fargo refused to accept the payments or speak with Garza regarding the mortgage account. Trevino was the only person to execute the Note and Deed of Trust \u2014 she was the sole \u201cborrower.\u201d In August 2013, Garza filed an Application to Determine Heirship in probate court. In October 2013, Wells Fargo foreclosed on Trevino\u2019s house \u2014 in which Garza and her family were living \u2014 and purchased it at the foreclosure sale. In December 2013, the probate court awarded Garza a 50% share in Trevino\u2019s real property, including Trevino\u2019s house; the court awarded her brother the other 50%, but he disclaimed his interest in the real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">In January 2014, Wells Fargo commenced eviction proceedings against Garza. Garza sued, alleging violations of the Texas Property Code and wrongful foreclosure, and seeking (1) specific performance, (2) a declaratory judgment, and (3) to quiet title in the property. Wells Fargo moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), Garza amended her complaint, alleging the same violations and requesting the same remedies, and Wells Fargo again moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). The district court granted Wells Fargo\u2019s second motion to dismiss. Garza appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">Garza only challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of her Texas Property Code claim. Because Garza does not challenge the dismissal of her wrongful foreclosure claim or the remedies she requested in her amended complaint, to the extent they are considered claims, she has waived them. <em>See Sama v. Hannigan, </em>669 F.3d 585, 589 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>&amp; </em>n. 5 (5th Cir.2012). We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), <em>see Lone Star Fund V (U.S.), </em>594 F.3d at 387, and we \"may affirm the [] judgment on any grounds supported by the record.\u201d . <em>Palmer ex rel. Palmer v. Waxahachie Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>579 F.3d 502, 506 (5th Cir.2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Garza asserts that Wells Fargo violated Section 51.002(d) of the Texas Property Code because it \u201cfailed to send proper notices to [Garza] regarding the mortgage loan and foreclosure.\u201d She appeals the district court\u2019s holding that Texas law \u201cdoes not recognize an independent cause of action for a violation of [Section 51.002].\u201d Neither the Texas Supreme Court nor this court has decided this issue, though \u201cthe federal district courts that have addressed it seem to conclude that Section 51.002(d) does not intend an independent private cause of action.\u201d <em>Rucker v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>806 F.3d 828, 830 n. 2 (5th Cir.2015) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">We need not reach this issue, however, because even if Section 51.002(d) authorizes an independent cause of action, Garza still fails to state a claim. The statute requires that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">the mortgage servicer of the debt shall serve a <em>debtor </em>in default under a deed of trust or other contract lien on real property used as the <em>debtor\u2019s </em>residence with written notice by certified mail stating that the <em>debtor </em>is in default under the deed of trust or other contract lien and giving the <em>debtor </em>at least 20 days to cure the default before notice of sale can be given under Subsection (b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Tex. Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 51.002(d) (2007) (emphasis added). The statute refers to a debtor as someone \u201cwho, according to the records of the mortgage servicer of the debt, is obligated to pay the debt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 51.002(b)(3). The record is clear that Trevino \u2014 Garza\u2019s mother \u2014 was the only person to execute the Note and Deed of Trust; thus, Trevino was the only person obligated to pay the debt. Trevino was the only debtor. And as Garza was not a debtor, the district court was correct in holding that she \u201cwas not entitled to notice under Texas Property Code section 51.002.\u201d <em>See Robinson v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>576 Fed.Appx. 358, 361 (5th Cir.2014) (unpublished) (holding that a mortgage servicer of the debt must only provide notice under Section 51.002(d) to \u201ca <em>debtor </em>in default\u201d (citing \u00a7 51.002(d))); <em>Rodriguez v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, </em>306 Fed.Appx. 854, 856 (5th Cir.2009) (unpublished) (\u201c[U]nder Texas law, \u2018[t]here is no legal requirement that personal notice of a' foreclosure be sent to persons not parties to the deed of trust.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). Therefore, Garza\u2019s allegation that \u201c[Wells Fargo] failed to send proper notices to [Garza] regarding the mortgage loan and foreclosure\u201d fails to state a claim: Wells Fargo was not required to provide Garza notice of foreclosure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Garza has not alleged that Wells Fargo violated Section 51.002 of the Texas Property Code, her claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b248-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-8\">. In her reply brief, Garza seems to argue for the first time that Wells Fargo did not <em>send </em>notice required by \u00a7 51.002(d) <em>at all, </em>to anyone. However, her complaint only alleges that Wells Fargo \"failed to send proper notices to [Garza] regarding the mortgage loan and foreclosure.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
