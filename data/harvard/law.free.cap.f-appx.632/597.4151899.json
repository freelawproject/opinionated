He contends that he is entitled to a sentence reduction because Amendment 782 to the sentencing guidelines lowered his advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">In 2011 Souffrant pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute oxycodone, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C). The presentence investigation report calculated his base offense level at 32 based on the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(5), (c)(4) (2011), and after the application of several adjustments, it assigned him a total offense level of 27. With his criminal history category of III, Souffrant\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 87 to 108 months. Varying downward, the district court sentenced him to 84 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In January 2015 Souffrant filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence, contending that Amendment 782, which retroactively amended \u00a7 2D1.1, lowered his offense level and advisory guidelines range. The district court agreed that Amendment 782 lowered Souffrant\u2019s base offense level to 30, but it found that his guidelines range remained the same. That\u2019s because the lower base offense level prevented the court from applying a two-level downward adjustment for minimal participation under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5), which had. been applied at Souffrant\u2019s original sentencing, because that adjustment applies only when a defendant\u2019s base offense level is 32 or higher. The removal of the \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5) adjustment essentially canceled out the lower base offense level provided by Amendment 782, leaving Souf-frant with the same advisory guidelines range of 87 to 108 months. The district court concluded that it lacked the authority to reduce his sentence and denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">On appeal Souffrant, by counsel, contends that the district court erred when it concluded that he was no longer entitled to a downward adjustment under \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5). He argues that the district court should have lowered his base offense level to 30 under Amendment 782, and still applied all of the other guidelines calculations from his original sentencing, including the downward adjustment under \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5), which would result in a lower amended guidelines range of 70 to 87 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about its authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012). We agree with the district court that Souffrant\u2019s guidelines range was not changed by Amendment 782, because he is no longer entitled to the two-level downward adjustment in \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(5). To determine whether Souffrant should receive a reduction in sentence, we must\" \u201cdetermine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to [him] if [Amendment 782] had been in effect at the time [he] was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). If he had been sentenced after Amendment 782 went into effect, Souffrant would not have received a downward adjustment under \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(5), because his base offense level would have been 30, not 32. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 782; <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(c)(5) (2014). Because Souffrant\u2019s guidelines range would not have been lower had he been sentenced after Amendment 782 went into effect, he is not eligible for a sentence reduction based on that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>amendment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B), cmt. n.l(A); Glover; 686 F.3d at 1206 (explaining that the goal of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is to give a defendant the \u201copportunity to receive the same sentence he would have received if the guidelines that applied at the time of his sentencing had been the same as the guidelines that applied after the amendment\u201d to the guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
