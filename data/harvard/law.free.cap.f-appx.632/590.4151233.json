After pleading guilty to conspiracy to possess aboard a vessel with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, the sentencing court adopted the Presentence Investigation Report\u2019s (\u201cPSI\u201d) facts, which found that Lopez-Ortega was responsible for 6,700 kilograms of cocaine. The district court then applied a base offense level of 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1). Lopez-Ortega now argues that: (1) the district court erred in calculating drug quantity and in finding that he was ineligible for a sentence modification; and (2) the district court applied the guidelines as binding, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions as to the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008). Once pronounced, a district court\u2019s authority to modify a sentence of imprisonment is narrowly limited by statute. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2010). Nevertheless, a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where the defendant was sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reductions, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statement, found in \u00a7 1B1.10, provides that where an amendment does not have the effect of lowering a defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief is unauthorized. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also Jones, 548 </em>F.3d at 1368-69 (holding that the district court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because he was sentenced based on a large quantity of drugs that left his base offense level unchanged after the amendment). A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>re-sentencing and \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>tencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis omitted) (holding that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the defendant\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim because it was an extraneous resentencing issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We have rejected the argument that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-94 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 829-30, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (rejecting the application of <em>Booker </em>to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings). We held that district courts continue to be bound by the limitations on their discretion imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines amended \u00a7 2D1.1 by revising the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2D1.1(c), U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 782. From 1998 to 2014, the amount of cocaine necessary to qualify for a base offense level of 38 increased from 150 kilograms or more to 450 kilograms or more. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3), (c)(1) (1998), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(5), (c)(1) (2014); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 782. Amendment 782 became effective on November 1, 2014, and was made retroactive by Amendment 788 as of the same date. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 782 <em>&amp; </em>788.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Here, the district court did not err in determining that Lopez-Ortega was ineligible for a sentence reduction because Amendment 782 did not lower his applicable guideline range. <em>See Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1368-69. The sentencing court adopted the PSI\u2019s finding that he was responsible for 6,700 kilograms of cocaine, which is well above the new drug quantity requirement for base offense level 38. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1). Therefore, because Amendment 782 did not lower his applicable guideline range, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief was not authorized. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Furthermore, his challenge regarding <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>has been foreclosed by precedent holding that neither <em>Booker </em>nor <em>Kimbrough </em>apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. <em>See Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 829-30, 130 S.Ct. 2683; <em>see also Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1192-94. Finally, his assertion that the sentencing court violated the holding of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) when it utilized a drug quantity that was not submitted to the jury is a challenge to the underlying findings of the sentencing court. Because a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider his <em>Apprendi </em>challenge in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
