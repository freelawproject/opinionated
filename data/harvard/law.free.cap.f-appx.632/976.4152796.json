On appeal, Spriggs argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to provide sufficient justification for his upward variance, rendering his total 36-month sentence procedurally and substantively unreasonable. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we typically perform two steps. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. First, we \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court is not required to explicitly state that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as long as the court\u2019s comments demonstrate that it considered the factors when imposing sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Indeed, we have held that \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we consider the \u201c\u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). \u201c[W]e will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [court] accorded to a given [\u00a7 3553(a)] factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation, alteration and emphasis omitted). We will not reweigh the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and will not remand for resentencing unless the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by imposing a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences. <em>United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). A sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum penalty is an indicator of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number><em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at the same time, the terms may run concurrently or consecutively. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). \u201cMultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at the same time run concurrently unless the court orders or the statute mandates that the terms are to run consecutively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When determining whether to impose concurrent or consecutive sentences, the court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Spriggs has not shown that his total sentence of 36 months is procedurally unreasonable. While the Guidelines range for Counts 1 and 2 was six-to-twelve months each, the district court imposed an upward variance, sentencing him to eighteen months for each count and running the sentences consecutively. However, the record reveals that the court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for exercising its own legal decision-making authority and imposing a total 36-month sentence instead of either a Guideline sentence or a higher sentence. Specifically, the court emphasized that the government was concerned that Spriggs was a danger to the community, he may have been involved in drug trafficking, and he had a history of consistently breaking the law. On the other hand, the court also noted that the amount of cash on Spriggs was not significant, the firearm could not be considered, and it was unclear whether he fled. The court was not required to say that it considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, nor how each one contributed to its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Spriggs has also failed to show that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. As the record reveals, the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing consecutive sentences and considered the Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. As for the total sentence\u2019s purpose to protect the public from his future criminal conduct, the court noted that the government was concerned that he was dangerous. As for the offense\u2019s nature and circumstances, the court said that it was not taking into account the cash, firearm, or whether he fled. As for Spriggs\u2019s history and characteristics, the court commented that he was likely involved in drug trafficking and consistently broke the law. The court also explained why it did not give him a higher total sentence and how he would have faced over 20 years\u2019 imprisonment if he did not have a plea agreement. To the extent Spriggs argues that the district court failed to give due weight to his factors asserted in support of a lower sentence, that decision is within the court\u2019s discretion. Moreover, the court\u2019s total 36-month sentence was well below the 3-year statutory maximum penalty for each count, an indicator of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the lands of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
