Brown, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Fort Laud-erdale, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-13\">Ramon Blanco, Coleman, FL, pro se;</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b576-15\">Before JORDAN, JILL PRYOR, and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b576-16\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b576-17\">Ramon Blanco appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to vacate the court\u2019s prior order denying his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-18\">In 2008, a jury found Blanco guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), 846; attempt to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), 846; conspiracy to obstruct commerce by means of robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a); attempt to obstruct commerce by means of robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 1951(a); conspiracy to use and carry a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime, and to possess a firearm in furtherance of such crimes, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(o); and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime, and possessing a firearm in furtherance of such crimes, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The district court sentenced Blanco to a total of 295 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-19\">On November 10, 2014, Blanco moved to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which- lowered the base offense levels for most drug offenses. The district court denied the motion on November 13, 2014, stating that, while the amendment had lowered Blanco\u2019s advisory guideline range, a sentence reduction was not warranted under the 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. On January 14, 2015, Blanco filed a motion \u201crequesting redress\u201d of the order denying, his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The district court denied Blanco\u2019s motion, which it construed as a. motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">On April 1, 2015, Blanco filed the <em>pro se </em>motion giving rise to the current appeal. Blanco styled the motion as a \u201cMotion Seeking the Court to Vacate a Void Judgment in the Criminal Proceeding Brought Under 18 USC \u00a7 3582(c)(2) Based on a Exacerbation of the Criminal History and a Fallacy by the Government to Deny Relief,\u201d in which he \u201cmove[d] the court to vacate the judgment entered on November 13, 2014\u201d denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The district court liberally construed the motion as either a Motion for Reconsideration under Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 35(a) or a Motion to Vacate under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 60(b). The court then denied the motion, stating that a motion for reconsideration was untimely and not properly before the court, and that Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was inapplicable to this criminal proceeding. This appeal followed. On appeal, Blanco argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The analysis in this case turns on whether Blanco\u2019s April 1 motion is construed as a Motion for Reconsideration under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or a Motion to Vacate under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. But the result is the same either way. Neither of these procedural devices offers relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">\u201cThe authority of a district court to modify an imprisonment sentence is narrowly limited by statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, 597 </em>F.3d 1190, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2010). A district court may only modify a term of imprisonment when one of three conditions are met: (1) the Director of the Bureau of Prisons has filed a motion to reduce sentence and other conditions are met; (2) another statute or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 expressly permits a sentence modification; or (3) the defendant has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), This case concerns only the second of those conditions. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a) provides that, within 14 days after sentencing, a district court \u201cmay correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a). In <em>Phillips, </em>we held that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding wherein a sentence is modified is a \u201csentencing\u201d for the purposes of Rule 35(a). 597 F.3d at 1197-98. In <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>772 F.3d 662 (11th Cir.2014), we held that the reasoning in <em>Phillips </em>\u201calso extends to cases in which a district court denies . a defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on the merits after considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>667. In such a case, \u201cthe district court\u2019s authority to consider a defendant\u2019s successive motion is likewise limited in this circumstance to Rule 35\u2019s fourteen-day time limitation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) provides that \u201cthe court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\u201d for a number of reasons. That Rule,-however, does not provide for relief from a judgment in a criminal case. <em>United States v. Mosavi, </em>138 F.3d 1365, 1366 (11th Cir.1998). Thus, we have held that Rule 60(b)(4), providing for relief from a judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>ment <em>on </em>the ground that the judgment is void, is not available to a defendant challenging his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), because a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is a continuation of a criminal case and not a civil post-conviction action. <em>United States v. Fair, </em>326 F.3d 1317, 1318 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Here, the district court properly concluded that it lacked authority to consider Blanco\u2019s April 1 motion to vacate its prior order denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. To the extent Blanco sought to vacate or void the order denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), Rule 60(b) does not provide for relief from denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Fair, </em>326 F.3d at 1318; <em>Mosavi, </em>138 F.3d at 1366. To the extent Blanco\u2019s April 1 motion should be considered a motion to reconsider, his motion was subject to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a)\u2019s 14-day time limitation, due to the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on the merits, and was untimely. <em>See Anderson, </em>772 F.3d at 666-67; Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
