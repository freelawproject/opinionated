Bueno-Sierra appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 782 to' the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court concluded that Bueno-Sierra was. ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because Bueno-Sierra\u2019s \u201cbase offense level remains at 38\u201d after Amendment 782 due to the large quantity of cocaine involved in his offenses. The district court also denied Bueno-Sierra\u2019s subsequent motion asking the court to vacate its order denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and to hold a hearing to determine the amount of cocaine for which he was responsible. Bueno-Sierra appeals that decision as well. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-23\">A district court may reduce a term of imprisonment only if it was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Amendment 782, which is retroactive, reduced by 2 levels the base offense levels for most drug offenses. U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 782 (2014). For offenses involving 450 kilograms or more of cocaine, however, Amendment 782 had no effect on the base offense level, which remains level 38, the highest offense level under the Drug Quantity Table. <em>See id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-25\">At the original sentencing hearing, it was undisputed that Bueno-Sierra\u2019s offenses involved approximately 467 kilo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>grams of cocaine found in a first shipment from Colombia to Florida, which resulted in a base offense level of 38, <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c)(8) (1994) (providing for a base offense level of 38 if the offense involved between 150 kilograms and 500 kilograms of cocaine). While Bueno-Sierra objected to the mention of an additional 138 kilograms of cocaine found in a second shipment, he did not object to the 467 kilograms in the first shipm\u00e9nt that was actually attributed to him in paragraphs 19 and 30 of his Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d). Therefore, for sentencing purposes, Bueno-Sierra admitted that his offenses involved 467 kilograms of cocaine. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303-04 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that the defendant is deemed to have admitted facts in the PSI to which he did not specifically object). Bueno-Sierra did not appeal the drug quantity finding or the calculation of his base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1). <em>See United States v. Bueno-Sierra, </em>99 F.3d 375 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">After Amendment 782, the 467 kilograms of cocaine attributed to Bueno-Sier-ra still results in a base offense level of 38 and a guidelines range of 360 months to life. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c)(1) (2014). Thus, the district court was without authority to reduce Bueno-Sierra\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1,10(a)(2)(B) (\u201cA reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if ,. an amendment listed [as retroactive] does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Furthermore, the district court was not required to hold a hearing to resolve Bue-no-Sierra\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The drug quantity attributed to Bueno-Sierra was undisputed. Furthermore, as the district court explained, although it did not state the drug quantity during the sentencing hearing, the PSI stated the drug quantity, and the district court adopted that finding. The district court was required to maintain its original sentencing determinations, including the drug quantity finding, in determining whether Bueno-Sierra was eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (stating that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, and <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-20\">. This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court's legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and for clear error its factual findings underlying those legal conclusions. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
