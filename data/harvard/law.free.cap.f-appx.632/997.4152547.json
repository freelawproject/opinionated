The BIA concluded that Petitioner failed to demonstrate that his removal would cause his two United States citizen children to suffer \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship,\u201d as required to qualify for relief under section 1229b(b). On appeal, Petitioner challenges the constitutionality of the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d standard.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision in this case because the BIA did not adopt expressly the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2008). We review constitutional challenges <em>de novo. Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1143 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-13\">Petitioner first contends that the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d standard violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Briefly stated, Petitioner argues that no rational basis exists for requiring aliens applying for cancellation of removal to show a higher level of hardship than that required of similarly-situated aliens seeking other forms of immigration relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">\u201cGiven that Congress has plenary power to pass legislation concerning the admission and exclusion of aliens, federal classifications that distinguish among groups of aliens are subject only to rational basis review.\u201d <em>Resendiz-Alcaraz v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 1262, 1271 (11th Cir.2004) (citations omitted). \u201cUnder rational-basis scrutiny, a statute is accorded a strong presumption of validity and will be upheld if any reasonably conceivable state of facts could demonstrate that the statute is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.\u201d <em>Tefel v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 1286, 1299 (11th Cir.1999) (quotations omitted). The alien bears the burden of showing that the classification is not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. <em>Resen-diz-Alcaraz, </em>383 F.3d at 1271-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>Petitioner has failed to satisfy his burden of proof. Congress has articulated a rational basis for adopting the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d standard for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>H.R. Conf. Rep. 104-828, at 213-14 (1996) (Conf. Rep.). Congress explained that cancellation of removal should be limited to \u201ctruly exceptional cases,\u201d consistent with the country\u2019s fundamental immigration laws and policies. <em>Id. </em>In the interest of conforming with the country\u2019s immigration policies \u2014 and in response to the \u201cweakening\u201d of the former \u201cextreme hardship\u201d standard \u2014 Congress adopted the heightened \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d standard \u201cto emphasize that the alien must provide evidence of harm to his spouse, parent, or child substantially beyond that which ordinarily would be expected to result from the alien\u2019s deportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given Congress\u2019s stated legitimate government purpose, the heightened hardship standard survives rational-basis scrutiny.-</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">We also reject Petitioner\u2019s contention that his being treated less favorably than excludable aliens constitutes an equal protection violation. We have concluded that deportable aliens \u2014 like Petitioner\u2014 may permissibly be categorized differently from excludable aliens. <em>See Chuang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>382 F.3d 1299, 1303-04 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that the disparity in treatment between deportable and excludable aliens incentivizes deportable aliens to leave the .country voluntarily\u2014 with the possibility of later entering the country legally \u2014 without being ordered to leave at government expense).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">We also reject Petitioner\u2019s argument that the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d standard is unconstitutionally vague. A civil statute is void for unconstitutional vagueness when the statute is so unclear \u201cthat persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\u201d <em>Wilson v. State Bar of Ga., </em>132 F.3d 1422, 1429 (11th Cir.1998) (quotations omitted). In assessing a statute\u2019s vagueness, we consider the statutory language in the light of limiting interpretations applied by the agency charged with the statute\u2019s enforcement. <em>See Vill. of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 1191 n. 5, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">As an initial matter, Petitioner himself has clearly failed to satisfy the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d standard. To demonstrate hardship, Petitioner argues only that, if he were returned to El Salvador and his children remained in the United States, his children would lose their only means of financial support. Alternatively, if Petitioner\u2019s children accompanied Petitioner back to El Salvador, Petitioner contends that his children would have fewer economic, medical, and educational opportunities. But as the BIA explained, the hardships described by Petitioner are not unusual when a family member is removed. As a result, the hardships identified by Petitioner are clearly insufficient to satisfy the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d standard. <em>See, e.g., In re Andazola-Rivas, </em>231. &amp; N. Dec. 319, 324 (BIA 2002) (hardships that are \u201cnot substantially different from those that would normally be expected upon removal to a less developed country\u201d are insufficient to satisfy the heightened hardship standard); <em>In re Monreal, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 56, 62 (BIA 2001) (interpreting the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d standard to require a showing of hardship \u201cbeyond the ordinary hardship that would be expected when a close family member leaves this country\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">Because the \u201cexceptional;and extremely unusual hardship\u201d standard bars unambig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>uously Petitioner relief, the standard is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to Petitioner. Moreover, because Petitioner himself has failed to satisfy the heightened hardship standard, he is precluded from challenging the statute\u2019s vagueness as applied to others. <em>See Vill. of Hoffman Estates, </em>102 S.Ct. at 1191 (\u201cA plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1024-10\"> Petitioner concedes that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA's discretionary determination about whether Petitioner in fact demonstrated \"exceptional and extremely unusual hardship,\u201d This Court does, however, retain jurisdiction to review Petitioner\u2019s constitutional arguments. <em>See Jimenez-Galicia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>690 F.3d 1207, 1209 (11th Cir.2012) (\"We can review no discretionaiy determinations about cancellation of removal, except those discretionaiy determinations about which Petitioner presents a genuine constitutional claim or question of law.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
