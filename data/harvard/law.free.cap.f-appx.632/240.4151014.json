Lopez argues that the district court abused its discretion by improperly weighing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-21\">In determining whether to reduce a sentence, the district court first determines whether the defendant is eligible for a sentence modification. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). If the court determines that a defendant is eligible for a sentence modification, it must then consider the applicable \u00a7 3553(a), factors to decide whether a reduction \u201cis warranted in whole or in part under the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683. Our review of the district court\u2019s refusal to lower Lopez\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-22\">Here, the district court implicitly found Lopez eligible for the reduction but declined to exercise its discretion to reduce his sentence. <em>See Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683; <em>United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011). The record reflects that the district court considered Lopez\u2019s arguments in favor of a sentence reduction and conducted a contemporaneous review of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which was all that it was required to do. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009). Despite Lopez\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the district court has no obligation to grant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, <em>see United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1323 (5th Cir.2010), and no abuse of discretion has been shown. The district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
