The IJ determined that Bonilla\u2019s conviction was an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i). We lack \u201cjurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed\u201d an aggravated felony, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), but we retain jurisdiction to decide the jurisdictional question of whether the charged crime is an aggravated felony. <em>James v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 505, 507 (5th Cir.2006). We may review \u201cjurisdictional facts,\u201d and we review de novo the legal issue of whether an offense constitutes an aggravated felony. <em>Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>705 F.3d 207, 210 (5th Cir.2013). We accord substantial deference to the BIA\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>pretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act and its definitions of phrases within it. <em>Omari v. Gonzales, </em>419 F.3d 303, 306 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u201cAny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d includes \u201can offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\u201d \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i); <em>see also Nijhawan v. Holder, </em>557 U.S. 29, 38, 129 S.Ct. 2294, 174 L.Ed.2d 22 (2009). Bonilla does not dispute that his \u00a7 286 conviction involved fraud or deceit. The issue presented is whether the BIA erred in determining that the offense involved a loss to the victim that was greater than $10,000. The amount of loss under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) \u201cis a factual matter to be determined from the record of conviction,\u201d <em>Arguelles-Olivares v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 171, 177 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Under \u00a7 286, it is a crime to \u201center[] into an agreement, combination, or conspiracy to defraud the United States ... by obtaining or aiding to obtain the payment or allowance of any false, fictitious or fraudulent claim.\u201d We must decide \u201cwhether there was clear and convincing evidence that [Bonilla\u2019s] prior conviction involved an amount of loss greater than $10,000 and whether the evidence establishing that the conviction involved such a loss was reasonable, substantial, and probative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Bonilla asserts that the losses were limited by his plea agreement to those associated with a single fraudulent tax return, which did not result in an actual loss to the Government. In support of this position, he notes that he was not ordered to make restitution. These contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The criminal judgment recites that Bon-illa was convicted of \u201cConspiracy to Defraud the U.S. With Respect to Claims in violation of ... \u00a7 286 <em>as charged in Count 1 of the </em>Indictment.\u201d The indictment alleged that Bonilla was a participant in a fraudulent scheme that resulted in the erroneous issuance of millions of dollars in tax refunds.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">The loss caused by Bonilla\u2019s crime is the total loss from the entire fraudulent scheme. <em>See James, </em>464 F.3d at 511. The rule in <em>James </em>is consistent with the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) in this case, to which we defer. <em>See Omari, </em>419 F.3d at 306. No inference may be drawn from the failure of the district court in the criminal case to exercise its discretion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(A) to require Bonilla to make restitution. The administrative record is silent as to that question. Although a restitution order may constitute evidence of the amount of a victim\u2019s loss, the absence of a restitution order does not compel the conclusion that no loss was sustained. <em>See Nijhawan, </em>557 U.S. at 42-43, 129 S.Ct. 2294 (treating restitution order as evidence of loss amount).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Because Bonilla\u2019s \u00a7 286 conviction was properly regarded by the BIA as an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), we lack jurisdiction, and the petition for review is DISMISSED. <em>See James, </em>464 F.3d at 512.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
