Cardenas-Guerrero asserts the BIA and IJ\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen his removal proceedings violated his due process rights because the IJ in the underlying deportation proceedings conducted the merits heating without his counsel present and failed to advise him of his right to counsel. Cardenas-Guerrero further contends the BIA abused its discretion by not exercising its ability to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen the deportation proceedings based on the deprivation of his due process rights during the deportation hearing. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we dismiss and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-16\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b604-17\"><em>A. Equitable </em>Tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-18\">A \u201cmotion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal,\u201d subject to certain exceptions. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(i). The time bar for motions to reopen is not jurisdictional, and thus equitable tolling may be available. <em>See Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>713 F.3d 1357, 1362-65 (11th Cir.2013) (en banc). Because Cardenas-Guerrero did not file his motion to reopen for more than 24 years his motion was untimely and he needed to satisfy the equitable tolling requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>The BIA did not abuse its discretion by affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Cardenas-Guerrero\u2019s motion to reopen. The BIA did not exercise its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner because it reasonably concluded from the evidence that Cardenas-Guerrero did' not exercise due diligence in pursuing his rights. <em>See Avila-Santoyo, </em>713 F.3d at 1363 n. 5 (stating to establish eligibility for equitable tolling, a litigant must show that (1) he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way). According to Cardenas-Guerrero\u2019s declaration, he sought documentation from his former attorney in late 1988 that could confirm his case had been resolved favorably, but received none. There is no evidence that Cardenas-Guerrero did anything after that point to follow up or to try to obtain the status of his case from immigration authorities. Consequently, the BIA was within its discretion to conclude that Cardenas-Guerrero failed to show the requisite diligence. Because Cardenas-Guerrero did not make the threshold showing that he was entitled to equitable tolling, we need not consider the merits of his motion to reopen pursuant to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>See Ruiz-Turcios v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>717 F.3d 847, 851 (11th Cir.2013) (explaining the eligibility for equitable tolling is a threshold showing that must be made before the merits of the claim underlying a motion to reopen can be considered).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">\n<em>B. Sua Sponte Reopening</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen based on the BIA\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>authority because the regulation permitting <em>sua sponte </em>reopening provides no meaningful standard against which to judge the BIA\u2019s exercise of its discretion. <em>See Lenis v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1292-94 (11th Cir.2008). As we explained in <em>Lewis, </em>no statute expressly authorizes <em>sua sponte </em>reopening, and instead the regulatory authorization to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen derives from a statute granting general authority over immigration matters to the Attorney General, a statute that \u201csets no standard for the Attorney General\u2019s decision-making in this context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1293; <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(g)(2). While we indicated in a footnote we \u201cmay have jurisdiction over constitutional claims related to the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>power,\u201d we recognized we had not yet decided the question and had no occasion to do so because the petitioner in <em>Lenis </em>did not raise any constitutional claims. <em>See Lenis, </em>525 F.3d at 1294 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">We lack jurisdiction to consider whether the BIA erred in refusing to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen Cardenas-Guerrero\u2019s proceedings. As in <em>Lenis, </em>Cardenas-Guerrero\u2019s claim is not a constitutional claim \u201crelated to the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>power.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Rather, Cardenas-Guerrero\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, although nominally addressed to the BIA\u2019s decision as well as to the first IJ\u2019s actions in the deportation proceedings, in substance relates only to whether the circumstances that occurred in the deportation proceedings and thereafter were sufficiently exceptional to warrant a <em>sua sponte </em>reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">Accordingly, we dismiss Cardenas-Guerrero\u2019s petition in part and deny in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-13\">. We review the denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Zhang v. U.S, Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009), Our review \u201cis limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion' in an arbitrary or capricious manner. The moving party bears a heavy burden, as motions to reopen are disfavored, especially in removal proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). We review <em>de novo </em>whether we have subject matter jurisdiction to consider a petition for review. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
