He admits that his original sentence falls below even the amended guideline range, which would ordinarily prevent its downward modification. But Jackson contends that he has sufficiently cooperated with the government to benefit from the substantial-assistance exception, and the district court erred by dismissing his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without holding an evidentiary hearing on that issue or requiring the government to respond. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194 n. 9 (11th Cir.2010). The decision whether to grant an evidentiary hearing is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>643 F.3d 807, 874 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Once imposed, a sentence can be modified only in narrow circumstances. <em>See Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1194-95. One such circumstance is when a defendant was sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction must be consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s applicable policy statements. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Normally, a district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cto a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A). There is one exception to this rule: when the defendant previously received a below-guideline sentence based on his substantial assistance to the government. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B); USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.3). Thus, a sentence may be reduced below the amended guideline range if (and only if) the defendant already received a downward departure for providing substantial assistance to the government \u2014 as opposed to simply receiving a downward variance based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Colon, </em>707 F.3d 1255, 1259-60 (11th Cir.2013) (upholding \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A)\u2019s restriction on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reductions in the context of downward variances, as opposed to downward departures for substantial assistance).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Jackson\u2019s convictions arise from a drug sting in which he and several accomplices set out to steal about ten kilograms of cocaine. Instead, Jackson\u2019s accomplices wound up in a gunfight with police, and he fled the scene in the getaway car, ultimately being apprehended after a chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">Jackson pleaded guilty to two counts: (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine hydrochloride in excess of five kilograms (in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 846), and (2) brandishing a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime (in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(iii)). Only the first count is relevant to this appeal. Under the 2008 Guidelines, Jackson\u2019s base offense level for Count 1 was 32. After adjustments, his total offense level was calculated at 39, which resulted in a guideline range of 324 to 405 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">At sentencing, the court confirmed this guideline range. After applying the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court granted a downward variance and sentenced Jackson to 216-months imprisonment on Count 1. He was not given a downward departure for substantial assistance at that time or any time since; though the government has occasionally suggested that it might move for one. For example, during the sentence hearing, the government stated \u201c[t]here is a possibility\u201d it would file such a motion. And later, in response to one of Jackson\u2019s motions to compel filing of a substantial-assistance motion, the government stated it \u201cdoes not exclude [that] possibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">\u2022In 2014, Jackson moved to reduce his sentence in light of Amendment 782 to USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, which lowered the base offense level for most drug offenses. As the district court acknowledged, Amendment 782 does in fact reduce Jackson\u2019s base offense level, creating an amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>guideline range of 262 to 327 months. However, the low end of this amended range is still above Jackson\u2019s original sentence of 216 months. Thus, the district court could not reduce Jackson\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) unless he had already received a downward departure for substantial assistance. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B); <em>Colon, </em>707 F.3d at 1259-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Jackson has never received such a downward departure. He does not contend otherwise. Indeed, Jackson\u2019s repeated attempts to compel the government to file a substantial-assistance motion have been unsuccessful.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On this record, the district court correctly denied Jackson\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">That the district court did so without first holding an evidentiary hearing or requiring the government to respond to Jackson\u2019s motion was not an abuse of discretion. While the district court suggested after a preliminary review of Jackson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion that it \u201cmay schedule an evidentiary hearing\u201d if the government objected to the motion (which the government never did), whether to ultimately hold a hearing remained within the district court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>United States v. Yesil, </em>991 F.2d 1527, 1531 (11th Cir.1992),</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Beyond that, any potential evidentiary hearing would have concerned Jackson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion pursuant to Amendment 782, not the issue of Jackson\u2019s present eligibility for a substantial-assistance sentence reduction. Conducting a hearing on Jackson\u2019s alleged assistance of the government was simply outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cThis Circuit has been very clear in holding that a- sentencing adjustment undertaken pursuant to Section 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a de novo resentencing. Indeed, we have held that <em>all </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has- been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d) (citation omitted). This was not an opportunity for Jackson to reopen other aspects of his sentencing. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-21\">. Jackson is wrong to characterize the government's past statements that it <em>might </em>file a substantial-assistance motion as \u201cpromise[s]\u201d and \u201cobligations.\u201d Similarly, the plea agreement states, that the government \u201creserves the right\u201d to file such motions in its \"sole and unreviewable judgment,\u201d and emphasizes that \"nothing in this Agreement may be construed to require this Office to file any [substantial-assistance] motion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
