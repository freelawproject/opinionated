Miller asserts the district court erred in denying his motion because: (1) he is entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines and (2) his sentence should be lowered based on the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010(FSA). Both arguments fail. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-23\">First, Miller is not eligible for relief under Amendment 782. Section 3582(c)(2) authorizes a sentence reduction if the relevant Guidelines amendment has \u201cthe effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable [G]uideline[s] range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). However, a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>is barred from \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, \u201ceven when an amendment would lower the defendant\u2019s otherwise-applicable Guidelines sentencing range, when the defendant was sentenced on the basis of a mandatory minimum.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1078 (11th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 540 (11th Cir.2013), Here, the original sentencing court imposed the relevant statutory mandatory minimum sentence on Miller. Therefore, Miller is not entitled to relief under Amendment 782. <em>See Mills, </em>613 F.3d at 1078; <em>Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d at 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Second, under the present procedural posture, Miller cannot challenge his sen-fence based on the FSA. The \u201cFSA is not a[G]uidelines amendment ... but rather a statutory change by Congress, and thus it does not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-5\">. Miller also challenges his status as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under the Guidelines. However, as with his FSA claim, Miller cannot raise such a challenge here. Section 3582(c)(2) only \"permits a sentence reduction within the narrow bounds established by\u201d the Guidelines amendments at issue. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct, 2683, 2694, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). \u201cIn making [a \u00a7 3582(c)(2)] determination, the court shall substitute only the amendments .,. for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and <em>shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected,\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1) (emphasis added). The only amendment raised by Miller, Amendment 782, does not affect any of the Guidelines\u2019 career offender provisions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 782. As such, Miller's status as a career offender is \u201coutside the scope of the proceeding authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>See Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 831, 130 S.Ct. at 2694.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
