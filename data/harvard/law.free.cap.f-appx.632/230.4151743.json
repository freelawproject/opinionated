Four stepping, Farrar explained, is using a large hoe in unison with three other inmates, in a close, linear formation, while a supervisor dictates the pace for the group and how hard and high they must swing their hoes. Farrar complained that he suffered blisters on his hands, bruises on his legs and feet, and overall fatigue, none of which caused him to seek medical treatment. He now contends that the district court erred when it granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-25\">We review de novo the dismissal of Far-rar\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim \u201cusing the same standard applicable to dismissals under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\u201d <em>Rogers v. Boatright, </em>709 F.3d 403, 407 (5th Cir.2013). The district court could properly dismiss Far-rar\u2019s claims only if his factual allegations \u201ctaken as true, do not state a claim that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Sweetin, </em>745 F.3d 756, 763 (5th Cir.2014) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-26\">In his briefs statement of the case, Far-rar mentions that the district court denied him leave to amend his complaint after it entered the final judgment; the district court analyzed his claims under the Eighth Amendment, when, although he has offered no other theory for recovery, he did not seek recovery on that basis; and Stephens was never recognized as a party. Because Farrar \u201cdoes not articulate any argument\u201d on these issues, \u201cnor does he cite any authority for his position\u201d that the district court erred on these grounds, Farrar has waived these issues for appeal. <em>Morris v. Livingston, </em>739 F.3d 740, 752 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2734, 189 L.Ed.2d 772 (2014). Farrar also suggests that the practice of four stepping has revived the old building tender system. However, because he raises this issue for the first time in his reply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>brief, it, too, \u201cmust be waived.\u201d <em>Morin v. </em>Moore, 309 F.3d 316, 328 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Farrar \u201chas no constitutional right to compensation\u201d for his work in the prison field. <em>Loving v. Johnson, </em>455 F.3d 562, 563 (5th Cir.2006). Further, he has not shown that four stepping was beyond his strength or ability, endangered his life, caused him undue pain, or aggravated a serious medical condition. <em>See Jackson v. Cain, </em>864 F.2d 1235, 1247 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219 (5th Cir.1983). As Farrar thus did not \u201callege a violation of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States,\u201d the district court correctly determined that he had not stated a claim for relief under \u00a7 1983. <em>Whitley v. Hanna, </em>726 F.3d 631, 638 (5th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
