Ann. \u00a7 13-3408(A)(7). On appeal, Esquival-Centeno concedes that the Arizona offense of attempted transport of cocaine for sale qualifies as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i). <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>782 F.3d 198, 201-205 (5th Cir.2015), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 533, 193 L.Ed.2d 426 (2015) (No. 14-10355). He contends, however, that the records proffered by the Government were insufficient to prove that he had been convicted specifically of attempted <em>transport </em>of cocaine, that offense falls within a statute the parties concede is divisible.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-22\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to apply a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b) de novo. <em>See United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d 352, 355-56 (5th Cir.2005). Because Esquival-Centeno concedes that attempted transport of cocaine for sale constitutes a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under the categorical approach of <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the sole question is whether, applying a modified categorical approach to the Arizona statute in question, we are able to ascertain which of the divisible elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>formed the basis of Esquival-Centeno\u2019s pre-deportation conviction. <em>See Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2281, 2293, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). In ascertaining the precise basis of the prior conviction, we may consider the \u201ccharging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Esquival-Centeno was charged generally under Arizona Revised Statute \u00a7 13-3408(A)(7), which prohibits transporting for sale, importing, selling, transferring, or offering to transport for sale, import, sell, or transfer, any narcotic drug. The state court judgment, however, plainly and unambiguously specifies his offense of conviction as \u201cattempted transportation of [cocaine] for sale,\u201d thus reflecting \u201ca conscious judicial narrowing of the charging document.\u201d <em>Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d at 357-58 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). While Esquival-Centeno argues that the judgment\u2019s allusion to \u201ctransportation\u201d may simply be a shorthand reference to \u00a7 133408(A)(7) as a whole, the judgment is a Shepard-approved document that is binding in this circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">- Also instructive is the State\u2019s promise in Esquival-Centeno\u2019s plea agreement to dismiss all other allegations under \u00a7 13-3408(A)(7) upon his guilty plea to the attempted transport charge. As with the state judgment, he challenges the language of the plea agreement as nonspecific boilerplate, but this contention also fails under the principles that guide the modified categorical approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Finally, the plea hearing transcript reflects Esquival-Centeno\u2019s confirmation of the factual basis of his prior conviction, which involved his driving a car containing cocaine packaged for sale from Arizona to California. Contrary to Esquival-Cen-teno\u2019s assertion, a district court, in ascertaining the relevant conduct that distinguishes one divisible offense from another, may refer to the \u201ctranscript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant.\u201d <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The <em>Shepard </em>documents suffice to show that Esquival-Centeno\u2019s pre-depor-tation conviction was for the specific offense of attempted transport of cocaine for sale, which qualifies as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i). <em>See Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d at 358; <em>Martinez-Lugo, </em>782 F.3d at 201-05. Consequently, the district court did not err in imposing a 16-level enhancement in this case. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b259-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
