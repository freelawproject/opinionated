Study of the record and arguments satisfies us that the District Judge reached just conclusions as to most of the matters in controversy, and no good end would be attained by a statement of our reasons for approving his conclusions. 246 Fed. 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> We think, however, that the District Court was in error in holding invalid claim 1 of the Connor machine patent, No. 836,486. That claim reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">\u201cApparatus for producing bifocal lenses including a rotary holder for the lens crystal, and means for grinding two bifocal surfaces of different dioptrics simultaneously on one face thereof, substantially as set forth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The District Court held this claim invalid, because the rotary lens holder is old in the art and the claim was too broad, in that it covered all apparatus which will make the product described, provided only that a rotary lens holder forms a part of them. A claim may be limited by reference to the specifications in the application. Seymour v. Osborne, 11 Wall. 516-547, 20 L. Ed. 33; The Corn-Planter Patent, 23 Wall. 181-218, 23 L. Ed. 161. We think the broad claim is so- limited in this instance by the words \u201csubstantially as set forth,\u201d referring to the specifications in the' application which it is conceded describe the apparatus, and that the claim is therefore valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> We are of opinion, also, that the defendant has infringed. It is true that in Connor\u2019s specifications he describes \u201ca crystal holder member, and rotary grinding member co-operating therewith and having a spherically disposed grinding surface and an adjacent nonspherically disposed grinding surface,\u201d and that Mayer\u2019s machine, which the defendants operate, has both surfaces spherical. Connor\u2019s apparatus being the first to accomplish the desired end, or at least an important generic invention, should not be so narrowly construed as to permit real infringement by a variation which, if substantial, is merely an inferior application of Connor\u2019s invention. Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., 210 U. S. 405, 28 Sup. Ct. 748, 52 L. Ed. 1122; King Ax Co. et al. v. Hubbard, 97 Fed. 795, 38 C. C. A. 423.</p>\n<p id=\"A1P\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Connor\u2019s invention cannot be regarded anticipated by grinding machines in a remote art, such as the grinding of buttons. Evidently something more than mechanical skill was required to apply the grinding process to lenses, even if it had been suggested by the apparatus for grinding buttons. Hobbs v. Beach, 180 U. S. 383-392, 21 Sup. Ct. 409, 45 L. Ed. 586. The decree of the District Court, with this modification, protects the plaintiff in the exclusive use of all inventions covered by its patents, and meets fully the justice of the case. The decree of the District Court is modified accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
