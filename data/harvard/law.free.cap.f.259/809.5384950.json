If there is a distinction between the \u201ccapital\u201d and the \u201ccapital stock\u201d of corporations, in that the capital stock is fixed by the charter of a corporation, but that the capital used in its business may be either larger or smaller, there may be a like distinction between the joint stock or share capital of a partnership or association, as fixed by the agreement of the partners, and the full amount of its property. Rindley on Partnership (8th Eng. Ed.) 382 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">In Bankruptcy Act Aug. 19, 1841, c. 9, \u00a7 14, 5 Stat. 448, and Act March 2, 1867, c. 176, \u00a7 36; 14 Stat. 534, the term \u201cjoint stock\u201d was \u25a0used to describe partnership assets. Collier on Bankruptcy (11th Ed.) pp. 1550, 1535. In Berthold et al. v. Goldsmith, 24 How. 541, 16 L. Ed. 762, the term \u201ccapital stock\u201d was used in the same sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">An \u201cassociation\u201d or \u201ccompany,\u201d equally with a corporation, may have a share capital distinct from its actual capital or property, irrespective of whether it is formed in a state without regulating statutes, or in a state where by statute it is regulated and given some of the characteristics of a corporation. The present statute, by the use of the terms \u201cassociation\u201d and \u201ccompany,\u201d covers those formed under the common law as well as those formed under or regulated by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">It seems to us clear that the words \u201ccertificates of stock\u201d contain no implication of an intent to exclude common-law associations or companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>A certificate evidencing a transferable share or shares in the share capital of a manufacturing company, whether incorporated, quasi incorporated, or wholly unincorporated, is properly described as a \u201ccertificate of stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">By agreement the certificates in question were issued as evidence of shares of a fixed capital, divided into a fixed number of shares, of the par value of $100 each.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">We are called upon to apply a statute imposing stamp taxes on documents of a certain class, and which assumes that these documents may be issued, not only by corporations,, but by associations and companies. These may have this in common \u2014 a share capital of fixed amount. Whether the share capital is fixed by agreement or under statutory authority seems immaterial, for the tax is not a franchise tax or a corporation tax, but a stamp tax or document tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The differences between corporations and unincorporated associations being considered immaterial to the imposition of a stamp tax on documents, the different modes of realizing upon the shares of incorporated or unincorporated companies by the certificate holders must also be regarded as immaterial. Having that feature of resemblance which the statute fixes upon as the test of the imposition of a stamp tax, the difference between these different bodies which are named in the statute has become immaterial to the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The suggestion of constitutional difficulties in adopting the construction for which the collector contends, and which we think right, does not seem of weight. It involves \u201cno distinction founded upon an immaterial difference between two kinds of partnerships,\u201d since the stamp tax is contingent upon the original issue of \u201ccertificates of stock,\u201d just as a stamp tax on checks is contingent upon the issuing of checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">A stamp tax on documents discriminates between those who do and those who do not issue documents; and a distinction between unincorporated companies and associations which do and those which do not issue certificates of shares of stock is not unreasonable, nor founded upon an immaterial difference between two kinds of partnerships. Thomas v. United States, 192 U. S. 363, 371, 24 Sup. Ct. 305, 48 L. Ed. 481; Hatch v. Reardon, 204 U. S. 152, 158, 159, 27 Sup. Ct. 188, 51 L. Ed. 415, 9 Ann. Cas. 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">The Massachusetts cases cited (Gleason v. McKay, 134 Mass. 419; Minot v. Winthrop, 162 Mass. 113, 38 N. E. 512, 26 L. R. A. 259; Opinions of Justices, 196 Mass. 603, 85 N. E. 545) in our opinion do not give rise to any constitutional difficulty. The opinion of Chief Justice Rugg (196 Mass. 619, 620, 85 N. E. 545) tends to support the view that the words \u201cassociation\u201d and \u201ccompany\u201d include organizations not regulated by statute, and that a statute including these in an excise tax does not involve a discrimination founded on an immaterial difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">Nor do we regard it useful to consider whether the right of the certificate holder or shareholder is a chose in action or in the nature of a chose in action, or an equit\u00e1ble interest in property.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>The certificate is but a muniment of title \u2014 documentary evidence of ownership \u2014 and not the share itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The thing taxed is not a chose in action, though it may be evidence of it. In a remote sense both a share of corporate stock and a certificate of a share in an unincorporated company may be said to represent an interest in property. It is equally true that both may represent an interest in a share of a capital fixed in amount, whether fixed by statute or by agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">In Eliot v. Freeman, 220 U. S. 178, 31 Sup. Ct. 360, 55 L. Ed. 424, construing the Corporation Tax Law (Act Aug. 5, 1909, c. 6, 36 Stat. 11), it was held that the tax was imposed upon doing business in a corporate or quasi corporate capacity. But that case is clearly distinguishable from the present case, since the present statute does not impose a franchise tax, but imposes a stamp tax upon various kinds of 'documents, which may be issued by companies neither incorporated nor quasi incorporated, \u201cor for or in respect of the vellum, parchment, or paper upon which such instruments, matters, or things, or any of them are written or printed,\u201d etc. See section 5, 38 Stat. pt. 1, p. 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In interpreting the statute we find no sufficient reason for limiting the terms \u201cassociation\u201d and \u201ccompany\u201d to those which derive their powers from legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">We have examined, also, the opinion of the Supreme Court in Crocker et al. v. Malley, March 17, 1919, 249 U. S. 223, 39 Sup. Ct. 270, 63 L. Ed. 573, reversing the judgment of this court. In that case the Supreme Court found that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-8\">\u201cThe declaration <em>of </em>trust on its face is an ordinary real estate trust of the hind familiar in Massachusetts, unless in the particular that the trustees\u2019 receipt provides that the holder has no interest in any specific property and that it purports only to declare the holder entitled to a certain fraction of the net proceeds of the property when converted into cash \u2018and meantime to income.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">It was stated, however, in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-10\">\u201cThe function of the trustees is not to manage the mills, but simply to collect the rents and income of such property as may be in their hands,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">Under the present declaration of trust it is provided that the name of the trust shall be Pepperell Manufacturing Company, and the trustees may be so designated, and in that name the trustees shall, so far as practicable, conduct the business of the trust; that the trustees shall employ and use the trust property and assets in the carrying on of the business of manufacturing textile or other fabrics, etc. This is essentially different from an ordinary real estate trust of the kind familiar in Massachusetts. If, under the decision of the Supreme Court, there' may be doubt whether the term \u201cassociation\u201d is applicable, there seems no ground for serious doubt of the applicability of the term \u201ccompany,\u201d used in the statute and made a part of the name and description of those persons who are to conduct the manufacturing business of the organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">In applying this stamp tax we find no substantial reason for a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>tinction between this textile manufacturing company and other textile manufacturing companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the case will be remanded to that court, with direction to enter judgment for the defendant, and the plaintiff in error recovers costs in both courts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
