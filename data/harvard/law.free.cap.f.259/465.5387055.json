The parties will be referred to as the Ice Company and the York Company, respectively. The case was tried on issues joined on pleas of non est factum and the general issue, with leave to present thereunder any special defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-4\">The following state of facts was shown by undisputed evidence: During the period covered by the dealings between the parties the lee Company was a manufacturer of ice, doing business at Mobile, Ala., and the York Company was a manufacturer of ice-making machinery, having its factory and main office at York, Pa. Several months prior to the signing, as hereinafter stated, by an agent of the York Company, of the alleged contract, the Ice Company made it known to several manufacturers of ice-making machinery, including the York Company, that it contemplated the purchase of an ice manufacturing plant, consisting of two refrigerating machines, each having a capacity of 50 tons of ice per 24 hours, and additional capacity to maintain a temperature of 28 degrees Fahrenheit in storage room having 100,000 cubic feet capacity. A representative of the Ice Company visited York, and had interviews with representatives of the York Company, in which the former\u2019s desire to buy a 100-ton plant was mentioned. Following this, the York Company, on October 23, 1914, made and transmitted to E. R. Feagin, to be submitted by the latter to the Ice Company, two alternative estimates, consisting of lists of machinery and equipment, stating price for the same, but not mentioning capacity. Feagin was a traveling salesman of the Southern Construction <em>&amp; </em>Supply Company of Atlanta, which was the York Company\u2019s agent for territory including Mobile, the terms of the agency being expressed in a written contract between the principal and agent, a provision of that contract being that among the duties to be performed by the agent are \u201cto solicit orders for the machinery and apparatus which is manufactured, sold, or handled by the principal, and to submit the same to the principal for acceptance.\u201d On November 5th the York Company sent to Feagin three additional estimates, consisting of lists of machinery and prices for same, no mention being made of capacity. In a communication of the York Company to Feagin dated November 12th, inclosing a blueprint referred to as showing the 100-ton plant, it was said: \u201cYou will understand that these layouts are only preliminary, and, of course, are subject to change in case the proposition goes through.\u201d For about two weeks prior to November 27, 1914, Feagin was in Mobile, negotiating with representatives of the lee Company for the sale of an ice plant to the latter. During most-of that time the lee Company was negotiating with other manufacturers of ice-making machinery, and the agents of the several manufacturers were actively competing for the business. While such negotiations were in progress the following correspondence took place:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-5\">\u201cDay Letter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-6\">\u201cMobile, Ala., Nov. 16th, 1914.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-7\">\u201cYork Mfg.

The latter conducted a department of its business under the first-stated name. On November 27tlr a written contract for the sale by the York Company to the Ice Company of two ice-making units was signed in the name of the former by Feagin, and in the name of the latter by its president and secretary and treasurer. That instrument contained the following provisions: \u201cThe York Manufacturing Company hereby guarantees that each machine consisting of the herein described engine andigas pump, under test will give a duly equal to the manufacture of 55 tons of ice in twenty-four hours, when operating under 15.67 pounds back pressure and 185 pounds condensing pressure, and at 68 B. P. M. [meaning revolutions per minute]. * * * The York Manufacturing Company guarantees that the above freezing system (can system Nos. 1 and 2) under test will have an ice-making capacity of 110 tons of ice per day of 24 hours each, each ton ro consist of five blocks, with the water entering the case at 40 degrees or less, when properly and continuously operated, and said ice to be suitable and merchantable for all domestic purposes. * * * 1292 galvanized freezing cans, size 14%\"xl4%/'x necessary length.

When the York Company was apprised of the contents of the instrument signed in its name by Feagin it refused to comply with it and gave notice of such refusal to the Ice Company. The following are extracts from the testimony of George Branngart, a witness for the York Company: \u201cThis contract calls for a 16% by 24 vertical single acting compressor, running at 68 revolutions, with 15.67 pounds back pressure and 185 pounds head pressure. Under those conditions the machine would have an actual ice-making capacity of 49 tons.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing, as a practical proposition, to prevent them from running the machine faster than 68 revolutions a minute, and if they would run it faster it would produce more ice.\u201d Testimony of other witnesses for the York Company was to the effect that the capacity of each of the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>ice-making units mentioned in the contract, when the ammonia air compressor is operated at 68 revolutions per minute, and under other conditions stated, had a capacity of 49 tons of ice a day; that by increasing the number of revolutions. per minute more ice would be made, and less would be made if the number of revolutions is decreased; and that each unit would make 55 tons of ice per day with the required Increase of the number of revolutions of the compressor, such increase being practicable, but requiring the use of more power.

In behalf of the York Company it was contended that its telegram of November 27th to Feagin, \u201cYou are authorized to sign City Ice Company contract in our name,\u201d had reference to such a 100-ton ice plant as had been the subject of previous negotiations, and did not confer on him authority to bind the York Company by such a contract as the instrument signed evidences. The rulings complained of resulted from the conclusion .reached by the court that under the evidence adduced it was open to the jury to find that the words \u201csign City Ice Company contract\u201d had reference only to a contract for a 100-ton plant, with means of keeping at freezing temperature 100,000 cubic feet of storage space, as contemplated in preceding negotiations, and that the telegram did not authorize Feagin to bind the York Company to a contract which gave the Ice Company the option to take either a 110-ton plant or a 55-ton plant. The nature and scope of Feagin\u2019s agency, as it existed before the just-mentioned telegram was sent, were disclosed by undisputed evidence. It was shown by uncontroverted testimony that Feagin was the duly authorized representative of the Southern Construction &amp; Supply Company, upon which the York Company, by written instrument, had conferred authority \u201cto solicit orders for the machinery and apparatus which is manufactured, sold, or handled by the principal, and to submit the same to the principal for acceptance.\u201d Before the sending of the telegram of November 27th, Feagin, as the representative of his immediate principal, was authorized to solicit and submit to the York Company for its acceptance such an order for machinery as the contract sued on embodies, whether such an order had or had not been the subject of previous negotiations. It seems that such a telegram as that of No<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>vember 27th, sent to one already having the authority just mentioned, had the effect of so enlarging that authority as to make it one to solicit and accept in behalf of the York Company such an order as the instrument signed embodied, whereas before the authority possessed by the addressee of the telegram did not extend beyond soliciting such an order and submitting it to the York Company for acceptance, and that the evidence was such as not to leave it open to find otherwise. The fact that the agent kept in touch with and consulted the principal while the negotiations were in progress does not indicate that prior to the sending of the telegram of November 27th the former did not, as to his dealings with the Ice Company, have the authority conferred by the agency contract. It was against the interest of both agent and principal for the former\u2019s efforts to result in obtaining an order which the latter would not accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">But it may be assumed, without being admitted, that when Feagin went to Mobile he was clothed only with authority to negotiate for the sale of such machinery as the Ice Company had indicated a desire to buy \u2014 a 100-ton ice plant and incident means of maintaining 100,000 cubic feet of storage room at or below a freezing temperature. It is contended that that authority was exceeded when the agent undertook to bind the principal to furnish a 110-ton ice-making plant. The uncontradicted testimony showed that the ice-making plant called for by the contract, when operated as and under the conditions therein specified, makes, not 110 tons, but 98 tons, of ice per day. That testimony further showed that that plant would make more or less than 98 tons of ice a day according as the ammonia air compressor is run at a speed of more or less than 68 revolutions per minute, the other stated conditions being the same, and that it is entirely practicable to increase or diminish within a considerable range the number of revolutions per minute above or below the number mentioned in the contract, the product per day being substantially three-fourths of a ton more or less than 49 tons for each revolution in addition to or less than 68, the other stated conditions being the same. It seems that it cannot with any propriety be said that a machine does not answer a call for a 100-ton one when it is equally capable of being so operated as to produce that amount, or more or less than that amount, per day, according as part of it is speeded up or slowed down within entirely practicable limits; and that an agent\u2019s sale of such a machine, which, when operated at a speed and under conditions specified in the contract of sale, makes slightly less than 100 tons of ice per day, cannot properly be said to be beyond the scope of an agency to sell a 100-ton machine because the contract contains a warranty that the machine when so operated will make 110 tons of ice a day, or substantially more than in fact it will make when so operated. Such a sale is not of a thing other than the one the agent was authorized to sell, whether the warranty does or does not subject the seller to liability for a breach of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Based on the provisions as to capacity to maintain a freezing temperature in storage room having 100,000 feet capacity, and as to the cans to be furnished having a capacity to make blocks of ice weigh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ing 440 pounds, contained in the instrument signed by Feagin, it was contended in behalf of the York Company that the ice-making machinery called for was guaranteed to have a capacity of even more than 110 tons per day, and that Feagin exceeded the authority conferred on him in undertaking to bind the York Company by such provisions.. If the provision as to the capacity of what was called for to maintain a freezing temperature in the storage space mentioned had the effect of guaranteeing additional ice-making capacity, yet such a provision must have been in the contemplation of the York Company from the beginning, as the Ice Company\u2019s written request for bids called for bids on \u201ctwo refrigerating machines, each of which will have a capacity of 50 tons of ice per 24 hours, and additional capacity to maintain a temperature of 28 degrees F. in storage room having 100,000 C. F. capacity.\u201d From the fact that the cans to be furnished were to have a capacity to make blocks of ice weighing about 440 pounds it does not follow that the above-quoted guaranty of- the ice-making capacity of the freezing system can be given a meaning different from the one expressed by its language. The language of the provisions, taken together, cannot be given the effect of guaranteeing an ice-making capacity of more than 110 tons of ice per day of 24 hours. The guaranty clause in question says each ton \u201cto contain five blocks.\u201d It does not say th\u2019\u00e1t each block shall be more than a fifth of a ton. The average weight of five units together making a ton is one-fifth of a ton. A fifth of a ton or less of ice may be made in a can having a capacity to make more than that amount. Ice-making capacity of more than 110 tons is not called for by a guaranty of a capacity of only 110 tons.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Even if the authority originally conferred on Feagin was limited to negotiating for the sale of a 100-ton ice-making plant, the correspondence between him and the York Company, after the former reached Mobile, unequivocally shows that the latter, while the negotiations were in progress, recognized that Feagin was empowered <em>tp </em>make changes, omissions or additions required by the Ice Company, to give guaranties, and to stipulate for special apparatus not included in any specifications or bid previously submitted. That the \u201cfull authority\u201d explicitly mentioned in the York Company\u2019s telegram of November 25th was not intended to be limited to negotiations for an order for a 100-ton plant is shown by its telegram of the day before in reply to the one of Feagin inquiring, \u201cWill you consider splitting contract with Vilter, each taking complete fifty ton?\u201d The York Company\u2019s statement, made in its reply, \u201cDo' not care to split contract with Vilter unless we can get good price for plant,\u201d is inconsistent with the existence of an intention on its part to limit Feagin\u2019s authority to negotiating for an order for a 100-ton plant, and shows that it contemplated the possibility of the negotiation resulting in Feagin getting an order for an ice-making machine having a capacity of substantially less than 100 tons a day. In view of that correspondence and the attending circumstances, the York Company\u2019s telegram of November 27th, \u201cYou are authorized to sign City Ice Company contract in our name,\u201d must be regarded as empowering Feagin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>to bind the York Company by a contract for whatever he previously had been authorized to obtain an order for.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The conclusion is that the uncontradicted evidence \u2014 written instruments and correspondence to which the York Company was a party and undisputed oral testimony \u2014 shows that Feagin was authorized to bind the York Company by the contract sued on. The existence of such contract and a breach of it being so shown, the Ice Company was entitled to have the jury instructed to find a verdict in its favor. The court erred in refusing the plaintiff\u2019s request for an instruction to that effect. Because of that error, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b487-6\">FOSTER, District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A1y\">(dissenting). The rule is well settled that when a contract contains technical terms parol is admissible to explain such. Evidence was admitted without objections on this question, was all one way, and conclusively showed that in the opinion of the experts the contract was not for a 100-ton plant. The court charged the jury the contract was not for a 100-ton plant. With that I agree. If there was nothing else, the option to take only one-half of the plant destroyed the contract as one for a 100-ton plant. Further, I am unable to follow the majority opinion in distinguishing the guaranty that the plant would produce 110 tons of ice every 24 hours from the balance of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">On the question of Feagin\u2019s authority to make the contract, it was clearly shown that he departed from the specifications sent.him, and contracted for certain items of machinery and apparatus never contemplated by the previous negotiations, and not regularly manufactured by defendant. The defendant had no knowledge of the changes until it received the signed contract. It was further shown that Feagin received a check for $250, which was not mentioned in the contract. The evidence as to the purpose for which this check was given is conflicting, but the jury may have concluded it was intended for a bribe to induce Feagin to make the unauthorized changes in the specifications. Negotiations between the parties extended over a period of four months, and there were personal interviews between the principals as well as between the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>agents and </em>Feagin, in addition to the extensive correspondence. Feagin\u2019s authority could not well be predicated upon one or two letters or telegrams, or in fact on less than all the evidence. The impression made upon my mind by the evidence is that Feagin was overreached by the plaintiffs\u2019 agents in the final making of the contract, and was induced to sign a document specifying a plant such as was never contemplated by the previous negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Conceding that the evidence was not disputed, the minds of reasonable men might well have differed as to the conclusions to be drawn from it, and, such being the case, the question 'of Feagin\u2019s authority to make the contract sued on was clearly for the jury. Therefore the action of the District Court in submitting that question to them was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">Entertaining these views, I am obliged to respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
