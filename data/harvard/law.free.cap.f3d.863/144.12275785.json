Christopher and Patricia Callahan\u2014 the decedent\u2019s brother and mother\u2014filed this suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Wilson, other Suffolk County police officers and employees, and Suffolk County, alleging, among other causes of action, that Officer Wilson\u2019s use of deadly force violated the Fourth Amendment prohibition against excessive force. The case proceeded to trial. Following the completion of evidence, the district court declined to give plaintiffs\u2019 proposed jury instruction regarding the use of deadly force by a police officer that tracked the deadly force instruction we endorsed in <em>Rasanen v. Doe, </em>723 F.3d 325 (2d Cir. 2013). The jury returned a verdict in favor of Officer Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-16\">We agree with plaintiffs that the district court\u2019s jury charge concerning deadly force was inconsistent with <em>Rasanen, </em>and this error was not harmless. Accordingly, we VACATE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b170-18\">I. Fatal Shooting of Kevin Callahan</p>\n<p id=\"b170-19\">In the early afternoon of September 20, 2011, Suffolk County Police Officer Thomas Wilson responded to a radio call from a dispatcher reporting a situation involving a gun at the single-family home of Patricia Callahan in Selden, New York. The radio transmission indicated that Patricia Callahan\u2014who was not at her home\u2014had been on the phone with her son, Kevin Callahan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who was at the home in Selden and had told his mother that another person with him had a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>When Officer Wilson arrived at the Callahan home, two other Suffolk County officers, Dan Furey and Elisa McVeigh, had already arrived in response to the- dispatch. Officers Wilson, Furey, and McVeigh approached the front entrance to the home, where the screen door was closed but the front door was open. The officers knocked on the screen door, announced their presence, and entered to investigate; McVeigh searched the upstairs while Furey and Wilson went downstairs. Officer Wilson repeatedly announced the officers\u2019 presence and asked if anybody was in the home or needed help. The officers did not hear any response.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Once they reached the bottom of the stairs, Officers Wilson and Furey split up\u2014Wilson went to the left, and Furey went to the right. Officer Wilson testified that he saw a cleaver knife in the den area downstairs, which heightened his concern. Wilson cheeked one bedroom downstairs and then turned to another bedroom to his right. The door was partially open, and as Officer Wilson began to walk through it, he saw an individual through the partially opened door and called out, \u201cpolice, I see you, ... don\u2019t move.\u201d J.A. 270. According to Wilson,, the person in the room \u201cstart[ed] to square off towards the door\u201d and then forcefully attempted to close the bedroom door on Wilson. J.A. 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Officer Wilson testified that he had been holding his semi-automatic service pistol in his left hand down by his left leg, and when the door partially closed on him, he was pinned in the doorframe such that his hand holding the gun was on the other side of the door. Wilson testified that he then saw \u201csome type of object\u201d on the other side of 'the door, but his flashlight had been knocked out of his right hand and he had only a limited view, so he did not know what the object was. J.A. 275. He testified that the person on the other side of the door also made a sound like \u201csome type of growl\u201d that was \u201cscar[]y.\u201d J.A. 275. According to Wilson, he feared that he could be shot through the door or that his gun might be used against him, so he tried to free himself. He testified that, while he was trying to pull himself out of the door, he saw \u201ca shadow coming around the door\u201d and \u201ca hand thrusting towards [him] with an object.\u201d J.A. 309. Still unable to get out of the doorway, Officer Wilson fired his weapon while the gun was on the other side of the door. Wilson testified that after the initial gunshots, the door let up, which caused him to fall back. As he fell, he continued to fire, but now through the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">According to Wilson, he then stood up and ran toward Officer Furey, took cover, and reported over the radio: \u201cshots fired, man behind the door, unknown weapon or object.\u201d J.A. 311-12. Emergency services arrived with more police officers. Officers entered the downstairs bedroom and saw a person later identified as Kevin Callahan behind the bedroom door, sitting on his heels with his hands under his chest and his chest on his thighs. The officers asked to see his hands and did not receive a response, at which point they placed him in handcuffs and. called medical services for him. Callahan died from his gunshot wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Forensic analysis and an autopsy later established that Officer Wilson fired a total of four shots, three of which struck Callahan. Two shots were fired from inside the bedroom, and the other two shots were fired through the door. The first shot fired inside the bedroom resulted in a contact wound to Callahan\u2019s back, and the second shot from inside the bedroom entered Callahan\u2019s back right shoulder and exited from his right abdomen. The shot fired through the door that hit Callahan caused a wound in his front upper abdomen/chest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>area.-No weapon was found in the bedroom where Callahan was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">II. Plaintiffs\u2019 Excessive Force Claim</p>\n<p id=\"ALa\">In,2012, Christopher and Patricia Callahan filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against Suffolk County, Officer Wilson, and' other Suffolk County police officers and employees. The complaint asserted several state and federal claims in connection with Kevin Callahan\u2019s death, including excessive force pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The excessive force claim proceeded to trial in July 2015.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict in favor of Officer Wilson.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs moved for judgment as a matter of law. or a new trial pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure SO and 59, which the district court denied. Judgment entered on January 29, 2016,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A4k\">On appeal, plaintiffs argue that a new trial is, necessary because the jury was not properly instructed regarding the legal standards' that govern the use of deadly force under these circumstances. We review jury instructions <em>de novo, </em>considering the challenged instruction in light of the charge as a whole. <em>Warren v. Pataki, </em>823 F.3d 125, 137 (2d Cir. 2016). A jury instruction is erroneous if it \u201cmisleads the jury as-to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law.\u201d <em>Velez v. City of N.Y., </em>730 F.3d 128, 134 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). An erroneous jury instruction requires a new trial unless the error is harmless. <em>Id, </em>We conclude that the use of force instructions here were inconsistent with our prior decision in <em>Rasanen v. Doe, </em>723 F.3d 325 (2d Cir. 2013), and we cannot say that the error was harmless..</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">I. Instructional Error</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">In <em>Rasanen v. Doe, </em>decided approximately two years before the trial here, we explained that the jury charge in a Section 1983 police shooting case alleging excessive use of force by a police officer in circumstances similar, to those here must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>include a specific instruction regarding the legal justification for the use of deadly force, 723 F.3d at 333, 337, The instruction \u201cmust\u201d convey \u201cthat the use- of force highly likely to have deadly effects is unreasonable unless the officer had probable cause to believe that the suspect posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334. Failure to so instruct the jury constitutes plain error, as it \u201cdeprives the jury of adequate legal guidance to reach a rational decision on [the] case\u2019s fundamental issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334-35 (alteration and internal quotation-marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Defendants-Appellees suggest that <em>Ra-sanen </em>may no longer control, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Plumhoff v. Rickard, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 2012,188 L.Ed.2d 1056 (2014). In <em>Plumhoff, </em>a dangerous police car chase of a fleeing suspect ended when police officers fired at the vehicle, killing the driver and a passenger. <em>See id. </em>at 2017-18. The Supreme Court concluded that the officers did not violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against the use of excessive force. <em>See id. </em>at 2020-22. <em>Plumhoff </em>did not, however, involve any claim of instructional error, nor does the opinion alter the authorities on which <em>Rasanen </em>relied regarding the appropriate jury charge concerning the fatal shooting of suspects in the circumstances presented here. In particular, <em>Plumhoff </em>involved an application of <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 127 S.Ct. 1769,167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007), which was decided several years before <em>Plumhoff </em>and was discussed at length in <em>Rasanen, see </em>723 F.3d at 333-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Nor does the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>County of Los Angeles v. Mendez, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 1539, 198 L.Ed.2d 52 (2017), undermine Rasanen\u2019s holding as to the requirements for a jury charge in the type of excessive force case presented here. In <em>Mendez, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201cprovocation rule\u201d because that rule allowed a prior independent Fourth Amendment violation \u201cto manufacture an excessive force claim where one would not otherwise exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1546. In explaining its decision, the Court noted that \u201c[t]he operative question in excessive force cases is ^whether the totality of the circumstances justified] a particular sort of search or seizure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tennessee v. Garner, </em>471 U.S. 1, 8-9, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)). Importantly, <em>Gamer </em>articulated the probable cause requirement for police shooting cases upon which this Court relied in <em>Rasanen. See Rasanen, </em>723 F.3d at 333 (\u201cIn <em>Garner, </em>the Supreme Court explained that \u2018[w]here the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Garner, </em>471 U.S. at 11, 105 S.Ct. 1694)).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Thus, as relevant here, we conclude that neither <em>Plumhoff </em>nor <em>Mendez </em>overrules <em>Rasanen, </em>which remains the controlling law of this Circuit. Defendants do not attempt to distinguish <em>Rasanen </em>on the facts, which is unsurprising given the similarity between the circumstances of the shooting in that case and the underlying facts here. Accordingly, we are bound to follow <em>Rasanen </em>in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Shipping Corp. of India v. Jaldhi Overseas Pte Ltd., </em>585 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>F.3d 58, 67 (2d Cir. 2009) (\u201c[A] panel of our Court is bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled either by an <em>en banc </em>panel of our Court or by the Supreme Court.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Applying <em>Rasanen, </em>we conclude that the jury charge regarding deadly force was erroneous. Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed jury instructions included the specific language we endorsed in <em>Rasanen </em>and cited that decision. At the charge conference, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel also orally requested that the jury charge include that language, arguing that \u201cit\u2019s not just a matter of semantics.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> J.A. 566. The district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 request, and instead instructed the jury in accordance with the general excessive force instructions that apply in situations involving non-deadly force,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> with two modifications: the charge specifically referred to \u201cdeadly force\u201d in two places, and it included language about an officer\u2019s probable cause to believe that he or she faces a threat of death or serious injury. The exact language of the district court\u2019s charge was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">A person has the right, under the United States Constitution, to be free from the use of excessive force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">A police officer is entitled to use reasonable force. A police officer is not entitled to use any force beyond what is necessary to accomplish a lawful purpose. Reasonable force may include the use of deadly force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">A police officer may use deadly force against a person if a police officer has probable cause to believe that the person poses a significant threat of death \u2018or serious physical injury to the officer or others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">In determining whether the police officer used reasonable force, the actions of the police officer are measured by the test of what a reasonable and prudent police officer would have done under the same circumstances confronting the police officer without regard to the police officer\u2019s underlying subjective intent or motivation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-11\">That means the evil intentions will not be considered excessive force if the force used was in fact reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-12\">On the other hand, an officer\u2019s good intentions will not make the use of excessive force constitutional. The reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene rather than with hindsight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-13\">The nature of reasonableness must allow for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments under circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-14\">This reasonableness inquiry is an objective one. The question is whether the defendant police officer\u2019s actions w[ere] objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting the police officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-15\">In determining whether the police officer used excessive force, you may consider,' one, the need for the application of force; two, the relationship between the need and the amount of force used; three, the threat reasonably perceived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>by the police officer; and, four, any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">J.A. 606-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Unlike in <em>Rasanen, </em>the charge here did refer to the probable cause necessary for an officer to reasonably use deadly force. But the instruction did not track the language from <em>Rasanen, </em>and we conclude that it is materially different from the language we approved there, even with the reference to \u201cprobable cause.\u201d In <em>Rasanen, </em>we held that the jury \u201cmust\u201d be instructed that the use of deadly force is <em>\u201cunreasonable unless </em>the officer had probable cause to believe that the suspect posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to others,\u201d 723 F.3d at 334 (emphasis added); here, the jury was instructed that an officer <em>\u201cmay </em>use deadly force ... <em>if </em>the officer has the requisite probable cause, J.A. 605 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Although these two formulations both refer to the probable cause requirement for the use of deadly force, they are not functionally equivalent. In <em>Rasanen, </em>we explicitly distinguished between the permissive \u201cmay/if\u201d language and the restrictive \u201cunless/only\u201d language by reference to the New York State Police administrative manual before the jury in that case. <em>See Rasanen, </em>723 F.3d at 335-37. The relevant provision in that manual used nearly identical language to the charge here, stating: \u201cA[n officer] may use deadly physical force against another person when they reasonably believe it to be necessary to defend the [officer] or another person from the use or imminent use of deadly physical force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336 (internal quotation marks omitted). In concluding that this formulation did not correctly instruct the jury, we explained that the problem with the \u201cmay/if\u201d language is that it \u201cis not framed in exclusive and restrictive terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337. That formulation was insufficient because it did not convey that an officer\u2019s use of deadly physical force is reasonable, and therefore legally permissible, only in a specific circumstance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Thus, the charge given to the jury here\u2014which used the same permissive \u201cmay/if\u201d language that we specifically rejected in Rasanen\u2014was deficient. This error in the formulation of the specific deadly force instruction was compounded by the balance of the charge regarding excessive force, which further weakened the probable cause requirement. For example, the jury was also told that an officer \u201cis entitled to use reasonable force,\u201d which \u201cmay include the use of deadly force.\u201d J.A. 605. Later in the charge, the district court again instructed the jury according to language that applies to non-deadly uses of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">These instructions were further \u201cdilute[d],\u201d <em>Rasanen, </em>723 F.3d at 335, by suggesting that the jury could find that Officer Wilson\u2019s shooting of Callahan complied with constitutional standards for reasons other than the fact that Wilson had probable cause to believe that Callahan posed a significant threat of death or serious injury to Wilson or others. Similar to <em>Rasanen, </em>the entirety of the charge here allowed the jury to conclude that \u201cthe shooting seemed necessary\u201d because Wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>son \u201cacted reasonably under the circumstances,\u201d even if the jury concluded that Callahan did not pose that type of threat, <em>Id. </em>at 336 (emphasis omitted). <em>Rasanen </em>makes clear, however, that an officer\u2019s use of deadly force in a police shooting case is not, as a matter of law, reasonable <em>unless </em>that officer had probable cause to believe that the individual posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others. <em>Id. </em>at 334. Thus, the charge here suffers from the same \u201cfatal defect\u201d as the charge in <em>Rasanen\u2014</em>\u201cthe jury did not know, because it was not told,\u201d that it could not properly conclude that the shooting was justified unless it found that the probable cause requirement was met. <em>Id. </em>at 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Even though the jury was told that Officer Wilson would have been permitted to use deadly force <em>if </em>he had probable cause to believe that Callahan posed a significant threat of death or serious injury, our required charge is more demanding; under <em>Rasanen, </em>such probable cause is the <em>only </em>situation in which Wilson was permitted to use deadly force, and the jury must be so instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">II. Harmlessness Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">An erroneous jury instruction requires a new trial unless the error was harmless. <em>Uzoukwu v. City of N.Y., </em>806 F.3d 409, 418 (2d Cir. 2015). \u201cAn error is harmless only if the court is convinced that the error did not influence the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). We are not persuaded that the error in the deadly force charge given here was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The focus of the trial was how the events unfolded in the Callahan basement that afternoon. As discussed above, under the instructions the jury was given, the jury could have reached its verdict without concluding that Officer Wilson had probable cause to believe .that Callahan posed a threat of-death or serious injury. That conclusion is compelled by the fact that the instructions here, allowed the jury to.return . a defense verdict if, it found that Wilson acted according to an overly general standard of \"reasonableness\u201d that does not comport with the holding of <em>Rasan</em>en\u2014that deadly force, in -, this context is reasonable only if the requisite probable cause standard is satisfied. On this record, we cannot determine whether the jury answered the critical question and concluded that probable- cause existed, or instead decided the case according to a more general standard that is inconsistent with our Circuit\u2019s precedent in this particular type of case. Because this error allowed the jury to decide the case on different grounds than <em>Rasanen </em>permits, we are not convinced that, the error did not .influence the jury\u2019s verdict, and we therefore cannot say that it was harmless,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">III. Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Because we have concluded that plaintiffs are entitled to a new trial on the basis of instructional error, we need not consider their remaining arguments. Nevertheless, we briefly, address the evidentiary issues raised on appeal in order to provide some guidance in connection with the retrial in this case, as the issues appear likely to recur. <em>See Rentas v. </em>Ruffin, 816 F.3d 214, 223 (2d Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Plaintiffs contend that the district court erred by excluding two pieces of evidence at trial: (1) expert testimony about police protocol, and (2) prior incidents in which Officer Wilson fired his weapon. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, including those as to expert testimony, for abuse of discretion. <em>Lore v. City of Syracuse, </em>670 F.3d 127, 155 (2d Cir. 2012). A district court abuses its discretion if it makes \u201can error of law or a clear error of fact.\u201d <em>Abascal v. Fleckenstein, </em>820 F.3d 561, 564 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). Upon review of the trial record, we identify no such error in the district court\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">At trial, plaintiffs attempted to introduce expert testimony by former New York City police officer Joseph Zogbi regarding police training and protocol. As explained in his report, Zogbi concluded that Officers Wilson and Furey did not act in accordance with standard police room clearing techniques when they arrived at the Callahan residence, and that the officers had not been properly trained with respect to \u201cbasic tactical movement and mindset.\u201d J.A. 156. The district court precluded , Zogbi from testifying as to plaintiffs\u2019 excessive force claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">We conclude that this decision was not an abuse of discretion.- As we have explained, a district court'has \u201cbroad discretion\u201d to carry out its \u201cgatekeeping function\u201d with respect to expert testimony, which involves ensuring that the proffered testimony \u201cis relevant to the task at hand,\u201d <em>In re Pfizer Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>819 F.3d 642, 658 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Zogbi\u2019s expert report focused on whether Officer Wilson\u2019s training was adequate and what a properly trained officer would or would not have done in a similar situation. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 arguments, the district court acted -within its discretion in concluding that these opinions are not relevant to Wilson\u2019s liability on the excessive force claim, as the type of training that Wilson received does not shed light, on the dispositive, question here\u2014-whether Wilson had probable cause to believe that Callahan posed a significant threat to his safety. Nor are Zogbi\u2019s opinions about police training relevant to Wilson\u2019s credibility in recounting what happened in the Callahan basement that afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\"> Moreover, expert testimony is not admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 if it \u201cusurp[s] ... the role of the jury in applying th[e] law to the facts before it,\u201d as such testimony \u201cundertakes to tell the jury what result to reach, and thus attempts to substitute the expert\u2019s judgment for the jury\u2019s.\u201d <em>Nimely v.

In this case, Zogbi\u2019s suggestions that Officer Wilson did not act reasonably under the circumstances intrude on the jury\u2019s exclusive role as the finder of facts. The district court therefore acted within its discretion in .precluding Zogbi from testifying with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 excessive force claim against Officer Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">Regarding Officer Wilson\u2019s prior discharges of his weapon; plaintiffs sought to introduce evidence -that' Wilson had twice fired his pistol at dogs that he perceived to be threatening him while he was on duty.

Lombardozzi, </em>491 F.3d 61, 78 (2d Cir. 2007), and argue that the evidence should have been admitted to show Officer Wilson\u2019s mental state when he fired at Callahan and to discredit Wilson\u2019s testimony that he perceived the situation to be dangerous. Even if this evidence was offered for a proper non-propensity purpose\u2014an issue that we need not and do not reach\u2014the district court was nevertheless entitled to conclude that the prejudicial effect of the evidence substantially outweighed its limited probative value. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>677 F.3d 72, 79, 83-85 (2d Cir. 2012). It was therefore not an abuse of discretion for the court to conclude that the evidence was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">In sum, on the record of this trial, the district court acted within its discretion in excluding Zogbi\u2019s expert testimony and the evidence concerning Officer Wilson\u2019s prior weapons discharges. Although we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion here, we note that any retrial may present different circumstances that lead to different conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The instructions given to the jury in this case regarding the lawfulness of Officer Wilson\u2019s use of force against Kevin Callahan misstated the law of our Circuit as articulated in <em>Rasanen, </em>723 F.3d at 333-38, and we cannot say that this error was harmless. We therefore VACATE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-13\">. At the time, Kevin Callahan was twenty-six years old.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b172-8\">. Kevin Callahan's claim under Section 1983 survived his death for the benefit of his estate, and is brought by his brother, Christopher, the administrator of his estate. <em>See Barrett v. United States, </em>689 F.2d 324, 331 (2d Cir. 1982), Christopher Callahan and Patricia Callahan were named as plaintiffs for additional claims not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b172-10\">. The trial also included an Eighth Amendment claim against Suffolk County Police Sergeant Scott Greene for deliberate indifference to the medical needs of Kevin Callahan after the shooting. The district court bifurcated the trial of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, such that the excessive force and deliberate indifference claims were tried together in the first phase, after which a second trial would address <em>Monell </em>liability of Suffolk County and other related claims if necessary. The first trial also originally included false arrest claims, but plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed those claims after their case-in-chief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b172-15\">. The jury also returned a defense verdict on the deliberate indifference claim against Sergeant Greene, which pl\u00e1intiffs have not challenged here. Defendants raised a qualified immunity defense as to both the excessive force and deliberate indifference claims as part of their oral Rule 50 motion, which the district court denied in its entirety. Qualified . immunity was not. otherwise litigated at trial, and defendants have not raised it on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b172-17\">. Although the jury\u2019s verdict addressed plaintiffs' claims against only Wilson and Greene, it appears that the district court entered judgment in favor of all defendants. The record is not entirely clear, but it appears the district court concluded that the defense verdict in the first phase of the bifurcated trial necessarily defeated plaintiffs' remaining claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b173-8\">. We acknowledge that, when faced with the question we previously addressed in <em>Rasanen, </em>other Circuits have reached different, and sometimes opposite, conclusions. <em>See Johnson v. City of Phila., </em>837 F.3d 343, 349 (3d Cir. 2016); <em>Noel </em>v. <em>Artson, </em>641 F.3d 580, 587 (4th Cir. 2011); <em>Penley v.

Unlike <em>Rasanen, </em>which considered the excessive force charge under plain-error review because no clear objection was made to that portion of the charge, <em>see </em>723 F.3d at 333, plaintiffs here clearly preserved their objection. <em>See </em>J.A. 565-67.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b174-16\">. <em>See, e.g., Terranova v.

The dissent understates the prominence of this manual provision in <em>Rasanen </em>by characterizing it as one piece of evidence among many in the trial record. <em>See </em>Dissenting Op., <em>post </em>at 156. To the contrary, <em>Rasanen </em>explained that the deadly force provision played a more important role at the trial in that case: the district court instructed the jury that certain manual provisions, including the deadly force provision, \u201capply to the case,\u201d and the jury indicated that it was specifically considering that provision during its deliberations. 723 F.3d at 336-37 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b176-7\">. That the parties referred to probable cause during their summations does not, as the dissent suggests, render the error here harmless, <em>See </em>Dissenting Op., <em>post </em>at 156-58, The parties various arguments did not cure the instructional error described above, especially in light of the court\u2019s instructions that the jury was required to follow the law as articulated by the court, not the lawyers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\">. Because the trial was bifurcated, the district court ruled that Zogbi would be permitted to testify in the second phase of the proceedings as to plaintiffs\u2019 municipal liability claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b178-9\">REENA RAGGI, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Apm\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">I concur in so much of the panel decision as concludes that the district court acted within its discretion in excluding testimony regarding police protocols and prior instances in which Officer Wilson feed his weapon. <em>See </em>Majority Op., <em>ante </em>at 152-54. I respectfully dissent, however, from that part of the decision identifying reversible charging error in reliance on <em>Rasanen v. Doe, </em>723 F.3d 325 (2d Cir. 2013). <em>See </em>Majority Op., <em>ante </em>at 148-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">At the outset, I recognize that this panel is bound by Rasanen\u2019s holding that in a civil action against a police officer for the unconstitutional use of deadly force, a district court cannot charge a jury that the standard for assessing the officer\u2019s use of such force is simply \u201creasonableness.\u201d Rather, the court must charge that the constitutional use of deadly force requires the officer to have had probable cause to believe that the person killed posed a significant threat of death or serious injury to the officer or to others. <em>See Rasanen v. Doe, </em>723 F.3d at 334, 337; <em>see generally Harper v. Ercole, </em>648 F.3d 132, 140 (2d Cir. 2011) (stating that panel is bound by prior decisions of court unless reversed <em>en banc </em>or by Supreme Court). I, therefore, do not repeat here my reasons for dissenting in <em>Rasanen. See Rasanen v. Doe, </em>723 F.3d at 338-46 (Raggi, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">I note only that <em>Rasanen </em>continues to set this court apart from our sister circuits, which construe the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007), to \u201cabrogate\u201d the use of any special standards for deciding when the use of deadly force is constitutionally excessive and to \u201creinstate[] \u2018reasonableness\u2019 as the ultimate\u2014and only\u2014inquiry.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Johnson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>City of Philadelphia, </em>837 F.3d 343, 349 (3d Cir. 2016); <em>see Acosta v. Hill, </em>504 F.3d 1323, 1324 (9th Cir. 2007) <em>(\u201cScott </em>held that there is no special Fourth Amendment standard for unconstitutional deadly force. Instead, all that matters is whether [police] actions were <em>reasonable.\u201d </em>(emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also Noel v. Artson, </em>641 F.3d 580, 587 (4th Cir. 2011) (rejecting argument for special charge on use of deadly force where district court \u201csubmitted the case to the jury under the general rubric of reasonableness\u201d because <em>\u201call </em>claims that law enforcement officers have used excessive force ... should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment and its \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard\u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>Penley v. Eslinger, </em>605 F.3d 843, 849-50 (11th Cir. 2010) (holding that \u201cFourth Amendment\u2019s \u2018objective reasonableness\u2019 standard supplies the test to determine whether the use of force was excessive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Moreover, since <em>Rasanen, </em>the Supreme Court has reiterated that the \u201csettled and <em>exclusive </em>framework\u201d for analyzing claims of excessive force is \u201creasonableness.\u201d <em>County of Los Angeles v. Mendez, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 1539, 1546, 198 L.Ed.2d 52 (2017) (emphasis added) (rejecting Ninth Circuit rule that otherwise reasonable defensive use of force is unreasonable as a matter of law where officers provoked violence to which they then responded with deadly force); <em>see Plumhoff v. Rickard, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 2012, 2020, 188 L.Ed.2d 1056 (2014) (\u201cA claim that law-enforcement officers used excessive [deadly] force to effect a seizure is governed by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard.\u201d). Insofar as neither <em>Mendez </em>nor <em>Plumhoff </em>spoke to the issue of how juries should be charged in excessive force cases, the majority concludes that they do not overrule <em>Rasanen. See </em>Majority Op., <em>ante </em>at 149-50. But neither did <em>Tennessee v. Garner, </em>471 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985), or <em>O\u2019Bert ex rel. O\u2019Bert v. Vargo, </em>331 F.3d 29 (2d Cir. 2003)\u2014the cases on which <em>Rasanen </em>relied to identify a probable-cause charging requirement\u2014 speak to jury charges. Indeed, <em>Gamer </em>arose in the context of a bench trial, and the issue in <em>O\u2019Bert </em>was the denial of summary judgment to a defendant who invoked qualified immunity to avoid trial. <em>See Rasanen v. Doe, </em>723 F.3d at 340 (Raggi, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">I do not pursue the matter further, however, because even following <em>Rasanen\u2019s, </em>holding, as this panel must, I would not identify charging error in this case. The jury instructions on the reasonable use of deadly force in <em>Rasanen </em>failed to make <em>any </em>mention of a need for probable cause to believe that the suspect posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury. <em>See id. </em>at 330-31 (majority opinion). By contrast, the district court here cited such probable cause as the <em>only </em>example of when an officer might permissibly use deadly force:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-13\">A police officer is entitled to use reasonable force. A police officer is not entitled to use any force beyond what is necessary to accomplish a lawful purpose. Reasonable force may include the use of deadly force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-14\">A police officer <em>may use deadly force against a person if a police officer has probable cause to believe that the person </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others. </em>:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">App\u2019x 605 (emphasis added). The majority nevertheless concludes that this charge is constitutionally inadequate because the jury could have construed \u201cmay,\u201d in the italicized text, as merely illustrative and, therefore, thought that deadly force might also\u2019 be - \u201creasonable\u201d' in other circumstances where the cited probable cause was lacking. <em>See </em>Majority Op., <em>ante </em>at 150-52. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The context in which the probable cause instruction was given indicates that the word \u201cmay\u201d was used to convey legal authorization rather than mere illustration. <em>See, e.g., </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1068 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \u201cmay\u201d as \u201c[t]o be permitted to\u201d); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged) 1396 (1986 ed.) (defining \u201cmay\u201d as to \u201chave power,\u201d or \u201cbe able\u201d and to \u201chave permission to\u201d). Thus, when the two quoted paragraphs were heard together, a reasonable jury would understand that (1) it can sometimes be \u201creasonable\u201d for an\" officer to use deadly force, and (2) when such force may be used, <em>ie., </em>when it is constitutionally authorized, is when the officer has \u201cprobable cause to believe that the person poses a significant-threat of death or serious physical injury.\u201d App\u2019x 605.,.This was sufficient to avoid the prejudicial .error identified in <em>Rasanen, ie., </em>the district court\u2019s failure in that case \u201cto instruct the jury with regard to the justifications for the use of deadly force articulated in <em>O\u2019Bert </em>and <em>Garner.\u201d Rasanen v. Doe, </em>723 F.3d at 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Nor do I think a different conclusion is compelled by <em>Rasanen\u2019s </em>determination that the instruction\u2019s omission in that case was not rectified by inclusion' in the record of a police manual provision advising officers that\u2018they \u201cmay use deadly physical force against another person when they reasonably believe it to be necessary to defend\u201d themselves or others \u201cfrom the use or imminent use of deadly physical force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336 (quoting N.Y. State Police Admin. Manual \u00a7 16B1(A)); <em>see id. </em>at 337 (observing that manual\u2019s language was not framed in \u201cexclusive and restrictive terms\u201d). As <em>Rasanen </em>itself concluded, a jury\u2019s opportunity to consider a manual provision that is in evidence is not the same as receiving an instruction from the court. <em>See id. </em>at 337 (noting that manual provisions were of little relevance in any event; as they could \u201cnot substitute for an instruction\u201d to the jury).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">More to the point, whatever a jury could have inferred from these manual provisions in <em>Rasanen, </em>where the district court provided no instructions as to the probable cause required to use deadly force, a similar concern is not warranted here. Not only did the district court follow its general reasonableness charge with the specific instruction that an officer may use deadly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>force when he has the probable cause to believe that a person poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to him or others, but also, that was the only justification for the use of deadly force that was identified' for the jury. The district court\u2019s charge did not suggest, and the parties did not argue, the existence of any other circumstances in which deadly force might reasonably be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Indeed, even if there was charging error in the district court\u2019s failure to employ \u201conly if\u2019 language respecting such probable cause, I would think that error harmless beyond a reasonable .doubt in this case because the parties\u2019 singular focus at trial and on summation was the presence or absence of probable cause for Officer Wilson to believe that the deceased Callahan posed a significant threat to the officer\u2019s life at the time he used deadly force.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel told the jury that he did not even dispute that Officer Wilson held a \u201csubjective\u201d fear for his life when he discharged his firearm, thereby killing Callahan. App\u2019x 573. Counsel argued only that the circumstances failed\u2014\u201cobjectively\u201d\u2014 to demonstrate probable cause for that fear. <em>Id.; see Dancy v. McGinley, </em>843 F.3d 93, 116 (2d Cir. 2016) (observing that \u201cSupreme Court [has] made clear\u201d that standard for assessing propriety of officer\u2019s use of force is \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d). Repeatedly, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel emphasized that Wilson could not lawfully \u201cuse deadly physical force, firing a gun, unless there\u2019s probable cause to believe that his life is at risk, somebody else is going to use deadly force against. him, or that somebody is going to cause serious physical injury to him or somebody else.\u201d App\u2019x 576; see <em>id. </em>at 580 (\u201cThe law says ... you\u2019re to rule for the plaintiff, ... unless there\u2019s probable cause, reasonably, objectively, probable cause to believe that [the officer\u2019s] life was in danger or that someone else was in danger, and that\u2019s clearly not the case here, clearly not the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The defense, in its summation, neither objected to these statements of the applicable legal standard nor argued otherwise. To the contrary, defense counsel embraced the probable cause standard, telling the jury that his summation would \u201cdiscuss with you how the evidence has shown that on that day in September 2011, Tom Wilson had probable cause to believe that he was facing a significant threat of death or serious injury and ... that it was reasonable and necessary to use deadly force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584. Counsel then argued how discrete evidence satisfied that standard. He maintained that (1) the call reporting a dispute involving \u201ca man with a gun\u201d at Callahan\u2019s home, (2) the officers\u2019 observation of a cleaver in plain view in the home, and (3) the officers\u2019 failure to receive a response upon announcing their presence in the home objectively supported Officer Wilson\u2019s belief of \u201ca real and present threat of danger ... that there may be a person there that had a gun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585. Counsel further argued that when Callahan slammed a bedroom door' on Officer Wilson, \u201cpinning him with his gun inside that room,\u201d the officer \u201cwas facing a real fear that the person behind that door could get his weapon and use it against him or, more significantly, was armed himself and was going to shoot [the officer] through that door.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 586. Thus, he maintained, the officer confronted \u201ca significant threat of death,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 594, that put him \u201cin fear of a real threat of death,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 595. Moreover, in response to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Officer Wilson\u2019s real subjective fear of risk to his life did not equate to objective probable cause to hold such a fear, defense counsel argued that \u201c[a]ny other officer would have faced that same threat and would have had that\u2019 same reasonable fear.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>It was for the jury to decide how persuasive counsel were in arguing that the evidence did or did not establish probable cause, but the cited record convincingly demonstrates that the singular issue in dispute was whether such probable cause existed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">That distinguishes this case from <em>Ra-sanen. </em>There, the jury \u201cdid not know, because it was not told,\u201d to frame the reasonableness of the officer\u2019s actions in terms of probable cause. <em>Rasanen v. Doe, </em>723 F.3d at 336. Here, the jury was so told, both by the court and by counsel. After generally charging the jury that the use of deadly force could be reasonable, the district court cited a single circumstance in which such a conclusion would be warranted: when an officer had probable cause to fear a risk to life or serious physical injury. Meanwhile, counsel for both parties, in summation, told the jury that the determinative issue in the case was whether the officer had probable cause to believe that he was facing a significant threat of death or serious injury. On this record, I identify no charging error. But even if I were to do so, I would find the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because I think that on the charge given and the arguments made, the verdict can only have been based on the jury\u2019s finding that, when Officer Wilson shot Callahan, the officer had,probable cause to believe that Callahan posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Accordingly, I vote to affirm the judgment'in favor of defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\">.
