The defendants\u2014the school, the church, and the archdiocese\u2014moved for summary judgment on the ground that these claims are barred\" by the \u201cministerial exception,\u201d a doctrine that precludes, on First Amendment grounds, employment-discrimination claims by \u201cministers\u201d against the religious organizations that employ or formerly employed'them. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Cathy Seibel, <em>Judge) </em>awarded the defendants summary judgment on that basis, The sole question on appeal is whether Fratello is a \u201cminister\u201d within the meaning of the exception, a conclusion that would preclude her employment-discrimination claims against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Although we have previously recognized a ministerial exception for employment-discrimination claims, this is our first occasion to address the doctrine since the Supreme Court\u2019s unanimous decision in <em>Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church &amp; School v. EEOC, </em>565 U.S. 171, 188, 132 S.Ct. 694, 181 L.Ed.2d 650 (2012) (recognizing a ministerial exception for employment-discrimination claims). In light of that decision, we conclude that, in determining whether the ministerial exception bars an employment-discrimination claim against a religious organization, the only question is whether the employee qualifies as a \u201cminister\u201d within the meaning of the exception. <em>See </em>id. at 190-91, 132 S.Ct. 694. In this regard, <em>Hosanna-Tabor </em>instructs us to assess a broad array of relevant \u201cconsiderations,\u201d including' but not limited to (1) the employee\u2019s \u201cformal title,\u201d (2) \u201cthe substance reflected in that title,\u201d (3) the employee\u2019s \u201cuse of th[e] title,\u201d and (4) \u201cthe important religious functions she performed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 132 S.Ct. 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Applying these principles here, we conclude that the ministerial exception' bars Fratello\u2019s employment-discrimination claims because in her role as principal she was a minister within the meaning of the exception. Although her formal title was not inherently religious, we think that the record clearly establishes that she held herself out as a spiritual leader of the school, and that she performed many significant religious functions to advance its religious mission. She was thus a \u201cminister\u201d for purposes of the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Fratello was employed by St. Anthony\u2019s School (the \u201cSchool\u201d), a Roman Catholic elementary school located in Nanuet, New York. She served as the School\u2019s principal from 2007 until 2011, when the School declined to renew her contract. She claims employment discrimination by the School, St. Anthony\u2019s Shrine Church (the \u201cChurch\u201d), and the Archdiocese of New York (the \u201cArchdiocese\u201d), alleging that her employment was terminated on the basis of gender discrimination and in retaliation for her reporting the alleged discrimination, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and New York State Executive Law \u00a7 296. The defendants argue as an affirmative defense that the ministerial exception bars these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">\n<em>A.

After finding that it could not determine whether the ministerial exception applied to Fratello\u2019s claims on a motion to dismiss, the district court appropriately ordered discovery limited to whether Fratello was a minister within the meaning of the exception. At the close of that limited discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment: The defendants sought summary judgment on all of Fratello\u2019s claims based on the ministerial exception, an affirmative defense; Fratello sought summary judgment striking that defense on the ground that she was not a minister within the meaning of the exception. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion and awarded them summary judgment by opinion and order dated March 29, 2016. <em>Fratello v.

Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">We review a district court\u2019s award of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>\u201cconstruing] the evidence in the light most favorable to the [losing party]\u201d and \u201cdrawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all ambiguities in [its] favor.\u201d <em>Darnell v. Pineiro, </em>849 F.3d 17, 22 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe affirm ... only where \u2019there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">II. The Ministerial Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">The ministerial exception bars employment-discrimination claims brought by ministers against the religious groups that employ or formerly employed them. <em>See Hosanna-Tabor, </em>565 U.S. at 196, 132 S.Ct. 694 (\u201cWhen a minister who has been fired sues her church alleging that her termination was discriminatory, ... [t]he church must be free to choose those who will guide it on its way.\u201d). This doctrine addresses a tension between two core values underlying much of our constitutional doctrine and federal law: equal protection and religious liberty. Laws that prohibit various kinds of employment discrimination are intended to give effect to the equality principle. As such, they are, as the Chief Justice writing for the <em>Hosanna-Tabor </em>Court stated, \u201cundoubtedly important\u201d to \u201csociety.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">The First Amendment\u2019s religion clauses are also of fundamental importance. Amongst other things, they have since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>their inception been understood to ensure the separation of church and state.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S. Const. amend. I (prohibiting any \u201claw respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In the context of employment disputes, these two core values sometimes conflict, and a balance must be struck. <em>Hosanna-Tabor </em>instructs that where a defendant is able to establish that the ministerial exception applies, <em>see Hosanna-Tabor, </em>565 U.S. at 195 n.4, 132 S.Ct. 694 (explaining that the ministerial exception is an affirmative defense), the \u201cFirst Amendment has struck the balance for us\u201d in favor of religious liberty, <em>id. </em>at 196, 132 S.Ct. 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\"><em>A. Historical </em>Underpinnings<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">As the Chief Justice explained on behalf of the Court in <em>Hosanna-Tabor, </em>the ministerial exception\u2019s historical roots extend to the founding generation, which adopted the First Amendment \u201cagainst th[e] background\u201d of \u201clife under the established Church of England.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 132 S.Ct. 694. Under English law, \u201cthe monarch [was] the supreme head of the Church of England\u201d with authority over its clergy, and the Parliament \u201cset forth the doctrinal tenets of the Church\u201d and \u201cprescribed the liturgy for religious worship.\u201d Michael W. McConnell, <em>Establishment and Disestablishment at the Founding, Part I: Establishment of Religion, </em>44 Wm. <em>&amp; </em>Mary L. Rev. 2105, 2112-13 (2003). Significantly, \u201cministers [were required] to conform to these requirements, making the Church of England the sole institution for lawful public worship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2113.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">\u201cSeeking to escape the control of the national church, the Puritans fled to New England, where they hoped to elect their own ministers and establish their own modes of worship.\u201d <em>Hosanna-Tabor, </em>565 U.S. at 182, 132 S.Ct. 694. Quakers \u201csought independence\u201d in Pennsylvania and Delaware. <em>Id. </em>at 183, 132 S.Ct. 694. Even Southern colonists, who \u201cbrought the Church of England with them[,] ... sometimes chafed at the control exercised by the Crown,\u201d particularly when \u201c[controversies over the selection of ministers ... arose in ...

Lund, <em>In Defense of the Ministerial Exception, </em>90 N.C. L. Rev. 1, 20-21 (2011) (reviewing earlier eases). More than forty years ago, the Fifth Circuit held that the First Amendment requires that a ministerial exception be applied to Title VII claims.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>See McClure v. Salvation Army, </em>460 F.2d 553, 555 (5th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 896, 93 S.Ct. 132, 34 L.Ed.2d 153 (1972) (reasoning that \u201c[m]at-ters touching\u201d \u201c[t]he relationship between an organized church and its ministers .,. must necessarily be recognized as of prime ecclesiastical concern\u201d because a church\u2019s \u201cminister is the chief instrument by which [it} seeks to fulfill its purpose\u201d). Over the next several decades, we and every other Circuit to address the issue<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>that the First Amendment requires a ministerial exception. <em>See Rweyemamu v. Cote, </em>520 F.3d 198, 204-09 (2d Cir. 2008). Then, in <em>Hosanna-Tabor, </em>the Supreme Court \u201cagree[d]\u201d with the Courts of Appeals that there is \u201ca \u2019ministerial exception,\u2019 . grounded in' the First Amendment, that precludes application of [employment-discrimination] legislation to claims concerning the employment relationship between a religious institution and its ministers.\u201d <em>Hosanna-Tabor, </em>565 U.S. at 188, 132 S.Ct. 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">As the Court explained, because \u201c[t]he members of a religious group put their faith in the hands of their ministers,\u201d it would \u201cintrude[ ] upon more than a mere employment decision\u201d to \u201c[r]equir[e] a church to accept or retain an unwanted minister, or [to] punish[] a church for failing to do <em>so,\u201d Id. </em>Either action would \u201cinterefere[ ] with the internal governance of the church, depriving [it] of control over selection of those who will personify its beliefs,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> in violation of both religion clauses: \u201cBy imposing an unwanted minister, the state [would] infringen the Free Exercise- Clause, which protects a religious group\u2019s right to shape its own faith and mission through its appointments,\u201d and by \u201cdetermining] which individuals will minister to the faithful,\u201d the state would \u201calso violate[ ] the Establishment Clause, which prohibits government involvement in such ecclesiastical decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188-89, 132 S.Ct. 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\"><em>B. Effect of </em>Hosanna-Tabor</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">This is our first occasion to address the scope of the ministerial exception and apply it to a specific case with the benefit of <em>Hosanna-Tabor.</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Before that decision, as noted above, we \u201cformally adopt[ed] the ministerial exception\u201d in <em>Rweyemamu, </em>520 F.3d at 207. That appeal involved a Catholic priest\u2019s Title VII racial-discrimination claim against his former Diocese and Bishop, \u201c[a]lleging that [they] ... misapplied canon law in denying him a requested promotion and, ultimately, in terminating him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199. Addressing whether the ministerial exception barred his claims, we explained that the First Amendment required consideration of both the \u201c\u2019function\u2019 of an employee, rather than his title or the fact of his ordination,\u201d and also \u201cthe type of claim asserted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208. We explained that while \u201ca lay employee\u2019s relationship to his employer may be so pervasively religious that judicial interference in the form of a discrimination inquiry could run afoul of the Constitution,\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> an employee of any rank \u201cin the church hierarchy ... alleging particular wrongs by the church that are wholly non-religious in nature\u201d\u2014 including, for example, certain common-law tort claims\u2014\u201cis surely not forbidden his day in court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">We concluded, though, that the particular facts of the case before us did not require us then to \u201cattempt to delineate the boundaries of the ministerial exception\u201d because the plaintiffs \u201cTitle VII claim easily f[ell] within them\u201d insofar as he was \u201can ordained priest of the Roman Catholic Church,\u201d whose \u201cduties [were] determined by Catholic doctrine and ... drawn into question in [the] case\u201d such that \u201cimpermissible entanglement with religious doctrine\u201d was unavoidable. <em>Id. </em>at 209. Indeed, \u201cin order to prevail on his Title VII claim, he [would have had to] argue that the decision of the [religious authorities] was not only erroneous, but also pretextual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We therefore held that his \u201cclaim fail[ed] at its inception\u201d \u201c[b]ecause Title VII [was] unconstitutional as applied in th[at] case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Our decision in <em>Rweyemamu </em>made clear that the question whether an employee was a minister within the meaning of the exception turned principally on the employee\u2019s job functions, and that where such employees were found to be ministers, they were barred from bringing Title VII claims against their religious employers when their claims would \u201cinexorably entangle [the court] in doctrinal disputes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208. But the decision seemed (at least to some district courts in this Circuit) to leave open the possibility that some employment-discrimination claims by ministers might not be barred if excessive entanglement could be avoided in the particular case. <em>See, e.g., Rojas v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester, </em>557 F.Supp.2d 387, 398 n.8 (W.D.N.Y. 2008) (\u201cinterpret[ing] th[e] holding [of <em>Rweye-mamu] </em>to mean that, in this Circuit, the ministerial exception does not necessarily apply to claims involving the hiring or firing of a minister, unless the hiring or firing involves issues of a religion\u201d); <em>Redhead v. Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists, </em>566 F.Supp.2d 125, 132 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (concluding in light of <em>Rweyemamu </em>that \u201can examination not just of [the] plaintiffs function [was] required, but also of the nature of [her Title VII] claim\u201d to determine whether \u201cthe dispute in this case is such that its resolution inevitably will ... impermissibly entangl[e] the court in matters of religious doctrine\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">In <em>Hosanna-Tabor, </em>however, the Supreme Court made clear that those properly characterized as \u201cministers\u201d are flatly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>barred from bringing employment-discrimination claims against the religious groups that employ or formerly employed them. <em>See Hosanna-Tabor, </em>565 U.S. at 194, 132 S.Ct. 694. As the Supreme Court explained, the ministerial exception\u2019s purpose \u2022 \u201cis not to safeguard a church\u2019s decision to fire a minister only when it is made for a religious reason,\u201d but to \u201censure! ] that the authority to select and control who will minister to the faithful\u2014a matter strictly ecclesiastical\u2014is the church\u2019s alone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194-95, 132 S.Ct. 694 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Armed only with the law as written and the tools of judicial reasoning, courts are ill-equipped to assess whether, and to what extent, an employment dispute between a minister and his or her religious group is premised on religious grounds. <em>See </em>Paul Horwitz, <em>Act III of the Ministerial Exception, </em>106 Nw. U. L. Rev. 973, 979 (2012) (asserting that <em>Hosanna-Tabor </em>\u201cconfirmed\u201d the principle that \u201cjudges cannot evaluate the kinds of religious questions that come up in employment discrimination cases involving ministerial employees\u201d because they \u201care simply incompetent to address them\u201d). Judges are not well positioned to determine whether ministerial employment decisions rest on practical and secular considerations or fundamentally different ones that may lead to results that, though perhaps difficult for a person not intimately familiar with the religion to understand, are perfectly sensible\u2014and perhaps even necessary\u2014in the eyes of the faithful. In the Abrahamic religious traditions, for instance, a stammering Moses was chosen to lead the people, and a scrawny David to slay a giant.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The notion of judicial incompetence with respect to strictly ecclesiastical matters can be traced at least as far back as James Madison, \u201cthe leading architect of the religious clauses of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Ariz. Christian Sch. Tuition Org. v. Winn, </em>563 U.S. 125, 141, 131 S.Ct. 1436, 179 L.Ed.2d 523 (2011) (quoting <em>Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 103, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968) (internal quotation marks omitted)). He argued against a proposed tax bill in Virginia to aid Christian religious teachers because, among other things, the proposed legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkZ\">implie[d] either that the Civil Magistrate is a competent Judge of Religious truth; or that he may employ Religion as an engine of Civil policy. The first is an arrogant pretension falsified by the contradictory opinions of Rulers in all ages, and throughout the world!;] [t]he second an unhallowed perversion of the means of salvation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-9\"><em>Walz v. Tax Comm\u2019n of N.Y., </em>397 U.S. 664, 722, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970) (Douglas, J., dissenting) (quoting James Madison, <em>Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, 2 </em>The Writings of James Madison 183-91 (G. Hunt ed., 1901)); <em>see also Ariz. Christian Sch. Tuition Org., </em>563 U.S. at 162-68, 131 S.Ct. 1436 (Kagan, J., dissenting) (providing historical context for Madison\u2019s argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">In light of these concerns, the Supreme Court in <em>Hosanna-Tabor </em>made clear that the First Amendment does not tolerate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>judicial remedy for any minister claiming employment discrimination against his or her religious group, regardless of the group\u2019s asserted reason (if any) for the adverse, employment action. <em>See Hosanna-Tabor, 565 </em>U.S. at 194, 132 S.Ct. 694 (explaining that with respect to ministers, the First, Amendment bars an order of reinstatement, which would \u201crequire[ ] the Church to accept a minister it did not want,\u201d and damages, which \u201cwould operate as a penalty on the Church for terminating an unwanted minister\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Therefore, whether the ministerial exception bars employment-discrimination claims against a religious organization depends entirely on whether the employee qualifies as a \u201cminister\u201d within the meaning of the exception. <em>See id. </em>at 190-91, 132 S.Ct. 694.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But that is hardly a question that admits of an easy or mechanical method for deriving an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Indeed, the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Hosanna-Tabor\u2014unanimous with two. concurring opinions subscribed to by three Justices\u2014is not without its Delphic qualities. The Chief Justice explained that the Court was \u201creluctant ... to adopt a rigid formula for deciding when an- employee qualifies as a minister. It [was] enough for [it] to conclude, in [its] first case involving the ministerial exception, that the exception covers [the teacher-plaintiff in that case], given all the circumstances of her employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190, 132 S.Ct. 694. The Court then identified various factors it considered in making that judgment with respect to a former fourth-grade teacher of a church-run Missouri Synod Lutheran school: \u201cIn light of these considerations\u2014 [1] the formal title given [to the teacher-plaintiff] by the Church, [2] the substance reflected in that title, [3] her own use of that title,, and [4] the important religious functions she performed for the Church\u2014 we conclude that [she] was a minister covered by the ministerial exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 132 S.Ct. 694.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Thus, <em>Hosanna-Tabor </em>instructs only as to what we <em>might </em>take into account as relevant, including the four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>considerations on which it relied; it'neither limits the inquiry to those considerations nor requires their application in every case. . . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">We thus set forth on our journey with only limited direction from the Supreme Court\u2019s controlling opinion in <em>Hosanna-Tabor. </em>But in finding our way, as will appear, we receive and accept substantial further guidance from the concurrence of Justice Alito, in which Justice Kagan joined. <em>See id. </em>at 198-206, 132 S.Ct. 694 (Alito, J., concurring). We refer to it frequently below not because we are bound to follow it\u2014of course we are not\u2014but because we find its analysis both persuasive and extremely helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Justice Alito pointed out that a formal title indicating that the plaintiff is playing a religious role, though often relevant, \u201cis neither necessary nor sufficient,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 202, 132 S.Ct. 694 (Alito, J., concurring), and that \u201ccourts should focus on the function performed by persons who work for religious bodies,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 198, 132 S.Ct. 694 (Alito, J., concurring). Although each of the four considerations cited in the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion were in that case relevant, Justice Alito explained, \u201cit would be a mistake if the term \u2019minister\u2019 or the. concept of ordination were viewed as central to the important issue of religious autonomy that is presented in\u201d ministerial-exception cases. <em>Id. </em>(Alito, J., concurring); <em>see also Rweyemamu, </em>520 F.3d at 206 (\u201cnot[ing] that the term \u2019ministerial exception\u2019 is judicial shorthand ... [that] is imprecise\u201d because the exception covers \u201cmore than just \u2019ministers\u2019\u201d). \u201c[M]ost faiths do not employ the term \u2019minister,\u2019 and some eschew the concept of formal ordination\u201d; other \u201cfaiths consider the ministry to consist of all or a very large percentage of their members.\u201d <em>Hosanna-Tabor, </em>565 U.S. at 202, 132 S.Ct. 694 (Alito, J., concurring). .</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">We agree. Where, as here, the four considerations are relevant in a particular case, \u201ccourts should focus\u201d primarily \u201con the function^] performed by persons who work for religious bodies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 132 S.Ct. 694 (Alito, J., concurring); <em>see also Cannata v. Catholic Diocese of Austin, </em>700 F.3d 169, 177 (5th Cir. 2012) (applying the ministerial exception to a church music director, noting that \u201cit [was] enough ... that ... [he] played an integral role in the celebration of Mass and that by playing the piano during services, [he] furthered the mission of the church and helped convey its. message\u201d); <em>Temple Emanuel of Newton v.

Application</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Applying these principles here, we conclude that the ministerial exception bars Fratello\u2019s employment-discrimination claims against the Archdiocese, the Church, and the School, all of which are religious groups within the meaning of the ministerial exception. Although her formal title\u2014\u201clay principal\u201d\u2014does not connote a religious role, the record makes clear that she served many religious functions to advance the School\u2019s Roman Catholic mission.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In so concluding, though, we do not accept the defendants\u2019 argument that all parochial-school principals should be presumed to be ministers within the meaning of the exception. We think that any such categorical presumption runs counter to the teaching of <em>Hosanna-Tabor, </em>in which the Supreme Court looked to the specific circumstances of the plaintiffs employment to determine whether she was a minister. <em>See Hosanna-Tabor, </em>565 U.S. at 190-92, 132 S.Ct. 694 (refusing \u201cto adopt a rigid formula\u201d and considering \u201call the circumstances\u201d of the plaintiffs employment). Although parochial-school principals may typically qualify as \u201cministers\u201d within the meaning of the exception, <em>see, e.g., Dayner v. Archdiocese of Hartford, </em>301 Conn. 759, 779, 23 A.3d 1192, 1205 (2011) (determining that \u201cthe plaintiffs duties as a Catholic school principal render her a ministerial employee\u201d), some may perform few such religious functions\u2014some, perhaps, none at all. In each case, therefore, we must assess the specific circumstances of employment. We do so here in light of the four considerations articulated in <em>Hosanna-Tabor, </em>565 U.S. at 192, 132 S.Ct. 694, on which the district court relied, <em>see Fratello, </em>175 F.Supp.3d at 165-68, because they are adequate to resolve the particular circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-15\">\n<em>A. Formal Title</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-16\">We first conclude that the employee\u2019s \u201cformal title,\u201d <em>Hosanna-Tabor, </em>565 U.S. at 192, 132 S.Ct. 694, weighs against application of the ministerial exception because Fratello\u2019s title, \u201clay principal,\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> does not suggest that she was in effect a member of the clergy or that she performed religious functions on behalf of the School. The teacher-plaintiff in <em>Hosanna-Tabor, </em>by contrast, was a \u201ccalled\u201d teacher, as distinct from a \u201clay\u201d teacher. <em>Id. </em>at 177, 132 S.Ct. 694 (explaining that \u201c[t]he Synod classif\u00ede[d] teachers into two categories: \u2018called\u2019 and \u2018lay\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 191, 132 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>694 (noting that the teacher-plaintiffs formal title was \u201cMinister of Religion, Commissioned\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Fratello would end the analysis here. She contends that the use of the title \u201clay principal\u201d\u2014rather than \u201creligious principal\u201d\u2014reflects a clear distinction between laity and clergy that precludes application of the ministerial exception.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In other words, she seems to suggest that the formal use of the term \u201clay\u201d eclipses any religious functions she may have performed in her position. This argument fails for at least two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">First, \u201ca title,\u201d though \u201csurely relevant,\u201d is not \u201cby itself\u2019 dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 193, 132 S.Ct. 694; <em>see also id. </em>at 202, 132 S.Ct. 694 (Alito, J., concurring) (noting that \u201ca [religious] title is neither necessary nor sufficient\u201d); Rwey<em>emamu, </em>520 F.3d at 206-07 (noting that the ministerial exception has been applied to a press secretary, Jewish nursing-home staff, and a music director). We cannot accept the notion that by doing n6 more than changing the title of an employee, a religious-group employer can change its employee\u2019s rights under the federal employment-discrimination laws. It cannot insulate itself from that sort of liability by bestowing hollow ministerial titles upon many or all of its employees. Nor would plainly secular titles (by themselves) prevent application of the ministerial exception. We think the substance of the employees\u2019 responsibilities in their positions is far more important.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Second, adopting Fratello\u2019s approach would in effect penalize religious groups for allowing laypersons to participate, in their ministries and thus create an incentive for religious organizations to bar laity from substantial \u201crole[s] in conveying the [organization\u2019s] message and carrying out its mission.\u201d <em>Hosanna-Tabor, </em>565 U.S. at 192, 132 S.Ct. 694. And it would in effect give preference to religious groups that have formal ordination processes over those that do not. <em>See id. </em>at 198, 202 &amp; n.3, 132 S.Ct. 694 (Alito, J., concurring) (noting that \u201cthe concept of ordination as understood by most Christian churches and by Judaism has no clear counterpart in some Christian denominations and some other religions,\u201d such as Islam, in which \u201cthere is no class or profession of ordained clergy\u201d because \u201cevery Muslim can perform the religious rites\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also Larson v. Valente, </em>456 U.S. 228, 244, 102 S.Ct. 1673, 72 L.Ed.2d 33 (1982) (\u201cThe clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Thus, contrary to Fratello\u2019s contention, we are confident that our analysis does not end because the formal title \u201clay principal\u201d does not connote that she was a minister.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">\n<em>B. Substance Ref\u00edected in the Title</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">We also consider in this case \u201cthe substance reflected in th[e formal] title.\u201d <em>Hosanna-Tabor, </em>565 U.S. at 192, 132 S.Ct. 694. Although a close question, we think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>this consideration cuts in favor , of applying the ministerial exception here.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">On the one hand, candidates applying for a \u201clay principal\u201d* position at the School are not required to meet any religious-education requirements. Indeed, Fratello\u2019s' academic credentials are in education, and she has no formal training in religion or theology. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 191, 132 S.Ct. 694 (explaining that that the teacher-plaintiffs commission as a \u201cMinister of Religion\u201d required \u201ceight college-level, courses in [religious] subjects\u201d and \u201celection by the congregation, which recognized God\u2019s call to her to teach\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">On the other hand, the record reflects that the School\u2019s principal must be a \u201cpracticing Catholic in union with Rome, with a commitment to the teachings of' the Church and to the development of [a] Christian spirit and a community of faith within [the] school.\u201d Manual \u00b6 328, at App\u2019x at 138. He or she should, at least in theory,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> \u201c[c]omplet[e] . Levels I and II of the Catechist Certification Program ... by the [end] of [his or her] fourth year of service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The principal must also \u201c[demonstrate proficiency\u201d in a number of religious areas: \u201c[e]mbody[ing] Christ-centered principles,\u201d \u201c[e]ncourag[ing] the spiritual growth ... of each and every' student,\u201d \u201c[e]xercis[ing] spiritual leadership to ensure a thriving Catholic school community,\u201d and exhibiting a \u201c[willingness to promote Catholic education.\u201d Job Summary and Qualifications, at App\u2019x at 243. These requirements help ensure that the principal is able to provide \u201cCatholic [[leadership\u201d to the School\u2019s faculty, students, and community. Manual \u00b6322, at App\u2019x at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Thus, although .according to the record a \u201clay principal\u201d is not strictly required to meet any formal religious-education requirements, the substance reflected in that title as used by the defendants and conveyed to the plaintiff entails proficiency in religious leadership, which we think is evidence in favor of applying the ministerial exception here.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">\n<em>a Fratello\u2019s Use of the Title</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">We also think that the employee\u2019s \u201cuse of th[e] title\u201d principal (\u201clay\u201d or otherwise), <em>Hosanna-Tabor, </em>565 U.S. at 192, 132 S.Ct. 694, weighs in favor of applying the ministerial exception here. Although Fratello did not accept a formal call to religious service, <em>cf. id. </em>at 192, 132 S.Ct. 694, the record discloses that she understood that she would be perceived as a religious leader. The Archdiocese describes acceptance of the principal position as \u201caccepting] the vocation apd challenge of leadership in Catholic education.\u201d Cover Letter from Edward Cardinal Egan (Dec. 2006), at App\u2019x at 110. And when Fratello was applying for the position of principal, she sent her references a recommendation form indicating that she was applying f\u00f3r an \u201cimportant leadership role\u201d with the Archdiocese. Reference Request, at App\u2019x at 190. Indeed, as principal, Fratello \u201cpersonified]\u201d the School\u2019s \u201cbeliefs,\u201d <em>Hosanna-Tabor, </em>565 U.S. at 188, 132 S.Ct. 694, inasmuch as she presented herself to the School community and the public as a spiritual leader. She led school prayers, conveyed religious messages in speeches and writings, and expressed the importance of Catholic prayer and spirituality in newsletters to parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">\n<em>D. Functions Performed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">In our view, the most important consideration in this case is whether, and to what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>extent, the plaintiff \u201cperformed\u201d \u201cimportant religious functions ... for [her religious organization].\u201d <em>Hosanna-Tabor, </em>565 U.S. at 192, 132 S.Ct. 694. We think the record establishes beyond doubt that, as principal, Fratello \u201ceonvey[ed]\u201d the School\u2019s Roman Catholic \u201cmessage and carried] out its mission,\u201d <em>id., </em>insofar as she: (1) consistently managed, evaluated, and worked closely with teachers to execute the School\u2019s religious education mission; (2) led daily prayers for students over the loudspeaker, and other prayers at various ceremonies for faculty and students; (3) supervised and approved the selection of hymns, decorations, and lay persons chosen to recite prayer at annual special Masses; (4) encouraged and supervised teachers\u2019 integration of Catholic saints and religious values in their lessons and classrooms; (5) kept families connected to. their students\u2019 religious and spiritual development through the newsletter; and (6) delivered commencement speeches and yearbook messages that were religious in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Not only did Fratello perform all these functions, she was also evaluated on the quality of that performance. Her supervisors and faculty commended her earlier in her tenure for \u201csetting a good example as a religion leader\u201d and \u201cmaking religious values ... the focus of life at the School.\u201d Daley Decl. \u00b6 25, at App\u2019x at 107. They also praised her for \u201cfoster[ing] a Christian atmosphere,\u201d \u201cgiv[ing] priority to a comprehensive religious education program\u201d by \u201cencouraging communal worship,\u201d \u201censuring] that religion classes [were] taught by knowledgeable and committed Catholics,\u201d and \u201cprovid[ing] for religious growth among staff members.\u201d Pastor Evaluation at 1-2, at App\u2019x at 198-99; <em>see also </em>Driscoll Evaluation at 1, at Supp. App\u2019x at 113; Sister Lewis Evaluation at 1, at Supp. App\u2019x at 119; Sister Connolly Evaluation at 1, at Supp. App\u2019x at 133; McGuirk Evaluation at 1, at Supp. App\u2019x at 143; Ladolcetta Evaluation at 1, at Supp. App\u2019x at 157; Murphy Evaluation at 1, at Supp. App\u2019x at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Thus, Fratello \u201cperformed\u201d several \u201cimportant religious functions\u201d as the School\u2019s principal. <em>Hosanna-Tabor, </em>565 U.S. at 192, 132 S.Ct. 694.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> This fundamental consideration therefore weighs strongly in favor of applying the ministerial exception.'</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">The irony is striking. We rely in part on Fratello\u2019s supervisors\u2019 and faculty officials\u2019 prior <em>praise </em>of her performance of her religious responsibilities as proof that she could be fired for the wrong reason or without any reason at all. In our inquiry, the nature of her duties trumps her apparent ability to perform them. This case thus lies at the center of the tension between an employer\u2019s right to freedom of religion and an employee\u2019s right not to be unlawfully discriminated against. The ministerial exception, as we understand it to be interpreted by the Supreme Court, resolves that tension in this case against Fratello and in favor of the Archdiocese, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Church, and the School. Indeed, the Supreme Court has told us that, because, as we conclude, she is a minister within the meaning of the exception, the \u201cFirst Amendment has struck the balance for us.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196, 132 S.Ct. 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">In sum, then, we conclude that although Fratello\u2019s formal title was not inherently religious, the record makes clear that she held herself out as a spiritual leader of the School and performed many important religious functions to advance its Roman Catholic mission. The ministerial exception thus bars her employment-discrimination claims because she was a minister within the meaning of the exception. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-6\">.

These examples, used for illustrative purposes, are obviously arbitrary and simplistic. Maybe, for example, there were good practical reasons for those choices. But this is neither the time nor the place to comment on them further. That is the point: This is not the time, because a court is virtually never the place, to analyze the grounds for a religious group\u2019s reasons for selecting its ministers. <em>See Hosanna-Tabor, </em>565 U.S. at 194-95, 132 S.Ct. 694.

We derive the title \"lay principal\u201d from Fratello's employment contract, which was entitled \u201cContract of Employment for Lay Principals.\u201d Lay Contract, at App\u2019x at 84. Beyond that contract's title, however, there is little evidence that she was called \"lay principal\u201d rather than just \"principal.\u201d The body of her employment contract simply uses the term \"principal,\u201d <em>see id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2-4, at App\u2019x at 84-85, and the Manual does not appear to distinguish between lay principals and religious principals, <em>see e.g., </em>Manual \u00b6\u00b6 320, 322, 324, 326 (referring simply to \"principal\u201d), at App\u2019x at 135-37.

The defendants assert that this distinction has nothing to do with a principal\u2019s job functions, but merely reflects a difference in the recruitment pool from which particular principals are selected: A \"religious principal\u201d is so tided because the individual is a member of a religious order (a nun, for example) who serves the school by agreement of her order, whereas a \"lay principal\u201d is not a member of a religious order. True or not, this does not alter our conclusion that Fratello\u2019s formal title, \"lay principal,\u201d weighs against ministerial status.
