This ruling was erroneous. The prisoner had the right to petition for the writ in his own behalf, and his application should have been heard the same as if an application had been made in his behalf by a friend or relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">It is ordered that a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>issue as prayed in the present petition, and that it be made returnable before the superior court of Napa County on Monday, the sixteenth day of February, A.
