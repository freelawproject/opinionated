The record shows that notice of intention to move for a new trial was duly served and filed in the lower court, and that the statement on motion therefor is in process of settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">These facts bring the present motion within the rule laid down in <em>Wall </em>v. <em>Mines, </em>128 Cal. 136, and <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Ning Yung Benevolent Assn., ante, </em>p. 602, and without further discussion, and on the authority of those cases, the motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Van Dyke, J., Shaw, J., Angel\u00edotti, J., McFarland, J., Beatty, C.
