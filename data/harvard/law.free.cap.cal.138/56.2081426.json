The applicants appeal from the judgment and gave the ordinary three-hundred-dollar appeal-bond; but they have not given any stay-bond. Their contention seems to be that the three-hundred-dollar bond stays execution because it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>come within any of the provisions of the code requiring a stay-bond, and therefore is governed by section 949 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This contention is not maintainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The transcript on appeal is not before us; and the matter must therefore be determined by the papers before us on this application. The position of applicants appears to be, that the lien decreed to be enforced was not a \u201cmortgage of personal property,\u201d and therefore is not within section 943, or any of the other sections from 942 to 945, inclusive. It is not necessary to inquire whether within section 942 there is a stay of the execution of a judgment directing the \u201cpayment of money\u201d without a stay-bond, notwithstanding the fact that it also enforces a lien other than a mortgage on personal property. In the case at bar the judgment declares the liens enforced to be \u201cplaintiff\u2019s mortgage and lien,\u201d and \u201cintervener\u2019s mortgage and lien,\u201d and that \u201csaid mortgages and liens are the ones described in the complaint,\u201d etc. Therefore, on the face of the papers, the liens here dealt with are mortgages, and, being within section 943, the judgment cannot be stayed without a stay-bond, and the three-hundred-dollar bond does not warrant a <em>supersedeas. </em>Moreover, the court below found that the property directed to be sold was \u201cperishable property,\u201d and that being so, the three-hundred-dollar bond does not stay the proceedings under section 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The application for <em>supersedeas </em>is denied and the proceeding dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Van Dyke, J., Harrison, J., Garoutte, J., and Henshaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
