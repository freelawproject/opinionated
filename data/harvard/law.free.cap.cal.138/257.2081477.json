The defendants Morton, Larsen, and Moore appeal from the judgment and from the order denying their motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">The plaintiff\u2019s ease is=admitted by the pleadings, and the controversy is therefore exclusively between the defendants named and the defendant corporation, which will hereinafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>be referred to as the respondent. The points involved are,\u2014 1. As to the validity of the defendant-respondent\u2019s lien; 2. As to the authority of the court, under the circumstances of the case, to decree its foreclosure; and 3. As to the sufficiency of its pleading to justify the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\">1. As to Mrs. Morton, the validity of the lien was adjudged in a former suit brought by Mrs. Morton against the respondent and others; and on appeal the judgment was affirmed by this court. <em>(Morton </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>124 Cal. 229.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) It is clear, therefore, as to her, that at the date of the judgment in this case, the lien of the respondent was a valid, existing lien. As to the defendants Larsen and Moore, their cases will be considered in the sequel.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">2. Assuming the validity of the lien, the respondent, we think, was clearly entitled to the relief accorded to it. The enforcement of liens, whether equitable or statutory, is a well-recognized function of courts of equity; and the only distinction in this respect between the different kinds of liens is, that in the case of the latter equity will interpose only where there is no other adequate remedy. (1 Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, secs. 167, 112 (class 4), 171, 297, and note 2; 3 Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, secs. 1268-1269, p. 1415, n. p. 2185; <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>31 Fla. 134; <em>Witmer\u2019s Appeal, </em>45 Pa. St. 455;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Gilchrist </em>v. <em>Helena etc. R. R. Co., </em>58 Fed. 711); to which may be added the case of <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>124 Cal. 229.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this case the property in question was conveyed to her daughter by Mrs. Wallace in her lifetime, and therefore never formed part of her estate. It could not be reached, therefore, in the probate proceeding; nor could an execution be issued on the respondent\u2019s judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 686, 1505.) The respondent was therefore wholly without remedy otherwise than by resort to a court of equity. Whether there was other property in the estate out of which the claim might be paid does not appear; nor is the question material. The respondent has a specific lien on the property in question, which\u2014so long as the debt is not satisfied\u2014he is entitled to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">But were there a doubt of the right of a judgment creditor, in the absence of other remedy, to maintain an independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>suit to foreclose his lien, there can be none of his right to relief in a suit brought against him to foreclose a prior lien. In such cases, to make the foreclosure effectual, it is necessary for the plaintiff to make all junior lienholders parties;*'and this implies that their rights, when brought into court, shall be adjudicated, and provision be made for them in the decree of foreclosure, by a proper disposition of the surplus proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged premises. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 726; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>McNaughton, </em>43 Cal. 161; <em>Hibernia S. and L. Soc. </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>110 Cal. 27, 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\">The case of <em>Howe Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Miner, </em>28 Kan. 441, cited by appellants (and also in 2 Freeman on Judgments, sec. 338), to the effect that \u201cthere is no foreclosure of a simple judgment lien,\u201d does not support the proposition asserted, but rather impliedly recognizes the rule as we have given it. In <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Wood, 47 </em>Miss. 233, there is a <em>dictum </em>to the effect claimed by appellant, but no authorities are cited, and what is said on the point has no connection with the matter involved \u2022in the case. The other authorities cited do not seem to have any application. In some of them, and in other cases, a distinction, or supposed distinction, between the <em>general </em>lien of a judgment as existing before levy of execution and the <em>specific </em>lien acquired by levy is referred to. <em>(Powell </em>v. <em>Macon, </em>40 Ark. 544; 2 Freeman on Judgments, sec. 338; Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, title, \u201cLiens,\u201d sub-title \u201cStatutory Liens.\u201d) But in this state there is no room for such a distinction; for here the judgment, when docketed, is by statute made a specific lien on all the lands of the judgment debtor, before as well as after levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">3. With regard to the question of pleading, the respondent\u2019s answer, containing a prayer for affirmative relief, was duly served on all his co-defendants, and must therefore be regarded as a cross-complaint. <em>(White </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>87 Cal. 151; <em>Hibernia S. and L. Soc. </em>v. <em>Fella, </em>54 Cal. 598; <em>Hibernia S. and L. Soc. </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>110 Cal. 27; <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Richet, </em>56 Cal. 307.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) Thus regarded, its allegations are defective in some particulars, but the essential facts were not only proven without objection and found, but also admitted. <em>(Hess </em>v. <em>Bolinger, </em>48 Cal. 349.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The defendants Larsen and Moore were not parties to the former suit of <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>and are therefore not bound by that determination. They acquired interests in the property subsequent to the docketing of respondent\u2019s judgment, and the decree of distribution did not operate to relieve their land from the lien which was thus attached. <em>(Martinovich </em>v. <em>Marsicano, </em>137 Cal. 354.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The trial court was therefore correct in decreeing that these appellants held their property subject to the lien of respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The judgment and order appealed from are therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AYg\"> 84 Am.
