Upon a trial <em>de novo </em>there was a verdict for defendant. More than five days after the verdict, but within an extension of time granted by the trial judge, the defendant filed his cost-bill, the amount of which was included in his judgment. Petitioner claims that the judgment is to that extent void, because the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>had no power to extend the time for filing the cost-bill, and that, being too late, costs were waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">We think, however, that the service and filing of a cost-bill is fairly within a proper construction of section 1054 of the Code of Civil Procedure authorizing extensions of time. It is substantially \u201ca notice other than of appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Writ denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
