The opinion contained the Attorney General\u2019s construction of LSA-R.S. 15:568, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-10\">\u201cThe warden of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, or a competent person selected by him, shall execute the criminal in conformity with the death warrant issued in the case. Until the time of his execution, the convict shall be kept in solitary confinement at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola and <em>no one shall be allowed access to him without an order of the court except the officers of the prison, his counsel, his physician, his spiritual adviser, his wife, children, father, mother, brothers and sisters.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-14\">The Attorney General\u2019s opinion construed the clause, \u201cno one shall be allowed access to him,\u201d as including the act of corresponding in writing with the prisoner. It is undisputed that appellant has never sought a court order permitting him to correspond with persons other than those named in the statute, and it is stipulated that neither appellant nor any of the other inmates on death row have ever been denied access in any form to any of the persons designated in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">We believe that the construction placed upon the statute by the Attorney General of Louisiana is a reasonable one, and we accordingly hold that the district court was correct in denying the relief sought. As pointed out by the district court, the statute in question is nondiscriminatory on its face and is being applied to all death row inmates in a non-discriminatory manner. \u201cControl of the mail to and from inmates is an essential adjunct of prison administration and the maintenance of order within the prison.\u201d McCloskey v. State of Maryland, 4th Cir. 1964, 337 F.2d 72, 74. See also Adams v. Ellis, 5th Cir. 1952, 197 F.2d 483, 485; Lee v. Tahash, 8th Cir. 1965, 352 F.2d 970. Thus the limitation of which appellant complains falls within the scope of the following language by the Supreme Court: \u201cLawful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system.\u201d Price v. Johnston, 1948, 334 U.S. 266, 285, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 1060, 92 L.Ed. 1356. Nor can we accept appellant\u2019s argument that he, as a death row inmate, is entitled to the same privileges as the ordinary prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-16\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
