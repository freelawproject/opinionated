The cause was submitted to the trial court upon an agreed statement of facts and resulted in a holding by that court that appellants\u2019 claims were barred by the equitable principles of laches. We hold that the trial court could and did properly apply the bar of laches to appellants\u2019 claims under applicable Kansas law and under the totality of the facts and circumstances as set forth in that court\u2019s memorandum opinion, D.C., 253 F.Supp. 571, and affirm the judgment for the reasons therein stated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
