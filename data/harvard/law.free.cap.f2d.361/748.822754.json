Defendant appeals from the modified judgment entered on the remittitur. Plaintiff filed a \u201cnotice of appeal and cross-appeal\u201d from the order directing the remittitur, and defendant has moved to dismiss the appeal and cross-appeal. We allow the motion to dismiss and affirm the modified judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Plaintiff was injured March 15, 1962, while operating a fork-lift tractor to push three gondola cars from a repair track in defendant\u2019s Gary, Indiana repair yard. He had been working for defendant since 1952, and for four or five months before his injury had worked as a tractor operator. At the time he was injured, plaintiff was helping in a program of replacing the trucks (or sets of wheels) of gondola cars; the cars were placed on.the repair track, jacked up so the trucks could be removed and replaced, and the substituted trucks were then connected to the gondola body lowered upon them. Plaintiff\u2019s function was to use the tractor to push the gondola cars off the repair track.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">On the day of the injury, he had used the fork to lift, about a foot from the repair track, the rear end of the rear of the three cars, so that he could shove them \u201cinto the clear\u201d across a planked crossing. In this movement one tractor wheel was between the two rails of the repair track, and the other was outside the rails. He shoved the cars over the crossing. But when the front wheels of the tractor struck the planks, the forks \u201cwent down,\u201d and the rear wheels of the tractor went up in the air four or five feet. Plaintiff applied the foot brake, the tractor stopped and the three cars separated and continued \u201cinto the clear.\u201d When the tractor wheels came down, plaintiff landed forcibly on the spring-less, fixed metal seat of the tractor and his- back was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">The complaint charged generally defendant\u2019s negligent failure to provide a safe place to work, and three specific acts of negligence. The only specific charge submitted to the jury, however, was that defendant negligently required plaintiff to move the cars by means of a tractor, instead of having them moved by a locomotive.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Defendant contends there was no evidence upon which to submit the specific charge to the jury. To test this contention we take only the evidence favorable to plaintiff and draw the inferences most strongly in the light favorable to him. We do not consider evidence unfavorable to plaintiff or inferences favoring defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">The evidence favorable to plaintiff is that he had driven automobiles but had never operated a tractor before being assigned by defendant to do so; that in driving the tractor he faced the large \u201cstationary\u201d front wheels and to steer the tractor to the right or left he had to turn the small rear wheels in the opposite direction, using the steering wheel; that defendant gave him no training in operation of the tractor; that he had shoved only one ear at a time prior to the day of his injury; that the cars weighed 23 or 25 tons each; that to push the cars \u201cinto the clear\u201d he had to gain momentum before releasing them at the crossing; that most of the ties on the repair track were above the ground, the rails on the ties six or seven inches high and the crossing level with the rails; and that a switch engine was used to place the cars on the track for repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">We think this evidence and the favorable inferences justified the district court\u2019s submission of the specific charge of defendant\u2019s negligence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">The district court ordered the remittitur because the verdict was \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d and the size of the verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>\u201cshocks the conscience\u201d of the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant argues that this view of the district judge \u201ccoupled with the complete absence, or, at best, paucity of evidence\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of negligence requires a new trial of the questions of liability and damages. We disagree that there is a paucity of evidence upon which the jury fastened liability, or that the question of liability is \u201cclose or doubtful (at best).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The facts here leave no room for reasonable inference that plaintiff\u2019s injury on March 15, 1962, was not due to the occurrence he described. The district court\u2019s decision to grant a new trial, if there was no remittitur, was \u201con the grounds of an excessive verdict.\u201d We see no merit in defendant\u2019s argument that the question of liability should be retried. There is no merit either in the argument of defendant suggesting that contributory negligence of plaintiff was a proximate cause as a matter of law and that the jury did not diminish damages because of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">This court in Shupe v. New York Central System, 339 F.2d 998 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 381 U.S. 937, 85 S.Ct. 1769, 14 L.Ed.2d 701 (1965), reversed an order denying defendant\u2019s motion for new trial as to damages and liability. There the $125,000.00 verdict, upon which judgment was entered, was grossly excessive, and plaintiff\u2019s claim that a defective door caused his shoulder injury was \u201cso grossly at variance\u201d with his own statements to numerous others that the injury was eaused by lifting a carton from the floor, that this court was left with a \u201cgrave doubt as to truthfulness and reasonableness\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s claim. The case before us is not \u201cone of those exceptional cases which call for a reversal,\u201d as the court said of the <em>Shupe </em>case, 339 F.2d at 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Defendant challenges the propriety of the court\u2019s instruction to the jury that it might consider the \u201cpermanency\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s physical injury, his \u201cfurther disability and loss of health,\u201d his \u201cfuture loss of earnings and inability to work,\u201d and, in effect, that his life expectancy was 32.6 years. It contends there is no basis in the evidence for the instruction and that the instruction probably led to the grossly excessive verdict which cannot be cured by the remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\"> We think there is a basis in the evidence for this instruction, in which the jury was told they could consider \u201cwhat evidence, if any,\u201d there was of such damages. We also think that the remittitur cured the excessiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">Defendant claims prejudice in the court\u2019s instruction on \u201cassumption of risk.\u201d The instruction given was in the words of the statute <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to the effect that where the injury or death of an employee results in whole or in part from the negligence of the common carrier, or where the injury or death is contributed to by the common carrier\u2019s violation of an employee safety statute, the employee \u201cshall not be held to have assumed the risks of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">Before giving the challenged instruction the court instructed the jury on the questions at issue, including the question of negligence on plaintiff\u2019s part. The court further instructed the jury that if plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, any award of damages should be diminished correspondingly, and that if plaintiff\u2019s negligence was the sole or only proximate cause defendant would not be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-14\"> It is true that since the 1939 amendment of the FELA, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 54, there is no vestige of the defense of assumption of risk. Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 318 U.S. 54, 58, 63 S.Ct. 444, 87 L.Ed. 610 (1943). In that case, Justice Frankfurter commented, as various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>courts <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> since then have done, that juries are likely to be confused by the instruction in the words of the statute. 318 U.S. at 72, 63 S.Ct. at 453 (concurring opinion). We agree that the statutory elimination of the defense of assumption of risk, when read to the jury in FELA cases where that \u201cdefense\u201d has been neither pleaded nor argued, serves only to obscure the issues in the case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">We cannot agree with defendant that the instruction had the effect of suggesting to the jury that plaintiff did not have to bear any responsibility for running the tractor into the planking, and therefore deprived defendant of the right to have the jury consider plaintiff\u2019s alleged \u201cnegligence\u201d as either the sole cause or in diminution of damages. The instruction was not proper, but considering the evidence in this case and the instructions as a whole, we can see no prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">If we allowed plaintiff to \u201cappeal and cross-appeal\u201d in Cause No. 15274, and reversed the order of remittitur, the conditional order for new trial would come into play. But plaintiff could have reached the same result by refusing to remit part of the award. Furthermore, the consequence of reversing the remittitur order would be a reinstatement of the original judgment, which is not final. Woodworth v. Chesbrough, 244 U.S. 79, 82, 37 S.Ct. 583, 61 L.Ed. 1005 (1917). Plaintiff consented to the remittitur and has waived objection to the judgment entered. Movible Offshore Co. v. Ousley, 346 F.2d 870, 875 (5th Cir. 1965); S. Birch &amp; Sons v. Martin, 17 Alaska 230, 244 F.2d 556, 562 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 837, 78 S.Ct. 62, 2 L.Ed.2d 49 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-16\">Modified judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-14\">.

Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 290 F.2d 296, 300 (3rd Cir. 1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b803-11\">. Plaintiff argues, Brief and Appendix for Appellee, p. 23:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhL\">\u201c[T]he record clearly illustrates an attempt on the part of the defendant to develop an evidentiary basis for the use of said defense by changing its name to contributory negligence. * * * It is clear that the defendant here attempted to create an inference of assumption of risk by emphasizing * * * the exclusive control of the tractor by plaintiff and that he had been operating said tractor for several months prior to the accident complained of.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-27\">If plaintiff feared that the evidence could create a question of assumption of risk, he could have urged an instruction on contributory negligence dissipating any implication that through his driving of the tractor he assumed any risks and thereby insulated defendant from liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
