We are satisfied that there was substantial evidence, which the Board could reasonably credit, of the existence and implementation of such an arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">A separate point, challenging the jurisdiction of the Board, is also without merit. It adequately appears that the operation of the Skouras theatre chain was a multimillion dollar enterprise involving large scale interstate transportation of films for commercial exhibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">A decree enforcing the Board\u2019s order will be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
