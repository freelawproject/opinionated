Three days later, on July 17, 1963, he slipped and fell while walking in the kitchen in his stockinged feet and was seriously injured. He sued the defendants in the District Court alleging that the accident was the result of the negligent heavy waxing of the kitchen floor by the defendants prior to his entering into possession of the leased premises. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the District Court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict which was premised on the grounds that the plaintiff\u2019s testimony had failed to establish any breach of duty imposed by law on the defendants inasmuch as the alleged defective condition was not latent or concealed. In granting the motion for a directed verdict the District Court in an oral opinion pointed out that the plaintiff was fully aware of the \u201cwax gloss on the floors and slippery nature thereof\u201d when he entered into possession of the premises and further noted that the defendants had not in their lease \u201cretained control over any part of the premises\u201d, nor had they asserted any control after the plaintiff came into possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-23\">On review of the record and consideration of the briefs and oral argument, we are of the opinion that the District Court did not err. LaFreda v. Woodward, 125 N.J.L. 489, 492-493, 15 A.2d 798, 800, 130 A.L.R. 1269 (1940); Folley v. United Building &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n of Hackensack, 117 N.J.L. 54, 57-58, 186 A. 591, 593 (Sup.Ct.1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-24\">For the reasons stated the Judgment entered by the District Court in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiff will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
