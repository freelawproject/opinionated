Floyd\u2019s complaint recites that the cabaret, the operation and ownership of which gives rise to a tax obligation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is in fact owned solely by his wife, and that he is not in any way financially involved in the enterprise. The District Court granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, relying on section 7421(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, which reads: \u201cExcept as provided in sections 6212(a) and (c) and 6213(a) [which are not here relevant], no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7421(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">We agree with the District Court that dismissal is compelled under the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of section 7421(a) in Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Nav. Co., 370 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 1125, 8 L.Ed.2d 292 (1962). There the Court was dealing with a suit by an employer to restrain the collection of social security taxes and unemployment taxes asserted by the Government to be due. The employer claimed that there was no employment relationship to which the taxes could apply. In reversing the lower courts\u2019 grant of injunctive relief, the Supreme Court declared that a suit by an allegedly delinquent taxpayer to enjoin the collection of taxes must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction unless \u201cit is clear that under no circumstances could the Government ultimately prevail.\u201d 370 U.S. at 7, 82 S.Ct. at 1129.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>instant case the District Court concluded, and we concur, that it is not at all clear that the Government will ultimately fail to establish that the tax liability arising from the operation of the cabaret attaches to Mr. as well as Mrs. Floyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Appellant nevertheless presses the contention that he is a non-taxpayer, and therefore outside the proscription against suits for injunctive relief embodied in section 7421(a). Floyd does not dispute that the taxes assessed are valid taxes and are owed by the owner of the c\u00e1baret, but denies that he has any interest in the cabaret upon which tax liability could lawfully be predicated as to him. In response to this contention it is sufficient to say that this is precisely the issue that should be resolved in the ordinary channels of tax litigation. Falik v. United States, 343 F.2d 38 (2d Cir. 1965), (injunctive relief denied where plaintiff sought to contest the Government\u2019s determination that she was a responsible officer of a tax-delinquent corporation). See also Cooper Agency, Inc. v. McLeod, 235 F.Supp. 276 (E.D.S.C.1964), aff\u2019d per curiam, 348 F.2d 919 (4th Cir. 1965); Broadwell v. United States, 234 F.Supp. 17 (E.D.N.C.1964), aff\u2019d per curiam, 345 F.2d 470 (4th Cir. 1965); Quinn v. Hook, 231 F.Supp. 718 (E.D.Pa.1964), aff\u2019d per curiam, 341 F.2d 920 (3d Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">This is not a case where a property owner under no tax assessment is seeking to enjoin the Government from seizing his property to satisfy the tax obligation of another. Cf. Raffaele v. Granger, 196 F.2d 620 (3d Cir. 1952); Adler v. Nicholas, 166 F.2d 674 (10th Cir. 1948). See also Shelton v. Gill, 202 F.2d 503, 506 (4th Cir. 1953). Where no tax deficiency has been asserted against one whose property is seized, a suit against the Government for injuncfive relief seems peculiarly appropriate, for the aggrieved party, not being an alleged tax delinquent, would have no opportunity in the ordinary channels of tax litigation to contest the validity of the Government\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">With respect to Mr. Floyd, however, his complaint shows on its face that the Government has made a levy against <em>him </em>for a deficiency, and we cannot say that this is an exaction merely in \u201cthe guise of a tax.\u201d Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Nav. Co., 370 U.S. 1, 7, 82 S.Ct. 1125 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">The Order of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-16\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4231.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-17\">. A complete statement of the Court\u2019s conclusion follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-18\">\u201cThe manifest purpose of \u00a7 7421(a) is to permit the United States to assess and collect taxes alleged to he due without judicial intervention, and to require that the legal right to the disputed sums he determined in a suit for refund. In this manner the United States is assured of prompt collection of its lawful revenue. Nevertheless, if it is clear that under no circumstances could the Government ultimately prevail, the central purpose of the Act is inapplicable and, * * * the attempted collection may he enjoined if equity jurisdiction otherwise exists. In such a situation the exaction is merely in \u2018the guise of a tax.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201cWe believe that the question, of whether the Government has a chance of ultimately prevailing is to be determined on the basis of the information available to it at the time of suit. Only if it is then apparent that, under the most liberal view of the law and the facts, the United States cannot establish its claim, may the suit for an injunction be maintained. Otherwise, the District Court is without jurisdiction, and the complaint must be dismissed.\u201d 370 U.S. at 7, 82 S.Ct. at 1129.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
