Code \u00a7 25-128(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was given a suspended sentence of ninety days imprisonment. That he was drunk or intoxicated at the time and place stated was proved and was uncontested. His defense was that he was a chronic alcoholic.</p>\n<p id=\"Aaj\">The judge did not rule that the evidence fell short of establishing that appellant was a chronic alcoholic. The judge ruled that the evidence to that effect was not pertinent; that is, that chronic alcoholism was not a defense to a charge of intoxication in a public place.</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. Easter v. District of Columbia, D.C.App., 209 A.2d 625. We allowed an appeal' to this court. Sitting en banc we heard and now decide the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b103-20\">Our decision is that chronic alcoholism is a defense to a charge of public intoxication and, therefore, is not a crime in violation of Section 25-128 (a) of our Code, <em>supra </em>n. 1. We think this follows, in the first place, from the Act of Congress of August 4, 1947, entitled \u201cRehabilitation of Alcoholics,\u201d 61 Stat. 744, c. 472, now embodied in our Code as Sections 24-501 et seq.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-21\">In aid of its purposes, one of which is \u201cto establish a' program for the rehabilitation of alcoholics, promote temperance, and provide for the medical, psychiatric, and other scientific treatment of chronic alcoholics\u201d the Act provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-22\">the courts of the District of Columbia are hereby authorized to take judicial notice of the fact that a chronic alcoholic is a sick person and in need of proper medical, institutional, advisory, and rehabilitative treatment, and the court is authorized to direct that he receive appropriate medical, psychiatric, or other treatment as provided under the terms of this chapter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay_\">D. C. Code \u00a7 24-501 (1961 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>A \u201cchronic alcoholic\u201d is defined in the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">The term \u201cchronic alcoholic\u201d means any person who chronically and habitually uses alcoholic beverages to the extent that he has lost the power of self-control with respect to the use of such beverages, or while under the influence of alcohol endangers the public morals, health, safety, or welfare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">D.C. Code \u00a7 24-502 (1961 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">We are concerned in this case only with that part of the above definition which refers to loss of the power of self-control with respect to the use of alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The above statutory provisions, considered in the full context of the Act of which they are a part,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> preclude attaching criminality in this jurisdiction to intoxication in public of a chronic alcoholic. An essential element of criminal responsibility is the ability to avoid the conduct specified in the definition of the crime. Action within the definition is not enough. To be guilty of the crime a person must engage responsibly in the action. Thus, an insane person who does the act is not guilty of the crime. The law, in such a case based on morals, absolves him of criminal responsibility. So, too, in case of an infant. In case of a chronic alcoholic Congress has dealt with his condition so that in this jurisdiction he too cannot be held to be guilty of the crime of being intoxicated because, as the Act recognizes, he has lost the power of self-control in the use of intoxicating beverages. In his case an essential element of criminality, where personal conduct is involved, is lacking. This element is referred to in the law as the criminal mind. See Carter v. United States, 102 U.S.App. D.C. 227, 235, 252 F.2d 608, 616, where the subject is well discussed. It is there stated in terms of the common-law axiom, <em>\u201cActus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea.\u201d </em>Coke, Third Institute *6, *107.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">The Act of 1947 does not state that a chronic alcoholic is suffering from a mental disease which causes the loss of control; the defense is not in terms of insanity. The condition is defined as a \u201csickness,\u201d and Congress did not find it necessary to specify whether it is mental, physical or a combination of both. Whatever its etiological intricacies it is deemed a sickness which is accompanied with loss of power to control the use of alcoholic beverages. The congressional judgment is supported not only by the evidence in this case adduced in the Court of General Sessions but by the record of the hearings on the Act of 1947,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the entire legislative history of the Act, and by an additional abundance of authorities, some of which are enumerated in Appendix B to this opinion. As Congressman Miller of Nebraska stated on the floor of the House during the debate on the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-13\">Jail is not the answer to their trouble. We think they are sick people and need scientific and technical attention of psychiatrists and medical personnel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">93 Cong.Rec. 3357 (1947).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">It is suggested that the public nature of the intoxication adds a factor which precludes the defense \u2014 that if suffering from the sickness is not a crime manifesting it in a public place is. But nothing whatever indicates that Congress intended to limit the scope of the Act to persons sick in privacy. It is clear the Act was primarily concerned with persons found in public places. The provisions which contemplated their institutional care, instead of the jail, show indubitably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>that the non-criminal approach of Congress applied to the chronic alcoholic floundering in a public place. The lack of power of self-control referred to cannot be limited to absolution of criminality for drinking or being drunk in a nonpublic place. No statute in the District of Columbia makes such an act or circumstance criminal. The very nature of the sickness goes where its victim goes.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">It should be clear from the above that chronic alcoholism resulting in public intoxication cannot be held to be criminal on the theory that before the sickness became chronic there was at some earlier period a voluntary act or series of acts which led to the chronic condition. A sick person is a sick person though he exposed himself to contagion and a person who at one time may have been voluntarily intoxicated but has become a chronic alcoholic and therefore is unable to control his use of alcoholic beverages is not to be considered voluntarily intoxicated. We desire to make clear, however, that we are not absolving the voluntarily intoxicated person of criminal responsibility for crime in general under applicable law. See Harris v. United States, 8 App.D.C. 20, 36 L.R.A. 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We find no basis for judicial repudiation of the Act of 1947. The fact that in the intervening years the facilities contemplated by the Act have not been made available does not detract from the legal effect of those provisions of the Act which define the nature of the sickness. One who has committed no crime cannot be validly sentenced as a criminal because of a lack of rehabilitative and caretaking facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">In event of a determination of chronic alcoholism under the procedures of D.C.Code \u00a7 24-504 commitment for treatment is not mandatory. In the judge\u2019s discretion the accused may be released. But he may not be punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Our decision would be the same were we without the guidance furnished by the Act of 1947. One who is a chronic alcoholic cannot have the <em>mens rea </em>necessary to be held responsible criminally for being drunk in public. This is so for the same reason which led Congress to that enactment, namely, that a chronic alcoholic is in fact a sick person who has lost control over his use of alcoholic beverages. This is demonstrated by the hearings on the Act of 1947, by the evidence taken in the present case, and by the wealth of material available and appropriate to be considered by the court. See Appendices A and B.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The same basic problem now. before us was recently before the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Driver v. Hinnant, 356 F.2d 761.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This was a habeas corpus proceeding attacking in the federal courts a conviction of Driver of public intoxication by the courts of North Carolina. Under a State statute it was a misdemeanor to be found \u201cdrunk or intoxicated on the public highway, or at any public place or meeting.\u201d Even without benefit of such a statute as our Act of 1947, the court sustained the defense of chronic alcoholism. The court said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-11\">As defined by the National Council on Alcoholism, he [a chronic alcoholic] is a \u201cperson who is powerless to stop drinking and whose drinking seriously alters his normal living pattern.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The American Medical Association defines \u201calcoholics\u201d as \u201cthose excessive drinkers whose dependence on alcohol has attained such a degree that it shows a noticeable disturbance or interference with their bodily or mental health, their interpersonal relations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>and their satisfactory social and economic functioning\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The World Health Organization recognizes alcoholism \u201cas a chronic illness that manifests itself as a <em>disorder of behavior\u201d.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Accent added.) It is known that alcohol can be addicting,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and it is the addict \u2014 the involuntary drinker \u2014 on whom our decision is now made.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hence we exclude the merely excessive \u2014steady or spree \u2014 voluntary drinker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZK\">This addiction \u2014 chronic alcoholism\u2014 is now almost universally accepted medically as a disease.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The symptoms, as already noted, may appear as \u201cdisorder of behavior\u201d. Obviously, this includes appearances in public, as here, unwilled and ungovernable by the victim. When that is the conduct for which he is criminally accused. There can be no judgment of criminal conviction passed upon him. To do so would affront the Eighth Amendment, as cruel and unusual punishment in branding him a criminal, irrespective of consequent detention or fine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-18\">Although his misdoing objectively comprises the physical elements of a crime, nevertheless no crime has been perpetrated because the conduct was neither actuated by an evil intent nor accompanied with a consciousness of wrongdoing, indispensable ingredients of a crime. Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 250-252, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952). Nor can his misbehavior be penalized as a transgression of a police regulation \u2014 malum prohibitum \u2014 necessitating no intent to do what it punishes. The alcoholic\u2019s presence in public is not his act, for he did not will it. It may be likened to the movements of an imbecile or a person in a delirium of a fever. None of them by attendance in the forbidden place defy the forbiddance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqh\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-19\">Of course, the alcohol-diseased may by law be kept out of public sight. Equally true, the North Carolina statute does not punish them solely for drunkenness but rather for its public demonstration. But many of the diseased have no homes or friends, family or means to keep them indoors. Driver examples this pitiable predicament, for he is apparently without money or restraining care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-20\">Footnote 3 of Judge Bryan\u2019s opinion calls attention to reliance by the District Court in the <em>Driver </em>case upon the definition of a chronic alcoholic contained in the Act of 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-21\">Judge Bryan also stated for the court that Robinson v. State of California, 370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758, \u201csustains, if not commands, the view we take.\u201d In <em>Robinson </em>the Supreme Court held invalid as cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments a California statute which made drug addiction a crime. The Court said such addiction was a status involuntarily assumed, and therefore to punish it as a crime violated the constitutional provisions. Since, as we have seen, public intoxication of a chronic alcoholic is not a crime, to convict one of it as though it were would also be cruel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>unusual punishment. The fact that in our case the sentence of 90 days was suspended, whereas in <em>Robinson </em>there was imprisonment, is immaterial on the question of cruel and unusual punishment; it is the fact of criminal conviction that is critical:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">* * * in the light of contemporary human knowledge, a law which made a criminal offense of such a disease [mental illness, leprosy, or venereal disease] would doubtless be universally thought to be an infliction of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALx\">370 U.S. at 666, 82 S.Ct. at 1420.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">In <em>Driver </em>Judge Bryan stated it is \u201ccruel and unusual punishment in branding him a criminal, irrespective of consequent detention or fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">We hold, therefore, by reason of the Act of 1947, for the independent reasons which underlay the theory of that Act, and on the precedential authority of <em>Driver,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>with support also from <em>Sweeney, </em>n. 9 <em>supra, </em>that the public intoxication of a chronic alcoholic lacks the essential element of criminality; and to convict such a person of that crime would also offend the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">We close this discussion with the observation that confinement, e. g. for inquiry or treatment, lies within the means available for dealing, constitutionally, with a menace to society. This appears from passages in Robinson v. State of California, <em>supra, </em>370 U.S. at 664-665, 82 S.Ct. 1417; Driver v. Hinnant, <em>supra. </em>We are not called upon to speculate as to the range and nature of permissible detention which could be authorized by Congress beyond that contemplated in the Act of 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">It follows that the evidence of chronic alcoholism adduced in this case was pertinent. It established the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">Expert medical and psychiatric evidence, not sought to be rebutted, proved that appellant was a chronic alcoholic who had lost self-control over his use of alcoholic beverages. His condition, with its usual physical manifestations, was arrayed fully before the trial judge and need not be repeated here in detail. Since 1937 appellant has been arrested for intoxication or associated conduct 70 times, 12 times in 1963 alone. On innumerable occasions he has been intoxicated but not arrested. The condition had progressed for many years, definitely since the 1930s, resulting in a broken home life, recurrent hospitalization, and loss .of steady employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Reversed, with direction to remand to the Court of General Sessions for dismissal of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Excerpts of Testimony from Hearings on H.R. 496 before Subcommittee on Health, Education, Recreation of the House Committee on the District of Columbia, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.

We are referred to cases decided by this court in -which narcotic addiction has been discussed in the majority and concurring opinions. These opinions bear upon rights of a narcotic addict in defending charges of having violated the narcotic laws. Hutcherson v. United States, 120 U.S. App.D.C. 274, 345 F.2d 964; Castle v. United States, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 398, 347 F.2d 492; Heard v. United States, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 37, 348 F.2d 43. Several of the opinions discuss the implications of <em>Robinson </em>as possibly barring punishment of such an addict charged with violating certain provisions of the narcotic laws, and, also, the relation of narcotic addiction to mental disease as a defense due to the addict\u2019s lack of responsibility for the conduct involved. Whatever impact if any our present decision has upon these problems in a narcotic case must be left for such a ease. In this case, as we have said, the defense of chronic alcoholism to a charge of public intoxication is not rested upon mental disease as relieving of criminal responsibility, but upon the absence of responsibility incident to the nature of this particular sickness as set forth by Congress and as shown also by the learning upon which Congress relied. It is rested in addition upon the reasoning of the Fourth Circuit and the studies of the problem in relation to criminal responsibility referred to there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b107-16\">.

My reasons for doing so are stated hereinafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">It was not argued to us on this appeal that we invalidate the D.C.Code provision against public intoxication on its face or as applied to any and all people found drunk in public places. What we were urged to do was to say that henceforth in this jurisdiction one charged with public drunkenness may assert chronic alcoholism as a defense and introduce evidence in support of that defense. This is what I consider we are doing in this case; and I agree that a remand is unnecessary only because the evidence of chronic alcoholism as to this appellant is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-15\">We may, in my view, summon this defense into being because we have both the authority and the duty to shape the criminal jurisprudence of the District of Columbia in accordance with civilized notions of justice. We are not like the ten other federal courts of appeals, whose authority over state criminal law derives only from the commands of the Constitution. In particular, we are not in the position of the Fourth Circuit when, in Driver v. Hinnant, 356 F.2d 761 (1966), it decided that the Eighth Amendment barred the conviction and imprisonment of a chronic alcoholic under a North Carolina statute directed at public drunkenness.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-16\">Our authority in this regard exists in any event, absent only an affirmative and valid legislative proscription of what we propose to do. Far from there being in effect such a veto by Congress in this instance, our duty to do as we do here is, if not compelled, at least strongly indicated and emphasized by the Act of August 4, 1947. In that statute Congress exhibited an extraordinarily sensitive awareness of the problems of acute alcoholism and enacted a singularly enlightened \u2014 and non-criminal \u2014 approach to be followed in this jurisdiction. Had Congress acted to implement this statute with the necessary appropriations and facilities, this appeal would presumably never have reached us. The substantive statute remains on the books. Only the implementation is missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-17\">The urgent need of that implementation is accentuated by what we do today. The community will not tolerate uncontrolled drunkenness in public places, and will insist that the police act to remove it as before. The power of the police in this respect is, in my view, unaffected by today\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But it does underscore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>the necessity of coming to grips with the ultimate disposition of the chronic alcoholics among those so removed. Congress has already done so in the 1947 Act. All it needs to do now is to put some flesh on those bones.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">DANAHER, Circuit Judge, with whom BURGER and TAMM, Circuit Judges, join, concurring in the result:</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">I join Judge McGowan in concluding that \u201ca remand is unnecessary only because the evidence of chronic alcoholism as to this appellant is clear.\u201d I share his view that we have here been asked to say that henceforth \u201cone charged with public drunkenness may assert chronic alcoholism as a defense and introduce evidence in support of that defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">My real problem stems from the alternative clause in D.C.Code \u00a7 24-502 (1961). Its definition of a \u201cchronic alcoholic\u201d as one \u201cwho chronically and habitually uses alcoholic beverages to the extent that he has lost the power of self-control with respect to the use of such beverages,\u201d is clear enough. As here applied, so far, so good.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">But the statute goes on to extend that category to include one who \u201cwhile under the influence of alcohol <em>endangers </em>the <em>public </em>morals, health, <em>safety, or welfare.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">I am confident that Congress in its obvious purpose of seeking means for accomplishing the possible rehabilitation of the unfortunate victims of alcoholism had no thought whatever of addressing itself to some revised standards for determining criminal responsibility as to yet other crimes than public drunkenness. I wish to note my complete understanding that we are not now doing so. All too often this court has been confronted with circumstances of crime where intoxication has been urged as a ground of exculpation. See, e. g., Bishop v. United States, 71 App.D.C. 132, 135-136, 107 F.2d 297, 301-302 (1939); Heideman v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 128, 259 F.2d 943 (1958), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 959, 79 S.Ct. 800, 3 L.Ed.2d 767 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">Obviously the application of any rule of law will depend upon the circumstances of a particular case. In the instant situation this appellant meets the definition of a chronic alcoholic because, by reason of his habitual use of alcoholic beverages, he \u201chas lost the power of self-control with respect to the use of such beverages.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-12\">. The Fourth Circuit has said in <em>Driver:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-13\">We do not annul the North Carolina statute. It is well within the State\u2019s power and right to deter and punish public drunkenness, especially to secure others against its annoyances and intrusions. Robinson v. California, supra, 370 U.S. 600, 664 [82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758]. To this end any intoxicated person found in the street or other public areas may be taken into custody for inquiry or prosecution. But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Constitut\u00edon intercedes when on arraignment the accused\u2019s helplessness comes to light. Then it is that no <em>criminal </em>conviction may follow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-11\">And the brief submitted to us for appellant characterized as \u201can unwarranted misrepresentation\u201d the prosecution\u2019s claim that acceptance of his argument \u201cwould paralyze the efforts of the Metropolitan Poliee to keep drunks off the public streets.\u201d The rationale of this characterization was said to be that the \u201cdefense [of chronic alcoholism] could neither be raised, nor resolved, until trial. That a defendant may be able to establish an absolute defense to the charge for which he is tried does not impair the validity of his arrest and prosecution * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
