We find no error which warrants reversal. One contention is that the trial court erred in refusing to give a requested instruction on the law of self-defense, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or its substance. Assuming there was evidence to justify self-defense instructions, trial counsel expressed complete satisfaction with those given on the subject. In these circumstances the refusal of the one requested, though appropriate in its substance,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is not deemed of sufficient significance to require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-14\">. Evidence has been introduced which may tend to show that the defendant acted in self-defense. The defense has no burden to sustain as to this. If this evidence, when considered with all the other evidence, raises a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt, he is entitled to an acquittal. He is not obliged to establish self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt, or even by a preponderance of the proof. The prosecution must prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b114-27\">. The instruction as requested should have been modified so as to make the second sentence thereof read: \u201cThe defense does not have the burden of proof as to this.\u201d There is, however, the need for the evidence to raise an issue of self-defense, and this may be considered a burden of sorts, ordinarily resting upon the defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
