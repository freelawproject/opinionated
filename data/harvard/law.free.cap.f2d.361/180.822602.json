On November 6, the union wrote to Frantz indicating that a majority of Frantz\u2019s employees had designated the union as their bargaining representative, and requesting recognition. The union suggested a meeting on November 11 for the purpose of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Frantz referred the letter to its attorney, who met shortly thereafter with the company vice-president. At this meeting, it was decided that Frantz\u2019s wage scale was low and that increases should be given to the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Frantz asked the union to postpone the projected November 11 meeting until November 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">On November 10, the union filed a petition for an election, a copy of which Frantz received prior to November 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">On November 16, Frantz granted each of its employees a wage increase of 35 cents an hour and also began paying employees\u2019 hospitalization insurance premiums. At that time, Frantz\u2019s vice-president advised each employee individually of the wage increase. One employee was told that there would be additional substantial pay increases in due time. He also stated: \u201cWe are going to have an election quite soon now, and I want you to bear in mind the Company\u2019s offer on that day when the election will be held.\u201d To another employee, he suggested that the wage increase might change the employees\u2019 minds about the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">On these facts, the trial examiner concluded that Frantz had violated sections 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (5) and (1). The Board adopted the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the trial examiner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">Frantz argues that the Board\u2019s order should not be enforced on the grounds that there is no substantial evidence in the record that the wage increase was granted for the purpose of discouraging the employees\u2019 freedom of choice and that Frantz did not refuse to bargain. Frantz also argues that three authorization cards were signed on the belief that they were to be used for the purpose of obtaining an election, while another signed card was secured through a misrepresentation of the union organizer that all but two of the employees had signed union authorization cards. Frantz urges that there is no substantial evidence that the union was freely chosen by the majority of its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">The law is clear that an employer commits an unfair labor practice if he grants economic benefits during a union organizational campaign for the express or calculated purpose of influencing employee freedom of choice for or against a union. National Labor Relations Board v. Exchange Parts Co., 375 U.S. 405, 409, 84 S.Ct. 457, 11 L.Ed.2d 435 (1964); or to induce employees to leave a union once they are members of it, thereby dissipating union strength, Medo Photo Supply Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 321 U.S. 678, 685-686, 64 S.Ct. 830, 88 L.Ed. 1007 (1944). Cf. National Labor Relations Board v. Taitel, 7 Cir., 261 F.2d 1, 4, cert. den., 359 U.S. 944, 79 S.Ct. 725, 3 L.Ed.2d 677 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">Similarly, an employer commits an unfair labor practice by refusing to bargain with a majority union if he does not have a good faith doubt of the union\u2019s majority status. Happach v. N.L.R.B., 7 Cir., 353 F.2d 629 (1965); N.L.R.B. v. Mid-West Towel &amp; Linen Service, Inc., 7 Cir., 339 F.2d 958 (1964); N.L.R.B. v. Crean, 7 Cir., 326 F.2d 391 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>We are bound to uphold factual findings and inferences of the Board if they are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. 29 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 160(f); Happach v. N.L.R.B., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s inference that the wage increase and other benefits given Frantz\u2019s employees were granted in order to discourage employees from supporting the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">While Frantz has argued that a majority of its employees did not support the union, there is no satisfactory showing in the record that the contested cards were signed under the belief or representation that the sole purpose of obtaining signatures on the authorization cards was to obtain an election. Cf. Happach v. N.L.R.B., supra. Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that the union had a majority at the time it made its first approach to Frantz.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Since the union had a majority without counting the authorization card which Frantz has challenged on the grounds of misrepresentation, it is not necessary to decide the question of misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Frantz gave no indication that it doubted the majority status of the union at any time. As found by the Board and sustained by us, the union did represent a majority of Frantz\u2019s employees. Since the union had majority status at the time Frantz illegally sought to discourage union support, the Board, under its authority to remedy unfair labor practices, could order Frantz to recognize the union and bargain with it, thereby preventing Frantz from profiting by its acts. Cf. Franks Bros. Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 321 U.S. 702, 703-705, 64 S.Ct. 817, 88 L.Ed. 1020 (1944); National Labor Relations Board v. Stow Manufacturing Co., 2 Cir., 217 F.2d 900, 904-905 (1954), cert. den., 348 U.S. 964, 75 S.Ct. 524, 99 L.Ed. 751 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The fact that the union filed a representation petition seeking an election does not excuse Frantz from its duty to recognize and bargain with a majority union. National Labor Relations Board v. Armco Drainage &amp; Metal Products, Inc., 6 Cir., 220 F.2d 573, 576-577 (1955), cert. den., 350 U.S. 838, 76 S.Ct. 76, 100 L.Ed. 748 (1955); National Labor Relations Board v. Inter-City Adv. Co., 4 Cir., 190 F.2d 420, 421 (1951), cert. den., 342 U.S. 908, 72 S.Ct. 301, 96 L.Ed. 679 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">There is no indication in the record that Frantz failed to deal with the union because it thought the union\u2019s representation petition justified a doubt as to the union\u2019s majority status, or that Frantz insisted upon an election for proof of union majority status. Similarly, the filing of the petition is no indication that the union did not have majority status.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">The petition for enforcement of the Board\u2019s order will be granted, and it is so decreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">Order enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-14\">.
