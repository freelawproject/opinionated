The deportation order is based upon charges, first, that petitioner is a Greek citizen who as an alien crewman after an entry into the United States in 1957, overstayed in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) (2) (Appendix), and, second, that petitioner failed to furnish notification of his address in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) (5) (Appendix).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-23\">The petitioner alleges a number of administrative and procedural errors with respect to his arrest, detention and deportation hearings and seeks to set aside the deportation order on the ground that these errors so permeate the entire proceedings against him as to render the administrative process null and void from its inception to its conclusion. Included in these charges against respondent\u2019s conduct are challenges to the legality of petitioner\u2019s arrest, improper use of a confession allegedly extracted from petitioner during a period of illegal detention, lack of evidence (in the absence of an inadmissable confession) to support a finding of deportability, an unfair hearing on the issue of alienage, and other administrative and regulatory transgressions of pertinent regulations and statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-24\">Substantial support for petitioner\u2019s claims appears in the record before us insofar as respondent\u2019s charges of alienage and overstaying are concerned. Were the case to be determined on these aspects of the deportation order alone, we might have to reverse the order and remand the case for new proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>ings to be conducted with due regard both for petitioner\u2019s rights and the governing regulations, statutes and case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Unfortunately for petitioner, however, our review does not halt at this point. The record discloses that subsequent to the occurrence of all of the irregular conduct summarized heretofore, and while on bond, petitioner was in due course afforded a deportation hearing at which he was represented by counsel of his own selection. Apart from the charge of having overstayed his admission as an alien seaman, he was also charged with having failed to submit address reports as required by law. During the course of this hearing, petitioner, in answer to questions, admitted that he had not filed address reports because of his fear that the immigration authorities would apprehend him. It thus appears that distinct and apart from the much earlier arrest, detention, interrogation and hearing proceedings, the petitioner, free on bond and counseled by his retained attorney, voluntarily and freely admitted his alienage and his violation of a specific provision of the Immigration Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Subsequent to the filing of the briefs and oral argument, we permitted petitioner to file a supplemental memorandum supporting his claim that he is eligible for suspension of deportation in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent disposition of Soric v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 382 U.S. 285, 86 S.Ct. 432, 15 L.Ed.2d 330 (Dec. 13, 1965). We have reviewed the memorandum and the opposition thereto and are of the opinion that petitioner\u2019s request that the case be remanded to permit the filing of an application for suspension of deportation should be denied since he clearly does not qualify under the terms of the statute. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a) (1) (2) (1964), as amended, 79 Stat. 918 (1965) (Appendix).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The deportation order is Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">\u00a7 1105a.

Petitioner\u2019s admission at the hearing was not, in our opinion, a product of his initial confession; it occurred two and one-half years after the original confession, in the presence of his counsel and at a time when petitioner\u2019s defense was based in large part on the alleged illegality of his detention and the inadmissability of his initial statements to the immigration authorities.
