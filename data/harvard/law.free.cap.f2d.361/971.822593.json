No promises, no threats?\u201d and the appellant replied, \u201cNo, sir\u201d and \u201cNobody forced upon me nothing.\u201d On January 8, 1960, the appellant was sentenced to a minimum term of 30 years and a maximum term of 40 years on the kidnapping indictment, and a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 12 years on the assault with intent to rape indictment, the sentences to run consecutively; the other indictments were dismissed on the state\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-16\">On April 11, 1960, the appellant unsuccessfully filed a motion in the Mercer County court for withdrawal of his plea of non vult alleging that he was coerced by promises of leniency. He thereafter at various times filed three petitions for habeas corpus relief in the Mercer County court which were all denied. On October 1,1962 the Supreme Court of New Jersey denied his petition which was premised on the denial of his previous applications for habeas corpus relief and various other motions which he had filed. The United States Supreme Court denied his petition for certiorari on May 20, 1963, Glazewski v. New Jersey, 373 U.S. 927, 83 S.Ct. 1531, 10 L.Ed.2d 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-17\">Thereafter the appellant filed the instant petition for habeas corpus relief in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Following hearings had on June 12, 1964, and July 7 and 8, 1964, the District Court denied the writ on July 6, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-18\">On review of the record we are of the opinion that the District Court did not err in its denial of the writ for the reasons so well stated in Judge Shaw\u2019s carefully considered opinion. Accordingly, the Order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
