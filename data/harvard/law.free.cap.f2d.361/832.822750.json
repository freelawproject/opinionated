Rudolph, was tried and convicted before the district court, sitting without a jury, of transporting property in interstate commerce without having obtained a certificate of convenience and necessity as required by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 306(a). Such conduct is criminal if knowingly and willfully committed, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 322(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-24\">At the request of appellant, this appeal was submitted to the court on briefs. We have reviewed the record in the light of the alleged errors; we can perceive no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that appellant knowingly and willfully violated 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 306(a). See Steere Tank Lines, Inc. v. United States, 330 F.2d 719 (C.A.5, 1963). We also fail to discern any reliance by the district court on appellant\u2019s failure to testify as a basis for his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-25\">The judgment of conviction and order denying the motion for a new trial by the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
