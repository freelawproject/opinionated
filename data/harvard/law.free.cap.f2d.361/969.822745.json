This case was started by plaintiffs Shouses in a suit for declaratory judgment in state court against two insurance companies and the other defendants alleging total loss of a house and the personal property therein. It was removed to federal court on diversity of citizenship grounds. The insurance coverage in both policies as to the two items of loss claimed exceeded $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-20\">Appellant Indiana Lumbermens Mutual Insurance Company issued a fire insurance policy on a house being purchased by plaintiffs-appellees, Shouses. The land contract sellers (appellees, Shorters) had already insured the same house by a fire insurance policy issued by appellee, Security Insurance Company of New Haven.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-21\">Lumbermens had knowledge through the Shouses of the existence of the Security policy. Security had no knowledge of the Lumbermens\u2019 policy. Lumbermens did not give notice to Security. Both insurance policies had provisions against \u201cother insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-22\">The only claim under either insurance policy which is before this court in this appeal is that of appellee Losantiville Building and Savings Company, the mortgagee of the destroyed house. The mortgagee\u2019s interest had been insured under both insurance policies. Losantiville cross-claimed against both Lumbermens and Security for its loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-23\">Under Ohio law double coverage is held to create an additional risk and to warrant the voiding of a policy by an insurance company where the risk was thus increased without the insurer\u2019s knowledge and where the policy contained a provision against \u201cother insurance.\u201d Phoenix Insurance Co. v. Michigan Southern &amp; Northern Indiana Railroad Co., 28 Ohio St. 69 (1875); Fireman\u2019s Insurance Co. of Dayton v. Holt, 35 Ohio St. 189 (1878); Sun Fire Office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>of London v. Clark, 53 Ohio St. 414, 42 N.E. 248, 38 L.R.A. 562 (1895); New Jersey Insurance Co. v. Ball, 119 Ohio St. 550, 165 N.E. 41 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">Each insurance company asserts that its policy should be held invalid as to the mortgagee on the ground of double coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">The District Judge held the Security policy void on the ground of \u201cother coverage\u201d but held that appellant Lumbermens should pay the mortgagee \u2014 apparently on grounds of waiver \u2014 because its agent wrote the policy with full knowledge of the existence of the Security policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">With much respect for the views of my colleagues and those of the District Judge, I come to the conclusion that this is not a true \u201cdouble coverage\u201d case and that neither insurance policy should be voided as a result of \u201cother coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ARKO\">The public policy behind the \u201cdouble coverage\u201d rule is founded on restraining persons from fraudulently insuring property in excess of its value so as to provide a financial motive for its willful or negligent destruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">Patently we do not deal here with a situation involving any such facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">Perhaps more important, the two policies of insurance at issue (while applicable to the same house) were issued to two different parties and insured different interests. Specifically, Security insured Losantiville for the Shorters\u2019 interest, while Lumbermens insured Losantiville for the Shouses\u2019 interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Couch on Insurance says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-10\">\u201cOther or double insurance exists where two or more policies of insurance are effected upon or cover the same interest in the same, or part of the same, property, against the same risk, and either in the name or for the benefit of the same person.\u201d 9 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 37:1292 (2d ed. 1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">A text on Ohio insurance law says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-12\">\u201cThe insurance of different interests although in the same property does not violate a condition against other insurance,<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> for the reason that the insurable interests involved under double insurance, must be identical.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Thus, where the possessors of separate interests in certain property obtain policies insuring their individual interests, neither insurance is avoidable for other insurance<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> * * McIntosh, Ohio Insurance Manual \u00a7 462 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-19\">See also Farmers\u2019 Union Mutual Protective Association of Colorado v.

Title 39 \u00a7 3929.26 (1954).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-22\">Since Ohio law creates the substantive right of contribution, federal procedure favors disposing of the respective claims in a single suit.
