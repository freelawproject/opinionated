We have considered the Union\u2019s Contentions, largely based on its view of Local 761, etc., Electrical Workers v. National Labor Relations Board, 366 U.S. 667, 81 S.Ct. 1285, 6 L.Ed.2d 592, that \u201cthe \u2018reserve gate\u2019 doctrine is limited to the particular facts of that case, and cannot be applied to invalidate picketing at a common construction site.\u201d We conclude, however, that the record considered as a whole gives substantial evidentiary support to the findings of the Board that the Union engaged in conduct prohibited by the provisions of the Act above referred to, and that the case cited'is no bar to the Order based on the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">The petition of the Union accordingly is denied, and the Order of the Board will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
