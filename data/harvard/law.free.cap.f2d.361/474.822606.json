Appellant, and his cousin were convicted of narcotics offenses and sentenced to state prison. The cousin\u2019s testimony had established Appellant\u2019s involvement. Both were subsequently deported to Mexico. The cousin then executed an affidavit before the United States Consul at Tijuana, Mexico, conceding that he had committed perjury at trial and absolving Appellant of all criminal culpability. There is no contention that the Prosecuting Attorney or the Superior Court Judge knew of the perjury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b526-36\">. To reach the District Court\u2019s ground we assume arguendo that Appellees are suable entities and as such are the parties properly chargeable with the acts of which Appellant complains. We simply extend sovereign immunity to the People and judicial immunity to the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
