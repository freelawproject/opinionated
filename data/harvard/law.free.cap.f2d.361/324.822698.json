His complaint is that at a preliminary hearing before a magistrate, in answer to a question on an official form asking for any explanation of the circumstances which he thought proper and for any facts which he might think tended to exculpate him, Jones answered \u201cI am guilty.\u201d The court record is silent as to whether Jones had theretofore been advised of his rights to counsel or as to what the then practice was. Judge Bonsai, in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, granted the petition without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-21\">As to the People's right to a hearing, we see no meaningful distinction between this case and United States ex rel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Mitchell v.
