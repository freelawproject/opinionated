Upon a plenary appeal his conviction was affirmed by this court, sub nom. United States v. Cimino, 321 F.2d 509 (2 Cir., 1963), Judge Waterman dissenting, cert. denied 375 U.S. 974, 84 S.Ct. 491, 11 L.Ed.2d 418 (1964). D\u2019Ercole then commenced this present proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to have the judgment of conviction vacated and set aside. The district judge denied the petition, without a hearing, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-28\"> Appellant alleges that he was deprived of the right to confront the witnesses against him because, even though the Government disclosed the name and address of its informer, one Saul Sapp, alias Saul Scott, Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957), it did not produce him at the time of the trial. He cites Pointer v. State of Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965) and Douglas v. State of Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965) in support of his claim but these cases are inapposite because they deal with the right of the defense to cross-examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>government witnesses who have appeared and testified. Although there may be reasons to suspect that the Government might have located Scott (or Sapp) had it wanted him,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> there is no decision which requires the Government to produce its informer in court. See United States v. Cimino, supra; Williams v. United States, 273 F.2d 781, 795-796 (9th Cir. 1959), cert. denied 362 U.S. 951, 80 S.Ct. 862, 4 L.Ed.2d 868 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">In support of his allegation that the Government knowingly used perjured testimony to bring about his conviction, D\u2019Ercole attached to his petition an affidavit made by another prisoner in which the affiant related conversations which he had with D\u2019Ercole\u2019s co-defendant, John Cimino, in which Cimino allegedly admitted to the affiant that he, Cimino, had been coerced by federal agents to implicate D\u2019Ercole and to testify against him, although the agents well knew that D\u2019Ercole was innocent. If what Cimino is supposed to have said was in fact true, then, of course, the appellant was denied due process under the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, and he would be entitled to relief under \u00a7 2255 and a new trial. The difficulty is that the affiant\u2019s statement of what John Cimino said does not qualify as proper evidential material to support a petition under \u00a7 2255 because it is hearsay and could not be used at a hearing. See United States v. Pisciotta, 199 F.2d 603, at 607 (2d Cir. 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">With regard to the claim of delay between the time of the discovery of the offense and the actual arrest of the appellant, this matter was at no time questioned before or during the appellant\u2019s trial and is now raised for the first time. As such an objection must be made at the latest at the time of trial, and perhaps even earlier, it is now too late. Cf. United States v. Lustman, 258 F.2d 475, 478 (2d Cir. 1958); United States v. Kelly, 349 F.2d 720, at 768 (2d Cir. 1965). The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-6\">. Judge Waterman\u2019s dissent in the original appeal, 321 F.2d at 512, fully discusses the peculiar unavailability of this particular informer in a number of cases where he was sought by defense counsel, and the strange ability of the Government to find him when it needed him. This issue, however, was fully considered upon the original appeal; and it cannot now be relitigated by way of \u00a7 2255.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
