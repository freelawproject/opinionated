Morgan on June 24, 1958. Morgan, who had made the application on May 16, 1957, assigned his patent rights to the corporate defendant, John E. Morgan Patents, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-18\">The defendants denied invalidity and asserted a counterclaim, in Count I, for damages for infringement by all but one of the plaintiffs, and, in Count II, for treble damages by reason of a group boycott by all plaintiffs in violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-19\">The district court held the patent invalid. 244 F.Supp. 219 (E.D.Pa. 1965). It found that the plaintiffs had engaged in an illegal group boycott, but concluded that since the patent was invalid, the patentee suffered no damage. 244 F.Supp. 235 (E.D.Pa.1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-20\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-21\">On review, we are of the opinion that the patent involved is valid, except claims 14-18 insofar as they relate to a process for finishing the knitted fabric. As to those claims, it is admitted that the process described was already known in the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-22\">The patent involved, called the \u201cMorgan Patent\u201d, is for a knitted fabric which because of its light weight and warmth is particularly suited for use in the production of such winter garments as \u201cthermal underwear\u201d. It is for a broad rib fabric knitted on \u201cweft\u201d (circular) knitting machines as opposed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u201cwarp\u201d knitting machines and is identifiable by the multitude of air-entrapping cells which are on both sides of the fabric. It is claimed that these cells keep their shape despite prolonged wear. By providing dead air spaces, it is claimed that the fabric achieves an enhanced insulating quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The sides of the air-entrapping cells are formed by the longitudinal ribs of the fabric; multiple tuck stitches form the bottom and top walls of these cells. These tuck stitches are utilized to break up the valleys and ribs of the broad rib fabric into individual air-entrapping cells.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the words of the patent claim \u201cwhen these tuck stitches are \u2018knitted off\u2019 the loops so formed are stretched between adjacent longitudinal ribs and function to draw these ribs together at spaced apart points along the length thereof. This serves to accentuate the cellular construction which is produced. At the same time, the tuck strands underlie the ribs and function to brace and maintain the height of these ribs when the fabric is stretched or subjected to prolonged wear.\u201d Additionally, the patent teaches that by knitting a tight fabric with heavy yam this will aid the cells in keeping their three-dimensional character.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Prior to the Morgan patent the only fabric to gain consumer acceptance as possessing the \u201cthermal\u201d qualities of light weight and warmth in cold weather was the \u201cRaschel\u201d fabric earlier developed by the Navy. This fabric, however, could only be produced on warp knitting machines. Consequently, knitters such as Morgan who had weft knitting machines which made circular knit fabrics had to buy their requirements from others. Morgan thus undertook the experimentation that resulted m his patent with the hope of developing an imitation of the Raschel fabric that could be made on a circular knit machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">Insofar-as the law of patentability is concerned, we only note the decisions of the Supreme Court in Graham v. John Deere Co., 381 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545, and United States v. Adams, 383 U.S. 39, 86 S.Ct. 708, 15 L.Ed.2d 572, both decided February 21, 1966, for exposition and application of currently effective principles. These, because of their recency and completeness, need not be reiterated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">We turn, then, to the determination of the validity of the Morgan Patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">Indefiniteness of the Claims</p>\n<p id=\"A4T\">The district court found the patent to be invalid because of the indefiniteness of the claims made by the patent. The court reached this conclusion because it found that the term \u201cheat-insulating\u201d as used in the patent specifications and claims was a relative and comparative term which did not meet the statutory requirement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">Regardless of the fact that the term \u201cheat-insulating\u201d may be one of degree, there is abundant evidence on this record taken as a whole that when one skilled in the art reads the Morgan Patent, he would be capable of producing the patented fabric and of determining the limits of the patent. As we interpret the statutory standard, this is all the inventor need show. 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-15\"> As succinctly stated by the Second Circuit in Georgia-Pacific Corporation v. United States Plywood Corporation, 258 F.2d 124 (2 Cir. 1958), cert. den. 358 U.S. 884, 79 S.Ct. 124, 3 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>112, the requirement of 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 112 serves two primary purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">\u201c * * * those skilled in the art must be able to understand and apply the teachings of the invention and enterprise and experimentation must not be discouraged by the creation of an area of uncertainty as to the scope of the invention. On the other hand, the policy of the patent statute contemplates granting protection to valid inventions, and this policy would be defeated if protection were to be accorded only to those patents which were capable of precise definition. The judicial function requires a balancing of these competing considerations in the individual case.\u201d (258 F.2d, at 136).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In performing this balancing, <em>Georgia-Pacific </em>teaches that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">\u201c * * * patentable inventions cannot always be described in terms of exact measurements, symbols and formulae, and the applicant necessarily must use the meager tools provided by language, tools which admittedly lack exactitude and precision. If the claims, read in the light of the specifications, reasonably apprise those skilled in the art both of the utilization and scope of the invention, and if the language is as precise as the subject matter permits the courts can demand no more.\u201d (258 F.2d, at 136)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The cases cited by the plaintiffs, General Electric Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 304 U.S. 364, 58 S.Ct. 899, 82 L.Ed. 1402 (1938); United Carbon Co. v. Binney &amp; Smith Co., 317 U.S. 228, 63 S.Ct. 165, 87 L.Ed. 232 (1942); Fisher &amp; Porter Co. v. Brooks Rotameter Co., 107 F.Supp. 1010 (E.D.Pa. 1952), aff\u2019d 211 F.2d 400 (3 Cir. 1954), cert. den. 348 U.S. 871, are not inapposite to the teachings of <em>Georgia-Pacific. </em>It is clear that each case presents a different question, and the rule is not a technical one, but one made to protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 witness Carroll Anderson testified that he believed the fabric put out by his company, Munsingwear, would infringe the Morgan Patent if the patent were upheld. We can assume that Anderson\u2019s willingness to make such a statement is based on his ability to determine the limits of the Morgan Patent. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness, Professor Shinn, also demonstrated ability to recognize the Morgan fabric. So also defendants\u2019 expert, Robert H. Lawson, was able to clearly identify an infringing fabric.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">The testimony of Professor Shinn on the issue of invention also supports a finding that one skilled in the art can read the patent so as to know that in addition to the stitch structure a knitter would utilize a tight knit and a heavy yam.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-14\">Anderson testified that he had no difficulty in understanding the Morgan Patent and that he could identify the Morgan fabric as well as infringements.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">The testimony of Mr. Lawson also illustrated that one skilled in the art can read the teachings of the patent without any reliance on the term, \u201cheat-insulating\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-16\">These references suffice for us to state, in summary, our conviction that the evidence shows that the patent teaches with sufficient conciseness how the invention might be put into use and also gives sufficient warning to the would-be infringer of the patent\u2019s limits. The fact that the patent also uses a term capable of only relative definition is not fatal. See Eibel Process Company v. Minnesota &amp; Ontario Paper Company, 261 U.S. 45, 43 S.Ct. 322, 67 L.Ed. 523 (1923); Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co. v. Hughes Tool Co., 97 F.2d 945 (10 Cir. 1938), cert. den. 305 U.S. 643, 59 S.Ct. 242, 83 L.Ed. 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The Prior Art</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The district court concluded that the Morgan Patent was anticipated in the prior art primarily on the basis of a fabric claimed to have been made by Carroll Anderson in 1933. But assuming similarity, more is required to constitute prior art under the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Reviser\u2019s Notes to Section 102, 35 U.S.C.A., make clear that the interpretation of \u201cknown\u201d by the courts assimilated it to \u201cpublicly known\u201d. See Pennock v. Dialogue, 27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 1, 7 L.Ed. 327 (1829).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The district court concluded that there was such a public knowledge and use because garments made from this Anderson fabric had allegedly hung on display racks in the Munsingwear Designs Division and that these racks were accessible to the public. Assuming that such a use is sufficient to meet the requirements of \u201cpublicly known,\u201d we conclude that the evidence is insufficient to support a finding of such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The defense of prior use is one that an alleged infringer, although free to raise, has the burden of persuasion. This burden is a heavy one, having been described by this Court as necessitating evidence that \u201cmust be so strong as to remove all reasonable doubt thereof.\u201d Smith v. Carter Carburetor Corporation, 130 F.2d 555, 560 (3 Cir., 1942). See also American Machine &amp; Foundry Company v. Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co., 172 F.Supp. 12, 16 (D.N.J.1959), aff\u2019d per curiam, 272 F.2d 451 (3 Cir.). Similarly, the Supreme Court has stated that every reasonable doubt should be resolved against the one who avers this defense. Washburn &amp; Moen Manufacturing Company v. Beat \u2019Em All Barbed Wire Company (\u201cThe Barbed Wire Patent Case\u201d), 143 U.S. 275, 284, 12 S.Ct. 443, 36 L.Ed. 154 (1892); Coffin v. Ogden, 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 120, 21 L.Ed. 821 (1874). In a more recent reappraisal, the Supreme Court, in Radio Corporation of America v. Radio Engineering Laboratories, Inc., 293 U.S. 1, 7, 8, 55 S.Ct. 928, 931, 79 L.Ed. 163 (1934) expressed itself thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYD\">\u201cA patent regularly issued, * * * is presumed to be valid until the presumption has been overcome by convincing evidence of error. * * * [It is the] common core of thought and truth, that one otherwise an infringer who assails the validity of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden of persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more than a dubious preponderance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AADC\">Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to meet this burden, by proving display of the Anderson fabric, rests upon the testimony of Anderson himself, and that of Ruth K. Friedman, Jenny M. Lindh, and Mary Przybylka, who were employees of Munsingwear at the time these garments were allegedly displayed. The district court in its opinion recognized that the disposition testimony of the three employees of Munsingwear was entitled to no probative weight (244 F.Supp., at 224).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">This leads us to recognize that the asserted \u201cpublic use\u201d rests solely upon the oral testimony of Anderson. The fact that plaintiffs seek to carry their burden solely on the basis of oral testimony is not necessarily fatal to their case. However, because of the nature of this testimony, this court is under a duty to scrutinize it very carefully. The rationale behind such close scrutiny was cogently stated in \u201cThe Barbed Wire Patent Case\u201d, supra, 143 U.S. at 284-285, 12 S.Ct. at 447:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-13\">\u201cWe have now to deal with certain unpatented devices, claimed to be complete anticipations of this patent, the existence and use of which are proven only by oral testimony. In view of the unsatisfactory character of such testimony, arising from the forgetfulness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>of witnesses, their liability to mistakes, their proneness to recollect things as the party calling them would have them recollect them, aside from the temptation to actual perjury, courts have not only imposed upon defendants [in infringement suits] the burden of proving such devices, but have required that the proof shall be clear, satisfactory, and beyond a reasonable doubt. Witnesses whose memories are prodded by the eagerness of interested parties to elicit testimony favorable to themselves are not usually to be depended upon for accurate information. The very fact, which courts as well as the public have not failed to recognize, that almost every important patent, from the cotton gin of Whitney to the one under consideration, has been attacked by the testimony of witnesses who imagined they had made similar discoveries long before the patentee had claimed to have invented his device, has tended to throw a certain amount of discredit upon all that class of evidence, and to demand that it be subjected to the closest scrutiny. Indeed, the frequency with which testimony is tortured, or fabricated outright, to build up the defense of a prior use of the thing patented, goes far to justify the popular impression that the inventor may be treated as the lawful prey of the infringer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Viewing Anderson\u2019s testimony in this light, we cannot say that plaintiffs\u2019 evidence sustains their burden. Three factors must be noted in support of this conclusion: (1) the length of time that has elapsed between the event and the date of trial: Anderson was testifying to a recollection that is, from the date of his depositions, approximately twenty-five years old and concerns a matter which was not then directly related to his particular line of work, (2) there is a lack of any corroborating evidence: swatches of the fabric with a 1933 date were introduced into evidence, but this is not proof that the material was made into garments or displayed. No company records were produced nor was any witness whose employment with Munsingwear at that time involved the making and displaying of garments. In other instances the latter factor alone has been sufficient for a finding of failure to carry the burden of proof. Jepson v. Egley, 231 F.2d 947, 953, 43 CCPA 853 (1956); American Machine &amp; Foundry Company v. Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co., supra; Radio Corporation of America v. Philco Corporation, 201 F.Supp. 135, 149 (E.D.Pa.1961), aff\u2019d per curiam, 309 F.2d 397 (3 Cir. 1962). Moreover, Anderson cannot be considered \u00e1 disinterested witness. He admitted that it was his belief, as well as that of Munsingwear officials, that the thermal wear fabric they were then producing infringed the Morgan Patent, that they were interested in nullifying the Morgan Patent, and that for these reasons they were assisting plaintiffs in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Further, Anderson\u2019s testimony as to the manufacture and display was not, as we view it, so clear that he was testifying from actual recollection on this score rather than from a reasoned belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">In these circumstances, it cannot be said with sufficient conviction to justify negation of a patent that the evidence sustains the defense of prior anticipation. Cf. General Radio Company v. The Superior Electric Company, 321 F.2d 857 (3 Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 938, 84 S.Ct. 793, 11 L.Ed.2d 659, wherein we specifically found corroboration of oral testimony, and cited Smith, Ex\u2019r v. Hall, 301 U.S. 216, 57 S.Ct. 711, 81 L.Ed. 1049 (1937), indicating the decisive significance of corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Lack op Invention</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The essence of the Morgan invention is the air-entrapping cells, which keep their shape even after prolonged wear, on both sides of a broad rib circular knit fabric. This is achieved through multiple tucking, utilizing heavy yarn and tight stitching. Such cells are present in the \u201cRaschel\u201d fabric, but Morgan claims to be the first to produce this effect in a circular knit fabric. The district court concluded this result would have been ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>vious at the time to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">The standard of invention was codified in 1952 and is set out in 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 103.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This section was not meant to establish a new standard but merely to codify prior case law. This is the conclusion reached by the Supreme Court in Graham v. John Deere Co., supra. The court there reasoned that Congress had hoped by codifying the standard to emphasize \u201cnon-obviousness\u201d as the operative test of the section, rather than the less definite \u201cinvention\u201d language of Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 11 How. 248, 13 L.Ed. 683 (1850).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><em>Graham </em>also makes clear that the \u201cflash of genius\u201d theory has no place in the requirement of invention. At footnote 7 of the opinion, the Court indicated that the theory originated from a misunderstanding of its opinion in Cuno Engineering Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp., 314 U.S. 84, 62 S.Ct. 37, 86 L.Ed. 58 (1941), and that <em>Cuno </em>merely required that the device, and not the method, display invention. This is the view we entertained in R. M. Palmer Company v. Luden\u2019s Inc., 236 F.2d 496 (3 Cir. 1956). There we said that patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made but that rather the court must look at the end product to see whether a step beyond the prior art has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Admittedly, Morgan was not a skilled knitter, and many of the steps and experiments he performed were necessitated by this lack of skill. Regardless of the nature of his struggles, it is the end product that matters, and if this product advances the art a significant step, there is invention so long as that step is not obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art. The district court ignored the end product to concentrate on the inventor\u2019s technique. This can be observed in the court\u2019s own language: \u201cIt is the means by which the idea is reduced to practice which must contain the elements of inventiveness as distinguished from mechanical skill and know how.\u201d 244 F.Supp. at 225. This strikes too closely to the \u201cflash of genius\u201d theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Examining the prior art, the district court concluded that the Morgan Patent was obvious at the time to one of ordinary skill in the art of knitting. The state of the prior art as found by the district court (Findings No. 42 and No. 43) consisted of the Raschel fabric, a \u201c2 X 2 rib knit fabric with at least two tuck stitches on the front and no tuck stitches on the back\u201d and \u201ca 2 X 2 rib knit fabric with pockets or cells formed on one side by plural tuck stitches and with one tuck stitch on the other side.\u201d The court then concluded that to one of ordinary skill, given this prior state of the art, it would be obvious how to make the Morgan Patent by utilizing multiple tucking in such a way as to form cell pockets on both sides of the rib knit fabric. We cannot agree with this conclusion and find it to be error insofar as it is based on the testimony of Carroll Anderson and Professor Shinn.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">While Anderson testified that given the prior art the Morgan Patent is obvious, his own experiments in 1952 and 1957 were unsuccessful and his own company decided to copy the Morgan fabric. There is also his deposition testimony, which was, however, denied by Anderson at the trial, that when he claimed the Morgan idea became obvious to him, he was already familiar with the Morgan Patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">Professor Shinn, a recognized expert in the knitting field, with considerably more' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>skill than the ordinary knitter, was unable to offer one constructive suggestion to inquiries concerning the manufacture of a Raschel type of fabric on a circular machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Here are two skilled knitters testifying to obviousness where one of them failed to produce the result through his own experimentation and the other did not offer constructive suggestions toward a solution. Where before the disclosure of a patent, two experts <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> are unable to foresee the solution provided by the patent, an inference of nonobviousness is not without justification. See Honolulu Oil Corporation v. Shelby Poultry Company, 293 F.2d 127, 131 (4 Cir. 1961). Cf. United States v. Adams, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The evidence indicates that given the state of the prior art as found by the district court the Morgan invention is not obvious to one of ordinary skill in the knitting art, and that the invention represents a significant advance in the knitting field.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">We do not rest this conclusion merely on the negative inferences to be drawn from the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 experts, but also note the commercial success of the Morgan fabric, the long felt need for the invention, and the availability of the tools to produce the invention and the failure of others to achieve the result. The relevancy of such considerations is acknowledged in the statement of the Supreme Court in Graham v. John Deere Co., supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">\u201cSuch secondary considerations as commercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, failure of others, etc., might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject matter sought to be patented. As indicia of obviousness or nonobviousness, these inquiries may have relevancy. See Note, Subtests of \u2018Nonobviousness,\u2019 112 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1169 (1964).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Such consideration failed to tip the scales in favor of patentability in a companion case to Graham (86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d, at 561) (plastic finger sprayer), but in United States v. Adams, supra, these factors were used to support a finding of nonobviousness (86 S.Ct. 708, 15 L.Ed.2d, at 580-581). See also, Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Company v. E. F. Drew &amp; Co., 237 F.2d 594, 596 (3 Cir. 1956); Reiner v. I. Leon Co., 285 F.2d 501, 504 (2 Cir. 1960), cert. den. 366 U.S. 929, 81 S.Ct. 1649, 6 L.Ed.2d 388 (1961); Allen v. Standard Crankshaft &amp; Hydraulic Company, 323 F.2d 29, 34 (4 Cir. 1963); Copease Manufacturing Co. v. American Photocopy Equipment Co. &amp; Poray, Inc., 298 F.2d 772, 781 (7 Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">There is abundant and uncontradicted evidence, much of it supplied by plaintiffs\u2019 own witnesses, that while the tools existed to produce the Morgan fabric for a number of years and there was a real need for such a fabric no one came up with a commercially successful product until Morgan. We have already considered the evidence relating to the state of the prior art and the failure of two skilled knitters to arrive at or suggest in any manner a solution. That there was a need for a solution is well documented. Circular knit underwear mills were forced to buy their requirements from Raschel manufacturers and let their own machines stand idle. Thus there was great interest in the 1950\u2019s to develop a circular knit imitation of the Raschel fabric. Finally, there is the overriding commercial success of the Morgan fabric. The fabric was desired by the underwear salesmen and copied by competing manufacturers.

Through the parties\u2019 use of the blackboard and their actual operation of the various types of knitting machines, the mechanics of commercial knitting, certainly of importance to the understanding of the problem at issue, were visually demonstrated to the District Court. With the benefit of these proofs, after listening to the testimony of the witnesses, and after considering the contents of the depositions, briefs and proposed findings submitted by both sides, it made fifty-three findings of fact and three conclusions of law, resolving the conflicts in the evidence in favor of, and holding for, the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">Though error is found in one of the legal propositions employed by the District Court in deciding the question of invention, the thrust of the majority opinion is to question both the accuracy of and the weight to be given, findings of fact bearing on all three conclusions of law. Finding both inadequacies in the District Court\u2019s handling of the facts, and an error of law, the majority reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-15\">In attacking the District Court\u2019s determination in such a manner, the majority, itself, must be convinced that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority, in my view, has ruled quite properly that the facts support neither the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Morgan patent is indefinite nor its conclusion that there was a public display of prior art indicative of an anticipation of the Morgan patent. However, on the District Court\u2019s legal conclusion that the Morgan patent is invalid for want of invention, because the process and fabric, the subject matter of the patent, is obvious to one skilled in the art, I am obliged to question whether the majority has demonstrated the clear error in the factual findings it attacks, and whether there has been a recognition of a number of findings directly supportive of this conclusion of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b511-17\">The majority is critical of the District Court\u2019s conclusion that, given the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>of the prior art, it would have been obvious to Morgan how to utilize multiple tucking in such a way as to form cell pockets on both sides of the rib. knit fabric. Error is found in the District Court\u2019s conclusion, \u201cinsofar as it is based on the testimony of Carroll Anderson and Professor Shinn,\u201d due to the failure of both Anderson and Shinn to produce, or suggest a method for the production of, a Raschel imitation on a circular machine. The majority draws an adverse inference therefrom and thus repudiates Anderson\u2019s and Shinn\u2019s credibility. Such action at the appellate level may only be justified by the absence of evidence upon which the District Court could have reasonably chosen to believe their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">As to Anderson, the majority finds his failure to produce a Raschel imitation in 1952 and 1957, and an alleged conflict between his deposition and oral testimony concerning when he first knew of Morgan\u2019s work, sufficient to negate any belief in his testimony that, given the state of the prior art, the Morgan patent was obvious to one skilled in the art. Such a conclusion is reached despite at least tacit acceptance by the majority that Anderson had in 1933 made a fabric on a circular knitting machine which was in accordance with the knitting sequence of the Morgan patent. The majority expressed an objection to the line of evidence on this point only because the appellees failed to sustain their burden of showing that the fabric was <em>publicly displayed </em>in 1933, which was found to be the ground for disallowing this prior art as an anticipation of the Morgan patent, a conclusion with which I have expressed agreement. But this is an issue separate and distinct from the evidential value the Anderson 1933 fabric may be given on the issue of obviousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">The District Court in its finding of fact No. 19 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> determines that Anderson produced a like fabric in 1933, a finding which is not contested and is amply supported in the record. In that finding as well as in findings No. 24, No. 26, No. 27 and No. 28 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, the District Court underlines the basic similarity between the Anderson and Morgan fabrics. It determines in finding No. 31<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, also amply supported by the record, that the differences between the Anderson and Morgan fabrics were matters of degree, such as the tightness of the knitting. And in findings No. 21 and No. 22 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, the manner in which the Anderson fabric was put away in Munsingwear\u2019s files for any possible future use is described. All of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>findings were based on evidence properly before the District Court and, in so adjudicating them, it stated that \u201c [irrespective of whether the Anderson fabric is prior art, it certainly can be cited to indicate a lack of invention by Morgan.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In view of the substantial evidence in support of such consideration, I am moved to give it appropriate weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The District Court obviously felt the evidence concerning the production of the Anderson fabric in 1933 more persuasive than the attempt to repudiate Anderson as a witness by turning his 1952 and 1957 failures against him. One basic reason for this is given in finding of fact No. 46.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In that finding the District Court determined that Anderson did in fact succeed again, in 1958, in producing a Raschel imitation, through the technique of multiple tucking on both the dial and cylinder sides of the circular knitting machine, and without reference to either the Morgan patent or a swatch of the Morgan fabric. Such a finding minimizes the evidential value of the 1952 and 1957 failures.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In accepting appellant\u2019s argument, that Anderson\u2019s deposition contradicts his oral testimony that he produced his 1958 fabric without reference to either the Morgan patent or a swatch of the Morgan fabric <footnotemark>8</footnotemark>, the majority overlooks two facets to the problem. First, even assuming the existence of the contradiction, the District Court had the right both to accept the oral statement over that in the deposition, and to have that choice respected by an appellate court. Second, Anderson\u2019s redirect testimony<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> itself clears up any doubt as to the presence of a contradiction between his deposition and oral statement, and underlines that it was only subsequent to his producing a Raschel imitation in 1958 that he became familiar with the Morgan fabric and patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">The record thus amply supports the District Court's acceptance of Anderson as a knowledgeable witness on the question of obviousness. Even more importantly, Anderson\u2019s successes at producing a Raschel imitation on a circular knitting machine provide independent evidence of the obviousness of the Morgan patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">As to the majority\u2019s attack on Professor Shinn\u2019s expertise, the fact that he, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>answer to inquiries concerning the possible imitation of the Raschel fabric on circular knitting machines, was unable to offer a suggestion as to the manner in which the circular machines could be programmed to imitate Raschel, certainly justifies an inference of nonobviousness of the Morgan patent, just as another factor, such as the existence of the Anderson fabric, justifies an inference of obviousness. Neither category of inferences is conclusive on the question of invention. The District Court did not consider Professor Shinn\u2019s failure to offer constructive suggestions to the problem of critical importance. In light of the evidence concerning the 1933 and 1958 Anderson fabrics, as well as other factors relied upon, which will be discussed below, the District Court, in my view, did not abuse its prerogatives in failing to give this factor decisive weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Aside from the findings relating to Anderson\u2019s success in producing a fabric akin to that claimed in the Morgan patent, the District Court made other findings of fact as to the state of the art, based on the record, which support the conclusion that the Morgan claims were obvious to one skilled in the art. A bit of further background material is in order. The circular rib knitting machine functions by the conjunctive operation of two banks of needles, the dial and the cylinder sides. The Raschel flat bed machine product was imitated by Morgan and Anderson through the technique of multiple tucking on both the dial and cylinder sides of the circular machine. Such tucking on both sides produced the air entrapping cells which gave the circular fabric its thermal characteristics, making it competitive with Raschel.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">As against this background the District Court found in finding No. 40 that certain aspects of circular machine operation were well established in the knitting art. It had long been known that in knitting with the circular machines, the same operations could be performed on both the dial and cylinder sides of those machines, so as to give the same effect on both faces of the fabric.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It was also well known to persons skilled in the art that the tucking in a circular rib knit fabric acted as crossbars to give a waffle or pocketed effect, such tucking inherently performing the functions of bracing and stabilizing the fabric and thus limiting its width-wise stretch, albeit to a lesser or greater degree depending upon the tightness of the knitting. This is the substantiated conclusion of findings No. 35 and No. 37.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Findings No. 40, No. 35, and No. 37, together with other support in the record, wholly justify finding No. <em>32</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>that prior to the Morgan patent it was well known in the art to knit circular rib knit fabrics with plural successive tucks on either the dial or cylinder side, or on both. It is further strengthened by evidence of concrete examples of such art<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> found by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>In this state of the commercial knitting art, at the time of the Morgan patent, what appears to have been the problem concerning the production of a <em>thermal </em>fabric on a circular knitting machine? An examination of the references to the record embodied in a portion of finding No. 16<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> indicates the following: Morgan viewed his problem as one of adjusting the machine to both tucking a heavy yarn three times on the cylinder side as well as the dial side and producing a fabric which would be tightly knit. He admitted that if a lighter weight yarn were to be used there would not be any problem with multiple tucking on both the dial and cylinder sides. The problem was not one of developing a new stitch arrangement. He, in effect, explains his contribution as the use of the heavy yarn and the element of tight knitting with known stitching patterns by adjusting the machine to both handle the tucking of the heavy yam on the dial and cylinder sides and to allow for a tight knit. As indicated in finding No. 38<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>, it is thus the weight of the yarn and the tightness of the knit, rather than a unique stitching development, which enhances the thermal quality inherent to a greater or lesser degree in any circular knit fabric having pockets formed by tuck stitches. This is further illuminated by the District Court\u2019s findings indicating that Morgan referred to the stitching techniques of the long known so-called waffle fabrics as a basis for his work in 1956.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The thrust of the Morgan patent, however, is directed to the stitch programming of the circular rib knit machine. References to machine adjustment are scanty and, as the District Court points out in finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>No 16<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>, machine adjustment is even characterized therein as obvious. With all the above-mentioned technological material before it, ample evidence emerges from this record to support the finding that Morgan\u2019s achievement was merely a mechanical act of machine adjustment to known knitting techniques and, therefore, obvious to one skilled in the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The majority, besides resting on certain negative inferences which it draws from the testimony of appellees\u2019 experts, points to the commercial success of the Morgan fabric, the long felt need for the invention, and the availability of tools to produce the invention. It acknowledged, however, that these factors, as well as that of the failure of others skilled in the art to produce the subject matter of the patent, are merely secondary considerations, which may, in some instances, certainly be indices of obviousness or nonobviousness and, therefore, relevant. In the words of the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">\u201c * * * These legal inferences or subtests do focus attention on economic and motivational rather than technical issues * * *. Such inquiries may lend a helping hand to the judiciary * * *. They may also serve to \u2018guard against slipping into hindsight,\u2019 * * * and to resist the temptation to read into the prior art the teachings of the invention in issue.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">In effect they serve as the factors which tip the balance in cases where the technological elements do not alone point, with a degree of reason, to the disposition of the issue of inventiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">As is set forth in the above discussion, there appears to be substantial technological evidence in the record in support of the District Court\u2019s determination of obviousness. Thus, this is not a case where the secondary factors are particularly helpful. And, it also seems that certain of these collateral factors have been overemphasized, for example, the evidence of market demand. Despite the alleged idleness of the industry\u2019s' circular machines and the claimed years of need for a Raschel substitute, it was not until May, 1956 that Morgan started his off and on experimentation. The inferences to be drawn from the secondary factors, such as this one, are mixed, at their very best. And even if considered as strongly favoring appellant, in my view, would not serve to offset the District Court\u2019s amply supported technological findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-16\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b517-17\">The majority finds that the District Court\u2019s statement \u2014 \u201cIt is the means by which the idea is reduced to practice which must contain the elements of inventiveness as distinguished from mechanical skill and know how,\u201d \u2014 misconceives the applicable legal standard on the question of invention. Such an approach is found to strike \u201ctoo closely to the \u2018flash of genius\u2019 theory.\u201d The majority is of the view that the District Court by this statement has ignored the end product and has concentrated erroneously on the inventor\u2019s technique of experimentation as being adversely determinative. I, however, do not read the District Court\u2019s statement to resurrect an approximation of the discredited flash of genius theory. On the contrary, the District Court\u2019s immediately preced<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>ing remarks seem to recognize that experimentation does not detract from invention and, in this case is to be admired.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As I read it, the statement to which objection is made is but a reiteration of a portion of the introductory paragraph to the District Court\u2019s discussion on lack of invention, in which paragraph it carefully pointed out that in considering the merits of any <em>end product </em>\u201cmere skill is not invention\u201d and there is a \u201cdistinction between mechanical skill and invention.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The emphasis placed by the District .Court on the necessity of some element of discovery being present was expressly approved in Graham v. John Deere Co.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The majority, itself, recognizes that the Supreme Court, in explaining its much misunderstood opinion in Cuno Engineering Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp.,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> emphasized that \u201cthe subject matter sought to be patented must be beyond the skill of the calling\u201d and that, properly considered, <em>Cuno </em>teaches that \u201cthe device, not the [method of] invention * * * had to reveal the \u2018flash of creative genius\u2019.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Court in <em>Graham </em>also quoted approvingly from its leading case of Hotchkiss v. Greenwood: <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">\u201c[U]nless more ingenuity and skill * * * were required than were possessed by an ordinary mechanic acquainted with the business, there was an absence of that degree of skill and ingenuity which constitute essential elements of every invention. In other words, the improvement is the work of a skilled mechanic, not that of the inventor.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">And in characterizing the relationship between <em>Hotchkiss </em>and Section 103 of 35 U.S.C. the Supreme Court emphasized that \u201cwhile the clear language of \u00a7 103 places emphasis on an inquiry into obviousness, the general level of innovation necessary to sustain patentability remains the same.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">The District Court recognized all the difficult problems inherent in a case such as this. Its conclusion of law on lack of invention is governed by the standard of obviousness.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Its textual discussion on this question of inventiveness contains a number of specific references to obviousness as being determinative, along with an explicit recognition of the manner in which hindsight as a vantage point may distort the process of judging whether an alleged invention is obvious.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> I cannot agree that the statement singled out by the majority, when read either alone, or with the other components of the District Court\u2019s opinion is indicative that this case was decided on a legal theory approximating that of the discredited \u201cflash of genius\u201d. On the contrary, the District Court merely recognized the factor which <em>Hotchkiss </em>first spelled out, <em>Cuno </em>later embellished, and <em>Graham </em>more recently has approved, namely, that an element of discovery is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>essential to patentability; that be it associated with the idea or the end result, the idea\u2019s reduction to practice, mechanical skill and know how without the requisite element of discovery will not suffice to make the end product patentable.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Finding no error of law on the issue of invention and ample support in the record for the District Court\u2019s factual findings of both Anderson\u2019s success in producing a Raschel imitation and the mechanical nature of Morgan\u2019s efforts, this court does not, in my view, have a sufficient basis upon which to overturn the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Morgan patent was obvious to one skilled in the art and, thus, not invention. I, therefore, find myself in respectful disagreement with the conclusion of the majority that the judgment of the District Court should be reversed. I would affirm it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-11\">. Hazeltine Corporation v.

[PX 151, p. 135; N.T. 974], Mr. Anderson had seen the Morgan patent at the time the DX 99 fabric was adopted for sale, but he had not seen it or any corresponding fabric at the time the DX 99 fabric was initially made.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b513-14\">.

Finding of Fact No. 40 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">\u201c40. It has long been known in the art that in knitting with rib machines the same operations can be performed on both faces of the fabric so as to give the same effect on both faces of the fabric, and specifically that groups of adjacent tuck strands could be formed on each face of a rib knit fabric.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">\u201c[N.T. 1305; PX 200, p. 138, example IX; N.T. 1178-1181; PX 208, p. 3, lower right-hand figure].\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b514-9\">. Ibid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">\u201c35.

Prior to tbe time when the alleged invention was made, there was nothing new or unobvious in using either single or plural tuck strands in a rib knit fabric to brace or stabilize the fabric and thus limit its widthwise stretch. Regardless of the purpose for which tuck strands are used, they inherently perform this function in a lesser or greater degree depending upon the tightness of knitting. [N.T. 1369, 1370, 1519, 1523, 1533, 1534, 1547, 1548, 1550-1553, 1613, 1614], Furthermore, tucks for this specific purpose have been known since at least 1907, the date of publication of the German patent PX 192, 192A. This specific purpose or function is stated on pages 1, 2 and 7 of the translation, PX 192A. Therefore, neither the bracing purpose nor the bracing function of the tuck stitches as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>described in the Morgan patent is novel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Appellant claims that finding No. 37 is in error for Professor Shinn testified that tucking in certain fabrics called snuggies does not brace the ribs of the fabric to limit widthwise stretch, and that it was testified that tucks were incorporated in snuggies merely to shape the fabric and add a little bulk. Appellant misconceives the import of finding No. 37. All the District Court determined was that \u201cin a lesser or greater degree depending upon the tightness of the knitting\u201d would one produce such an effect. In snuggies, with their loose knit, <em>effective </em>bracing and stabilization would not be expected, and the District Court did not find otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b515-6\">.

In the prior art publication PX 200, the fabric on page 138 designated as \u2018Double French Rack\u2019, example IX, is a rib knit fabric having multiple tucks on each face in adjacent groups. As shown in the knitting diagram on page 138, the dial needles tuck for two courses while the rib needles knit; then for one course both the dial and cylinder needles knit; then the cylinder needles tuck for two courses while the dial needles knit; then for one course both the dial and cylinder needles knit; and then the sequence is repeated. The example specifies that the yarn be 9\u00cd4S worsted, which would result in a heavy fabric. [N.T. 1097, 1101]. The multiple tuck strands would limit the widthwise stretch of the fabric and would add to the warmth-giving properties of the fabric. [N.T. 1552],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-11\">\u201cThe fabric described on page 138 of PX 200 is a 1 X 1 rib, which is stated in the patent to be within the scope of the invention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-12\">\u201c44. There are in evidence two fabrics made by Michael LaOorte, a knitter for Beaunit Mills, Inc., prior to 1953. The fabrics, their knitting diagrams, and a stipulation of counsel were combined as PX 299. The fabrics were made while Mr. LaOorte was \u2018fooling around\u2019 with a knitting machine. He thought they were attractive, and might be useful as either outerwear or underwear. For this reason he saved the swatches. The fabrics were never manufactured or sold. The fabrics have three tucks on one side and one tuck on the other side and are a 2 X 2 rib setup. These fabrics have a waffle effect, or pockets, or cells, etc., at least on the side which incorporates the multiple tuck stitches. These are \u2018air-entrapping cells\u2019 constructed in the exact manner disclosed in the Morgan patent. The only difference between these fabrics and the Morgan patent is that these fabrics incorporate one tuck stitch or strand on one side whereas the Morgan patent discloses two or more tuck stitches or strands.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-13\">\u201c45. The fabric of DX 1 is a 2 X 2 rib knit fabric having three consecutive tucks on the dial side and no tucks on the cylinder side. [DX 226, p. 69]. This fabric was made by Lloyd Kranz, knitter for Jones Knitting Corporation, in his spare time and was completed around December, 1956. Mr. Kranz did not see any fabric manufactured by Morgan until at least August, 1957.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-14\">\u201c[DX 226, pp. 71, 72, 73, 122].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-15\">\u201c47. Back in 1935 or 1936, Emmitt Murray made a rib knit fabric having a plurality of tuck stitches on each side. Specifically the fabric had ribs on one side which were three needles wide and ribs on the other side which were two needles wide. There were at least two successive tuck stitches bridging the valleys on each side of the fabric. [N.T. 1197-1199]. The knitting diagram for the fabric is set forth in the document PX 223, and specifically on the page marked as PX 223a. A revised knitting diagram in the form shown in the Morgan patent is in evidence as PX <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>280.

The existence of the stipulation, however, would seem to preclude any attack on the truth of the subject matter of the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Appellant also attacks No. 47, on the ground that the fabric itself was not produced, merely an undated entry in a notebook and the recollection of a witness, Murray.
