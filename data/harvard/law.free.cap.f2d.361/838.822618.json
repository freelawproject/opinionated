PHILLIPS, Circuit Judge r</author>\n<p id=\"AQp\">Ta\u00f1os, a use plaintiff, obtained a money judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico on July 3, 1962, which became final. He thereafter instituted this action in garnishment in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, naming St. Paul Mercury Insurance Company<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as garnishee. The writ of garnishment was issued and was served upon the Insurance Company by a Florida county sheriff. The court sustained the Insurance Company\u2019s motion to quash the service of the writ on the ground that the sheriff was not authorized to serve the writ. Thereafter, Ta\u00f1os caused a second writ of garnishment to be issued, which was served on the Insurance Company by the United States Marshal. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>garnishee filed an answer to the writ, denying it was indebted to the judgment debtor, or had in its possession any money, goods, chattels, credits, or effects of the judgment debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">The Insurance Company was the surety on a supersedeas bond, given to supersede a judgment running in favor of the judgment debtor. The judgment had become final. Other persons were claiming the amount due on such judgment, adversely to the judgment debtor. After the service of the first garnishment writ had been quashed and prior to the time the second writ of garnishment was served, the Insurance Company had obtained an order from a state court permitting it to deposit in the registry of such court the full amount due on the superseded judgment, and the Insurance Company had so deposited such amount. Accordingly, at the time the second writ of garnishment was served, the Insurance Company was no longer indebted to the judgment debtor. From a summary judgment in favor of the Insurance Company, Ta\u00f1os has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The sole question presented is whether the court erred in quashing the service of the first writ of garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Rule 1.3(c) of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure (30 F.S.A., page 18) in part here material provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-7\">\u201c(c) <em>Service </em>\u2014 By <em>Whom Made. </em>Service of process may be made by any officer authorized by law to serve process; but if such officer shall, for any reason be disqualified or unable to act, the Court may appoint any competent person not interested in the case on trial to serve such process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADN\">Rule 4(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in part here material provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAL\">\u201c(c) <em>By Whom Served. </em>Service of <em>all </em>process shall be made by a United States marshal, by his deputy, or by some person specially appointed by the court for that purpose, * * Italics ours.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Rule 64 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in part here pertinent provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-12\">\u201cAt the commencement of and during the course of an action, all remedies providing for seizure of person or property for the purpose of securing satisfaction of the judgment ultimately to be entered in the action are available under the circumstances and in the mannerprovided by the law of the state in which the district court is held, existing at the time the remedy is sought, subject to the following qualifications: (1) any existing statute of the United States governs to the extent to which it is applicable; * * *.

BROWN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A0J\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">In spite of the fact that the Federal Rules dealing with service of process, F.R.Civ.P. 4, and garnishment, F.R.Civ.P. 64 and 69,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> have been consistently amended to allow resort tcrstate procedure in the Federal District Courts, and in spite of the fact that the Appellee-Garnishee got all the notice it was entitled to under Florida, and federal, law, the Court, by relying on two easily distinguishable Tenth Circuit decisions and without much mention of the law of Florida applicable to the facts of this case, holds that it makes a difference whether the writ of garnishment issued by the Clerk of the Federal Court is delivered by a man wearing a star-shaped, five-pointed rather than a shield-shaped, eagle-topped badge. Believing that the Rules do not require such a formalistic, ritualistic distinction, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion that the United States Marshall and only the United States Marshal must serve such a writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-17\">Before explaining why I must dissent, I deem it appropriate and necessary to add these undisputed record facts to the majority\u2019s description of the events which give rise to this appeal. First, Ta\u00f1os\u2019 affidavit application for the issuance of the original writ of garnishment did not request that the Clerk of the District Court address it to any Florida Sheriff. Nevertheless, the Clerk, who is authorized to issue the writ by virtue of Rule 4(a) and 77(c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> expressly directed the writ \u201cTO THE UNITED STATES MARSHAL, AND OR THE SHERIFFS AND CONSTABLES OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, the Florida sher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>iff to whom the writ was delivered<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> served the writ, not upon the Insurance Company, but upon the State Insurance Commissioner <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as required by the terms of the writ<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Florida law under which there was one and only one way the Insurance Company could have been served, and that was by substituted service upon the Commissioner who then had to mail a copy of the writ to a person designated by the Company.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The process server, neither seeking nor seeing any official of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>the Insurance Company, was thus two steps removed from the defendant: (1) the Insurance Commissioner and (2) the United States postman. Third, on the same day that the Insurance Commissioner received the writ and acknowledged thereon \u201cService of the within WRIT OF GARNISHMENT accepted by me on behalf of the garnishees, ST. PAUL MERCURY INSURANCE COMPANY,\u201d he sent a copy of the writ, together with a statement that the writ had been served on him by the sheriff, by registered mail to the Insurance Company\u2019s president.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">From these additional facts \u2014 presumably not considered by the Court \u2014 it is clear that we are here dealing with a case of substituted, rather than personal, service of process. Since the Insurance Company does not claim any impropriety in the action of the Insurance Commissioner or any deficiency in the notice it promptly received from him, and since substituted service on the Commissioner is the sole method by which an insurance company can be served under Florida law, the sole question boils down to this: does it make any difference under Rule 4(c) whether the United States Marshal or the Florida Sheriff delivers the writ of garnishment to the State Insurance Commissioner whose function is then to send it on by mail which he did? <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">The purpose of service of process being notice to the parties involved, where personal service is required there might be justification for a strict application of the demand of Rule 4(c) that process be served by a Marshal or by someone specially appointed by the District Court to serve process.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For personal service is required in order to give actual notice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>demanding that such service be made by a person of integrity and experience not only protects the defendant from harassment by overzealous or unscrupulous process-servers, but assures the Court, through the server\u2019s return, that the proper person was actually notified of the pending litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">But this is not a case of personal service. This is a case of substituted service on a State officer as the defendant\u2019s statutory agent for service of process. And substituted service does not have to give actual notice so long as it provides reasonable probability of such notice. Service upon the Insurance Commissioner as the defendant\u2019s statutory but otherwise fictional agent is effective and binding provided that he promptly forwards by mail to the person designed by the defendant a copy of the process so served. The person so designated need not be an agent of the defendant, and it makes no difference that the person so designated then fails to notify the defendant. Actual notice is immaterial. The Court need only assure itself that there is a reasonable probability that the defendant was notified, and this assurance is provided by the Commissioner\u2019s acknowledgment that he has accepted service on behalf of the defendant and by the presumption\u2014 here unchallenged \u2014 that the Commissioner forwarded<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a copy of the writ as the law requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The process server never sees, never looks for, the defendant. His job is easy. He need only deliver a copy of the writ to the Insurance Commissioner\u2019s office in a Florida State office building. Indeed, he fails in his job if he goes elsewhere and seeks out the defendant insurer (see note 7, supra). There is no danger that he will serve the wrong person, for there is only one Insurance Commissioner and the location of his office is common knowledge. There is no danger that he will misrepresent the fact that he has actually made service, for the Court has before it the written acknowledgment of this responsible State official that a copy of the writ has actually been received. And the person designated by the defendant to receive a copy of the writ receives the same copy and same notice regardless of how the writ comes into the hands of the Commissioner \u2014 whether it is delivered there by the Marshal, the sheriff, or for that matter, even the postman.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">I simply cannot discover any purpose to be served by insisting that the Marshal and only the Marshal physically go to the office of the Commissioner and personally hand him the writ, and I thus see no reason for giving Rule 4(c) such a hyper-technical interpretation to reach such a sterile result.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Certainly the Tenth Circuit decisions in Rumsey v. George E. Failing Co., 10 Cir., 1964, 333 F.2d 960, and Mid-Continent Cas. Co. v. Everett, 10 Cir., 1965, 340 F.2d 65, both of which I accept, do not compel or even suggest such a result. In general these eases hold that, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>extent other Federal Rules are applicable in supplementary proceeding under Rule 69(a), these other provisions rather than state law govern the procedure to be followed. I agree. But in these cases there was no question as to the sufficiency of the service of the writ of garnishment. The problem there arose because the Garnishee mailed his answer to the Garnishor as provided in F.R.Civ.P. 5(b) instead of personally serving it upon him as required by Kansas law. Although the Court used some language to the effect that the Federal Rules are controlling,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the sole issue it had to decide was whether Kansas law was controlling. It held only that delivering the answer to the Garnishor pursuant to Rule 5(b) was permissible. It did not hold that following the Kansas procedure would be impermissible.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Rwmsey, </em>the Court expressly stated: \u201cIn the instant case we need go no further in determining to what extent the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are applicable in supplementary proceedings.\u201d 333 F.2d at 962. And in <em>Mid-Continent </em>the Court likewise went no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Thus, it is obvious that neither of these decisions are controlling, unless, that is, we are willing, Which I am not, to change \u201cmay\u201d to \u201cmust\u201d and \u201c5(b)\u201d to \u201c4(c)\u201d in the Court\u2019s holding that where 5(b) is applicable, it may be followed in lieu of the state procedure. I agree that the Marshal could have served the writ of garnishment on the Insurance Commissioner in this case. But our question is whether the sheriff could likewise do so. The only case cited by the parties<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which addresses itself to this question, clearly holds that he could. Ospina v. Vanelli, D.Minn., 1964, 34 F.R.D. 151.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201c But putting this case to one side, and accepting for the moment the proposition that Rule 4(c) \u201cmust\u201d be followed to the extent that it is applicable in supplemen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>tary proceedings, I nevertheless would sustain the service in this case for the simple reason that 4(c) is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">To summarize, my argument runs as follows: Rule 69(a) demands that state procedure be followed except to the extent that 4(c) is applicable. Rule 4(e) provides that \u201c[w] hen ever a statute or rule of court of the state in which the district court is held provides (1) for service of a summons * * * upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the state, * * * service may * * * be made under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed in the statute or rule.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> How can 4(c) and 4(e) be reconciled? The Courts and commentators agree that while 4(e) controls the manner of service, 4(c) prescribes who shall make the service if, and only if, the manner of service under 4(e), and thus state law, must be <em>personal. </em>If state law does not require personal service, if constructive or substituted service involving only posting, publishing, or mailing is provided for by state law, then 4(c) is inapplicable and the Marshal need play no part.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>1 have already made clear that Florida requires substituted service upon the Insurance Commissioner in this case. See note 7, supra. The problem then boils down to this: is personal service upon the Insurance Commissioner an essential element of the substituted service provided for in \u00a7 624.0222? Put in another way, would it have been enough under Florida law if the Insurance Commissioner received the writ of garnishment through the mail rather than from the hands of the sheriff? Although the Florida <em>Erie </em>lights are dim, an examination of Florida law and decisions from other jurisdictions leads me to the conclusion that, contrary to the assumption of the majority and even Appellant, personal service upon the Insurance Commissioner is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Section 624.0222(1) provides that \u201c[sjerviee of process upon the commissioner as process agent of the insurer (under \u00a7 642.0221) shall be made by serving copies in triplicate of the process upon the commissioner,\u201d but it does not indicate whether the Commissioner must be personally served, and I have found no Florida case touching on this question. There are, however, several considerations which militate against construing this section to require personal service in the awesome manner associated usually with that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">First, is the fact that the section itself neither specifies personal or manual delivery nor refers to those provisions of Florida law, Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 47.12, 47.13, which describe the method of personal service. Second, there are some analogous Florida provisions for substituted service which clearly do not require personal service upon the State official statutorily designated as the agent for service of process. Section 47.29 provides that the operation in Florida of a motor vehicle by a nonresident \u201cshall be deemed equivalent to an appointment by him of the secretary of state of the State of Florida as his agent upon whom may be served all lawful processes in any action\u201d growing out of a collision in the state. Prior to 1959, \u00a7 47.30 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-12\">\u201cService of such process shall be made by leaving a copy of the process with a fee of two dollars in the hands of the secretary of state, or in his office, and such service shall be sufficient service upon a defendant who has appointed the secretary of state as his agent for the service of such process \u00bb * * \u00bb <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">A Federal District Court sitting in Florida quashed a service under this provision where it appeared that the process had been mailed by registered mail to the secretary of state instead of having been personally served upon him. Gallant v. McKinney, S.D.Fla., 1952, 104 F.Supp. 277. See also Delray Beach Aviation Corp. v. Mooney Aircraft, Inc., 5 Cir., 1964, 332 F.2d 135. In 1959, and perhaps as a result of the District Court\u2019s interpretation of this section, \u00a7 47.30 was amended to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-15\">\u201cService of such process shall be made by the plaintiff or his attorney by ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>ther leaving a copy of the process with a fee of two dollars in the hands of the secretary of state, or in his office, or by mailing a copy of such process with a fee of two dollars to the secretary of state * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">Fla.Laws 1959, ch. 59-382, \u00a7 1. Thus, personal service upon the secretary of state is no longer necessary under the Florida provisions for substituted service of nonresident motorists and nonresidents engaging in business. There is no basis for assuming that Florida policy is any different as to \u00a7 624.0222. The Legislature\u2019s 1959 amendment of \u00a7 47.30 indicates a recognition of what I consider to be the third- \u2014 and most important\u2014 reason why personal service is not required. I cannot express it better than in the words of the dissenting opinion in Hunstock v. Estate Dev. Corp., 1943, 22 Cal.2d 205, 138 P.2d 1, 148 A.L.R. 968, 974 (1944):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-5\">\u201cThe majority opinion holds that the delivery of the summons to the Secretary of State must be a personal one and not by mail. Indulgence in such technicality should not be permitted to thwart the ends of substantial justice. It must be remembered that the service involved is <em>substituted </em>service and not personal service. * * * Such service does not necessarily give the defendant personal notification of the action. * * * Jurisdiction is acquired if compliance is had with the statutory requirements, even though the defendant never in fact receives a copy of the summons. * * * . The purpose of requiring personal delivery of a summons to a natural person is to leave no doubt that he receives notice of the action. In substituted service only a reasonable probability of that result is required. Hence, delivery by mail to the Secretary of State is sufficient. To require personal delivery to the Secretary of State is contrary to the very nature of substituted service which rather than being personal service is a substitute therefor. It follows that when the Legislature established a method of substituted service it did not intend to require personal delivery of the summons to the Secretary of State.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsL\">Though there are non-Florida judicial pronouncements to the contrary,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the decisions dispensing with the necessity for personal service upon the state official-statutory agent are in harmony with many other decisions of Florida courts which stress that substance rather than form is to determine the validity of substituted service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">Although the Florida courts appear to require strict and substantial compliance with the statutory provisions for substituted service, 25 Fla.Jur. Process \u00a7 23, several cases indicate that as long as the statutory steps essential to providing reasonable probability of notice have been taken, minor deviations from the technical requirements of the statutes do not invalidate the service. In Cherry v. Heffernan, 1938, 132 Fla. 386, 182 So. 427, service was made upon the Secretary of State pursuant to the nonresident motorist statute, and the Secretary of State forwarded a copy of the process by registered mail to the nonresident defendant. The Post Office, however, returned this letter marked \u201cRefused,\u201d and the defendant contended that the service was deficient in absence of a signed return receipt. The Court quickly disposed of this contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-11\">\u201c * * * [Sjtatutes providing for * * * substituted service on nonresidents are in derogation of common rights and must be strictly construed. * * * the steps required to be taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>must be substantially complied with. It was never contemplated, however, that a nonresident could employ the terms of the act to defeat its purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-4\">\u201cThe purpose of the act was to give the classes named therein notice of any action brought against them that they might submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the court and offer such defense as they may be advised. <em>It is shown here that the terms of the act in so far as giving notice was required were complied with to the letter.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">182 So. at 429. (Emphasis added.) Mitchell v. Brown, Fla.Dist.Ct.App., 1959, 114 So.2d 178, involved the propriety of service under Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 47.25 which provides that an incompetent shall be served by delivering a copy of the summons to both the guardian and the incompetent. In this case both the incompetent and a person who happened to be his guardian were co-defendants, and both were served in their individual capacities. However, the guardian was not delivered a copy of the writ served on his incompetent as required by the statute. The Court upheld the service nonetheless. Noting that the purpose of \u00a7 47.25 was to provide notice to the guardian, the Court held there was no need to serve an additional copy of the summons on the guardian who had been served individually and thus had notice. See, e. g., H. Bell &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Keasbey &amp; Mattison Co., Fla.Dist.Ct.App., 1962, 140 So. 2d 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Though these strong Florida pronouncements compel the conclusion that where the terms of \u00a7 624.0222 \u201cin so far as giving notice was required were complied with to the letter,\u201d it is a matter of indifference as to how the writ of garnishment arrived at the Commissioner's office, even assuming Florida would require personal service by the sheriff\u2014 which by application of 4(c) would be translated to personal service by the Marshal \u2014 can the Insurance Company object to the method of delivery if the Commissioner as its statutory agent has accepted the service, as he did here? The law provides that \u201cprocess so served [on the Commissioner] shall be valid and binding upon the insurer,\u201d \u00a7 624.0221, and \u201cshall <em>for all purposes </em>constitute valid and binding service * * * upon the insurer,\u201d \u00a7 624.0222(3) (emphasis added). Again, though there is no clear Florida precedent, \u201cit is a well established general rule recognized in this state that acceptance of service is as effective as service of process on the defendant in personam,\u201d 25 Fla.Jur. Process \u00a7 17; see 72 C.J.S. Process \u00a7 38, citing McCord v. Smith, Fla., 1950, 43 So.2d 704. And, in many other jurisdictions it appears that acceptance of service by the statutory agent in cases of substituted service forecloses objections by the defendant to at least technical defects in the manner in which the agent was served. See, e. g., Sovereign Camp, W. O. W. v. Sadler, 1930, 42 Ga.App. 219, 155 S.E. 343; Coyle v. Interstate Business Men\u2019s Ins. Acc.

Although Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 77.05 provides that \u201c[t]he writ [of garnishment] shall be served in the same manner as service of summons,\u201d there is only one way in which summons may be served upon an insurance company in Florida. This is not obvious upon first glance at the Florida statutes. Section 47.17 sets out the method for personal service on corporations, domestic and foreign, and provides that this method \u201cshall be cumulative to all existing laws,\u201d \u00a7 47.17(7). Section 47.33 then refers to some of these other laws which provide \u201c[o]ptional methods of service of process upon certain persons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-13\">\u201cIn addition to the methods of service of process provided in this chapter, service upon the following mentioned classes of persons may also be made as provided in the following sections of these statutes, to wit: * * * corporations * * * doing an insurance business in this state, \u00a7 624.0221; * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">The Revision Note to \u00a7 47.33 explains that \u201c\u00a3t]his section has been supplied as information and as a reference to special or specific instances where other methods of service of process is specifically provided. It is also the purpose of this section to clear up any possible question as to whether or not service may be had under the provisions of this chapter as well as under specifically mentioned sections.\u201d Thus, in serving an insurance company there would at first appear to be a choice between personal service provided by \u00a7 47.17 and the method of service provided by \u00a7 624.0221. But quite to the contrary, \u00a7 624.0221 and its implementing provision, g 624.0222, reveal that there is no choice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1kF\">\u201c624.0221 Service of process; appointment of commissioner as process agent.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-16\">\u201c (1) Each insurer applying for authority to transact insurance in this state, whether domestic, foreign or alien, shall file with the commissioner [of insurance] its appointment of the commissioner * * * as its attorney to receive service of all legal process issued against it * * * and agreeing that <em>process so served shall he valid and binding upon the insurer. </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-20\">\u201c(2) At the time of such appointment of the commissioner as its process agent the insurer shall file with the commissioner designation of the name and address of the person to whom process against it is served upon the commissioner is to be forwarded. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-21\">\u201c(3) Service of process upon the commissioner as the insurer\u2019s attorney pursuant to such an appointment shall be <em>the sole method </em>of service of process upon an authorized domestic, foreign or alien insurer in this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-22\">\u201c624.0222 Serving process.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-23\">\u201c(1) Service of process upon the commissioner as process agent of the insurer (under g 624.0221) shall be made by serving copies in triplicate of the process upon the commissioner or upon his assistant, deputy, or other person in charge of his office.

That this is so is obvious from the fact that the second writ of garnishment, which all concede' to have been validly served, was identical in all respects to the first writ except that it was addressed solely to the United States Marshal and was delivered by him to the Insurance Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">The majority, by stating that \u201c[a]fter the service of the first garnishment writ had been quashed,\u201d the Insurance Company pursuant to a State Court\u2019s order deposited the full amount owing Ta\u00f1os into the registry of that court, gives the impression that this whole question could have been avoided had Ta\u00f1os, upon the service of the first writ being quashed, promptly resorted to the simple expedient of having the Marshal re-serve the original writ. Indeed, it will often be the case that a subsequent valid service of the same writ will make immaterial the consequences of a deficient service. See Dehne v. Hillman, Inv. Co., 3 Cir., 1940, 110 F.2d 456; 1 Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 173, at 652 (Wright rev. 1960). But here the record is clear that the Insurance Company transferred to the state Court the funds it owed Ta\u00f1os immediately after the first writ was served and, contrary to the majority opinion, <em>before </em>the first service was quashed, and for that matter, <em>before </em>it even moved to quash this service. Far from sleeping on his rights, Ta\u00f1os did what he could after he discovered that he, the Clerk, and the Insurance Commissioner were wrong in their judgment as to the sufficiency of service by the sheriff: he first tried to appeal from the District Court\u2019s order quashing the service, and when we dismissed his appeal \u2014 as I think we were bound to do\u2014 for want of a final, appealable order, he unsuccessfully urged the District Court to enter a final judgment which would be appealable. The Court did so only after he validly served the second writ and the Insurance Company answered. When Ta\u00f1os discovered that the service of the first writ was questioned, it was too late for a second service to have any effect except to precipitate a final, appealable judgment upon which he could raise the question here presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b894-14\">. Rules 4(d) (7), 4(e), and 69(a) reveal a policy to conform the <em>manner </em>in which federal process is served to the manner in which state process is served. This same policy would have consistently dictated the service of federal process by those persons empowered to serve state process. This would have meant that in some states, such as New York, federal process could be served by any person who is not a party and not under 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>years of age. Evidently, conformity on the question of <em>who </em>is to serve process, as distinguished from <em>hoxo </em>process is to be served, was thought unwise. However, it was also dear that in many cases it would be inconvenient, if not impossible, to insist on service by the federal Marshal. Thus, Rule 4(c), compromising between absolute safety and practical convenience, provides for service by either a Marshal or a person specially appointed by the Court for that purpose. Its purpose is to insure that a responsible person is entrusted with service of process. The District Court could have appointed the Florida sheriff formally to serve the writ in this case, but Ta\u00f1os never requested such appointment. Nevertheless, when the Clerk of the District Court addresses a writ in the name of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida to a responsible state officer empowered to serve state process, it is entirely consistent with the spirit of Rule 4(c) to dispense with formal appointment by the Judge himself. Indeed, the Judge seems to have overlooked altogether the fact that the Court, through the Clerk, directed this manner of service. Litigants who have no recourse against Judges have reason to wonder how, to their detriment, the Court can so easily brush aside the assumed error of its officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b895-11\">.

In <em>Rwmsey, </em>the Court quotes the following language from 7 Moore, Federal Practice #69.03 [1], at 2407:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-5\">\u201cThe Committee [in providing in Rule 69(a) for continuing conformity to state practice] believed that the development of a series of rules on supplementary proceedings would be impractical and onerous in that such rules would have to be relatively detailed in order to meet the diverse situations in the various states. Furthermore, most states have provisions on supplementary proceedings which are fairly adequate\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASL\">and then draws what I would regard as a curious distinction between state procedural rules \u201cpeculiarly applicable\u201d to garnishment proceedings and those of \u201cgeneral application,\u201d implying that only in the latter case do the Federal Rules prevail over the state rules. Professor Moore draws no such distinction, and I see no justification for the majority\u2019s perpetuation of it by characterizing Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.3(c) as \u201cnot a rule peculiarly applicable to service of writs of garnishment.\u201d Besides, the starting point is not Fla.Rule 1.3(c) but Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 77.05, note 7, supra, which is a provision peculiarly applicable to garnishment in spite of the fact that it refers to the manner in which summons is served in any civil action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b896-6\">.

Had the materials discussed by me been presented to the District Judge, I am confident that the service would never have been quashed.

In a situation where personal rather than substituted service was required, the District Court approved service of a garnishment writ pursuant to the liberal Minnesota ruie which allows service by any person not a party. Although this case was decided prior to the Tenth Circuit decisions, Professor Wright makes the following comment on it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-12\">\u201cIt is doubtful that Rule 64 requires the federal court to yield to state procedural provisions as to provisional remedies, but the court, in the case cited, seems right in holding that service, though not by a United States Marshal, was valid where garnishee did not deny that personal service had been effected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">1 Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 177, at 297 n. 39.1 (Wright rev. 1965 Pocket Part). Similarly, in this case the Insurance Company does not deny personal service upon the Insurance Commissioner nor compliance with \u00a7 624.-0222. Nor could it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b897-5\">.

Rule 4(e) was expressly amended in 1963 to provide for resort to such state statutes. See 2 Moore, Federal Practice # #4.32 [1], 4.41-1. It is undisputed that the Insurance Company is a nonresident of Florida, and thus 4(e) applies. But whether 4(d) (7) (for residents) or 4(e) (for nonresidents) applies, since substituted service pursuant to state law is available under both, 1 Barron &amp; Holtzoff. Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 171, at 647, \u00a7 179, at 716, the determination of the validity of service in federal actions depends on an appraisal by the Federal Court of the propriety of service under the applicable state statutes, 2 Moore ##4.22 [3], 4.32 [2]. And since the Florida procedure for service on an insurer is the same whether the insurer is domestic, foreign or alien, \u00a7\u00a7 624.0221, 624.0222 (note 7, supra), the result under 4(d) (7) and 4(e) would be the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b897-11\">. Of course, 4(c) to the extent it is applicable controls even where service is made pursuant to 4(d) (7) or 4(e) because these sections relate to the manner of service, not to the person making service. 1 Barron &amp; Holtzoff \u00a7 176, at 657, \u00a7 182.1, at 728.' But as Professor Moore explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-15\">\u201cRule 4(c) is subject to * * * [an] exception, not explicitly stated but which may be derived from the other provisions of Rule 4, as amended in- 1963. Thus where service of original process is made on a party who is not an inhabitant of or found within the state in which the district court is held, under * * * a state statute or rule of court, as provided in Rule 4(e), the service may be made in the manner provided in such * * * state statute or rule, and this would implicitly include reference to the means of making service under the practice envisioned in such * * * state statute * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-17\">2 Moore #4.08, at 1007. Then he explains :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-18\">\u201cThese [state] statutes and rules may call for substituted or constructive service such as personal service on the party outside the state, service by mail, service of notice by publication, or a combination of these forms, often coupled with service within the state on a state official, deemed by law to be the agent of the out-of-state party for the reception of service. * * * A question arising in the use of these statutes or rule in federal actions is: do they conflict with the requirement of Rule 4(c) * * *? Prior to 1963, the Second Circuit had held that Rule 4(d) (7) incorporated the state method of service into actions under the Federal Rules, and that Rule 4(c) was no barrier to service by mail on the out-of-state party under state practice.
