Wilson, Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b871-10\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">This is a petition for review of an unreported memorandum decision of the Tax Court of the United States, T.C. Memo 1964-260.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">The Commissioner assessed an accumulated earnings tax against petitioner, the Kirlin Company, under Sections 531 and 532 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-13\">The Tax Court found that petitioner accumulated its earnings and profits, for its taxable year ending August 31, 1958, beyond the reasonable needs of its business as of that date and that petitioner was availed of for the purpose of avoiding the income tax with respect to its shareholders by permitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being distributed. The deficiency determined by the Tax Court is in the amount of $103,439.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-18\">The evidence is summarized in detail in the memorandum findings of fact and opinion of the Tax Court, to which reference is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-19\"> The issues of whether a corporation has been availed of for the purposes of avoiding income taxes and whether accumulations are beyond the reasonable needs of the business present questions of fact. The findings of the Tax Court may be set aside by this court only if they are clearly erroneous. Helvering v. National Grocery Co., 304 U.S. 282, 58 S.Ct. 932, 82 L.Ed. 1346; Smoot Sand &amp; Gravel Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 241 F.2d 197 (C.A.4), cert. denied, 354 U.S. 922, 77 S.Ct. 1383, 1 L.Ed.2d 1437, and 274 F.2d 495, cert. denied, 362 U.S. 976, 80 S.Ct. 1061, 4 L.Ed.2d 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-20\">Petitioner contends that the Tax Court erred in holding that its accumulations during its taxable year here involved were beyond the needs of the business and in ruling that the corporation was availed of in the taxable year for the purpose of avoiding the income tax with respect to is shareholders by permitting its earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed. Numerous arguments are asserted in support of these contentions. We hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>that the findings of the Tax Court on these factual questions are not clearly erroneous, but to the contrary are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Petitioner further contends that the Tax Court erred in failing to give the credit authorized by \u00a7 535(c) of the-Internal Revenue Code of 1954.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon examination of the record we find that the Tax Court has ruled upon each item of credits claimed and that these rulings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-15\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 531.
