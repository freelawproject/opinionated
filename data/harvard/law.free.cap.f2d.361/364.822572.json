At the time, he was in the employ of McLean Contracting Company, which had been engaged by the shipbuilding company to install two cranes. The action was dismissed\u2014 and rightly we think \u2014 on Shipbuilding\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-24\">Decision was grounded on the Virginia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Code of 1950, as amended, \u00a7\u00a7 65-26 and 65-37, declaring an employee\u2019s right to compensation under this statute to be his exclusive remedy. The Act bars suit by an employee of a contractor or sub-contractor against the owner of the project if the employee is injured in work which is \u201ca part of the [owner\u2019s] trade, business or occupation\u201d. Concededly the requirements of the Act have been met and the plaintiff Evans has accepted its benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-25\">The record discloses no genuine issue upon the material facts in the case and they bring him squarely within the Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Hence his sole remedy is the recovery of statutory compensation. This was the view of the District Court in dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
