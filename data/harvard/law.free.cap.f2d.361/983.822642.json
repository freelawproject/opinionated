The basic issue is whether Congress has forbidden the payment to plaintiff of the retirement pay accumulated by his late father, a retired Army officer, during the many years the father was an incompetent patient in a Veterans Administration hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-18\">Plaintiff is the only child of Captain Charles M. Hurt, Jr., who entered the Veterans Administration Hospital in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, in October 1947, as an adjudicated incompetent. Captain Hurt remained a patient until he died intestate at the hospital on August 6, 1962. During that time, the captain was the beneficiary of about $19,000 in Army retirement pay which was withheld from him under the statute with which we shall be concerned. In August 1963 plaintiff made claim for this sum. This demand was refused<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and plaintiff sues for the accumulated retirement pay. Both parties have moved for summary judgment and there is no factual dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-19\">The controlling statute \u2014 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3203, 72 Stat. 1234, entitled \u201cHospitalized veterans and estates of incompetent institutionalized veterans\u201d \u2014 is set out in the Appendix.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It deals with the payment of compensation or retirement pay to certain veterans who are being cared for by the Veterans Administration in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>institutions. Section 3203(a) (1) provides that, <em>if such a veteran has \"neither wife, child, nor dependent </em>parent\u201d, his compensation or retirement pay shall continue unabated for six months following his admission, but that after six months only one-half of such monies (if more than $30 per month) shall be paid to the veteran. Upon his discharge he is paid, in a lump sum, the amount by which his retirement pay has been reduced,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> except that if he leaves against medical advice or as a result of disciplinary action he cannot obtain this lump sum until six months have elapsed. If the veteran dies while institutionalized or before payment of the lump sum, the money is to be paid (\u00a7 3203(a) (2) (A)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-5\">First, to the spouse; second, if the decedent left no spouse, or if the spouse is dead at time of settlement, then to the children (without regard to their age or marital status) in equal parts; third, if no spouse or child, then to the dependent parents in equal parts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">If there is no surviving member of these classes, \u201cno payment shall be made\u201d, except for expenses of burial or last sickness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">Obviously a problem is created by the seeming conflict between the basic provision for reduction and accumulation of retirement pay \u2014 which expressly applies, under \u00a7 3203(a) (1), only to veterans \u201chaving neither wife, child, nor dependent parent\u201d \u2014 and the direction to pay the accumulated lump sum, if the veteran has not received it before death, to a spouse, child, or dependent parent. A man \"having neither wife, child, nor dependent parent\u201d can hardly be left with such relatives. Congress solved this dilemma by providing, first, that veterans subject to the reduction and accumulation of retirement pay \u201cshall be deemed to be single and without dependents in the absence of satisfactory evidence to the contrary\u201d (\u00a7 3203(c)), and, second, that survivors within the specified classes have five years after the veteran\u2019s death to file claim for the accumulated lump sum (\u00a7 3203(a) (2) (B)). Under these provisions, as they have been applied by the Veterans Administration, an institutionalized veteran is considered to have \u201cneither wife, child, nor dependent parent\u201d so long as affirmative proof of such status is not officially presented. On the veteran\u2019s death, the survivors have five years in which to offer \u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d of their relationship, and to claim the lump sum.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Many a wife, we are told, defers making such proof until after her husband\u2019s death so that the retirement pay given to him in the hospital will be halved and the remainder accumulated, safely, as a nest-egg which cannot be squandered or dissipated by the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-12\">This is the system Congress has spelled out, in terms, for institutionalized veterans who are competent, e. g., those who are patients or inmates because they are physically ill or merely advanced in years. For the mentally incompetent the surface of the statute reads differently as to disposition of the lump sum upon the patient\u2019s death, and that difference gives rise to the defense here. There is reduction and accumulation of retirement pay in the case of incompetents as well as of competents, and this applies, again, only to a hospitalized veteran \u201chaving neither wife, child, nor dependent parent.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The general provisions relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>to institutionalized but competent veterans are likewise made applicable \u2014 including the scheme for distribution to survivors \u2014 except that the subsection on incompetents (38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3203(b) (1), 73 Stat. 298) adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1038-4\">however, no payment of a lump sum herein authorized shall be made to the veteran until after the expiration of six months following a finding of competency and in the event of the veteran\u2019s death before payment of such lump sum no part thereof shall be payable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">Read literally, this would bar payment of the accumulated lump sum to the survivors of an incompetent veteran, such as plaintiff\u2019s father, who dies in the hospital while still incompetent. Unlike the survivors of a tubercular veteran, the incompetent's close relatives would receive nothing. The Government insists that the statute must and should be read literally. Our inquiry is whether we are so constrained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">The major stumbling block to a literal reading is that the defendant has given us no reason, and none appears in the legislative history, why Congress would have wished to differentiate in this way \u2014at least as to retirement pay \u2014 between the survivors of mentally incompetent veterans and those who were physically sick or merely old. If Captain Hurt had been hospitalized for tuberculosis or cancer, and had died in 1962 in the hospital of that disease, plaintiff would clearly be entitled to recover the lump sum consisting of.the accumulated half of the captain\u2019s retirement pay which was withheld during his long institutionalization \u2014the veteran had no surviving wife and plaintiff, as the only son, proved his status and filed his claim within five years of his father\u2019s death. With competent veterans, sick or old, there is no instance under the specific wording of the statute in which a surviving son could not timely claim the accumulated lump sum (if it had not already been paid to the veteran).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There would never be a cutting-off, forfeiture, escheat, or lapse. Can it be than Congress, without giving any reason, meant to discriminate against the wives, children, and dependent parents of incompetents?</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">The legislative background of the statute does not give a clear or conclusive answer, but we think it suggests, quite strongly, that Congress did not intend to confine distribution of an incompetent veteran\u2019s accumulated <em>retirement pay </em>to those few instances in which the patient has survived a finding of competency by six months. We are concerned in this case only with accumulated retirement pay, not with other types of veterans\u2019 benefits, and we look to the history of these provisions with that type of payment specially in mind. The modern general system of reducing and accumulating retirement pay (and other compensation) began in 1946 when the Act of August 8, 1946, 60 Stat. 908, established the forerunner of present Section 3203.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under that Act, which applied both to competent and to incompetent veterans institutionalized in Veterans Administration facilities, one major difference from the current pattern was that distribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>could be made, not only to wives, children, or dependent parents, but also to brothers and sisters (if no member of the prior classes survived). But that Act, like the present legislation, delayed payment of the lump sum to the competent veteran, himself, for six months if he left the hospital against medical advice or as a result of disciplinary action. With respect to incompetents, the 1946 statute incorporated the basic plan set up for competents, but also contained a proviso declaring that no payment of the lump sum should be made until after the expiration of six months following a finding of competency (\u00a7 (B)); the Act did not then add (as it does now): \u201cand in the event of the veteran\u2019s death before payment of such lump sum no part thereof shall be payable.\u201d Since the 1946 legislation specifically required the retirement pay of the incompetent to \u201cbe subject to the provisions\u201d relating to the competent \u2014 which contained directions for distribution to relatives on the veteran\u2019s death \u2014 the provision for a six month\u2019s delay \u201cfollowing a finding of competency\u201d could easily be read as equivalent to the six months wait for competent patients who were discharged against doctor\u2019s advice or on disciplinary grounds; just as in the case of competent patients, the lump sum would be paid, however, to the surviving relatives if an incompetent veteran died in the hospital or within six months of an adjudication of competency.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">The 1946 Act also contained an ambiguous stipulation that \u201c[i]n any case where the estate of such incompetent veteran derived from any source equals or exceeds $1,500, further payments of such benefits * * * shall not be made until the estate is reduced to $500.\u201d The words \u201csuch benefits\u201d could hark back, as a matter of grammar, to a prior reference in the paragraph on incompetents to \u201cthe pension, compensation, or retirement pay for such [incompetent] veteran\u201d, but we understand that this direction to withhold all payments which would bring the estate above $500 was not applied to ordinary retirement pay (involved here) which was apparently not treated as a gratuitous benefit like a pension.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-9\">This Act of August 8, 1946, was carried forward, without relevant change, in the 1958 codification of Title 38 of the U.S.Code, on \u201cVeterans\u2019 Benefits\u201d. Act of September 2, 1958, Public Law 85-857, 72 Stat. 1105, 1234-1235. The codification placed these reduction-and-accumulation provisions in Section 3203 (where they now appear). One clarification was the explicit excepting of retirement pay from the requirement to withhold \u201cbenefits\u201d when the incompetent\u2019s estate exceeds $1,500 (\u00a7 (b) (2)). At the same time the codifiers appended to this particular provision a sentence which ordered that \u201c[t]he amount which would be payable but for this subsection [relating to withholding where the incompetent\u2019s estate is more than $1,500] shall be paid to the veteran as provided for the lump sum in paragraph (1) of this subsection\u201d [incorporating the provisions for distribution to competent patients, but with the additional proviso delaying payment until after the expiration of six months following a finding of competency], and then added the significant words: \u201cbut in the event of the veteran\u2019s death no part thereof shall be payable.\u201d This last tag would not affect retirement pay since that type of compensation was entirely excluded from this particular provision withholding pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>ments when the patient\u2019s estate is more than $1,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">We see, then, that from the institution of the benefits-reduction system in 1946 through the recodification of 1958, accumulated <em>retirement pay </em>(as distinguished from gratuitous benefits) was payable, on the death of an incompetent veteran, to the relatives specified by Congress. If Captain Hurt had died in 1958, plaintiff, as his son, would have been entitled to demand the accumulated retirement pay upon the filing of a timely claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The immediate issue is whether Congress changed this in 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">The Act of August 7, 1959, Public Law 86-146, 73 Stat. 297, amended 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3203 to read substantially as we have set it forth in the Appendix. The main change relevant here was to add the phrase \u2014 \u201cand in the event of the veteran\u2019s death before payment of such lump sum no part thereof shall be payable\u201d\u2014 to the subsection dealing with the retirement pay (along with other benefits) of patients.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Did this addition mean that Congress now wished, in the case of incompetents, to \u201cforfeit\u201d accumulated retirement pay \u2014 which is not a gratuity (see footnote 9, supra) \u2014 and to bar a surviving wife or child from collecting it? Aside from the bare words of the Act, there is no such indication. The signs all point in the other direction. The 1959 Act (which also deals with other matters relating to incompetent veteran patients) seems concerned, as a whole, with the distribution of gratuitous benefits, and with their distribution to near relatives. The first section amended another provision of Title 38 (\u00a7 3202 (d)) to provide, generally, that on the death of a mentally incompetent or insane veteran all gratuitous benefits withheld from him and deposited in a trust fund (under other provisions of law) should not be paid to his personal representative but to the wife, children, or dependent parents, any unpaid balance reverting to the Treasury.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Another change made by the 1959 Act was to cut off, to some extent, brothers'and sisters as a class of distributees and to confine payments to the immediate family plus dependent parents (this process was completed in 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-10\">Similarly, the theme of the entire legislative history is that accumulated gratuitous benefits should be paid, after death, only to close relatives, not to remote or collateral kin. Both committee reports (H.Rept.No.303, 86th Cong. 1st Sess., and S.Rept.No.344, -86th Cong., 1st Sess., U.S.Code Congressional and Administrative News 1959, p. 2048) emphasized that the bill was designed to prevent the payment of gratuitous benefits for incompetent veterans, receiving care at public expense, from accumulating in excessive amounts and passing, on death, to relatives having no claim against the Government on account of the veteran\u2019s military service (i. e., relatives farther away than wives, children, and parents). This same notion runs throughout the debate in the House (105 Cong.Rec. 7320-7322),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the short discussion in the Senate (105 Cong. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>Rec. 14619) (\u201cgratuitous benefits\u201d). The stress is always on the double note that federal largess should not pass to collateral kin. On the other hand, there was no reference to accumulated retirement pay and no suggestion at all that such earned compensation would be lost to the wife or children if the incompetent died in the hospital or before recovering his sanity. We have found not one word in the legislative history making or implying that point, or giving any reason why Congress should or would have wished to deprive a child of his incompetent father\u2019s accumulated retirement pay while permitting the son of a sick-but-competent father to recover.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\"> The only support for that position lies in the literal terms of the 1959 amendment adding the words \u201cand in the event of the veteran\u2019s death before payment of such lump sum no part thereof shall be payable.\u201d Explicit Congressional language is not readily shunted aside (United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 310 U.S. 534, 543, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940); Flora v. United States, 362 U.S. 145, 150, 80 S.Ct. 630, 4 L.Ed.2d 623 (1960)), but we have also been instructed \u201cnot to make a fortress out of the dictionary\u201d (Cabell v. Markham, 148 F.2d 737, 739 (C.A.2, 1945), aff\u2019d, 326 U.S. 404, 409, 66 S.Ct. 193, 90 L.Ed. 165 (1945), and \u201cagainst the dangers of an approach to statutory construction which confines itself to the bare words of a statute\u201d (Lynch v. Overholser, 369 U.S. 705, 710, 82 S.Ct. 1063, 1067, 8 L.Ed.2d 211 (1962)). The history and policy of this statute, as we judge them, demand a departure from a literalness which has nothing else to recommend it. In the special context of the legislation (cf. International Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union v. Juneau Spruce Corp., 342 U.S. 237, 243, 72 S.Ct. 235, 96 L.Ed. 275 (1952)), the Congressional purpose is better reached by excluding retirement pay, at the least, from the \u201capparent absolute\u201d (Markham v. Cabell, supra, 326 U.S. 404, at 409, 66 S.Ct. 193, 90 L.Ed. 165) of the broad prohibition on payments of accumulated lump sums to surviving relatives.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cIt is a familiar rule that a thing may be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the statute, because not within its spirit nor within the intention of its makers.\u201d Holy Trinity Church v. United States, 143 U.S. 457, 459, 12 S.Ct. 511, 512, 36 L.Ed. 226 (1892); National Labor Relations Board v. Fruit &amp; Vegetable Packers, 377 U.S. 58, 72, 84 S.Ct. 1063, 12 L.Ed.2d 129 (1964). Since the Congress was so wholly concerned with gratuitous benefits and with cutting off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>collateral relatives from such grants, we do not believe that it also intended to bar the immediate family from accumulated retirement pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\"> We are prodded to this conclusion by the consequences of reading the 1959 Act to declare that plaintiff cannot recover his father\u2019s accumulation. As we have indicated (see especially footnote 9, supra), military retirement pay is not a gratuity or mere pension. At the passage of the 1959 Act, Captain Hurt had long been retired and receiving retirement pay, part of which was being accumulated for him by the Veterans\u2019 Administration. There is a grave question whether Congress could validly deprive him or his son of the retirement pay already accumulated by 1959, and there is even a question whether Congress could reduce or abolish that pay, for Captain Hurt who was already retired, with respect to the period following the 1959 Act. Cf. Steinberg v. United States, 163 F.Supp. 590, 592-93, 594-96, 143 Ct.Cl. 1, 7-8, 9-13 (opinions of Jones, C. J., and Whitaker, J.) (1958); Nordstrom v. United States, 342 F.2d 55, 60, 169 Ct.Cl. 632, 639 (1965); Rafferty v. United States, 210 F.2d 934, 936 (C.A.3, 1954). We can properly take account of these substantial constitutional issues, which the Government\u2019s interpretation would immediately present, and read the statute so as to by-pass them. Cf. Guessefeldt v. McGrath, 342 U.S. 308, 317-319, 72 S.Ct. 338, 96 L.Ed. 342 (1952). Congress, we can assume, would not have wanted to thrust into the routine legislation which was the 1959 Act a sharp constitutional barb. In the same way, the accepted principle decrying forfeitures justifies us in thinking that Congress would not have desired to cut off the immediate family of an institutionalized incompetent veteran from the accumulated residue of his retirement pay. \u201cConsidering that confiscation is not easily to be assumed, a construction that avoids it and is not barred by a fair reading of the legislation is invited.\u201d Guessefeldt v. McGrath, supra, 342 U.S. at 319, 72 S.Ct. at 344. Cf. Farmers &amp; Mechanics Nat\u2019l Bank v. Dearing, 91 U.S. 29, 35, 23 L.Ed. 196 (1875); United States v. One Ford Coach, 307 U.S. 219, 226 (1939); De Sylva v. Ballentine, 351 U.S. 570, 579, 76 S.Ct. 974, 100 L.Ed. 1415 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-6\">For these reasons, the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied and plaintiff\u2019s cross-motion is granted. He is entitled to recover and judgment is entered to that effect.
