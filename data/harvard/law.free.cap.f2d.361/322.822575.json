Plaintiff claimed that while he was negotiating a right hand curve in the road, defendants\u2019 truck approached from the opposite direction and suddenly \u201cdipped over\u201d onto plaintiff\u2019s side of the road, the truck\u2019s left front fender shearing down the whole left side of plaintiff\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-18\">Defendants\u2019 version was that plaintiff blew a tire and was swerving back and forth across the center line for some distance before the two vehicles met; and that at the time of impact plaintiff was on the defendants\u2019 side of the road. The case was tried without a jury before Judge Gordon in the Middle District of North Carolina. Testimony in the trial, which extended over four days, was in sharp conflict in many respects. The District Court made detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, finding primary negligence by the truck driver, and no contributory negligence. He gave judgment for the plaintiff for $33,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-19\">On the record before him, the District Court could reasonably have found for either party, and this is therefore a classic case for the application of rule 52(a). The trial judge was in a position to evaluate all the evidence in context, to weigh the credibility and reliability of the witnesses, and to interpret the physical facts. His treatment of the problem was careful and logical and the result well supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
