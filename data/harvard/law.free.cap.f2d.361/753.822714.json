The relevant statute is the Anti-Kickback Act, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 51-54.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-19\">Defendant\u2019s sole contention is that Section 51 \u201cis on its face unconstitutional in that it purports to create a federal crime predicated upon an irrebuttable presumption [of loss to the government], with no rational connection in common experience between the fact proved and the ultimate fact conclusively presumed.\u201d His basic argument is that such a connection did exist under the original version of Section 51 (60 Stat. 37) as enacted in 1946, which applied only to cost-plus-a-fixed-fee or cost reimbursable contracts. Under this version, there was a logical linkage between kickbacks and inflated costs to the government. But with the substitution in 1960 (Pub.L. 86-695) of the word \u201cnegotiated\u201d for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>\u201ccost-plus-a-fixed-fee\u201d and \u201cother cost reimbursable basis\u201d language, argues defendant, there is no longer any reasonable inference that a kickback is ultimately borne by the government. Tot v. United States, 1943, 319 U.S. 463, 63 S.Ct. 1241, 87 L.Ed. 1519, and United States v. Romano, 1965, 382 U.S. 136, 86 S.Ct. 279, 15 L.Ed.2d 210, both involving rebuttable presumptions in criminal cases, are cited as authority for the supposed flaw in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">We do not reach the question of the validity of the conclusive presumption, because it seems clear to us that Section 51 is solely concerned with civil remedies. Section 54, a criminal statute, by referring to \u201csuch prohibited payment\u201d, merely incorporates the definitions of proscribed kickbacks and no other provisions. As we have pointed out elsewhere, this crime of bribery stands by itself and does not depend on subsequent actions. Specifically, it is not necessary that the government be financially harmed. Howard v. United States, 1 Cir., 1965, 345 F.2d 126, 128, cert. denied, 382 U.S. 838, 86 S.Ct. 86, 15 L.Ed.2d 80. Not only does a reading of 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 51-54 indicate a clear distinction between civil and criminal sanctions, but both legislative history and subsequent interpretation confirm such a reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">In supplying requested comments on the proposed 1960 amendment to the House Committee on Government Operations, the Acting Deputy Attorney General recognized that the question of rational connection between the presumption and a kickback could be raised if fixed-price contracts were brought within the reach of the statute. That this question relates only to civil actions was made clear by the context of the letter, for the paragraph containing the above observation begins with this sentence: \u201cThe keystone of the civil liability created by the statute is the 'conclusive presumption\u2019 that any such payment was included in the price of the subcontract and was ultimately borne by the United States.\u201d U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News, 86th Cong.2d Sess., 1960, p. 3304.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This letter was specifically referred to in the House Report on the 1960 amendments. Id. at 3293.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Moreover, as long ago as 1955, the court in United States v. Davio, E.D. Mich.1955, 136 F.Supp. 423, 429 stated: \u201cSection 1 of the Anti-Kickback Act, which is the only section under consideration, is civil in nature * *</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\"> The district judge was careful to avoid any reference to the presumption in his charge, which defendant's counsel commended. Defendant asserts, without any substantiation, the possibility of prejudice by reason of an improper consideration of the presumption by the grand jury. Indictments are not so easily to be impeached by conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-12\">. The Act, as it relates to this case, may he broadly summarized as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">Section 51 prohibits payment of any gratuity on behalf of a subcontractor to an agent of a contractor \u201cholding a negotiated contract\u201d with a United States agency. It prohibits including such a gratuity in the subcontractor\u2019s price and sets forth remedies of setoff, court action, and withholding from sums otherwise due the subcontractor. It also specifies: \u201cUpon a showing that a subcontractor paid fees, commissions, or compensation or granted gifts or gratuities to an officer, partner, employee, or agent of a prime contractor or of another higher tier subcontractor, in connection with the award of a subcontract or order thereunder, it shall be conclusively presumed that the cost of such expense was included in the price of the subcontract or order and ultimately borne by the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-21\">Section 52 consists of definitions of terms. \u201cNegotiated contract\u201d is defined to mean \u201cmade without formal advertising\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-22\">Section 53 gives the General Accounting Office power to audit books of contractors and subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-23\">Section 54 states: \u201cAny person who shall knowingly, directly or indirectly, make or receive any such prohibited payment shall be fined not more than $10,-000 or be imprisoned for not more than two years, or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b807-18\">. While counsel for defendant saw fit to include the first point of the Department of Justice letter in his brief, he chose to ignore the language last quoted, Counsel for the government did not repair the defect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
