The second appeal is from the denial of plaintiffs\u2019 cross motions \u201c * * * to transfer this action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, and in the alternative, for an order pursuant to Rule 41(a) (2) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, for dismissal of this action, without prejudice, * * Ordinarily the interlocutory order denying those motions would not be reviewable. In this instance, where they are not only ancillary to the interlocutory injunction but actually a vital affinnative part of plaintiffs\u2019 total effort to have their case tried in the Eastern District of New York, they are so reviewable because of the interlocutory injunction. National Equipment Rental, Ltd. v. Fowler, 287 F.2d 43, 45 (2 Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">The substance of these appeals has been exhaustively examined by this Court. On all of the facts we find that the decisions of the District Judge were well within his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">The judgments of the District Court will be affirmed without costs to either party as against the other.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
