L. R. B. v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 341 F.2d 750 (C.A.6, 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 830, 86 S.Ct. 69, 15 L.Ed.2d 74 (1965), and N. L. R. B. v. Cumberland Shoe Corp., 351 F.2d 917 (C.A.6, 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-24\">Respondent, however, argues that in the instant case most of respondent\u2019s coercive practices <em>preceded </em>the union\u2019s request to bargain, while in <em>Cumberland </em>the unfair labor practices <em>followed </em>the request to bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-25\">We do not consider this a meaningful distinction on this record. Taking the record as a whole, there was evidence from which the NLRB could have found that respondent sought by unlawful coercion to change the choice of its employees as to their bargaining agent and succeeded in doing so. In such a situation an order to bargain may be \u201cstrong medicine\u201d but we believe it to be no stronger than is authorized by the statute. Franks Bros. Co. v. N. L. R.
