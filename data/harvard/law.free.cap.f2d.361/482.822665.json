KIRKPATRICK<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b535-12\"><em> </em>United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate in place of Chief Judge WORLEY, pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28, United States Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b535-5\">KIRKPATRICK, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Appellant contends here that the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board committed reversible error in dismissing its opposition to applicant\u2019s registration of \u201cKWIK-TRIM\u201d over appellant\u2019s prior registered mark \u201cE-Z-TRIM,\u201d both applied to potentiometers.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">In evaluating the marks, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">Opposer contends that the marks of the parties have substantially identical suggestive connotations. In this regard opposer directs our attention to the definition of the word \u201cfacile\u201d and to the definition of the word \u201cfacility\u201d but the words with which we are concerned are \u201cquick\u201d and \u201ceasy.\u201d The dictionaries which are available to us * * * do not indicate that the terms \u201cquick\u201d and \u201ceasy\u201d are synonyms or even have similar suggestive connotations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">The only similarity between the marks resides in the common use of the term \u201cTRIM\u201d. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">Considering the nondistinctive nature of the term \u201cTRIM\u201d and <em>considering the marks in their entireties, </em>we conclude that \u201cKWIK-TRIM\u201d does not look or sound like \u201cE-Z-TRIM\u201d nor do they have the same meaning or connotation. We conclude that there is no likelihood of confusion. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Appellant argues specifically that the board improperly dissected the competing marks; that when viewed in their entireties the marks have the same suggestive connotation; and that doubt should be resolved in its favor as prior registrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">We have reviewed the board\u2019s action in light of appellant\u2019s arguments but are unable to find that the board erred in any of the respects that appellant alleges. Aside from the board\u2019s reasoning, it would seem that the technical nature and uses of potentiometers suggest that purchasers would be inclined to exercise care and discrimination, a point developed in appellee\u2019s brief but not treated in appellant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
