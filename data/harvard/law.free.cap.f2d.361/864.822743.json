Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954); United States v. Pepe, 360 F.2d 1015 (3 Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-22\">The hard core of the appellant\u2019s contention on this appeal is that the Government failed to satisfactorily prove a substantial understatement of income during the tax years in the critical respect that it failed to meet its burden of proof on the score of establishing an \u201copening net worth\u201d or total net value of the appellant\u2019s assets at the beginning of the sequence of tax years for which a deficiency was alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-23\">On review of the record we are of the opinion that the appellant\u2019s contention is without merit and that there was ample basis for the jury\u2019s verdict. Other points presented by the appellant with respect to alleged errors at the trial do not merit discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-24\">For the reasons stated the judgment of sentence of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
