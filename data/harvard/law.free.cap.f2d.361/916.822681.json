This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Both parties filed motions for summary judgment in the District Court and submitted the cause for decision on a written stipulation of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">The District Court entered judgment for appellee decreeing \u201cthat at the time mentioned in the complaint defendant\u2019s aircraft B-377 PG was a \u2018public aircraft\u2019 as that term is used in Section 101(30) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, 49 U.S.C. Section 1301(30), and, accordingly, at such times the Federal Aviation Act was not applicable to said aircraft and defendant was not subject to the jurisdiction or control of the Federal Aviation Administrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b969-19\">The stipulation of faets on which the cause was submitted to the District Court for decision may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b969-20\">As the space program moved forward the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, herein NASA, had need for a large capacity aircraft in which could be transported missile sections, components, spacecraft modules and outsized cargo related to the national Space program.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-21\">Defendant [appellee] voluntarily undertook to redesign and modify a Boeing B-377 Stratoeruiser to meet the needs of NASA and other governmental or private organizations in transporting such missiles, modules, components or other large sized cargo. The resulting aircraft Boeing B-377 PG is the subject of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-22\">Until appellee developed the aircraft, there did not exist any aircraft capable of handling and transporting the modules, outsized cargo, missiles and components required in the Government\u2019s space program (S-IV Saturn and Apollo).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-23\">On January 24,1962, appellee [through its predecessor] applied to the Federal Aviation Agency [herein FAA], for a Certificate of Airworthiness covering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>aircraft B-377 PG under 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1423.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">On February 20, 1963, appellee applied to the FAA for a Commercial Operator\u2019s Certificate. See Civil Air Regulation 45.2, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">On March 12, 1963, appellee applied to FAA for an exemption from Parts 1 and 8 of Civil Air Regulations re: Airworthiness Certificate. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1421(c) authorizes the Administrator of FAA to grant exemptions from the requirements of any rule or regulation prescribed, if he finds such action to be in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">On May 2, 1963, the application for such exemption was granted by FAA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-15\">On May 16, 1963, the aircraft B-377 PG was flown for the first time by the appellee in its modified form, and on May 28,1963, appellee entered into initial contract with NASA, for the period ending July 31, 1963, subject to extension by NASA, but not beyond August 31, 1963. This contract covers a portion of the period during which tests of the aircraft were undertaken to determine if it was airworthy. Also, tests required by NASA were pursued to determine the feasibility of using the aircraft to handle and transport spacecraft modules, space missiles, components, dummies of modules and components, and related cargo. Relevant provisions of the contract appear in footnote <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>On July 10,1963, FAA issued a Certificate of Airworthiness covering the aircraft and restricted operating limitations for the aircraft. The aircraft was certificated \u201conly for the special purpose of carrying spacecraft modules, persons and cargo for compensation or hire for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\u201d The operation of the aircraft for any purpose other than for which it was certificated was prohibited. The restrictions contained in the restricted oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>ating limitations that formed a part of the certificate, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-4\">\u201c1. The <em>only </em>flights authorized are for the special purpose of carrying spacecraft modules, persons and cargo for compensation or hire for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, subject to the following conditions (Ref. FAA Exemption <em># </em>258, dated May 2, 1963 \u2014 Regulatory Docket No. 1679):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-5\">\u201ca. The cargo shall consist solely of S-IV Saturn and Apollo spacecraft modules and related cargo;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-6\">\u201cb. The persons carried shall be restricted to the technicians designated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and carried to insure security and monitor loads to which cargo components are subjected in transit; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHl\">\u201cc. Cargo and persons may be carried only between locations as prescribed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">On September 6, 1963, NASA and appellee entered into a contract for \u201cAir Transportation Services\u201d for the term September 1, 1963, through June 30, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">ARTICLE I of the contract provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-9\">\u201cThe contractor, as an independent contractor and not as an agent of the government, shall, on the terms and conditions hereinafter more particularly set forth, furnish to the government for its exclusive use and control one each B-377 PG Aircraft, Serial No. N1024V and furnish all personnel, facilities, equipment and materials, other than may be furnished by the government, necessary for the complete operation and maintenance of the aircraft in order to provide air transportation of S-IV stages, large booster components, tools, and fixtures, and such other cargoes as may be specified by the contracting officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">ARTICLE II A. provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-15\">\u201cA. EQUIPMENT: The contractor shall furnish, for the government\u2019s exclusive use and control, one (1) converted Boeing 377 Stratocruiser aircraft (commonly known as the \u2018pregnant guppy\u2019 with the capacities, capabilities, and/or appurtenances as follows: * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-16\">ARTICLE IV A., under the heading \u201cFlight Operations\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-17\">\u201cA. During the period of performance, all movements of this aircraft shall be at the direction of the contracting officer. The contractor shall furnish the aircraft, fully stabilized, ready for loading, with full operation crew within 48 hours after receipt of notice from the contracting officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-18\">Other relevant provisions of the contract appear in footnote <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of this opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-19\">The three violations alleged in the complaint occurred during the period of the contract of September 6, 1963, and on each of which occasions appellee operated the aircraft pursuant to its contract with NASA without obtaining a Commercial Operator\u2019s Certificate from the Administrator. Each flight involved the transportation of spacecraft components for use by NASA.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-20\">At the times of the above flights it was the position of the Federal Aviation Agency and its Administrator, which was communicated to appellee, that the oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>ation of the aircraft required certification of appellee as a Commercial Operator under the appropriate regulations issued by the Federal Aviation Administrator. During the same time it was the position of appellee, which was communicated to the Federal Aviation Agency, that it was not required to secure a Commercial Operator Certificate because the aircraft was a \u201cpublic aircraft\u201d under the terms of the contract with. NASA. The appellee did not withdraw its application to the Federal Aviation Agency for the issuance of a Commercial Operator Certificate, and the same was granted on November 13, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Since completion of the modification and successful flight of Boeing B-3.77 PG and up to the time the complaint was filed, no movement of said aircraft was made except at the direction and for the use of NASA, exclusive of crew training or check flights of which the FAA was advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">This appeal involves the sole question of whether the aircraft here in question was a \u201cpublic aircraft\u201d as that term is defined in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, [49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301]. In pertinent part \u00a7 1301 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-7\">\u201c(14) \u2018Civil Aircraft\u2019 means any aircraft other than a public aircraft. * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-8\">\u201c(30) \u2018Public Aircraft\u2019 means an aircraft used exclusively in the service of any government or of any political subdivision thereof, including the government of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia, but not including any government-owned aircraft engaged in carrying persons or property for commercial purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">We note that in the stipulation of facts filed in the District Court, the parties stipulated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-10\">\u201cThe Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1301 et seq.) restricts the applicability of Part 45 of the Civil Air Regulations to \u2018civil aircraft\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">Appellee acknowledges that if the aircraft is found not to be a \u201cpublic aircraft\u201d, the three flights set forth in the complaint were made contrary to Part 45 of the Civil Air Regulations and that the appellee would be liable to a maximum civil penalty of $1,000 for each of the three flights.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">Appellant concedes that if the aircraft in question was a \u201cpublic aircraft\u201d at the time of the three flights in question, within the meaning of that term as used in \u00a7 1301(30) supra, appellee was not required to obtain a Commercial Operator\u2019s Certificate under Part 45 of the Civil Air Regulations, and hence is not subject to the civil penalties prescribed by 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1471(a) (1) supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">In this respect appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-16\">\u201cIn enacting the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, Congress created the Federal Aviation Agency for the purpose of prescribing uniform rules and regulations for the use of navigable air space for aH users \u2014 civil and military. It also authorized the Administrator of that agency to prescribe minimum rules and regulations and standards of safety for civil aircraft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-17\">\u201cThe Act defines a third category of aircraft, i. e. \u2018public aircraft\u2019, but does not purport to give the Federal Aviation Agency, or any other agency, jurisdiction over such an aircraft or its operator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-18\">No regulation has been issued by the FAA Administrator under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, with respect to \u201cpublic aircraft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-19\">We note that the definitions of \u201ccivil aircraft\u201d, and \u201cpublic aircraft\u201d which appear in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, are identical to the provisions contained in the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, and are substantially identical to the definitions of the same terms in the Air Commerce Act of 1926. No regulation was ever issued under any statutes with respect to \u201cpublic aircraft.\u201d It would thus appear that aircraft used exclusively in the service of the government, but not including any government-owned aircraft engaged in carrying persons or property for commercial purposes, have long been exempt from regulatory control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>and from rules and regulations relating to \u201ccivil aircraft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The definition of \u201cpublic aircraft\u201d appearing in 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1301(30) is simple, plain and unambiguous. It is an aircraft used exclusively in the service of any government, but not including any government-owned aircraft engaged in carrying persons or property for commercial purposes. Under the plain language, the aircraft used exclusively in the service of any government .need not be.a government-owned aircraft. To come within the definition of \u201cpublic aircraft\u201d, the aircraft need only be used exclusively in the service of any government and need not be a government-owned aircraft engaged in carrying persons or property for commercial purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">From our review of the record in this case, much of which we have set forth in this opinion, we are forced to conclude, as did the District Court, that appellee\u2019s aircraft B-377 PG was used exclusively in the service of the government of the United States at the time the three flights in question were made; that such aircraft was a \u201cpublic aircraft\u201d within the meaning of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended; that appellee was not subject to the provisions of Civil Air Regulation 45.2, and therefore is not subject to the civil penalties set forth in 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1471(a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Appellant argues that the aircraft in question was a \u201ccivil aircraft\u201d because Congress must have intended that it be so classified, for otherwise appellee would not be subject to the regulations and standards prescribed by the FAA Administrator. We have reviewed the Congressional history relating to the enactment of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, which has been called to our attention. We find nothing in such history which has bearing upon the intention of Congress in respect to the question presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Appellant further argues that many of the provisions in the two contracts between appellee and NASA were unnecessary if the aircraft in question were a \u201cpublic aircraft\u201d and to conclude that the aircraft in question was a \u201cpublic aircraft\u201d would be to allow one government agency to contract away the powers and duties given by Congress to another agency. We do not find such arguments persuasive in light of the enactment by Congress of 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1301(30), and the fact that the aircraft in question was used exclusively in the service of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-9\">. Title 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1471(a) (1) provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-10\">\u201cAny person who violates * * * any provision of subchapter * * * VI [Safety Regulations of Civil Aeronautics] * * * of this chapter [Chapter 20, Federal Aviation Program] or any rule, regulation, or order issued thereunder * * * shall be subject to a civil penalty of not to exceed $1,-000 for each such violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b969-15\">. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1487 reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-16\">\u201c\u00a7 1487.
