The charging party, The Carvel Company, is a plumbing and heating contractor having a collective bargaining agreement with the union.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kibler and Storer Company, hereinafter Kibler &amp; Storer, is a general contractor engaged in building an addition to a bank building in Portland, Maine. Carvel is one of the subcontractors. Ballard Oil and Equipment Company, hereinafter Ballard, is a heating subcontractor on the project. Ballard is non-union, and its employees do not receive union wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Section X (4) of the collective bargaining agreement to which Carvel is a signatory provides that no member of the union \u201cwill be assigned to work or expected to work or required to work, on any job or project on which a worker or person is performing any work within the jurisdiction of Local 217 * * * [at non-union standards.]\u201d Respondent pulled its men off the Kibler &amp; Storer project because Ballard did not meet union standards. It concedes that this action was a strike,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a boycott, and accepts the Board\u2019s interpretation that the fair meaning of section X(4) of the agreement is that Carvel should not only not ask its union employees to work on the project, but should itself \u201ccease\u201d to do so. The Board held respondent\u2019s action to be a secondary boycott in violation of section 8(b) (4) (B), and con-eluded that section X(4) of the contract violated section 8(e). One member dissented with respect to the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">Respondent\u2019s basic position is that the strike activity was primary because section X(4) requires Carvel to preserve \u201cthe labor standards for which he has contracted,\u201d and, alternatively, to protect \u201cjob opportunities.\u201d Respondent asserts that since the conduct required of Carvel by section X(4) is designed to protect the integrity of its own unit, the case falls within the rationale of those decisions upholding strike action to prevent an employer from subcontracting out work which could be done by its own employees,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and not within the-proscription of NLRB v. Denver Building and Construction Trades Council, 1945, 341 U.S. 675, 71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed. 1284. Thus, it is argued, respondent\u2019s dispute is with Carvel, not with Kibler &amp; Storer or Ballard, and for this reason section X(4) is not merely an attempt to immunize by contractual provision conduct that would otherwise be illegal. NLRB v. Bangor Bldg. Trades Council, 1 Cir., 1960, 278 F.2d 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">We find no merit in respondent\u2019s argument that Ballard\u2019s employees jeopardize union standards by their presence \u201con the same construction project\u201d because of their \u201cimmediate and proximate activity.\u201d No concrete example of jeopardy has been brought to our attention, and, on the facts of this case, we can conceive of no hazard to Carvel\u2019s employees. If any jeopardy existed, it was to Ballard, whose employees, by coming into contact with Carvel\u2019s might discover the advantages of union membership. Absent some express allegation we will not assume it to be respondent\u2019s position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>that Carvel\u2019s employees would be persuaded of any disadvantages.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Respondent, however, alternatively asserts that it was striking to preserve \u201cjob opportunities,\u201d because Ballard\u2019s \u201ccheaper labor costs can be an inducement to the division of work.\u201d If respondent means to obtain more work for the union as a whole, as distinguished from Carvel\u2019s employees,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> this would seem the clearest kind of a secondary boycott. But even if it be thought to mean more work for Carvel\u2019s employees alone, the Board could properly find that respondent\u2019s real dispute was not with Carvel. It is difficult to understand how, in the absence of the contractual agreement, see NLRB v. Bangor Bldg. Trades Council, supra, there existed any potential adversity between respondent and Carvel with respect to the division of labor. The union stands to suffer a loss of work only if Carvel itself suffers. This is a far cry from the subcontracting cases, supra, where the union\u2019s purpose was to prevent an employer from self-servingly taking away its employees\u2019 work to give it to another whose labor costs are lower. The union is striking not to protect itself from Carvel, but to reduce the possibility that another contractor, because of its lower labor costs, would obtain work that Carvel itself could bid on, and might otherwise get for itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Even if we were to assume that the strike was not secondary with respect to Carvel, the strike activity could well be found directed against Ballard, and designed to coerce Kibler &amp; Storer, a neutral to the dispute, to cease doing business with Ballard. We do not accept respondent\u2019s asserted distinction that it was not seeking the \u201ccessation of the business relationship between Kibler &amp; Storer and Ballard,\u201d but was seeking simply that these parties comply with its wishes. This latter is the normal objeetive of any secondary boycott. In sum, we find unpersuasive respondent\u2019s contention that the Board was required to find that its strike constituted primary activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Respondent concedes that if the boycott is not primary, it has violated section 8(b) (4) (B). Determination that this was not primary activity also, concededly, disposes of respondent\u2019s contention that section X(4) of the agreement lies outside the ambit of section 8(e) of the act. We turn, therefore, to the question whether the agreement is saved from section 8(e) by the special construction industry proviso. The Board\u2019s decision that it is not seems to us based on a misconception.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Although section 8(e) generally prohibits \u201chot cargo\u201d agreements, a proviso explicitly exempts \u201can agreement between a labor organization and an employer in the construction industry relating to the contracting or subcontracting of work to be done at the site of the construction * * This does not legalize an agreement which purports to authorize conduct in violation of section 8(b) (4) (B). Local 1976, United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of America, etc. v. NLRB (Sand Door), 1958, 357 U.S. 93, 78 S.Ct. 1011, 2 L.Ed.2d 1186; NLRB v. Bangor Bldg. Trades Council, supra. It does authorize agreements if enforcement is limited to judicial remedies. Local Union No. 48 of Sheet Metal Workers, etc. v. Hardy Corp., 5 Cir., 1964, 332 F.2d 682. It is the Board\u2019s position that section X(4) is invalid because it \u201cincorporates into the contract self-enforcement terms providing that employees may refuse to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">In Muskegon Bricklayers Union, 1965, 152 N.L.R.B. No. 38, chiefly relied upon here, the Board said that exempted hot cargo clauses could not be enforced \u201cby strikes or other self-help economic action proscribed by section 8(b) (4) (B).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>This statenient is correct. The difficulty is that section 8(b) (4) (B) does not prohibit all forms of economic self-help. This section makes it an unfair labor practice only \u201cfor a <em>labor organization or its agents to engage in, </em>or to <em>induce or encourage </em>any [employees] * * * to engage in, a strike or a refusal [to work] * * (Ital. ours.) A requisite to its application is that \u201cemployees must be induced.\u201d <em>Sand Door, </em>supra 357 U.S. at 98, 78 S.Ct. 1011. We think it implicit in the Court\u2019s opinion, see particularly pages 98-99, 78 S.Ct. 1011, that a totally self-generated cessation of work by Carvel\u2019s employees would not be proscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">The legislative history cited by the Board does not indicate the contrary. In the course of debate on the bill, Senator Kennedy explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">\u201cThis proviso affects only Section 8(e) and therefore leaves unaffected the law developed under Section 8(b) (4). * * * Since the proviso does not relate to Section 8(b) (4), strikes and picketing to enforce the contracts excepted by the proviso will continue to be illegal under Section 8(b) (4) whenever the <em>Sand Door </em>case (357 U.S. 93, 78 S.Ct. 1011, 2 L.Ed.2d 1186) is applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201cIt is not intended to change the law with respect to judicial enforcement of these contracts, or with respect to the legality of a strike to obtain such a contract.\u201d 2 Legislative History of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, at 1433.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The House Managers\u2019 Report echoes this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201cPicketing to enforce such contracts would be illegal under the <em>Sand Door </em>case * * *. To the extent that such agreements are legal today under section 8(b) (4) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, the proviso would prevent such legality from being affected by section 8(e). * * * The proviso is not intended to limit, change, or modify the present state of the law with respect to picketing at the site of a construction project. * * * It is not intended that the proviso change the existing law with respect to judicial enforcement of these contracts or with respect to the legality of a strike to obtain such a contract.\u201d 1 Legislative History of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, at 943-44.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">The clear thrust of this history is that the construction industry proviso was intended to dovetail with section 8(b) (4), and neither to limit nor extend it. It is true that several cases decided subsequent to the 1959 amendments have broadly implied that no economic pressures of any kind could be used to enforce construction industry hot cargo clauses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Local Union No. 48 of Sheet Metal Workers, etc. v. Hardy Corp., supra 332 F.2d at 686; Orange Belt District Council of Painters No. 48, etc. v. NLRB, supra 117 U.S.App.D.C. 233, 328 F.2d at 538. However, none of these cases involved the narrow distinction between union-induced and independent self-help.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">It may be highly unlikely that employees in the position of Carvel\u2019s will refuse to work without having received some union suggestion to do so, but we must hold, so far as the abstract terms of the present contract are concerned, that as they do not call for section 8(b) (4) proscribed conduct, they remain with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>in the construction industry proviso to section 8(e).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">A decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board insofar as it relates to conduct found forbidden by section 8(b) (4) (B).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\">.

Although the union frequently refers to the fact that this is a multi-employer agreement, we are satisfied that nothing turns on this.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\">. The stipulation recites that respondent \u201crefused to allow Carvel\u2019s employees to work at the Casco Bank job.\u201d Respondent properly denominates the resulting cessation as \u201cstrike activities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b213-17\">. Orange Belt District Council of Painters No. 48, etc. v. NLRB, 1964, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 233, 328 F.2d 534; Truck Drivers Union Local No. 413, etc. v. NLRB, 1964, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 149, 334 F.2d 539, cert. den. 379 U.S. 916, 85 S.Ct. 264, 13 L.Ed.2d 186.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\">. \u201cIn realistic terms, the economic integrity of <em>a hw'gavning unit which includes the employees of </em>* * * <em>Carvel * </em>* * is jeopardized * * * when the general contractor undertakes to divide the plumbing and steamfitting work between Carvel and another sub-contraetor who provides cheaper labor.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s brief; ital. ours.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b215-9\">. This broader view finds some support in a statement by Senator Goldwater, 2 Legislative History of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, at 1858, relied upon by the Board in <em>Muskegon, </em>supra, and in its brief. Senator Goldwater\u2019s statement appears in a \u201cmemorandum\u201d submitted to the Senate on September 14, 1959, contemporaneous with the President\u2019s signing of the bill. Since it was not before Congress when the bill was voted on, nor even, so far as is indicated, before the President when he signed the bill, we do not give it significant weight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b216-16\">. The Board did not indicate that merely by bargaining for inclusion of section X(4) in the labor contract the respondent union induced or encouraged a prohibited boycott, and we think such a position would be untenable. If the union could not bargain for a clause permitting independent employee action not prohibited by section 8(b) (4), such action would be a violation of the collective bargaining agreement, leaving the employees unprotected, and their right to take such actions largely illusory.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
