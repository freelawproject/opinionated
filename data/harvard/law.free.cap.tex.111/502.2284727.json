Masterson v. Cundiff, 58 Texas, 472; Thompson v. Locke, 66 Texas, 383; Wolfe v. Sahm, 120 S. W. 1116; Seley v. Whitfield, 46 S. W. 865; Railway Co. v. Vermea Land Co., 54 S. W., 324; Townes on Texas Pleading, 328.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-8\">If it should be held that venue cannot be raised by special exception, such conclusion could not affect the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals in remanding this cause and ordering it transferred to the proper county, for the reason that the record shows that a plea of privilege was filed and acted on by the trial court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-9\">As the action of the court in overruling the plea of privilege and in overruling the special exception raising the point clearly appears from the record, no bill of exception was necessary , to preserve the point and present it in the appellate court.

Parker, 104 Texas, 162.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-3\">As the defendant below had no right of appeal from the interlocutory judgment overruling his plea of privilege, he clearly had the right to complain on an appeal from the final judgment.

W., 475.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-4\">The Court of Civil Appeals properly remanded this case with instructions to transfer to the proper county because the uncontradicted evidence showed that this action should have been taken by the trial court.

Allen waived his right to be sued in Irion County, upon the case being transferred to Nolan County.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">On April 4, 1912, the plea of privilege was heard and sustained by the court, and an order was entered transferring the case to the District Court of Nolan County. On April 27, 1912, the court sustained a motion for rehearing, filed by plaintiff in error, set aside its previous order, and overruled the plea of privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">At the time these orders were made, a statement of facts was filed, showing the proceedings and evidence at the hearing of the plea of privilege and of the motion for a rehearing of the order sustaining the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">It appears from a copy of the statement of facts, embodied in the transcript, that all the evidence offered by both parties in support of, and against, the plea of privilege consisted of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">First: A written contract between plaintiff in error and defendant in error whereby defendant in error agreed to convey to plaintiff in error the Fort Worth lots, and whereby plaintiff in error agreed to convey a certain 4428 acres of Taylor County land to defendant in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">Second: An agreement that the domiciles of defendant in error, Allen, and Rockwell were truly stated in the plea of privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Third: A letter from Allen and Rockwell, which it was admitted was addressed to plaintiff in error and was received by him in Parker Comity, stating the Port Worth property consisted of 32 three-room rent houses about two years old, nicely papered and painted, with deep well, wind mill, electric pump, and sewage system, and that defendant in error would trade for plaintiff in error\u2019s land, making the following guarantee for 22 months, each party to pay 2% per cent commission, viz: 12 houses at $2.00 per week $24.00; 12 houses at $1.50 per week $18.00; and 8 houses at $1.00 per week $8.00; making a total per week of $50.00. The letter also showed that on the basis of the guaranteed rental the lots would pay, after deducting taxes and insurance, 8 per cent net on $30,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Fourth: An agreement that the exchange contract was signed by plaintiff in error at Port Worth, by defendant in error at Sweet-water, and was returned to plaintiff in error in Parker County, with a letter stating that plaintiff in error had gotten \u201csome good income property. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Fifth. An agreement that the letter of Allen and Rockwell to plaintiff in error was in response to a letter from plaintiff in error making inquiry about what the Port Worth lots were bringing in rentals.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">At the March term, 1914, defendant in error requested the court to submit to the jury the issues presented by his plea of privilege, to which plaintiff in error objected, on the ground that the court\u2019s previous order conclusively determined the plea, which objection was sustained, and the court declined to again hear or determine the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The trial of the ease, on the merits, on April 24, 1914, resulted in a verdict and judgment for plaintiff in error, against defendant in error, for $4038.50, and in favor of Allen and Rockwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">On appeal, the Port Worth Court of Civil Appeals reversed the judgment of the District Court, in so far as same was against defendant in error, and remanded the cause, with directions to sustain the plea of privilege and to transfer the case to the District Court of Nolan County for a new trial as between plaintiff in error and defendant in error. 178 S. W., 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Plaintiff in error complains of the action of the Court of Civil Appeals in reviewing the order overruling the plea of privilege, in the absence of a bill of exceptions, citing Levy v. Lupton, 156 S. W., 363; American Warehouse Co. v. Ray, 150 S. W., 764; and Ward v. Odem, 153 S. W., 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">These cases are cited on the proposition that defendant in error having taken no bill of exceptions when his plea of privilege was overruled is to be considered as having acquiesced therein, under rule 70 for the District and County Courts, 142 S. W., XXII. The writ of error was granted because of the conflict between those decisions and the decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>If the evidence submitted on a plea of privilege be brought before the appellate court in either a bill of exceptions or a statement of facts, we are sure it should be considered. The bill of exceptions is an appropriate means of disclosing proceedings preliminary to the trial of a cause on its merits. But the determination of an issue presented by a plea of privilege may well be regarded as a part of the \"trial\u201d referred to in our statute directing the preparation of a statement of the facts given in evidence on the trial. Mi Palmo v. Slayden &amp; Co., 100 Texas, 15, 92 S. W., 796; Gulf C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Muse, 109 Texas, 360, 4 A. L. R., 613, 207 S. W., 897. So far as concerns the court\u2019s order on the plea of privilege and a party\u2019s exception thereto, a bill of exceptions would be entirely useless, the proper entry on the minutes definitely disclosing such order and exception. For that reason, no bill would be required where the question of venue was determined on special exception only. Thomson v. Locke, 66 Texas, 386, 1 S. W., 112. Disregarding mere form, it is quite indisputable that' defendant in error did not acquiesce in the court\u2019s action in overruling his plea. Instead of acquiescing, he Vas excepting, and he was preparing and preserving everything requisite to avail himself of his exception in the reviewing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">It can hardly be said that defendant in error failed to take a bill of exceptions. He preserved in the record all that transpired in the court below when his plea of privilege was heard and sustained, and when it was heard and overruled, in the order on the minutes and in what is termed a statement of facts, both authenticated by the trial judge. Not only does the statement of facts show all the evidence introduced in support of, and against, the plea, and the court\u2019s action thereon, but it also shows, by express reference to the order overruling the plea, the exception to the court\u2019s ruling as reserved in open- court. Therefore, we have in the record all that would be required in a proper bill of exceptions, if we ignore mere form. We should ignore mere form not only in obedience to the dictate of reason but in obedience to the mandate of article 2059 of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Royal Insurance Co. v. Texas &amp; P. Ry. Co., 102 Texas, 307, 116 S. W., 46, is decisive of the proposition that copying the statement of facts into the transcript, instead of transmitting the original, was a mere informality in the manner of bringing the case to the Court of Civil Appeals. Under rule 8 for the Courts of Civil Appeals, 142 S. W., XI, plaintiff in error was required to object to the consideration of the statement as copied within thirty days after the transcript was filed. His failure to make objection of any sort, for some six months after the filing of the transcript, was a clear waiver of any objection to the manner in which the statement of facts was presented. The Court of Civil Appeals correctly refused to disregard the copy of the statement in determining the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">To deprive a defendant of the right of trial in the county of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>domicile, the case against him must be within an exception to article 1830 of the Revised Statutes. With the venue challenged, under proper plea, by one sued without his county, as shown by the plaintiff\u2019s pleading, or by proof, the burden not only to allege but to prove that the case is within one of the exceptions to the statute rests on the plaintiff. Pecos &amp; N. T. Ry. Co. v. Thompson, 106 Texas, 460, 167 S. W., 801; Hilliard Bros. v. Wilson, 76 Tex., 184, 13 S. W., 25; Durango Land &amp; Timber Co. v. Shaw, 165 S. W., 490; Cloyd v. Sacra, 175 S. W., 457; Graves v. McCollum &amp; Lewis, 193 S. W., 217. Plaintiff in error wholly failed, on the hearing or rehearing of the plea of privilege, to meet the burden resting on him to prove a cause of action for fraud committed in Parker County. The Court of Civil Appeals directed the entry of the order, on the plea of privilege, to which defendant in error was in law entitled in the trial court, and the Supreme Court would not be authorized to set aside the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals, in order that another trial be had of the plea of privilege. Pecos &amp; N. T. Ry. Co. v. Thompson, 106 Texas, 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\">The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
