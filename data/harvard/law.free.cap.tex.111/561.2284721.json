The opinion was dated April 24, 1916, and is to be found in the Report and Opinions of the Attorney General of Texas for the years 1914 to 1916, pages 175 to 193. We will quote from that opinion, giving the list of authorities which will constitute a part of our brief in this case!:</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-4\">A cashier\u2019s check is the bank\u2019s own check which is issued by the cashier at the request of a depositor against whose account it is charged. Such a check is strictly commercial paper, and is merely a bill of exchange drawn by a bank on itself and accepted in advance by the act of its issuance. It is not subject to countermand by the payee after endorsement, as is an ordinary check by the endorser, and the relations of the parties to such an instrument are analogous to those of the parties to a negotiable note payable on demand. 2nd Michie on Banks and Banking 1168-1105; Penn Bank v. Frankish, 91 Penn., 339; Drinkall v. Movius State Bank, 57 L. R. A., 341; Henry v. Allen, 36 L. R. A., 658. Throughout the whole! Guaranty Act, the claims or obligations to be protected are constantly referred to as deposit obligations, and the fund raised under the guaranty fund plan is designated in the law as the Depositor\u2019s Guaranty Fund. The! word \u201cdepositor\u201d in the Act is evidently used in its general and ordinary significance. A depositor is one who delivers to or leaves with the bank money subject to his order, either general time deposit or subject to cheek. Michie on Banks and Banking, Vol. 2, Sec. 119; Lawson v. Baker, 220 S. W., 260, 269; State v. Corning State Saving Bank, 113 N. W., 500.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-5\">In determining the amount which shall constitute the Guaranty Fund, each bank is required to pay a per centage on its daily average \u201cdeposits.\u201d R.

In determining the amount of the Guaranty Fund or of reserves, cashier\u2019s checks are not regarded or considered any where! under the law. The Banking Department has continuously held, as has the Attorney-General, that cashier\u2019s checks were not protected by the Guaranty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Fund, and this, as we understand the rule, is to be considered by the court in construing the law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b595-5\"><em>Hawkins, Hawkins &amp; David, </em>as amici curiae and on behalf of clients similarly interested, filed an argument and citation of authorities in support of relator\u2019s position.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b595-6\">W. <em>A.

Justice GREENWOOD</author>\n<p id=\"AfG\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Relator brought this suit in the Supreme Court, against the State Banking Board, the Commissioner of Insurance and Banking, the State Treasurer, and the Attorney General, to compel the payment to Relator of three thousand dollars out of the guaranty fund created under the banking laws of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">Prior to December 21, 1920, Relator deposited certain sums of money in the Leeray Guaranty State Bank, of Leeray, Texas, which was chartered under the banking laws of Texas. The Bank operated under the \u201cguaranty fund plan.\u201d The Bank was closed on account of its insolvency on December 31, 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">On December 21, 1920, the Relator had an open, unsecured, and non-interest-bearing deposit with the Bank of $3712.35. On that day he cashed a check for $200, leaving a balance to his credit as a general depositor in said Bank of $3512.35. At the same time, Relator obtained from the/ Bank its cashier\u2019s check, which was signed by its cashier, and which, omitting the cashier\u2019s signature, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-11\">i. \u201cNo. 1184</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-12\">\u201cLeeray Guaranty State Bank,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-13\">\u201cLeeray, Texas, Dec. 21, 1920.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-14\">\u201cPay to the order of J. S. Middlekauff</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-15\">\u201c$3000, Three Thousand Dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-16\">\u201cCashier\u2019s Check.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-17\">In exchange for the cashier\u2019s check, Relator gave his own check on the Bank for $3000. The cashier\u2019s check was never paid, on account of the insolvency of the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-18\">Relator presented a claim for the payment to him of $3512.35 out of the guaranty fund, by reason of the aforesaid indebtedness of the Bank to him. His right to payment of $512.35 out of the guaranty fund was not questioned, and that sum has been paid to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-19\">The single question for our determination is whether, on the facts stated, the Relator is entitled to have the balance of his claim against the Bank, amounting to $3000, paid out of the guaranty fund, it being contended by Respondents that after the acceptance of the cashier\u2019s cheek, Relator no longer had an unsecured and non-interest bearing deposit in the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Before the cashier\u2019s check was applied for, on December 21, 1920, Relator was a general depositor in the Bank. He was the Bank\u2019s creditor for $3512.35. The Bank was his debtor in that amount. The money which Relator placed in the Bank had become the property of \u25a0 the Bank. , The obligation of-the Bank was to pay to him $3512.35, on demand, which obligation was manifestly secured by the guaranty fund and in no other way. Unless otherwise agreed, this obligation of the Bank to Relator as a depositor could be discharged only by payment in money to him, or to his order, of the full amount of hiS deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\">No facts are relied on, to show an agreement by Relator releasing the Bank from its obligation, or to show a payment in discharge of same, to the extent of $3000, save that Relator gave The Bank his check against his deposit for $3000, and received the Bank\u2019s check \u2022 on itself for that sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">It is essential to the extinguishment of an obligation, by the debtor\u2019s issuance of his own negotiable/ paper therefor to his creditor, that both debtor and creditor intend the paper to discharge the obligation. The law indulges in no presumption from the creditor\u2019s acceptance of the paper that it is to operate as an absolute payment. The presumption is, on the contrary, that the parties intend that the paper shall operate only as a conditional payment. The condition implied is performance of the promise evide/nced by the paper. Upon the paper\u2019s dishonor, the creditor may enforce the debtor\u2019s original obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In McGuire v. Bidwell, 64 Texas, 45, the court, through Judge Stayton, said: \u2018 \u2018 The rule .is that the ne/gotiable promissory note of the debtor does not amount to payment of the indebtedness for which it is given unless the circumstances show that such was the intention of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Again, in Johnson v. Amarillo Improvement Co., 88 Texas, 510, 31 S. W., 505, the declaration in Crane v. Clay, 25 English Law and Equity Reports, 451, was quoted with approval, as follows: \u201cA bill given for and on account of money due on a simple contract operates as a conditional payment, which may be repudiated at the option of the creditor, if the bill be unpaid at maturity in his hands, in which case he may rescind the transaction of payment and sue on the original contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">The transaction between Relator and the Bank negatives an intent by either party for the cashier\u2019s cheek to wipe out the Bank\u2019s debt. Relator had put his money in the Bank for safekeeping, being entitled to rely on the security afforded by the guaranty fund. He chose not to have the Bank pay him $3000, on his check, in discharge of its obligation in that amount. He sought to avoid the risk of carrying that much money on his person. He did not care to substitute another debtor for the Bank. We cannot reasonably attribute to him the purpose to merely weaken his security. The certificates for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Relator\u2019s deposits, whether on slips or in a pass-book, evidenced that he had an unsecured, non-interest-bearing, debt against the Bank, payable to him or his order on demand, for his unchecked and unpaid balance. The cashier\u2019s check evidenced the same obligation, save it specified the balance, and, in ordinary course, it would have enabled Relator to utilize his balance with more facility. Had Relator had his own $3000 check certified, or had he taken the Bank\u2019s formal certificate of deposit for that amount, no one could maintain that he meant such negotiable paper to extinguish the Bank\u2019s liability to him as a depositor. Yet it seems plain enough that we can ascribe no different intention to the parties, with respect to discharge of the Bank\u2019s obligation, supported by the guaranty fund, than if their transaction had been consummated by means of formal certificate of deposit or by certified check. 5 R. C. L., 483, 484; Walker v. Sellers, 201 Ala., 189, 77 So., 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">-\u25a0Referring to a cashier\u2019s check, which a depositor of a bank obtained by having the amount of the check entered on his pass-book as a payment to him, the Supreme Court of Illinois said: \u201cThe check was not drawn by a depositor, but was simply an acknowledgment of an indebtedness on the part of the bank to the payee of the order. As between the bank and appellant (the payee) it was, in legal effect, the same as a certificate of deposit or a certified check.\u201d Clark v. Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co., 186 Ill., 444, 53 L. R. A., 232, 78 Am. St., 294; Same case, 85 Ill. App., 295. To the same effect, see Lummus Cotton Gin Co. v. Walker, Supt., 195 Ala., 555, 70 So., 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Relator\u2019s check for $3000 against his deposit has not been paid. He drew the cheek to get $3000 not at that moment but when he or his transferee might choose to present the cashier\u2019s check. The cashier\u2019s check was but the vehicle by which the payment of Relator\u2019s check was to be\"accomplished. Upon the dishonor of the Bank\u2019s check. Relator\u2019s deposit stands as though he had never drawn Ms own $3000 cheek, nor received the Bank\u2019s worthless check. Western Brass Mfg. Co. v. Maverick, 4 Texas Civ. App. 535, 23 S. W., 728; Anderson v. Owen, 112 Miss., 476, 73 South., 286; Bank of Greenville v. Kretschmar, 91 Miss., 615, 44 So., 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">We are not inclined to hold that a cashier\u2019s cheek will ordinarily draw interest in advance of its presentment for payment. The essential understanding of the parties is that the principal only is to be paid whenever the holder may elect to present the! cheek for payment. Duncan v. Magette, 25 Texas, 248. However, having held that Relator could repudiate the cheek, on the Bank\u2019s insolvency, as he did, it is not necessary for us to determine the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Since it plainly appears that the transaction between Relator and the Bank did not discharge the Bank\u2019s obligation to Relator as a general depositor, entitled to the benefits of the guaranty fund, such transaction presents no obstacle to his maintenance of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>We express no opinion as to the/ right, with respect to the guaranty-fund, of a payee of a cashier\u2019s check, to whom no obligation has been previously incurred under a general deposit. It is enough to say that Relator\u2019s unextinguished rights undefr his open, unsecured and non-interest-bearing deposit furnish the basis on which we predicate the decree in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">It is ordered that this suit be dismissed as to the/ respondents no longer in office, and that a writ of mandamus be issued against the remaining respondents, requiring the allowance of the claim of Relator for payment out of the1 bank guaranty fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Chief Justice Cureton took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
