B. Garrett, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-5\">It was error prejudicial to the defendant, in the trial court, to permit the witnesses Quinn, Menke and Ellis to testify that, in their judgment, the damages or difference in the value of the pasture land before and after the fire, on account of the permanent injury to the turf and sod, was fifty (50) cents per acre, for the reason that said testimony was the arbitrary opinion or conclusion of said witnesses upon the matter and issue exclusively for the jury to determine, from a consideration of proper evidence. International &amp; G. N. Ry. Co. v. Fickey, 125 S. W., 327; Boyer &amp; Lucas v. St. Louis, S. F. &amp; T. Ry. Co., 72 S. W., 1038; Dallas Term. Ry. Co. v. Ardrey, 146 S. W., 617; Bell County v. Flint, 91 S. W., 329; Gainesville H. &amp; W. Ry. Co. v. Hall, 78 Texas, 169.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-6\">The testimony of the witness above referred to was improper, and not admissible over the objection that it was not the proper basis for the correct measure of damages to land because of injury to the turf and soil, for the reason that, in cases of this character, the proper measure of damages is the difference in the market value of the la,nd before the fire, exclusive of the value of the grass, and its market value after the fire. Railway Co. v. Hendricks, 25 S. W., 433; Trinity &amp; B. V. Ry. Co. v. Gregory, 142 S. W., 656; Trinity &amp; B. V. Ry. Co. v. Burke, 142 S. W., 658; Texas &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. Prude, 39 Texas Civ. App., 144; Gulf Pipe Line Co. v. Bryoner, 124 S. W., 1010.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-7\">The charge was affirmatively erroneous, in not submitting the correct measure of damages to the land by reason of injury to the turf by fire, for the reason that, in cases of this character, the correct measure of damages is the difference in the market value of the land immediately before the fire, exclusive of the value of the grass fhereon, and its market value after the fire.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b46-8\"><em>J.

Railway v. Wallace, 74 Texas, 581; Railway v. Ayers, 8 S. W., 538.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b47-4\">Mr. Chief Justice PHILLIPS</author>\n<p id=\"A00\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 pasture was set afire by a passing engine of the defendant and the grass was burned off. The suit was for the value of the grass burned and for the injury done the turf by the fire. A judgment for the plaintiffs was affirmed by the honorable Court of Civil Appeals for the Third District.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Complaint is made that some of the witnesses were permitted to testify that the damage done to the' pasture land by the fire was a stated amount \u2014 two \u00abfixing it at fifty cents per acre and one at seven cents per acre. It is urged that the ruling of the Court of Civil Appeals on the admission' of this testimony is in conflict with its decision in International &amp; G. N. Railway Company v. Fickey, 125 S. W., 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">There is no conflict. Had the witnesses been allowed to say that the damage to the land was a given amount, it would have been improper and contrary to the decision cited. But such was not the testimony as given. The witness Quinn, for instance, was asked to state his judgm\u00e9nt as \u201cto the damage to the pasture.\u201d An objection that the question called for the conclusion of the witness upon a matter exclusively for the jury and for testimony not the proper basis for the correct measure of damages, was overruled. The question was repeated, but in this form, \u201cWhat would be the damage, the difference between the value of the pasture before the fire and after the fire?\u201d The answer of the witness, shown to havebeenan experienced cattleman and familiar with the pasture, was this: \u201cIf you are going to rent a pasture for stock, and one had been burned and one was not burned, I would make fifty cents an acre difference. Yes sir, that would be a fair difference in the value.\u201d While so much of the question as asked for a statement of the witness\u2019 opinion as to \u201cthe damage\u201d was objectionable, as a part of the same question he was asked to state his opinion as to \u201cthe difference between the value\u201d of the pasture before and after the fire; and his answer gave an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>amount .which he expressly stated as \u201cthe fair difference in the value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">The measure of damages was the difference in the value of the land because of the injury. The value of property is a matter of opinion. A witness may give his opinion on the question. No obj\u00e9ction was made that the witness here was not qualified by knowledge to give an opinion. His. testimony shows that it related to value. It might have been preferable to have had him state his opinion as to the value of the pasture land before the fire and its value afterward, instead of stating the difference between'the value before and after; but his answer had the same effect. In substance, it amounted to the same thing, and a court should look to the substance. We will not reverse a judgment upon such grounds. The testimony, and that of the other witnesses as well, under any fair interpretation had reference only to the difference in the value of the land occasioned by the defendant\u2019s wrongful act. That was the inquiry before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The charge informed the jury that if the verdict was for the plaintiffs, it should award them 11 such an amount of money as you believe from the evidence to be the reasonable value of the grass destroyed by the fire as alleged and the damage to the grass roots, if any; \u2019 \u2019 and that \u201cthe measure of damages for injury to the roots is the difference in the value of the land before and after the burning for pasturage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The verdict stated the amount found as the value of the grass destroyed, at $2.50 per acre for the 617 acres, or $1542.50; and the amount of the damage to the land as 50 cents per acre, \u2014 a total of the two elements of damage of $1851.00 \u2014 showing that double damages were not allowed and rendering criticism of the charge untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The judgments of the District Court and Court of Civil Appeals are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">(Associate Justice Hawkins dissents and will later'file a statement of his views.) The promised dissenting opinion seems not to have been filed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
