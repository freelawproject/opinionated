(2) Said act is in conflict with section twenty-eight of the Bill of Rights in that it attempts to confer upon the voters of said county and the commissioners' court of said county the right to suspend the laws of this state, which right is exclusively invested in the legislature.

That law was held unconstitutional by this Court in Ex Parte Mitchell, 109 Texas, 11, 177 S. W., 953. This holding was afterwards concurred in by the Court of Criminal Appeals, that court receding from the former holding of a majority of its members upon the question, from which former holding Presiding Judge Davidson had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>dissented. Lyle v. State, 80 Texas Criminal, 606; 193 S. W., 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\">The decision in Ex Parte Mitchell controls the case, and accord- . ingly the judgments of the Court of Civil Appeals and District Court are reversed and judgment is here rendered for the plaintiffs in error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
