(P. 4448).</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b477-5\">2. \u2014 Same\u2014Statutory Construction.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b477-6\">No consideration of venue is required in conferring jurisdiction on the Supreme Court; and this, and the providing in the same section of the Act for the appointment of a receiver, is appropriate only to a District Court and wholly unsuited to confer jurisdiction on the Supreme Court. (P. 448).</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-7\">This was a motion in the Supreme Court for leave to file an original petition therein for issuance of a writ of mandamus against the State Commissioner of Insurance and Banking.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-8\"><em>Cocke &lt;&amp; Cocke, </em>and <em>Ethridge, McCormick &amp; Bromberg, </em>for relators.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-9\">The jurisdiction of this court to issue the writ cannot he questioned. Aetna Insurance Co. v. Hawkins, Commissioner of Insurance and Banking, 103 Texas, 195; Firemen\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. Von Rosenberg, Commissioner, 103 Texas, 571. Mandamus is the only adequate remedy. Hazelwood v. Rogan, Commissioner, 95 Texas, 295.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-10\">Where the duties sought to be enforced consist both of discretional and ministerial acts, and all discretion has been exhausted, mandamus lies to compel the performance of the remaining ministerial duties. Such has been the law since Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137. United States v. Schurz, 102 U. S., 378.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b477-11\">Mr. Justice GREENWOOD</author>\n<p id=\"Ayv\">delivered the opinion \u00f3f the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">The Thirty-fourth Legislature of Texas, at its First called Session, passed an act, approved May 27, 1915, regulating the business of eorporated and unincorporated Co-Operative Savings and Contract Loan Companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">The Act, being Chapter 5 of the acts of said session of the Legislature, among other things, places the companies regulated by it under the supervision and control of the Commissioner of Insurance and Banking, and requires that all forms of contracts which the companies may seek to issue \u201cshall be first submitted to the Commissioner of Insurance and Banking for his examination and approval,\u201d and that if approved by the Commissioner, \u201cthe same may thereafter be issued and sold,\u201d but if disapproved by him, then \u201csuch company max institute a proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction and venue to review his action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">The Act further provides: \u201cAll contracts issued by any such company shall have upon their face a certificate substantially in the following words: \u2018This contract is registered, and approved securities equal in value to the legal reserve hereon are held in trust by the Commissioner of Insurance and Banking of the State of Texas,' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>which certificate shall be signed by the Commissioner and sealed with the seal of his office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Relators allege that the unincorporated association in whose behalf they sue complied with all the requirements of the Act and procured the Commissioner\u2019s approval of, and certificate to, 2497 Contracts issued by said association between May 26, 1921, when a certificate of authority to do business was issued to the association and November 18, 1921, when the Commissioner refused to approve, or sign certificates on, certain contracts, following the previously approved form, which the association presented to the Commissioner, unless certain sections in said form were eliminated from said contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Relators filed a motion for leave to file a petition for a mandamus to compel the Respondent Commissioner of Insurance and Banking to place his certificate on the contracts presented by the association to him in the form, which he had already approved, and to continue to place his certificates on contracts in the approved form, so long as the deposits to secure such contracts might be made as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The motion of relators for leave to file the petition for mandamus will be refused because of the want of jurisdiction in the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">In our opinion the Legislature clearly meant other, courts than the Supreme Court when it provided that proceedings of this character be instituted \"in any court of competent jurisdiction and venue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">The Legislature would never require a consideration of venue with respect to a suit in the Supreme Court. It is also significant that precisely the same language is used a few lines later in the same section and act in providing for the appointment of a receiver of a company operating under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">The language'accurately fits an appropriate district court and is whollj unsuited to confer jurisdiction on the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">The Supreme Court has such original jurisdiction in mandamus cases as the Legislature may confer; but, so has the district court, Thorne v. Moore, 101 Texas, 208, 105 S. W., 985; and, when the Legislature has used language negativing an intent for the Supreme Court to assume original jurisdiction, in specified mandamus cases, and declaring an intent for other courts to take original jurisdiction, then, in all such cases the Supreme Court must, of course, refsue to exercise original jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">Relators\u2019 motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">Chief Justice Cureton not sitting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
