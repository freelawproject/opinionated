Such filing shall be the only act required to perfect the appeal and vest jurisdiction in the court. &amp; * sfc ''</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-20\">Hansford admits the notice should have been filed in Butler County. She contends the statute pertains to venue. The appellee Administrator maintains the statute controls subject-matter jurisdiction. If construed as a venue statute, jurisdiction could have been maintained by the trial court. Conversely, if the statute controls subject-matter jurisdiction, the proper action was dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-21\">The appellee correctly points out where a right of appeal is conferred by statute the appeal can only be perfected in the mode prescribed by that statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The right to appeal from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>OBES ruling is, indeed, conferred by R.C. 4141.28(0). This is evidenced by the clear language of the statute which provides that \u201cfiling shall be the only act required to perfect the appeal and vest jurisdiction in the court.\u201d We conclude the statute controls subject-matter jurisdiction and, therefore, an appeal can only be perfected if the requisites of R.C. 4141.28(0) are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The requisites of R.C. 4141.28(0) are clear. An appeal from the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review by an employee-appellant must be filed in the court of common pleas of the county in which the employee-appellant is a resident or was last employed. Hansford\u2019s appeal was incorrectly filed and the action w\u00e1s properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The judgment of the court of appeals is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b121-9\">Moyer, C.J., Locher, Holmes and H.
