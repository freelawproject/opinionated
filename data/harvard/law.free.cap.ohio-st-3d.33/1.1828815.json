For the reasons discussed <em>infra, </em>we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals with regard to appellant\u2019s conviction, but reverse the judgment of the court of appeals as to appellant\u2019s death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">We begin our analysis by considering appellant\u2019s propositions of law which challenge the validity of his conviction for aggravated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">In appellant\u2019s first proposition of law, he asserts that his conviction must be reversed because the prosecutor improperly commented upon appellant\u2019s refusal to testify on his own behalf. Appellant argues that he was materially prejudiced by comments made during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. We agree that the comments of the prosecutor were improper but do not agree that such comments affected in any material way the <em>conviction </em>of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-14\">In closing argument, the prosecutor made the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-15\">\u201c* * * The only other thing that is missing in this case is a complete and total confession to the crime by the defendant. Why doesn\u2019t he tell us what happened and make it easier on himself. He doesn\u2019t want to admit the actual killing. * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-17\">\u201c* * * What happened next? He walked back to his own house. Why? Something happen? What did he do, proposition her? She\u2019s a good-looking woman. What does he say to her? I don\u2019t know * * *. * * * Was he mad? Had he been jilted? Did he decide he really liked the girl? Heaven knows. I don\u2019t know and he\u2019s not telling us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-18\"><em>I i </em>* jfc $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-19\">\u201c* * * I submit that it does not make one bit of difference whether Mr. Thompson remembers tying up Beth or having sex with Beth or having killed her. It doesn\u2019t make any difference because we know that he did. <em>Why isn\u2019t he telling us that? What is he trying to tell vis? That he had a blackout? Balogna </em>[sic]. Our version is that Mr. Thompson told us as much as he thought he could, but he\u2019s going to leave out something because he wanted to bargain. He wanted a deal.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-20\">Appellant objected to the prosecutor\u2019s comments on two separate occasions. Both objections were sustained. Following the first sustained objection, the court stated, \u201c[h]e\u2019s [appellant\u2019s] under no obligation to tell anyone. The jury will disregard that completely.\u201d Additionally, the court gave the following curative instruction as part of its general charge to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u201cThe defendant did not testify in this case. It is not necessary that the defendant take the witness stand in his own defense. He has a constitutional right not to testify. The fact that he did not testify must not be considered for any purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 609, 32 O.O. 2d 437, held that a prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding a defendant\u2019s refusal to testify violated the accused\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lynn </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St. 2d 106, 34 O.O. 2d 226, 214 N.E. 2d 226. However, in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 18, and more recently in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hasting </em>(1983), 461 U.S. 499, the Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s <em>conviction </em>may be affirmed, provided that the comments regarding the defendant\u2019s silence are found to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. This court has similarly held that if it is \u201c* * * clear beyond a reasonable doubt that, absent the prosecutor\u2019s comments, the jury would have found the defendant guilty,\u201d then the defendant\u2019s conviction need not be reversed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St. 3d 13, 15, 14 OBR 317, 319, 470 N.E. 2d 883, 886; see, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Zimmerman </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 43, 18 OBR 79, 479 N.E. 2d 862, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Comments by prosecutors on the post-arrest silence or refusal to testify by defendants have always been looked upon with extreme disfavor because they raise an inference of guilt from a defendant\u2019s decision to remain silent. in effect, such comments penalize a defendant for choosing to exercise a constitutional right. Prosecutors must therefore take care not to equate the defendant\u2019s silence to guilt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St. 3d 70, 512 N.E. 2d 581. Further, they must be aware that where such comments work to the material prejudice of the defendant, they will not be tolerated. See, <em>e.g., Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield </em>(1986), 474 U.S. 284; <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1976), 426 U.S. 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Although considerable latitude is permitted the parties in closing argument, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in the case now before us were unquestionably improper.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, after previously having this line of argument objected to, which objection was <em>sustained </em>by the court, the prosecutor proceeded to comment once again on appellant\u2019s failure to tell his side of the story. This third comment prompted both an objection, which was again sustained, and a motion for a mistrial, which was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">Notwithstanding the clear impropriety of the prosecutor\u2019s comments, there is no doubt that the jury herein would have convicted appellant even if the comments in question had not been made. Appellant\u2019s admissions and the other evidence produced leave <em>no doubt </em>that appellant was the perpetrator of the crime. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s comments, while highly improper and possibly even subject to a contempt sanction,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did not work to the material prejudice of the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>in the <em>guilt phase </em>of the proceeding. Accordingly, as the prosecutor\u2019s comments were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, appellant\u2019s first proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In appellant\u2019s second proposition of law, appellant charges that the trial court erred when it failed to grant appellant\u2019s motions for a change of venue. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">A trial court may order a change of venue \u201c* * * when it appears that a fair and impartial trial cannot be held in the jurisdiction in which the trial would otherwise be held * * *.\u201d R.C. 2901.12(J). See, also, Crim. R. 18(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Although a criminal defendant is entitled to \u201c* * * a fair trial by a panel of impartial, \u2018indifferent\u2019 jurors,\u201d there is no requirement \u201c* * * that the jurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.\u201d <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd </em>(1961), 366 U.S. 717, 722. Thus, the trial court must examine \u201c* * * the totality of the surrounding facts * * *\u201d and make its \u201c* * * own estimate of local conditions * * *\u201d when deciding whether a change of venue is warranted because of the pretrial publicity a case has received. <em>Id. </em>at 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">In making this decision, the trial court should scrutinize closely the <em>voir dire </em>examination of prospective jurors. An important consideration in deciding whether pre-trial publicity has acted to prevent the defendant from having a fair trial is whether a \u201c* * * juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court * * *.\u201d <em>Irvin, supra, </em>at 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">Additionally, this court has held that \u201c[t]he examination of jurors on their <em>voir dire </em>affords the best test as to whether prejudice exists in the community against the defendant, and where it appears that opinions as to the guilt of the defendant of those called for examination for jurors are not fixed but would yield readily to evidence, it is not error to overrule an application for a change of venue, in absence of a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Swiger </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St. 2d 151, 34 O.O. 2d 270, 214 N.E. 2d 417, paragraph one of the syllabus, certiorari denied (1966), 385 U.S. 874.</p>\n<p id=\"At6\">We are satisfied that the trial court herein did not abuse its discretion when it overruled appellant\u2019s motions for a change of venue. Extensive <em>voir dire </em>examinations were conducted prior to a jury being impanelled.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Fifty-two prospective jurors were questioned by the prosecutor, the defense counsel and the trial court concerning his or her opinion of appellant\u2019s guilt and whether he or she could set aside that opinion in order to render an impartial verdict based upon the evidence adduced during trial. In fact, appellant was so satisfied with the jury ultimately impanelled, that he elected not to use all his statutorily granted peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">Moreover, we find the pre-trial publicity herein was not such as to inflame the passions of the jury against appellant and deny him a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fairbanks </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St. 2d 34, 61 O.O. 2d 241, 289 N.E. 2d 352. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The newspaper and broadcast accounts of the murder were neither so inflammatory nor so prejudicial as to warrant a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">In sum, there is no indication in the record that the trial court abused its discretion by denying appellant\u2019s motions for a change of venue. Appellant\u2019s second proposition of law is, therefore, without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In appellant\u2019s third proposition of law, appellant contends that it was prejudicial error, under <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1985), 472 U.S. 320, for the trial jury to be told that its determination regarding the death penalty is only a non-binding recommendation. We have previously considered and rejected this argument in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St. 3d 16, 21, 23 OBR 13, 18, 490 N.E. 2d 906, 912; <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St. 3d 92, 104, 26 OBR 79, 89-90, 497 N.E. 2d 55, 65; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St. 3d 427, 28 OBR 480, 504 N.E. 2d 52. Appellant has not persuaded us to alter our present position. Further, we find that the comments made by the trial court, the prosecutor and the defense counsel were not such as to diminish the jury\u2019s sense of responsibility for determining whether the sentence of death should be imposed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject this proposition of law. But, see, our admonitions regarding the propriety of making such comments in <em>State </em>v. <em>Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St. 3d 124, 144, 22 OBR 203, 220, 489 N.E. 2d 795, 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In appellant\u2019s sixth proposition of law, he argues that a defendant in a capital case has the right to the assistance of a qualified psychologist to assist him in jury selection where there has been intense pretrial publicity. We disagree. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 164, 194, 15 OBR 311, 336, 473 N.E. 2d 264, 292, this court previously upheld the denial of funding for a social scientist to assist in jury selection, when such expert acts only as a consultant to counsel as opposed to a source of evidence on relevant disputed factual issues. We find the <em>Jenkins </em>rationale equally applicable herein, because the psychologist would assist only in the selection of the jury and not testify on disputed factual issues. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to appoint a psychologist for appellant. Therefore, this proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Appellant, in his seventh proposition of law, argues that he should have been permitted to act as co-counsel in his own behalf during the trial. Appellant argues that a hybrid representation of criminal defendant and defense counsel both preserves the reliability of the judicial process and protects his dignity. We do not agree. Neither the United States Constitution, the Ohio Constitution nor case law mandates such a hybrid representation. See <em>McKaskle </em>v. <em>Wiggins </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 168. Although appellant has the right either to appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>pro se </em>or to have counsel, he has no corresponding right to act as co-counsel on his own behalf. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s seventh proposition of law is not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Appellant, in his eighth proposition of law, urges that his arrest was unlawful and that all statements and evidence obtained as a result therefrom should have been suppressed at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Appellant first argues that his arrest was illegal because it was effected without a warrant. We do not agree. The record indicates that the arrest was effected by appellant\u2019s parole officer, not a police officer. While police officers were present, they were there only to protect the parole officer and provide support, if needed, for the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In Ohio, a parole officer is not required to obtain a warrant prior to arresting a parolee for a parole violation. R.C. 2967.15 provides the procedure by which a parole officer may effect the arrest of a parolee. This section provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201c* * * Whenever any parole officer has reasonable cause to believe that any parolee under the supervision of the [adult parole] authority has violated the terms and conditions of his pardon or parole, such parole officer may arrest such parolee, or may order any sheriff, deputy sheriff, constable, or police officer to make such arrest. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">Thus, a parole officer may arrest a parolee if the parole officer has reasonable cause to believe that the parolee has violated the conditions of his parole. In this regard, R.C. 2967.15 is analogous to R.C. 2951.08, which authorizes the warrantless arrest of probationers for violating the terms and conditions of their probation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This court has thus found, in the context of constitutional guarantees, no distinction between probationers and parolees. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St. 3d 225, 513 N.E. 2d 720. Both probationers and parolees have been held to possess Fourth Amendment rights more limited than other people, because they are considered to be in the constructive, as opposed to actual or physical, custody of the state at all times during their probation or parole. <em>State </em>v. <em>Deener </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 335, 18 O.O. 3d 499, 414 N.E. 2d 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">Appellant\u2019s parole was conditioned upon his obeying all municipal, state and federal laws. Since the arresting parole officer knew that appellant was the prime suspect in a murder investigation, that officer had reasonable cause to believe that appellant had violated his parole. Accordingly, the parole officer had the authority, pursuant to R.C. 2967.15, to make the warrantless arrest of appellant herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">Appellant additionally argues that the warrantless entry into his brother\u2019s apartment to effectuate the arrest was illegal, and that the statements and evidence in question should therefore have been suppressed. We disagree. In <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1980), 445 U.S. 573, the Supreme Court held that police may not enter a suspect\u2019s home to arrest him without either a warrant or exigent circumstances. <em>Payton, </em>however, does not apply where the entry is made with the consent of the occupant. <em>Id. </em>at 583; <em>Steagald </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 204, 211-212. In the instant cause, the entry, if any, was consensual. Appellant answered the door and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>permitted the parole officer to place him under arrest. The record is unclear whether the parole officer actually entered the appellant\u2019s apartment; however, even if the entry therein had been forcible, it would have been legal because the parole officer herein needed no warrant to arrest appellant. Accordingly, suppression of the statement and evidence obtained at the time of appellant\u2019s arrest was not mandated by the warrantless entry, if any, of the parole officer into appellant\u2019s brother\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Appellant further complains that the manner of his arrest violated R.C. 2967.15. This section provides in part that a parolee arrested by a parole officer \u201c* * * shall be confined in the jail or detention home <em>of the county in which he is arrested </em>until released on parole or removed to the proper institution. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.) We agree that the statutory procedure was not followed in this case. The arrest was effected in Franklin County, but appellant was transported to Licking County for incarceration. We do not, however, believe that such a technical violation of the statute is sufficient to justify an application of the exclusionary rule to either appellant\u2019s statements or the evidence obtained at the time of his arrest. This violation is simply not one of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Unger </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 65, 69-70, 21 0.O. 3d 41, 44, 423 N.E. 2d 1078, 1081.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Similarly, we reject appellant\u2019s argument that his right to counsel was infringed when he was not permitted to communicate with an attorney prior to being removed to Licking County. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Unger, supra, </em>we held that a violation of R.C. 2935.14, upon which appellant relies, does not of itself require the application of the exclusionary rule. Furthermore, it is apparent from the record that appellant knew of his right to counsel, having been advised of his rights at the time of arrest and several times thereafter, but chose not to invoke such right with either an attorney or other person at the time. In view of this fact, we fail to see how the appellant was prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Appellant, in his final challenge to the legality of his arrest, claims that pursuant to R.C. 2935.05, an affidavit describing the offense should have been issued immediately after his arrest, not five days later as was done herein. R.C. 2935.05 requires that a person arrested without a warrant must be taken before a court or magistrate \u201c* * * without unnecessary delay, * * *\u201d and that an affidavit describing the offense must be filed. Once this is done, a warrant is issued to the arresting officer or citizen pursuant to R.C. 2935.08. However, as stated <em>supra, </em>the parole officer herein was not required to obtain a warrant before arresting appellant. This fact is implicitly recognized by R.C. 2935.05 which states that it applies only to \u201c* * * a person named in section 2935.03 of the Revised Code * * *.\u201d R.C. 2935.03 does not include a parole officer in its list of persons who must obtain warrants before performing arrests. Thus, the parole officer herein was not required to file an affidavit describing the offense in compliance with R.C. 2935.05.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">Although appellant was removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>to Licking County instead of remaining in Franklin County, the arrest and incarceration of appellant were essentially valid. We have found that the errors herein do not reach constitutional proportion and thus they do not justify either application of the exclusionary rule or reversal of appellant\u2019s conviction. Accordingly, this proposition is not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">In proposition of law number nine, appellant asserts that, during the <em>guilt </em>phase, he was materially prejudiced by the projection and admission of gruesome photographic slides of the victim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Fourteen photographic slides were projected on a screen for the jury to see. Some slides were shown more than once, so that the jury observed a total of twenty-eight slides.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E. 2d 768, this court stated in paragraph seven of the syllabus that \u201c[p]roperly authenticated photographs, even if gruesome, are admissible in a capital prosecution if relevant and of probative value in assisting the trier of fact to determine the issues or are illustrative of testimony and other evidence, as long as the danger of material prejudice to a defendant is outweighed by their probative value and the photographs are not repetitive or cumulative in number.\u201d See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St. 3d 252, 257-258, 513 N.E. 2d 267, 273-274. Thus, the test for admitting gruesome photographic evidence is twofold. Does the probative value of the photographs outweigh their prejudicial impact, and second, are the photographs repetitive or cumulative in number? Either a negative response to the first question, or a positive response to the second question will mean that the photographic evidence is inadmissible in a capital prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">We have reviewed the slides in question and find that the trial court erred when it permitted certain of the slides to be shown at appellant\u2019s trial. Although the trial court viewed each of the slides <em>in camera </em>prior to trial, we find that the slides shown at appellant\u2019s trial were clearly repetitive and cumulative in number. The portrayal of the identical subject matter in two slides, one from a relative distance and the other from a close proximity to the subject matter, is clearly repetitive in nature. Accordingly, the trial court erred when it permitted the prosecution to project the repetitive slides for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">Yet, notwithstanding the error in showing the repetitious slides, there is no doubt that the jury would have convicted appellant even if the slides had not been shown. Appellant\u2019s admissions and the other evidence produced clearly establish that appellant was the perpetrator of the crime herein. Thus, the showing of the slides, while error, did not work to the material prejudice of appellant in the <em>guilt </em>phase of this proceeding. Accordingly, the showing of the slides was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and appellant\u2019s ninth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">In his next proposition of law, number ten, appellant maintains that he was denied a fair trial when a witness was permitted to testify about appellant\u2019s apparent lack of remorse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>upon viewing photographs of the victim. As appellant failed to object to such testimony in the trial court, this proposition of law will be overruled absent a finding of plain error. We find that the trial court did not commit plain error by permitting the testimony. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St. 2d 91, 70 O.O. 3d 178, 372 N.E. 2d 804, we held in paragraph three of the syllabus that \u201cnotice of plain error * * * is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d This standard has been met here. The testimony does not appear to have any particular relevance in this case and, further, in view of the overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt, it is beyond doubt that the jury would have convicted appellant even if such testimony had not been given. Accordingly, the trial court did not commit plain error in permitting the witness to testify about appellant\u2019s apparent lack of remorse. This proposition of law is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">In proposition of law eleven, appellant contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Essentially, appellant argues that his counsel failed to obtain the appointment of a forensic pathologist to assist him in presenting evidence and rebutting the state\u2019s witness on the issue of rape. Appellant also argues that his counsel should have sought to preserve certain potentially exculpatory physical evidence, namely the vaginal swabs that were taken of the victim. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 686, the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d The court therein outlined a two-part test for evaluating whether assistance of counsel was so ineffective as to require reversal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">\u201cFirst the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing the counsel made errors so serious that counsel w\u00e1s not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Additionally, \u201c* * * a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Strickland, supra, </em>at 689. See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Clayton </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 45, 16 O.O. 3d 35, 402 N.E. 2d 1189; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytle </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St. 2d 391, 2 O.O. 3d 495, 358 N.E. 2d 623, vacated in part on other grounds (1978), 438 U.S. 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">In the instant cause, appellant\u2019s counsel were not ineffective so as to have precluded a fair trial or to have created an unreliable result. Appellant was represented by two experienced trial attorneys who presumably were aware of the issues involving the evidence of rape. Appellant\u2019s counsel decided not to request the appointment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>of a forensic pathologist, choosing instead to rely on their cross-examination of the state\u2019s expert in order to rebut the evidence of rape. In light of these circumstances, the errors alleged by appellant were neither so serious that his counsel were not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, nor so serious that the result of his trial was rendered unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Accordingly, we will not second-guess the judgment of appellant\u2019s counsel, and appellant\u2019s eleventh proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Appellant also argues, in proposition of law thirteen, that the jury should have been instructed to make a specific finding as to whether appellant committed either vaginal rape, anal rape or both. Appellant argues that the omission of this instruction was error because some jurors may have found him guilty of one, but not the other, type of rape. Thus, appellant believes there might have been a non-unanimous finding of the type of rape. The answer to appellant\u2019s contention is again, no.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">R.C. 2907.02(A)(2) is one part of Ohio\u2019s rape statute. This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">\u201cNo person shall engage in sexual conduct with another when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat of force.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">\u201cSexual conduct\u201d is defined by R.C. 2907.01(A) as \u201c* * * vaginal intercourse * * *[,] anal intercourse, fellatio, and cunnilingus between persons * * Therefore, the jury had only to find that one of these forms of sexual conduct took place between the victim and appellant to find that a rape had been committed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The statute simply does not require, as appellant asserts, that a specific finding be made as to the <em>type </em>of rape. Consequently, it was not error for the trial court to refuse to instruct the jury that it must make such a specific finding. The fact that some jurors might have found that appellant committed one, but not the other, type of rape in no way reduces the reliability of appellant\u2019s conviction, because a finding of either type of conduct is sufficient to establish the fact of rape in Ohio. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s thirteenth proposition of law is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">In a related proposition of law, number fourteen, appellant maintains that the jury should have been instructed that felonious sexual penetration is a lesser included offense of rape. He contends that the instruction should have been given because the jury could have inferred from the evidence that an object other than a human penis caused the tear in the victim\u2019s anus.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">As we recently held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kidder </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St. 3d 279, 513 N.E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>2d 311, paragraph one of the syllabus, \u201c[a]n offense may be a lesser included offense of another only if (i) the offense is a crime of <em>lesser </em>degree than the other * * (Emphasis added.) See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Rohdes </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St. 3d 225, 23 OBR 382, 492 N.E. 2d 430; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkins </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 382, 18 O.O. 3d 528, 415 N.E. 2d 303. Because rape and felonious sexual penetration are both offenses of the <em>same </em>degree, felonious sexual penetration can never be a lesser included offense of rape. Accordingly, the trial court properly refused to give the requested instruction and appellant\u2019s proposition of law is overruled.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">In proposition of law fifteen, appellant argues that the jury should have been instructed that it could find him guilty of involuntary manslaughter, a lesser included offense of murder. We reject this argument for two reasons. First, the jury was not limited to finding the appellant guilty or innocent of a capital offense. The lesser included offense of murder, a non-capital crime, was an option available to the jury. <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1980), 447 U.S. 625. Second, \u201c* * * due process requires that a lesser included offense instruction be given <em>only </em>when the evidence warrants such an instruction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Hopper </em>v. <em>Evans </em>(1982), 456 U.S. 605, 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">In the instant cause, the jury could not have reasonably found appellant guilty of involuntary manslaughter. All the evidence indicates that appellant purposefully murdered the victim. The cause of death was strangulation. Although appellant claims not to remember killing her, he remembers running downstairs from the room where the body was found. He also admits having cut the cord which was used to strangle her from a spool in his garage before going to the victim\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Taking the aforementioned evidence into consideration, a jury could not have reasonably found that appellant involuntarily murdered the victim. Thus, an instruction for involuntary manslaughter was not warranted. See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkins, supra; State </em>v. <em>Nolton </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St. 2d 133, 48 O.O. 2d 119, 249 N.E. 2d 797. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s request for such an instruction. Therefore, appellant\u2019s fifteenth proposition of law is not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Appellant, in proposition of law sixteen, challenges the propriety of certain jury instructions concerning the definitions of \u201cpurpose\u201d and \u201ccausation.\u201d Specifically, appellant claims that these instructions might have misled the jury into believing that they could convict him even if he acted recklessly or negligently, as opposed to purposely. Appellant has, however, chosen to overlook an instruction which required the jury to find that appellant purposely intended to kill the victim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As we stated <em>in State </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St. 2d 136, 14 O.O. 3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>379, 398 N.E. 2d 772, paragraph four of the syllabus, a jury instruction \u201c* * * must be viewed in the context of the overall charge, * * *\u201d rather than in isolation.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">When the jury charge here is considered in its entirety, it is certain that the jury could not have been misled as to the element of purpose. We therefore overrule appellant\u2019s sixteenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">As appellant\u2019s seventeenth proposition of law, he argues that the trial \u25a0court committed plain error when it failed to orally instruct the jury that it was not required to find unanimously that appellant was innocent of aggravated murder before it considered the lesser offense of murder. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We find that appellant failed to raise any objection pursuant to Crim. R. 30 and, in addition, that the alleged omission does not constitute plain error. Our review of the record reveals that the written charge to the jury was correct. Additionally, copies of the written charge were given to the jury. As noted above, notice of plain error is taken only under exceptional circumstances to avoid a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, supra. </em>Accordingly, as the written charge to the jury was correct, appellant was not prejudiced by the omission of the trial court and his seventeenth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">In his final contention concerning his conviction, proposition of law twenty-seven, appellant argues that his conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence. We clearly do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-14\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record, particularly appellant\u2019s statements, the testimony of witnesses placing appellant at the victim\u2019s home at the time of the murder and the expert witness testimony concerning the pathology reports. On the basis of the aforementioned review, sufficient evidence exists in the record to convict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>appellant of the rape and murder of Elizabeth Hendren. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s twenty-seventh proposition of law is not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">This concludes our review of appellant's challenges to the validity of his conviction for aggravated murder. Having found appellant\u2019s contentions devoid of merit, we hereby affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Appellant presents thirteen propositions of law. numbers 12, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 which challenge the application and constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death penalty statute. We have previously determined all these issues and have found the statute to be constitutional when measured against similar attacks. See, <em>e.g., State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, supra; State </em>v. <em>Maurer, supra; </em>and <em>State </em>v. <em>Buell, supra. </em>We therefore find these propositions of law to be not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">We now turn our attention to a consideration of the validity of appellant\u2019s death sentence. Our review of the record reveals that the penalty phase of appellant\u2019s trial was severely flawed by the presence of prosecutorial misconduct. Add to this the previously discussed misconduct by the prosecutor, in the closing argument of the guilt phase, and one is led to the inevitable conclusion that appellant was materially prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s actions. Accordingly, we cannot, in good conscience, uphold appellant\u2019s sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">At issue are the comments made by the prosecutor during <em>both </em>closing arguments. The prosecutor\u2019s misconduct in closing argument in the guilt phase of this proceeding has been discussed <em>supra. </em>In question now are the prosecutor\u2019s comments made in the closing argument of the penalty phase. The prosecutor made the following remarks, concerning the gruesome photographic slides shown to the jury during the guilt phase of the trial, during the closing argument in the penally phase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-11\">\u201cI know that Elizabeth Hendren is dead and I know that the defendant killed her. I know that the defendant raped her and I know that this is a horrible crime, and I know that in any criminal trial in the guilt or innocence trial or in the penalty phase trial, it means more than walking up and patting you on the head like a little dog and saying, hi folks, you did good, you were right, nice jury. That does not cut it. The State of Ohio gave you the evidence to work with. Don\u2019t pat it on the head and say, thank you, you did good. <em>You want aggravating circumstances, look at the slides. If you want the projector, we\u2019ll send it back with you. </em>Here\u2019s the rope that he killed her with, here\u2019s the blue box knife he had with him, there's the panty hose he used to tie her hands. You tell me when you put those on the scales and you consider what he did to Elizabeth Hendren that these [mitigating] factors he\u2019s talking about have to mean that those pieces of evidence prove less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt that those aggragating [sic] circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">Generally, parties are granted a certain amount of latitude in closing argument. <em>State </em>v. <em>Maurer, supra </em>(15 Ohio St. 3d 239), at 269, 15 OBR at 404-405, 473 N.E. 2d at 794-795. However, there comes a time where prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument impairs a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. Such a point is reached where, as here, a prosecutor appeals to the passions of the jury in an attempt to obtain a favorable verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">The use of the gruesome slides earlier in the trial to illustrate expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>testimony was error, yet, harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because of the overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt. The prosecutor\u2019s subsequent reference to those same slides at the penalty phase was impermissible. The question at the penalty phase is not guilt but what penalty is appropriate. Although the prosecutor did not actually show the slides again, his entreaty that the jury should remember the slides could have had no other effect than to cause the jurors to re-experience the horror and outrage they must have felt upon viewing the slides earlier in the trial. This later use of the slides to appeal to the jurors\u2019 emotions and to prejudice them against the appellant is grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">In our opinion, the combination of the prosecutor\u2019s prejudicial argument in the penalty phase aimed at inflaming the passions of the jury, and his resurrection of the' gruesome photographic slides, created a climate in which the jury herein was unable to dispassionately weigh the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors. It is quite possible that the prosecutor\u2019s appeal to the jury, that it should remember the slides, induced the jury to give appellant a harsher sentence than it would have otherwise. As the Supreme Court of Tennessee has stated, it \u201c[i]s precisely because of the danger that * * * [the jurors] will inflict excessive punishment that unnecessary inflammatory evidence is kept from them. * * * [Citations omitted.] The fact that death is now an available penalty for homicide poses, in view of the existing law on that thorny subject, a strong consideration in opposition to appealing to the emotions of jurors in assessment of punishment.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Banks </em>(Tenn. 1978), 564 S.W. 2d 947, 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">In addition, we are aware, of course, that the statutory scheme for the trial of aggravated capital cases is one of bifurcation. We would be naive not to recognize that those matters which occur in the guilt phase carry over and become part and parcel of the entire proceeding as the penalty phase is entered. The type and magnitude of any error then becomes the issue. In the case before us, the prosecutor\u2019s persistent references to the appellant\u2019s silence, continuing even after the trial court had sustained an objection to such comments, are errors so egregious that regardless of where they occurred in the overall trial, they cannot be ignored or overlooked. See, generally, <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield, supra. </em>When we add to this the prosecutor\u2019s improper conduct and remarks at the guilt phase, we are forced to conclude that the ultimate effect was such that the penalty phase of appellant\u2019s trial was fundamentally flawed and prejudicially unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">Therefore, regrettably, we are constrained to hold that any egregious error in the penalty phase of a death penalty proceeding, including prosecutorial misconduct, will be cause to vacate the sentence of death with a subsequent remand to the trial court for a new sentencing procedure pursuant to R.C. 2929.06. This action is mandated by the persistent efforts of the prosecutor which resulted in the appellant\u2019s not being given a fair trial in accordance with previous decisions of the United States Supreme Court and decisions of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Accordingly, we hereby vacate appellant\u2019s death sentence and remand the cause for resentencing pursuant to R.C. 2929.06.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Douglas and H.

The autopsy revealed that there was seminal fluid in the victim\u2019s vagina that had been secreted by someone with type \u201cB\u201d blood. Neither the victim nor her husband has type \u201cB\u201d blood, whereas the appellant does. Furthermore, the victim was found in bed, naked, with her hands bound behind her back. Appellant admitted to having been there, to having grabbed her by the neck and to having later run downstairs from the bedroom before fleeing to Columbus. Thus, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that vaginal rape had taken place, and that the aggravating circumstance of rape was established. '</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b60-6\"> It should be noted that the trial court instructed the jury that it could find appellant guilty of the lesser included offense of murder. If the jury did not believe appellant had committed rape, then it had the option of convicting the appellant for murder rather than aggravated murder. Thus, there was no danger that the jury would convict appellant of aggravated murder, even if it believed no rape had occurred, in order to avoid acquitting him. The jury could have chosen to convict him of a lesser included, non-capital offense instead.

The standard to be applied by trial courts in the admission of gruesome photographs was enunciated by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E. 2d 768, at paragraph seven of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">\u201cProperly authenticated photographs, even if gruesome, are admissible in a capital prosecution if relevant and of probative value in assisting the trier of fact to determine the issues or are illustrative of testimony and other evidence, as long as the danger of material prejudice to a defendant is outweighed by their probative value and the photographs are not repetitive or cumulative in number.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">Generally, \u201cthe admission of photographs is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Maurer, supra, </em>at 264, 15 OBR at 401, 473 N.E. 2d at 791; see, also, Evid. R. 403 and 611(A). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hymore </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St. 2d 122, 128, 38 O.O. 2d 298, 302, 224 N.E. 2d 126, 130, we stated that a \u201ctrial court has broad discretion in the admission * * * of evidence and unless it has clearly abused its discretion and the defendant has been materially prejudiced thereby, this court should be slow to interfere.\u201d An abuse of discretion by a trial court connotes \u201c \u2018not merely error of judgment, but perversity of will, passion, prejudice, partiality or moral delinquency.\u2019 \u201d <em>State, ex rel. Shafer, </em>v. <em>Ohio Turnpike Comm. </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 581, 590-591, 50 O.O. 465, 469, 113 N.E. 2d 14, 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">It simply cannot be said that the trial court in the case <em>sub judice </em>abused its discretion by admitting the photographic slides in question. After viewing each of the slides <em>in camera </em>prior to trial, the court applied the <em>Maurer </em>standard and ruled that certain of the slides offered by the prosecutor could be admitted as having probative value in excess of the danger of material prejudice to the appellant, while the others had to be rejected as being either repetitive, cumulative, or of insufficient probative value. Also, the error cited by the majority, namely, the \u201cportrayal of the identical subject matter in two slides, one from a relative distance and the other from close proximity of the subject matter,\u201d does not amount to a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-13\">Additionally, to say that the admission of two repetitive photographs is error is absurd in the light of our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St. 3d 252, 513 N.E. 2d 267. In <em>Morales, </em>this court upheld the admission of no fewer than <em>thirty-one </em>photographs of the victim\u2019s bloody, bruised and broken body, all of which were unquestionably more gruesome than those of the victim herein. It is difficult to reconcile the fact that the court today finds the admission of two similar photographs to be repetitive and cumulative with the fact that the court did not find such error in the admission of so many photographs of the same subject in <em>Morales.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The majority\u2019s assertion that the prosecutor committed an egregious error during closing argument in the mitigation phase of the trial is likewise without foundation. The prosecutor made the following statements to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">\u201cThe State of Ohio gave you the evidence to work with. * * * You want aggravating circumstances, look at the slides. If you want the projector, we\u2019ll send it back with you. Here\u2019s the rope that he killed her with, here\u2019s the blue box knife he had with him, there\u2019s the panty hose he used to tie her hands. You tell me when you put those on the scales and you consider what he did to Elizabeth Hendren that these [mitigatr ing] factors he\u2019s talking about have to mean that those pieces of evidence prove less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt that those aggragating [sic] circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">In general, prosecutors are allowed a certain amount of latitude in closing argument. See, <em>e.g., State </em>v. <em>Byrd </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St. 3d 79, 82, 512 N.E. 2d 611, 616; <em>State </em>v. <em>Maurer, supra, </em>at 269, 15 OBR at 404-405, 473 N.E. 2d at 794-795; <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodards </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St. 2d 14, 26, 35 O.O. 2d 8, 14, 215 N.E. 2d 568, 578. This is because prosecutors have a duty to represent the state as zealously and aggressively as they can, just as defense counsel are expected to defend their clients to the utmost.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">With this in mind, it is difficult to see why the prosecutor\u2019s comments in this case constitute prosecutorial misconduct. There was nothing <em>per se </em>erroneous about what he said, since his comments were both within the record and substantiated by the evidence. The comments were not, as the majority maintains, intended to prejudice the jury against the appellant. Instead, the comments were clearly directed at reminding the jury of the evidence proving the existence of the aggravating circumstance. R.C. 2929.03 (D)(1) provides in part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-11\">\u201cThe court, and <em>the trial jury </em>if the offender was tried by jury, <em>shall consider </em>* * * <em>any evidence raised at trial that is relevant to the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing </em>or to any factors in mitigation of the imposition of the sentence of death, * * * and the arguments, if any, of counsel for the defense and prosecution, that are relevant to the penalty that should be imposed on the offender.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">The prosecutor\u2019s references to the slides, the rope, the knife and the panty hose were merely a review of the evidence against the appellant which supported his conviction for aggravated murder. The statute obligated the jury to consider this evidence. To say that a prosecutor cannot remind the jury of the existence of such evidence is to render the prosecutor unable to rebut the defendant\u2019s evidence of mitigating factors and to render the jury incapable of intelligently weighing the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors. Thus, it can only be said that the prosecutor was doing his job when he made the statements in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">The majority contends that the prosecutor\u2019s comments prejudiced the jury against the appellant because they reminded the jury of the gruesome slides of the victim shown earlier in the trial. However, it was not error for the prosecutor to mention the slides because they were evidence supporting the existence of the aggravating circumstance of rape. The slides were properly admitted by the trial court because their probative value outweighed the danger of prejudice to the appellant. Their evidentiary value re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>mained undiminished at the time the references to them were made, because they were still relevant to the issue of whether the aggravating circumstance of rape outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the prosecutor did not commit an egregious error when he referred to the slides during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Even if it is assumed that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the slides was error, such error was not materially prejudicial to the appellant. The comments in question were limited to a single instance, and were so innocuous that they were not objected to by the appellant\u2019s counsel. Furthermore, the trial court specifically instructed the jury afterwards that the arguments of counsel were not to be considered as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Under these circumstances, it is very unlikely that the prosecutor\u2019s comments induced the jury to give the appellant a harsher sentence than it would have given otherwise. The heinous nature of the appellant\u2019s crime and the overwhelming evidence of his guilt more than justified the jury\u2019s recommendation that the appellant be sentenced to death. As the appellant said in his unsworn statement during the penalty phase, he felt that the jury\u2019s verdict was \u201cfair and honest,\u201d that \u201cwhat I have done was a senseless act,\u201d and that \u201cI would have come to the same conclusion if I were sitting on the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Taking all of the facts and circumstances of this case into account, it is clear that the appellant was not deprived of his constitutional rights or of a fundamentally fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">Finally, the majority applies what amounts to a cumulative-error test in reversing the appellant\u2019s sentence. In essence, the majority holds that a death sentence may now be vacated when the cumulative effect of errors in both the guilt and mitigation phases of a capital prosecution deprives the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">This court has recently held that a conviction must be reversed when cumulative errors in the admission of evidence materially prejudice the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMarco. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 191, 31 OBR 390, 509 N.E. 2d 1256. However, a capital prosecution is significantly different from an ordinary criminal proceeding. As recommended by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1976), 428 U.S. 153, Ohio\u2019s statutory scheme provides for bifurcated trials in capital cases. See R.C. 2929.03. Today\u2019s decision erodes the bifurcation intended by the General Assembly by stating that \u201cmatters which occur in the guilt phase carry over and become part and parcel of the entire proceeding.\u201d The majority thus creates a precedent that will open a new avenue of appeal for many defendants, and that will encourage defendants to argue that their death sentences should be vacated because of the cumulative effect of the trivial mistakes that inevitably occur over the length of a capital prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">For all the above reasons, I would affirm the appellant\u2019s sentence. There is simply nothing in the record which convinces me that the prosecutor committed reversible error in either stage of the trial, and it seems to me that the majority exaggerates the prejudicial effect, if any, of his conduct. Also, it occurs to me that many of our decisions in criminal cases, including this one, express a lack of concern for the victims of the crimes involved. Even in the face of overwhelming evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the defendant\u2019s guilt, we often appear to be more concerned with procedural niceties and protecting the rights of the criminals than with protecting society from the criminals. What is needed is a more equitable approach that balances the rights of criminals to a fair trial against the rights of our citizens to be safe from crime. In the instant case, the appellant received a fair trial. In view of his overwhelming guilt, the reversal of his death sentence will only cause a further loss of faith in our criminal justice system, particularly among the families of the victims of similar crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b67-8\">Holmes, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
