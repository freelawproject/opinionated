In an action for libel it is always a question of law for the court, in the first instance, to determine whether or hot the proved publication is libelous. Where the whole publication is susceptible of only one meaning and is libelous per se, it is the duty of the court to instruct the jury that the publication is actionable, if made, and no evidence of a different intent is admissible in such case to prove the defendant\u2019s innocence. It is also the province of the court to determine whether the language of the alleged libel is ambiguous, or double in meaning, one of which is libelous. In determining whether the alleged libel is double in meaning, one of which is libelous, the court must not separate it into parts, and construe each part separately, but must construe each part of the alleged libel in connection with all the rest of it. When the court has so determined that it will bear such double meaning, it is then the province of the jury to determine in which sense the language was used, and for such determination the whole publication should go to the jury.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b581-9\" pgmap=\"581\">2.

Slander and libel\u2014how intent may be shown. If the intent of the defendant in an action for slander or libel be doubtful the witnesses may be asked their opinion as to the intent of the defendant.

Instructions\u2014when upon damages in action for libel erroneous.

Damages\u2014what not essential to recovery of exemplary. Express malice, or malice in fact, is not necessary to authorize exemplary damages in an action of libel.

In this action for libel Angeline M. Beeson, appellee, recovered a judgment in the sum of $5,000 against The H. W. Gossard Company, appellant, a corporation and manufacturer and dealer in women\u2019s icorsets. The declaration charges, in substance, that appellee had been a resident of Chicago for thirteen years and for many years had been engaged in administering treatments to invalids under direction of their physicians, having prepared herself therefor by a course of study at various medical institutions, and that she had enjoyed the friendship and patronage of the leading medical practitioners of Chicago; that appellant, with its principal store and office in Chicago, had employed appellee to attend an exhibit of its corsets at the annual convention of the American Medical Association, an organization of physicians and surgeons residing in different parts of the United States, held in Chicago on the 2nd to-the 5th days of June, 1908, and there to lecture and explain to the attending physicians the hygienic and therapeutic merits and uses of such corsets; that in pursuance of such employment she did attend said exhibit and so explained and demonstrated the uses of said corsets in the treatment of diseases, by oral lectures illustrated by another woman employed by appellant and acting as model; that appellant, June 25, 1908, published in the form of a printed circular of and concerning appellee a certain scandalous, malicious and defamatory libel, containing certain false, scandalous, malicious and defamatory matter which purported to be an account of the conduct of appellee at. and of certain happenings in connection with, the-said corset exhibit; that appellant had sent said circular by mail to a large number of physicians in different parts of the United States, whereby appelleehad been greatly injured in her good name, credit and reputation and brought into scandal and disgrace,, and had been shunned and avoided by divers persons- and otherwise injured. The alleged false, scandalous- and defamatory circular with proper innuendoes is set forth in the declaration in haec verba. The said circular, with the innuendoes omitted, reads as follows :</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-4\" pgmap=\"583\">\u2018 \u2018 RECORD-HERALD-</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-5\" pgmap=\"583\">Morning, June 4, 1908.

They went to-the ladies\u2019 committee, who had arranged the ladies\u2019 end of the convention programme. The committee, headed by Mrs. Albert J. Ochsner, went to Manager Braun.

It was so ordered and so done.</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-11\" pgmap=\"585\">Then the corset company brought down a wax figure and demonstrated on that.

The clipping from ihe Record-Herald is the article set forth in appellee\u2019s declaration as the alleged libel. The clipping from the Inter Ocean does not name nor in any wise refer to appellee; but its language describing the happenings at said corset exhibit is similar in character to that in the alleged libel, except that it names as the corset model a certain Miss Clarkson. The clipping from the Inter Ocean contained also at the top of the article a purported picture of the corset model, Miss Clarkson, as she appeared at the corset exhibition, and she is further portrayed by the Inter Ocean article in the following language:</p><p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-8\" pgmap=\"586\">\u201cHidden behind curtains in an attractive booth, Miss Clarkson gave her exhibitions clad in a union suit and a close fitting knit petticoat.

Appellant did. not deny the publication of the exhibit aforesaid, but introduced evidence to prove that its only purpose in publishing the same was to deny the truth of the newspaper articles and to correct the false impressions created thereby.

In an action for a libel, it is always a question of law for the court, in the first instance, whether or not the proved publication of the defendant is libelous. If such publication of the defendant is not susceptible of a libelous meaning, there is no question for the consideration of the jury and a verdict of not guilty should be directed by the court. Where the whole publication is susceptible of only one meaning and is libelous per se, it is the duty of the court to instruct the jury that the publication is actionable, if made, and no evidence of a different intent is admissible in such case to prove the defendant\u2019s innocence. From the publishing or speaking of actionable words malice is implied, which will justify the assessment of exemplary damages. Gerald v. Inter Ocean Pub. Co., 90 Ill. App. 205; Schmisseur v.

In determining whether the alleged libel is double in meaning, one of which is libelous, the court must not separate it into parts, and construe each part separately, but must construe each part of the alleged libel in connection with all the rest of it. When the court has so determined that it will bear such double meaning, it is then the province of the jury to determine in which sense the language was used, and for such determination the whole publication should go to the jury.

App. 479.</p> <p id=\"b590-5\" pgmap=\"590(308) 591(81)\">A libel, as defined by our statute, is a malicious defamation, expressed either by printing, or by signs or pictures, or the like, tending to blacken the memory of one who is dead, or to impeach the honesty, integrity, virtue or reputation, or publish the natural defects of one who is alive, and thereby to expose him to public hatred, contempt, ridicule or financial injury. By applying the foregoing rules to the facts in this case it is clear, we think, that' the alleged libelous matter, as proved in this case, is susceptible of a double meaning, one of which is libelous, and that it was the province of the jury to determine from the evidence whether or not the appellant was guilty of libeling appellee. If the jury should find from the evidence that the intent and purpose of appellant as to the appellee, in republishing the slanderous article of the Record-Herald was in good faith to vindicate her and to thereby repel the slanderous charge against her character, and that the readers of the whole publication must have so understood it, then the defendant should be found not guilty. If, on the other hand, the jury should find that the mailing of the alleged libelous matter was for the purpose of advertising its \u25a0 corsets, and that the denial of the libelous charges of the Record-Herald was merely a pretense for the purpose of using it and the Inter Ocean article and picture of the model woman in the advertising of its corsets, without regard to appellee\u2019s rights in the matter, and appellee was thereby libeled, then appellant in such case should be found guilty. In making this finding it is proper and necessary for the jury to consider both exhibits \u201cA\u201d and B,\u201d and even the booklet referred to, if in evidence, together with all the other evidence in the case. We do not deem it proper to discuss the probative force of each part of these exhibits in reaching our conclusion that the meaning of the publication is double, one of which is libelous, in view of our decision to rev\u00e9rse the judgment, and particularly as we think it apparent from an inspection of the exhibits and the evidence that such discussion is unnecessary.</p> <p id=\"b591-4\" pgmap=\"591\">For the foregoing reasons appellee\u2019s instruction No. 1, as read to the jury, is erroneous. It reads as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b591-5\" pgmap=\"591\">\u201cYou are instructed that any publication, the necessary tendency of which is to expose a person to hatred, contempt or ridicule is a libel, and if you find from the evidence that the defendant caused the article set forth in the declaration to be printed, and mailed it to a number of persons and that it was received and read by one of such persons, and if you also believe from the evidence that plaintiff did not consent that such article should be so printed and mailed, and if you find from the evidence that said article as mailed to such persons by defendant had a necessary tendency to expose the plaintiff to hatred, contempt or ridicule, you will find the issues for the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b591-6\" pgmap=\"591(126) 592(46)\">The vice of this instruction will be readily seen by mere inspection of the instruction. Only the article as published by the Record-Herald is \u201cset forth in the declaration,\u201d and the jury are told, in substance, by this instruction that if they found from the evidence \u201cthat said .article\u201d (set forth in the declaration) \u201cas mailed to such persons by defendant had a necessary tendency to expose the plaintiff to hatred,\u201d etc., \u201cyou will find the issues for the plaintiff.\u201d The article published in the Record-Herald, when considered alone, is libelous per se. The instruction violated the rule that the whole publication must be considered in determining the question of whether or not there is a libel. This instruction is necessarily misleading and there was no other instruction given in the case that had any tendency to correct this error, that is to say, that called the attention of the jury to the fact that the whole publication must be considered in determining the meaning of appellant.</p> <p id=\"b592-5\" pgmap=\"592(307) 593(51)\">Appellee\u2019s second instruction is erroneous. It tells the jury that \u201cif you find the issues for the plaintiff and believe from the evidence that the publication was made maliciously or wantonly and under circumstances evincing disregard for the rights of the plaintiff, and with malice, then in assessing her damages you are not confined to such damages as will simply compensate plaintiff for such injuries as the evidence-shows she has received by reason of the publication of the defamatory words set forth in the declaration, but you may in addition thereto assess against the defendant by way of punishment to it and as an example to others such damages as the jury in their sound judgment under all the evidence in the case, believe the defendant ought to pay.\u201d This instruction is subject to two objections. In the first place, by the language of the instruction, it is absolutely assumed that the evidence shows that appellee has been injured by reason of the publication of \u201cthe defamatory words set forth in the declaration.\u201d The instruction is also vicious in telling the jury they may assess against the defendant such damages as the jury \u201cbelieve the defendant ought to pay,\u201d under all the evidence in the case, instead of closing with the proper conclusion, \u201csuch damages, if any, as you shall find from all the evidence in the ease that she is entitled to recover against the defendant.\u201d It should always be borne in mind when formulating instructions to the jury that a plaintiff can only recover \u201csuch actual damages as he has sustainedand, if it is a proper case for exemplary damages, that he can then only recover such damages as he is entitled to under the evidence, and that it must not be assumed by an instruction that he has sustained damages when the question is controverted. \u201cThe jury are to inquire not what the defendant can pay (or ought to pay) but what the plaintiff ought to receive.\u201d Holmes v. Holmes, 64 Ill. 294; Smith v. Wunderlich, 70 Ill. 426; Dady v. Condit, 188 Ill. 234.</p> <p id=\"b593-4\" pgmap=\"593\">There was no evidence in this case of the pecuniary ability of the defendant, and the question of such ability is virtually submitted to the jury by the above instruction, and the damages made to depend solely on that - question. Where such evidence of pecuniary worth is not proved the jury have no right to give any more damages than they would if it had affirmatively appeared that the defendant, was without pecuniary resources. T. W. &amp; W. Ry. Co. v. Smith, 57 Ill. 517; Mullin v. Spangenberg, 112 Ill. 140, 146.</p> <p id=\"b593-5\" pgmap=\"593\">Appellant\u2019s contention, however, that appellee\u2019s second instruction attempts to submit the question of actual or express malice as the basis of exemplary damages, is not tenable, if it means thereby an actual intent on the part of appellant to do appellee an injury. Express malice, or malice in fact, is not necessary to authorize exemplary damages. Proof of express malice may be made in any libel case to enhance the plaintiff\u2019s damages, and the defendant may offer proof showing the absence of express malice in mitigation of damages, but not as barring the right of the plaintiff to recover exemplary damages. Hintz v. Graupner, 138 Ill. 158. Express malice, or malice in fact, is so commonly understood that a definition thereof would not seem to be necessary in an instruction to the jury. The failure of the court to define malice, and especially malice in fact, could not have injured appellant in our judgment. Implied malice, or malice in law, was not in express terms referred to in the instructions.</p> <p id=\"b594-4\" pgmap=\"594\">If the intent of the defendant in a suit for a libel or for slander be doubtful, the witnesses may be asked their opinion as to the intent of the defendant. Their answers are not conclusive upon the jury, but such testimony is admissible as tending to show what meaning hearers of common understanding would and did ascribe to the alleged libelous matter. Particularly is this rule applicable where the witnesses are also parties who read the alleged libelous matter. We think the court was in error in excluding testimony of the above character in this case. McKee v. Ingalls, 4 Scammon, 30; Nelson v. Borchenins, 52 Ill. 236; Dexter v. Harrison, 146 Ill. 169; Dexter v. Taber, 12 Johns. (N. Y.) 238; 2 Greenleaf on Evidence, Sec. 417.</p> <p id=\"b594-5\" pgmap=\"594\">It is also argued by appellant that the damages awarded by the jury-are excessive. We do not think' it necessary or proper to discuss this question, or the merits of the case. For the errors indicated the judgment of the court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b594-6\" pgmap=\"594\">.Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
