This is an appeal from a judgment rendered in favor of appellee in the Circuit Court. -The case has been tried twice. The first trial resulted in a disagreement of the jury. Upon the second trial the jury assessed appellee\u2019s damages at the sum of $3,000. Judgment was rendered accordingly, from which this appeal is prosecuted.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-10\" pgmap=\"345(85) 346(278)\">Plaintiff\u2019s evidence tends to show that he received the injuries complained of while attempting to board a street car operated by appellant. He states that in company with a fellow workman, upon quitting work about half after four o\u2019clock in the afternoon of November 1, 1901, he walked to the corner of 55th street and Lake avenue. They waited there for a street car. When the train, headed by a grip-car, approached the two men \u201cwent out on the street,\u201d as there is testimony tending to show. The grip-car passed them about five or six feet and came to a stop. The two men followed it and plaintiff\u2019s companion got on the grip-car. Plaintiff tried to get on, but says he did not get time; that he \u2018 gripped the railing on the end of the seat and got one foot on the running step of the grip-car;\u201d that the car was then standing still, but that when he tried to put his other foot on the running board of the grip-car, the bell was rung, the car gave a jerk and twisted him around; that he had his dinner pail in his right hand; that the \u201ccar was going too quick for\u201d him; that he \u201clost his feet\u201d and was not able to pull himself on; that his wrist gave out and he had to let\" go; that in falling down his left shoulder and elbow he thinks struck the running board of the car and his breast hit the pavement. He was in bed, he says, about four months after the accident, and noticed a \u201clittle grain of black blood\u201d the next day in his sputum and for about four weeks thereafter and he noticed a little in his urine for about a week. He claims to have had pains in his side and chest ever since the accident, and testifies that three years after the accident a splinter of bone about a quarter of an inch long, with a sharp point, about an eighth of an inch thick in the middle and \u201cnot so thick in the butt end\u201d worked its way out at the wrist.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-5\" pgmap=\"346\">Before the accident here in question plaintiff had been shot at the time of a strike in the fleshy part of the thigh; and August 31, 1906, when he was crossing a railroad track after quitting work he was struck by an engine which injured the ankle of his left leg and caused him the loss of the four small toes and part of the foot, including the heel of his right foot, from which a bone was taken out by the surgeon. The right foot has since been crooked and deformed.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-6\" pgmap=\"346(17) 347(43)\">The defendant\u2019s contention is that plaintiff and his companion were attempting to board the train after it was in motion; that his companion succeeded in getting on but that the plaintiff got hold of the car and had one foot on the running board, when he lost his hold and fell. There is evidence tending to support this contention.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-4\" pgmap=\"347\">James Gr. Condon, for appellant; Irvin I. Livingston, of counsel.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-5\" pgmap=\"347\">Quin O\u2019Brien and Lawrence W.- Potter, for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b347-6\" pgmap=\"347\">Mr. Presiding Justice Freeman</author> <p id=\"Ay1\" pgmap=\"347\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b347-7\" pgmap=\"347\">It is urged in behalf of the defendant that the declaration is insufficient, that the verdict is contrary to law and the weight of the evidence, that plaintiff\u2019s counsel was guilty of improper conduct at the trial and that the Court erred in giving and refusing instructions. The alleged defect in the declaration consists, according to counsel, in its failure to allege facts and circumstances showing that the negligence alleged was the breach of any duty owing to the plaintiff from the defendant since, as it is said, it fails to allege facts or circumstances from which it can reasonably be inferred that the plaintiff was a passenger on the car, or that the relation of carrier and passenger existed between plaintiff and the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b347-8\" pgmap=\"347(86) 348(386) 349(18)\">The declaration consists of a single count. It alleges that defendant\u2019s business was that of a common carrier of passengers for hire, and that it ought to have exercised due care to avoid injuring -such passengers; that the defendant\u2019s car had stopped at a usual place of receiving passengers and plaintiff was in the act of getting on the car, when before plaintiff was fully on said car and while he was in the act of boarding the car with reasonable care, defendant\u2019s agents negligently and carelessly caused the car to be suddenly and violently started forward, by reason of which the plaintiff was \u2018 thrown violently from said car \u2019 \u2019 and injured. The declaration is not open to the objection urged. We deem it unnecessary to refer to the cases mentioned by defendant\u2019s counsel or to take time to analyze and differentiate them. The case of Grace and Hyde Co. v. Sanborn, 124 Ill. App. 472-479 et seq., and the opinion of the Supreme Court in the same case in 225 Ill. 138-141, are we think relevant. In Nellis on Street Surface Railroads, p. 446, it is said: \u2018 Certainly where a street car stops at a usual place for passengers and a person in the exercise of due care gets on the steps or platform, or places one foot on the step of the car for the purpose of taking passage while it is so waiting, he is to be regarded as a passenger.\u201d If the plaintiff got on the car for the purpose of taking passage thereon while it was standing still and was as the declaration alleges violently thrown therefrom by the sudden starting of the car when he had gotten but one foot on the car step, he had become in the eye of the law a passenger. In Clark\u2019s Street Ry. Accident Law, 2nd ed. (1904), Section 3, it is said that \u201ca person does not have to be actually on a street car before he becomes entitled to the rights of a passenger. If a car has been stopped on being signalled and he is in the act of getting aboard when the car starts, the relation of carrier and passenger is held to be established.\u201d The question of the sufficiency of the declaration was involved in Chi. Union Traction Co. v. O\u2019Brien, 117 Ill. App. 183-189, and what is there said on this subject by Mr. Justice Adams is we think applicable in the case at bar. Here, as in that case, the substance of the averments in the declaration was \u201cthat appellee was impliedly invited to get on the train and was getting on it when the accident occurred. Facts are averred from which the legal conclusion that appellee was a passenger is deducible. We think the declaration sufficient to admit evidence showing that appellee was a passenger.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b349-4\" pgmap=\"349\">The verdict is supported so far as the question of negligence is concerned by evidence in plaintiff\u2019s behalf. The conflict as to whether plaintiff was injured by reason of the car being suddenly started before he could get on or whether he was trying to get on while the car was moving must be deemed concluded by the verdict.</p> <p id=\"b349-5\" pgmap=\"349\">We are unable to concur in appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence relating to plaintiff\u2019s injury by a bullet was necessarily prejudicial and find no reversible error in the admission of the evidence tending to show that a so-called splinter of bone came from the wrist about three years after the injury complained of.</p> <p id=\"b349-6\" pgmap=\"349\">It is urged however that there was reversible error in giving and refusing instructions. The first instruction the refusal of which is complained of would have been erroneous, if given. A car might be \u201csuddenly and violently started forward,\u201d as the declaration charges, without being pnt in \u201crapid motion,\u201d as stated by the instruction in question. As to the next instruction complained of, which was given at plaintiff\u2019s request, we have already indicated our view that the declaration sufficiently stated facts from which the relationship of passenger and carrier as a matter of law was clearly deducible. There is no error therefore in the reference contained in that instruction to \u201cnegligence as charged in the declaration.\u201d In like manner objections are urged to plaintiff\u2019s instructions numbered 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9, and the refusal of plaintiff\u2019s instruction Number 35. Appellant\u2019s brief and argument contains more than 183 printed pages. It must suffice to say that we have considered with care the objections urged in reference to these instructions and find no material or reversible error.</p> <p id=\"b350-4\" pgmap=\"350\">It is urged that the verdict and judgment of three thousand dollars is excessive. That in our judgment the jury were warranted by the evidence in finding the defendant guilty of negligence causing injuries of which the plaintiff complains we have above indicated. There is evidence tending to show that the plaintiff was confined to his bed about four months after the accident, was then around the house and yard about four or five weeks and then went back to work; that for a year he could not lift a heavy load or use a shovel. The accident happened November 1, 1901. Plaintiff testified that until August 31, 1906, when he was again injured as before stated in a railroad accident, he felt fairly well and was apparently doing his usual work the greater part of the time. His injuries up to that time were confined to bruises from his fall at the time of the accident now in question, except that he testifies he saw some traces of blood in his sputum and urine shortly after the accident. There is evidence in behalf of defendant tending to show that many of the symptoms complained of by appellant were such as might be ascribed to rheumatism. Upon this evidence the verdict of the jury fixed the amount of damages at $3000. While if sitting as jurors we might have regarded this amount as excessive, the question was clearly within the province of the jury to determine, and the amount is not so clearly excessive as to justify this court in setting it aside.</p> <p id=\"b350-5\" pgmap=\"350\">Finding no material error in the record, the judgment of the Circuit Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b350-6\" pgmap=\"350\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
