Making avail of section 69 of the Code of Civil Procedure, plaintiff did not set forth the items of the account in his complaint. Defendant, invoking the same section, moved that plaintiff be required to furnish a copy of the account, which motion was granted. Responding to the order, plaintiff filed photostatic copies of sheets purporting to show defendant\u2019s account with plaintiff\u2019s assignor, but which gave only the dates and amounts charged \u2014 nothing as to the goods for which the charges were made. Defendant, again invoking that section, moved that plaintiff\u2019s statement be made \u201cmore particular, definite and certain,\u201d by showing for what goods the charges were made, and the price thereof. The motion, although plaintiff made no showing in opposition, was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">Answering, defendant challenged generally, as by demurrer, the sufficiency of the complaint, and particularly that the statement of items was insufficient to require answer. Also, he denied all allegations, and affirmatively alleged \u201cthat whatever goods, wares and merchandise or other things, if any, may have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>purchased by the defendant or his family from * * * plaintiff\u2019s assignor, the same were, and have been fully paid for.\u201d There was no replication.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">About one month preceding the time of trial, defendant served written demand upon plaintiff to supply a copy of the account, \u201cor be precluded from giving evidence thereof.\u201d Plaintiff ignored the demand. When the first witness at the trial had been sworn, defendant, consistent with his contention that plaintiff\u2019s failure to supply a copy of the account upon which the action was based, operated to preclude him from \u201cgiving evidence thereof,\u201d objected \u201cto the introduction of any testimony.\u201d The objection was overruled, and the trial proceeded precisely as if defendant'had not demanded a copy of the account, or that in response to demand therefor plaintiff had adequately complied. Judgment was given plaintiff, and defendant, complaining, emphasizes the same point he constantly urged upon the attention of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The code provision cited above, and upon which defendant relies, reads: \u201cIt shall not be necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading the items of an account therein alleged; but he shall, within five days after a demand thereof in writing by the adverse party, deliver to him or file a copy of such account, or be precluded from giving evidence thereof. The court or judge may, on motion, limit or extend the time for delivering or filing such account, and may order a further account when the one delivered or filed is too general or is defective in any particular.\u201d Construing this code provision in a similar situation, our Court of Appeals said: \u201cThe items of the different accounts were not set forth in the pleading. * * *. Defendants were entitled to have each of the different accounts itemized * * *. The statute is peremptory. Upon demand he shall furnish the itemized account, and upon failure to do so \u2018shall be precluded from giving evidence thereof.\u2019 The court erred in receiving any evidence without the accounts.\u201d <em>Scott v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>Frost, </em>4 Colo. App. 557, 36 Pac. 910. In <em>Gilmore v. Weisser, </em>68 Colo. 205, 187 Pac. 521, where the identical question presented here was considered, we said: \u201cDefendant filed a motion for a bill of particulars, which was granted. A so-called bill of particulars was filed which gave no statement as to the goods, for which the charges were made, only the date and the amount charged being, in each instance, given. An objection to the sufficiency of the bill having been overruled, defendant answered challenging the sufficiency of the complaint to state a cause of action, and denying any indebtedness.\u201d Citing <em>Scott v. Frost, supra, </em>we announced, as did the Court of Appeals, that \u201cThe statute under which the demand was made is peremptory,\u201d and that the court had erred in \u201cholding that the bill of particulars was sufficient, and not excluding evidence because a proper account was not filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">. [3,4] Plaintiff seeks to justify the judgment upon two grounds: (1) That section 3, chapter 177, \u201935 C.S.A., rather than the code provision which we have discussed, is controlling; and (2) that the action is \u201cupon an account stated, and therefore, the plaintiff in error is not entitled to an accounting of any nature.\u201d Neither contention is tenable. The two enactments are not in conflict. The code provision outlines rules of pleading in actions on account, as is the basis of the demand here. The statutory section upon which plaintiff relies, above cited, has to do with the competency of witnesses to testify in relation to books of original entry, and their evidentiary value when established. It is only invocable when the party relying on books of account has so proceeded that testimony is in order. In the circumstances of this record, as we have seen, plaintiff failed to develop his pleading to that point. As to plaintiff\u2019s second contention, his failure to plead \u201can account stated,\u201d obviously appearing, operates adversely thereto. \u201cTo enable one to recover upon an account stated he must declare upon it as such.\u201d <em>Wilson v, Waldron, </em>12 Wash. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>149, 40 Pac. 740. See, <em>St. Louis Co. v. Colorado Nat. Bank, </em>8 Colo. 70, 5 Pac. 800; <em>Bump v. Cooper, </em>20 Ore. 527, 26 Pac. 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">There were other errors, as our discussion has indicated, but the culminating one grew out of the court\u2019s order overruling defendant\u2019s objection to the introduction of any testimony. That a proper ruling on that objection may be made, let the judgment be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Mr. Chief Justice Francis E. Bouck and Mr. Justice Bakke dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
