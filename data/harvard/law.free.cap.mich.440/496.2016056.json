In November, 1987, he hired plaintiff Dorene Sanchez as a waitress. Shortly thereafter, a rumor circulated that Sanchez had acquired immunodeficiency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>syndrome, aids. It appears that some patrons refused to allow Sanchez to wait on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">On December 8, 1987, Lagoudakis informed Sanchez that she could not continue to work at the restaurant until she secured medical evidence that she was disease free.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sanchez obtained a blood test at the county health department and learned that the result was negative about a month later. She maintains, however, that she was so humiliated by the experience that she had to leave Coldwater and return to Marshall.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Sanchez commenced this action against her employer, Lagoudakis,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claiming that his actions violated the Handicappers\u2019 Civil Rights Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After some discovery, both parties filed motions for summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The circuit court granted Lagoudakis\u2019 motion, finding that because the complaint alleged, and discovery tended to show, that Sanchez did not in fact have aids, she did not have a handicap as defined by the act, and thus had failed to state a claim under the act. The court conditioned the dismissal of the case, however, on Lagoudakis\u2019 paying lost wages for the time between Sanchez\u2019 suspension and her receipt of the negative test results. The court assessed some costs and attorney fees against Lagoudakis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>affirmed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We reverse, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The circuit judge granted summary disposition because he was of the opinion that the act cannot support a claim of discriminatory treatment based on an employer\u2019s <em>erroneous perception </em>that an employee has aids.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">There are two parts to the question presented: (1) can aids be found to be a handicap under the act?; (2) is the mere perception of a handicap, even if erroneous, actionable under the act?</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Although this is the first time this Court has confronted the issue whether aids can be a handicap under the act, courts in California, New York and New Jersey, have considered the question in construing discrimination statutes. These courts have all concluded that aids is a handicap for civil rights purposes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">The United States Courts of Appeals for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Ninth<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Eleventh<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Circuits, and the United States District'Courts for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the Central District of California,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> have held that aids is a handicap under antidiscrimination statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Section 103(b)(i) of the act,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in effect at the time of Sanchez\u2019 claim,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> defined \"handicap\u201d as \"a deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>minable physical or mental characteristic of an individual or a history of the characteristic which may result from disease, injury, congenital condition of birth, or functional disorder which characteristic . . . is unrelated to the individual\u2019s ability to perform the duties of a particular job or position, or is unrelated to the individual\u2019s qualifications for employment or promotion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We are persuaded that a person with aids can be found to be handicapped. On remand, the evidence may provide support for a finding that a person with aids has a \"physical characteristic\u201d because such persons have a severely weakened immune system, an inability to fight disease that persons not so infected can withstand. Further, this characteristic may be \"determinable\u201d because it can be identified by blood testing. Finally, this characteristic may \"result from disease\u201d because the cause of the breakdown of an Ams-infected person\u2019s immune system is the disease known as AIDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In the instant case, the circuit court did not reach either the issue whether aids can be a determinable physical or mental characteristic resulting from disease or the issue of \"unrelated<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ness,\u201d having concluded that the act precluded claims based on the perception of handicap.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Having determined that aids can be found to be a handicap under the act, we turn to the question whether the mere perception of a handicap, even if erroneous, is actionable under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Section 202(1)(b) of the act<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> provided that an employer shall not \"[discharge or otherwise discriminate against an individual with respect to compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, <em>because of a handicap </em>that is unrelated to the individual\u2019s ability to perform the duties of a particular job or position.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">It appears from this wording that the act prohibited employers from acting against employees on the basis of a handicap within the statutory definition. The focus of the act was the basis of the employer\u2019s conduct \u2014 the employer\u2019s belief or intent \u2014 and not the employee\u2019s condition. If the employer acts on a belief that the employee has a handicap, and subsequently discharges or otherwise discriminates against the employee on the basis of that belief, it is inconsequential whether the employee actually has the handicap because, in either hypothesis, the employer has undertaken the kind of discriminatory action that the act prohibits.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The Civil Rights Commission has consistently construed the act to protect persons who suffer discrimination motivated by an employer\u2019s erroneous perception of a handicap.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The commission recently extended this construction to explicitly include the perception of aids.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The Court of Appeals has concluded that the act proscribes discrimination motivated by an employer\u2019s erroneous perception of a handicap.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Courts in other jurisdictions with discrimination laws similar to the act have consistently construed their statutes to protect persons perceived to be handicapped. The United States Supreme Court,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> as well as the United States Court of Appeals for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the Fifth Circuit<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and the United States District Courts for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and the District of Hawaii,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> have construed the federal Rehabilitation Act<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> to include employers\u2019 perceptions of handicap, even in instances where the employee in fact had no handicap.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The Supreme Courts for the States of Washington,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Wisconsin<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and Utah,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the Connecticut Human Rights Commission,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>New Jersey Superior Court,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> have all concluded that handicap discrimination statutes prohibit discrimination based on mere perception of handicap.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The Legislature, in 1990, amended the definition of \"handicap\u201d to include \"[b]eing regarded as having\u201d a handicap.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Clearly, under the current version, when the act, in describing prohibited behavior, speaks of discrimination by an employer against an individual because of a handicap, this includes an individual who, while not handicapped, is regarded as having a handicap.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Because aids can be found to be a handicap under the Handicappers\u2019 Civil Rights Act, and because the act prohibits discriminatory treatment, even when based on erroneous perception, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">On remand the circuit court shall determine whether the condition Sanchez was perceived to have was a determinable physical characteristic resulting from disease unrelated to her ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>perform the duties of her job or her qualifications for employment or promotion.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Both of these questions are for further factual development and determination.
