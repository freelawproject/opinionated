Its function in this regard is documented by an impressive record of service over several centuries. The press does not simply publish information about trials but guards against the miscarriage of justice by subjecting the police, prosecutors, and judicial processes to extensive public scrutiny and criticism. <em>[Sheppard v Maxwell, </em>384 US 333, 350; 86 S Ct 1507; 16 L Ed 2d 600 (1966).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">In this case we are called upon to examine, the balance between protecting an individual\u2019s reputation from false and defamatory statements and fostering energetic, tumultuous public debate to ensure continued scrutiny of police, prosecutors, and the courts through cherished constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>rights guaranteeing freedom of speech and the press.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Newspapers have a 'longstanding tradition of reporting on criminal justice and police conduct. \"With respect to judicial proceedings in particular, the function of the press serves to guarantee the fairness of trials and to bring to bear the beneficial effects of public scrutiny upon the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp v Cohn, </em>420 US 469, 492; 95 S Ct 1029; 43 L Ed 2d 328 (1975). Protecting that tradition without trampling the rights of individual citizens is the task facing this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The plaintiff, David Rouch, was arrested, booked on a charge of first-degree criminal sexual conduct by the police upon authorization from an attorney in the prosecutor\u2019s office, and released after an informal bond hearing by a magistrate acting in her formal capacity pursuant to MCR 6.104. The defendant newspaper, the Enquirer &amp; News of Battle Creek, published an account of Rouch\u2019s arrest, the charge against him, and his release on bond. Later, when Rouch appeared for his formal arraignment, he was told that the charges had been dropped. Rouch predicates his suit upon inaccuracies in the newspaper report.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Perhaps it is not surprising that with such important rights at stake, this controversy has required so much appellate court time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When this Court first considered the case, it reviewed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>abbreviated record prepared prior to a summary disposition motion to determine \"the applicability of Michigan\u2019s statutory 'public and official proceedings\u2019 statute, MCL 600.2911(3); MSA 27A.2911(3), and the viability of its common-law qualified public-interest privilege.\u201d 427 Mich 157, 160; 398 NW2d 245 (1986). With further factual development, the matter returns to this Court for additional review. We now consider whether the defendant published a materially false article. We need not reach the issue whether it was negligently published,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and whether the more complete factual record brings the case within Michigan\u2019s statutory privilege.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>We hold that the article was not materially false, <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and we therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand for entry of judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">A. THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">On December 5, 1980, David Rouch commenced this libel action against the Enquirer &amp; News of Battle Creek by filing a complaint in the Calhoun Circuit Court. Rouch claimed that the newspaper had falsely published an article describing his arrest as a suspect for the rape of a seventeen-year-old girl who was baby-sitting for his former wife. After initial discovery, the newspaper filed a motion for summary disposition, seeking an order of no cause of action because the newspaper was entitled to qualified privilege under the terms of MCL 600.2911(3); MSA 27A.2911(3). In support of its motion, the newspaper relied on the depositions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>of the plaintiff, affidavits of the news reporter who authored the article, and a police sergeant who provided a copy of. the incident report with respect to Rouch\u2019s arrest. Relying on <em>Schultz v Newsweek, Inc, </em>668 F2d 911 (CA 6, 1982), the trial court ruled that the newspaper was entitled to a qualified privilege for matters of general public interest. As a result, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff was required to prove actual malice in order to sustain his claim. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant on the basis that the plaintiff was unable to establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding the defendant newspaper\u2019s malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed the ruling of the trial court, stating that the statutory privilege was unavailable on the basis that no warrant was issued in the case, that the common-law privilege to report matters in the public interest was unavailable because the details of the alleged crime fell outside the scope of matters promoting the public interest, and that the trial court erred in requiring a showing of malice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We granted the defendant leave to appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">In <em>Rouch v Enquirer &amp; News of Battle Creek, </em>427 Mich 157; 398 NW2d 245 (1986) (hereafter <em>Rouch I), </em>we considered the scope of Michigan\u2019s statutory privilege, the continued existence of Michigan\u2019s qualified privilege in light of the constitutional dimensions of the law of defamation as developed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>New York Times Co v Sullivan, </em>376 US 254; 84 S Ct 710; 11 L Ed 2d 686 (1964), and its progeny, and the burden of proving falsity. Writing for the majority, Justice Brickley considered the questions of privilege and discussed the applicability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the \"official proceedings privilege\u201d statute, MCL 600.2911(3); MSA 27A.2911(3). Justice Brickley concluded that an arrest,, absent judicial action, falls outside the scope of \"public and official proceedings\u201d as covered in Michigan\u2019s statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In rejecting an interpretation of Michigan\u2019s statutory privilege that would reach arrests or police reports absent judicial action, Justice Brickley reasoned that the language \"evoke[d] notions of adjudicatory action, rather than of government action generally.\u201d 427 Mich 172. Justice Brickley further explored the effect of constitutional mandates on the availability of Michigan\u2019s public-interest privilege. Concluding that the public-interest privilege had been largely subsumed by the more expansive constitutional protections afforded by the <em>New York Times </em>standard, we adopted the <em>Gertz</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>negligence standard in place of the former public-interest privilege, 427 Mich 202, and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings, with the instruction that the plaintiff bore the burden of proving falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">On February 9, 1988, an eight-day trial commenced in circuit court. Witnesses included the news reporter responsible for the story, police officers, the plaintiff, the magistrate responsible for holding the informal bond hearing, and several expert witnesses. Significantly, John Bell, a Battle Creek police officer, testified that the prosecutor, Mr. Pattison, authorized Mr. Rouch to be arrested on the charge of first-degree criminal sexual con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>duct. The defendant introduced a copy of the police report that detailed the booking of Rouch for criminal sexual conduct on the basis of the authorization of Prosecutor Pattison. Officer Bell also explained that an arraignment for bond purposes was held before the magistrate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Adding to the factual record in <em>Rouch </em>\u00a3 which focused on the facts regarding the arrest and police reports, the trial record included testimony from the magistrate who was responsible for setting bond. The magistrate testified that one of her official duties was to set bond for persons being held in custody. Although the magistrate did not specifically recall the details of this hearing, the defendant introduced a bail bond form signed by Rouch which evidenced a $10,000 personal recognizance bond with appearance for arraignment required on December 28, 1979. The form detailed the offense as criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. The magistrate agreed that the form indicated that she had set bond and described the manner in which such bonds were set. She explained that to set bond, she would consider the length of the defendant\u2019s residence in the community, his employment status, his reputation and character, his prior criminal record, his record of appearance or nonappearance on other occasions, the nature of the offense, and the probability of conviction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The defendant renewed its motion for directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>verdict incorporating all its prior arguments, and again raised the contention that the case fell within Michigan\u2019s statutory privilege, relying particularly on the magistrate\u2019s testimony as evidence of an official proceeding. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and awarded damages of one million dollars. The defendant unsuccessfully moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. A stay was granted, and the newspaper appealed in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The Court of Appeals addressed numerous issues in affirming the jury verdict. The Court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff failed to prove that the article was materially false. The Court disagreed with the defendant\u2019s assertion that the plaintiff failed to submit sufficient evidence to establish negligence. In addition, the Court disagreed with the defendant\u2019s suggestion that publication of the article was within the protection of the official proceedings statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">We granted the defendant leave to appeal. 437 Mich 1035 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">B. THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">This case began on December 21, 1979, with the arrest of David Rouch as a suspect in the rape of his former wife\u2019s baby-sitter. Rouch was arrested without a warrant, held by the police, booked on the charge of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, as authorized by the prosecutor, and released on $10,000 personal recognizance bond after an informal hearing before a magistrate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is undisputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>that Rouch was never formally arraigned on a warrant and that the police eventually pursued another suspect. The facts surrounding Rouch\u2019s arrest were set forth in an article published by the Battle Creek News &amp; Enquirer.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Mr. Rouch conceded that the article in question and its references to his arrest, booking, and release on bond were accurate. Plaintiff complained, however, about three supposedly material errors. First, plaintiff contended that the article falsely asserted that Rouch was \"charged\u201d with sexual assault. Second, the plaintiff complained that the article falsely stated that he was identified by his children when, in reality, he was identified by his former wife\u2019s children, his former stepchildren. Third, plaintiff complained that the article was inaccurate in that it asserted that the charge against Rouch was authorized by the Calhoun County Prosecutor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The facts regarding the manner in which the newspaper reporter received the information are in dispute. The reporter claimed that he contacted members of the Bedford Police Department in Calhoun County who relayed the information to him, and that he held the information until he was informed that court action had occurred and Rouch was released on bond with an arraignment set for the following week. Because the reporter could not identify with certainty to whom he spoke at the police department, and the officers who testified could not recall speaking with the reporter about this specific case, the plaintiff suggests that the reporter uncovered the information in some other way.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AxH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\">A proper determination of the plaintiff\u2019s defamation claims requires consideration of the elements of libel under Michigan law in light of the constitutional requirements and principles that shape libel law to be consistent with First Amendment strictures. Michigan adheres to the commonly accepted meaning of a defamatory communication set forth in the Restatement of Torts. <em>Nuyen v Slater, </em>372 Mich 654, 662; 127 NW2d 369 (1964). 3 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 559, p 156, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\">A communication is defamatory if it tends so to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In <em>Locricchio v Evening News Ass\u2019n, </em>438 Mich 84, 115-116; 476 NW2d 112 (1991), we enumerated four components for a cause of action for libel: 1) a false and defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff, 2) an unprivileged communication to a third party, 3) fault amounting to at least negligence on the part of the publisher, and 4) either actionability of the statement irrespective of special harm or the existence of special harm caused by publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In addition to satisfying Michigan\u2019s common-law requirements for a libel cause of action, a litigant must comply with constitutional requirements. As we recognized in <em>Locricchio, </em>analysis under the constitution has focused on three elements: \"the public- or private-figure status of the plaintiff, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>media or nonmedia status of the defendant,<footnotemark>[15]</footnotemark> and the public or private character of the speech.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118. In this case involving a private plaintiff, a media defendant, and a publication regarding an area of public concern, the constitution requires that the plaintiff bear the burden of proving falsity. <em>Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc v Hepps, </em>475 US. 767; 106 S Ct 1558; 89 L Ed 2d 783 (1986). Further, after <em>Gertz v Welch, Inc, </em>418 US 323, 347; 94 S Ct 2997; 41 L Ed 2d 789 (1974), invited states to \"define for themselves the appropriate standard of liability for a publisher or broadcaster of defamatory falsehood injurious to a private individual,\u201d this Court adopted negligence as the standard in Michigan. <em>Rouch I, </em>427 Mich 195.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant\u2019s publication of the communication at issue was negligent.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the jury verdict in this case, ruling that the plaintiff met his burden of proving falsity, that sufficient evidence was submitted to establish the defendant\u2019s negligence, and that the defendant could not invoke the protection of Michigan\u2019s \"official proceedings\u201d statute, MCL 600.2911(3); MSA 27A.2911(3). <em>Rouch v Enquirer &amp; News (On Remand), </em>184 Mich App 19; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>457 NW2d 74 (1990). We disagree with the ruling on material falsity.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In <em>Locricchio, </em>438 Mich 110-114, we held that in reviewing a libel case affecting constitutionally protected public discourse, an appellate court must independently review the record with regard to falsity. The concept of independent appellate review of the record reflects a longstanding concern that judges \"exercise such review in order to preserve the precious liberties established and ordained by the Constitution.\u201d <em>Bose Corp v Consumers Union of United States, Inc, </em>466 US 485, 511; 104 S Ct 1949; 80 L Ed 2d 502 (1984). Since <em>New York Times Co v Sullivan, supra </em>at 285, the United States Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of careful appellate review of the evidence to ensure that constitutional principles are properly applied. There, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">This Court\u2019s duty is not limited to the elaboration of constitutional principles; we must also in proper cases review the evidence to make certain that those principles have been constitutionally applied. This is such a case, particularly since the question is one of alleged trespass across \"the line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be regulated.\u201d . . . In cases where that line must be drawn, the rule is that we \"examine for ourselves the statements in issue and the circumstances under which they were made to see . . . whether they are of a character which the principles of the First Amendment, as adopted by the Due Process Clause of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Fourteenth Amendment, protect.\u201d . . . We must \"make an independent examination of the whole record,\u201d ... so as to assure ourselves that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Reiterating this conclusion in <em>Time, Inc v Pape, </em>401 US 279; 91 S Ct 633; 28 L Ed 2d 45 (1971), the Court underscored its concern that an independent examination of the evidence be conducted. Writing for the majority, Justice Stewart stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">Inquiries of this kind are familiar under the settled principle that \"[i]n cases in which there is a claim of denial of rights under the Federal Constitution, this Court is not bound by the conclusions of lower courts, but will re-examine the evidentiary basis on which those conclusions are founded.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 284.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Justice Stewart recalled that the occasion for such review \"frequently\u201d arose in \"the area of tension between the First and Fourteenth Amendments on the one hand and state defamation laws on the other . . . .\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">More recently, the United States Supreme Court revisited the question of the proper standard of appellate review in <em>Bose Corp v Consumers Union of United States, Inc, supra. Bose </em>rejected the imposition of the clearly erroneous standard of FR Civ P 52(a) in reviewing a determination of actual malice in cases governed by <em>New York Times Co v Sullivan, supra. </em>Recounting the lengthy tradition of independent review in the context of constitutional facts, the <em>Bose </em>Court characterized the requirement as \"a rule of federal constitutional law\u201d that \"emerged from the exigency of deciding concrete cases; it is law in its purest form under our common-law heritage . . . reflecting] a deeply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>held conviction that judges \u2014 and particularly Members of this Court \u2014 must exercise such review in order to preserve the precious liberties established and ordained by the Constitution.\u201d <em>Bose </em>at 510-511.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Likewise, the United States Supreme Court independently reviewed the record in <em>Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc v Connaughton, </em>491 US 657; 109 S Ct 2678; 105 L Ed 2d 562 (1989), to conclude that the judgment was supported by clear and convincing proof of actual malice. The Court reiterated its conclusion in <em>Bose </em>that the sufficiency of evidence to support a finding of actual malice is a question of law. It emphasized the \"unique character of the interest protected by the actual malice standard,\u201d <em>Harte-Hanks </em>at 686. The Court predicated the rule requiring independent review on the difficulty in giving \"content to these otherwise elusive constitutional standards,\u201d coupled with the importance of \"such elucidation ... in the area of free speech . . . .\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Although the scope of this doctrine had not been clearly delineated by the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Locricchio, </em>we concluded that \"an independent appellate review of the burden of proof with regard to falsity in private-figure, public-interest cases deters 'forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression\u2019 as a logical corollary to independent review of actual malice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113 (quoting <em>Sullivan </em>at 285). We reasoned that <em>Hepps </em>abrogated the common-law presumption of falsity in libel cases, creating \"an issue of constitutional fact regarding whether a plaintiff carries the burden of proving falsity.\u201d 438 Mich 113.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ered that the absence of meaningful appellate review might result in upholding a jury verdict lacking adequate evidentiary support. We analogized this result to a \"failure to review for clear and convincing evidence of actual malice,\u201d <em>id., </em>and concluded that the promised protection for media defendants afforded by placing the burden of proof on the plaintiffs would \"ring hollow\u201d in the absence of meaningful review of the trial court\u2019s finding regarding falsity. <em>Id. </em>at 114.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The Court has acknowledged that the \"appropriate methodology for distinguishing questions of fact from questions of law has been, to say the least, elusive.\u201d <em>Miller v Fenton, </em>474 US 104, 113; 106 S Ct 445; 88 L Ed 2d 405 (1985). In discussing this problem, the Court at 114, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>At least in those instances in which Congress has not spoken and in which the issue falls somewhere between a pristine legal standard and a simple historical fact, the fact/law distinction at times has turned on a determination that, as a matter of the sound administration of justice, one judicial actor is better positioned than another to decide the issue in question. Where, for example, as with proof of actual malice in First Amendment libel cases, the relevant legal principle can be given meaning only through its application to the particular circumstances of a case, the Court has been reluctant to give the trier of fact\u2019s conclusions presumptive force and, in so doing, strip a federal appellate court of its primary function as an expositor of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">The <em>Miller </em>Court at 114, cited with approval Monaghan\u2019s article discussing <em>Constitutional fact review, </em>85 Colum L R 229 (1985). The author placed the <em>Bose </em>case within the context of numerous United States Supreme Court decisions establishing that \"absent limiting legislation, federal appellate courts, particularly the Supreme Court\u201d possess the authority to \"sort out the relevant facts and apply to them the controlling constitutional norms.\u201d Monaghan at 238. Monaghan explained that independent review enabled the appellate court to \"elaborate the governing norm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236. Since law application is \"situation-specific\u201d and norm elaboration is often invisible or buried in a general verdict, Monaghan noted that unless appellate courts conduct independent review they are unable to carry out their law declaration function by providing general norm elaboration when they conclude that it is necessary.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In accord with Monaghan\u2019s view, the <em>Miller </em>Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>emphasized the question of allocation of decision making embodied in the categorization of issues as fact/law or mixed fact/law questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">We perceive an additional need for independent review grounded on the fear that juries may give short shrift to important First Amendment rights. The <em>Miller </em>Court recalled that the Court has tended to allocate decision making to appellate courts where necessary to avoid perceived shortcomings of the trier of fact and to allocate decision making to trial courts where the issue involves the credibility of witnesses. In the area of libel actions, we have acknowledged that independent review \"reflects an inherent distrust of allocating unlimited decisional power to juries in the First Amendment context.\u201d <em>Locricchio, supra </em>at 114, n 20. Even Justice Rehnquist, who dissented in <em>Bose, supra, </em>conceded that the doctrine of independent review of facts \"exists ... so that perceived shortcomings of the trier of fact by way of bias or some other factor may be compensated for.\u201d 466 US at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">We therefore independently review the whole record in this case to consider whether material falsity was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">The common law has never required defendants to prove that a publication is literally and absolutely accurate in every minute detail. For example, the Restatement of Torts provides that \"[sjlight inaccuracies of expression are immaterial provided that the defamatory charge is true in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>substance.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Michigan courts have traditionally followed this approach.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> At early common law, Michigan courts predicated a claim for libel on the question whether the article was substantially true. In <em>McAllister v Detroit Free Press Co, </em>85 Mich 453, 460-461; 48 NW 612 (1891), this Court explained that liability could not be imposed for a slight inaccuracy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-4\">It is sufficient for the defendant to justify so much of the defamatory matter as constitutes the sting of the charge, and it is unnecessary to repeat and justify every word of the alleged defamatory matter, so long as the substance of the libelous charge be justified. ... [A] slight inaccuracy in one of its details will not prevent the defendant\u2019s succeeding, providing the inaccuracy in no way alters the complexion of the affair, and would have no different effect on the reader, than that which the literal truth would produce ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Thus, the test looked to the sting of the article to determine its effect on the reader; if the literal truth produced the same effect, minor differences were deemed immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In contrast to the early common law, where falsity was presumed and the defendant was required to prove substantial truth as a defense, the burden of proving falsity has now been shifted to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Despite this constitutionally required alteration in the allocation of the burden of proof, the definition of falsity remains based on the common-law doctrine. <em>Masson v New Yorker Magazine, Inc, </em>501 US \u2014; 111 S Ct 2419; 115 L Ed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>2d 447 (1991). In determining the falsity component of an actual malice finding, the United States Supreme Court grounded the concept of falsity on its historical definition of falsity in common-law libel. <em>Masson, </em>111 S Ct 2432-2433. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">The common law of libel takes but one approach to the question of falsity, regardless of the form of the communication. ... It overlooks minor inaccuracies and concentrates upon substantial truth. . . . The essence of that inquiry, however, remains the same whether the burden rests upon plaintiff or defendant. Minor inaccuracies do not amount to falsity so long as \"the substance, the gist, the sting, of the libelous charge be justified.\u201d . . . Put another way, the statement is not considered false unless it \"would have a different effect on the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have produced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Although <em>Masson </em>pertained to the falsity component of an actual malice determination, it is clear that the constitutional requirement for testing falsity mirrors Michigan\u2019s common-law test.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">The substantial truth doctrine is frequently invoked to solve two recurring problems: minor inaccuracies and technically incorrect or flawed use of legal terminology. This case raises both questions. The Court of Appeals held that \"whether the article is read for its gist or simply for the information presented as fact, plaintiff has met his burden of proving falsity.\u201d 184 Mich App 32. In reaching this result, the Court of Appeals focused on the assertions that the article indicated that plaintiff was \"charged\u201d with the crime of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, sexual assault, that \"charges\u201d had been authorized by the prosecutor when no formal arraignment had occurred, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>and that the article suggested that \"his children\u201d identified him as the person who committed the crime when the identification was made by his former wife\u2019s children. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">In order to properly evaluate the falsity of the article, we have reproduced the language from the article as published in the newspaper followed by a version that contains language which corrects the inaccuracies complained of by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">. This is the text of the report and headline published by the Enquirer &amp; News of Battle Creek:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">POLICE ARREST SUSPECT IN BABY-SITTER ASSAULT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">A 43-year-old man has been <em>arrested and charged </em>with the sexual assault of a 17-year-old wom[a]n who was baby-sitting with <em>his children </em>at his <em>ex-wife\u2019s house </em>on North Finlay Avenue in Bedford Township.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">The suspect has been identified by Bedford Township police as David J.

The Court of Appeals concluded that the message conveyed to readers of the article by the several references to \"charge\u201d or \"charges\u201d was materially false. First, it interpreted this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Rouch I </em>as requiring this result. It apparently concluded from the statement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>Rouch I </em>that \"plaintiff was never formally charged\u201d with the crime, that the use of the word \"charged\u201d was false. Second, it relied upon a textual analysis of the plain meaning of the word \"charge,\u201d questioning the defendant\u2019s suggestion that \"charge\u201d is synonymous with \"accuse.\u201d Conceding that <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary of the American Language, Second College Edition </em>(1984), includes \"accuse\u201d as one of the possible meanings of \"charge,\u201d the Court pointed out the additional listed term \"indictment.\u201d It also referred to <em>The Random House College Dictionary, Revised Edition </em>(1984), which defined \"charge\u201d as \"to accuse formally or explicitly\u201d and as \"an accusation.\u201d On the basis. of these authorities, the Court reasoned that \"charge\u201d carries a more serious connotation than \"accuse\u201d and that the article\u2019s use of the term \"in a much more specific and legal sense\u201d was false. 184 Mich App 34. Finally, the Court of Appeals attempted to draw an analogy with this Court\u2019s reasoning regarding the distinction between \"proceedings\u201d under the privilege statute and mere apprehensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">We cannot agree with this reasoning. The linchpin of the Court of Appeals analysis is a formalistic interpretation of the word \"charge\u201d that belies any attempt to ascertain the \"gist\u201d or \"sting\u201d of the article to the lay reader. The United States Supreme Court has cautioned that recovery can be refused for \"choice of language which, though perhaps reflecting a misconception, represented 'the sort of inaccuracy that is commonplace in the forum of robust debate to which the <em>New York Times </em>rule applies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Masson, </em>111 S Ct 2434, quoting <em>Bose, </em>466 US 513.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Technical inaccuracies in legal terminology employed by nonlawyers such as those at issue here fall within this category. Numerous courts have rejected claims of falsity when based on a misuse of formal legal terminology.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We have recognized that the popular sense of a term may not be technically accurate. See, e.g., <em>Bailey v Kalamazoo Publishing Co, </em>40 Mich 251, 255-256 (1879). The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">A prosecution before a justice is not in a technical sense an indictment, but it serves a similar purpose. Grand juries are seldom summoned now, and very few cases are tried at the circuit on indictment. Informations have generally superseded the old method. Yet we use the term \"indictment\u201d in ordinary conversation and often in judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>cial opinions to express any criminal prosecution. The burden of this charge was that Bailey had been prosecuted for malfeasance, and we do not think there was any substantial variance between the charge and proof. The popular sense was made out by showing the prosecution for misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Thus, if technical and common parlance yield different interpretations of the same word, the constitutionally required breathing space affords protection of the writer\u2019s choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Another typical example involved reports of statements made by a trial judge at a sentencing hearing of a defendant who had pleaded no contest to a charge of second-degree sexual assault. <em>Simonson v United Press Int\u2019l, Inc, </em>654 F2d 478, 479-480 (CA 7, 1981). The article had set forth the judge\u2019s comment regarding a \"sexually permissive\u201d community and questioning whether a severe sentence should be imposed on \"an impressionable person 15 or 16 years of age,\u201d who responded. The plaintiff, the trial judge, was recalled from office after the report. He sued the newspaper for defamation, contending that its description of a sexual assault as \"rape\u201d and its use of the word \"ruled\u201d when describing the judge\u2019s comments constituted defamation. The <em>Simonson </em>court rejected this argument, noting that rape in its common usage included nonconsensual sex and that intercourse had occurred without the consent of the victim. The court further rejected the judge\u2019s contention that he never \"ruled\u201d that sexual assault was a \"normal reaction to prevalent sexual permissiveness,\u201d but simply remarked on this during the hearing. Noting that a plain and ordinary meaning of \"ruling\u201d might include statements and comments made by a judge when sitting on the bench, the court rejected the judge\u2019s contention that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>\"rhetorical question\u201d should not be seen as a ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Just as the judge in <em>Simonson </em>asserted that \"ruling\u201d should be reserved for words uttered by the judge as a formal decree and that \"rape\u201d should not be used for a no-contest plea to second-degree sexual assault, plaintiff asserts that \"charge\u201d should be limited to circumstances in which a formal arraignment has been held. As in <em>Simonson, </em>the word at issue in this case encompasses the formal legal sense as well as a broader lay sense. Just as the <em>Simonson </em>court concluded that use of a word in accord with one of its meanings could not be deemed materially false, so too do we conclude that use of \"charge\u201d absent formal arraignment cannot be deemed materially false.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Not only does \"charge\u201d in a popular sense accord with the newspaper\u2019s use of the term, it accords with the legal description of the status of an arrestee before judicial process is issued. For example, the Legislature used \"charge\u201d to describe the disposition of a person following arrest without a warrant. See MCL 764.13; MSA 28.871(1).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Similarly, Michigan Court Rules use \"charge\u201d to mean accuse. See MCR 6.106(E)(8).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Panels of the Court of Appeals and this Court\u2019s Criminal Jury Instructions likewise use \"charged\u201d as a synonym for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>accusations made by the police in conjunction with arrests made without a warrant.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Thus, the popular and legal sense of the term \"charge\u201d may not be identical before the police act on an accusation; once the police act on an accusation, the popular and legal terms are synonymous.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Furthermore, both testimony and documents from the trial illustrate the numerous uses to which the word can be put. Plaintiff himself used \"charge\u201d at numerous points in the proceedings to describe the accusations brought against him.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Furthermore, plaintiff conceded that \"the article in question and its reference to the Plaintiff being arrested and being charged [with] esc and thereafter released on bond were true.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In addition, the police reports used \"charge\u201d to describe the accusations against Rouch.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The word \"charge\u201d is an umbrella term covering all stages of the charging process. It is used by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>law in contradistinction to a conviction. Even if plaintiff\u2019s argument that \"charge\u201d connotes a more serious formal involvement of judicial process than \"accuse\u201d were correct as a matter of law, we think it apparent that the word may be used in a popular sense as a synonym for accuse. While one meaning of \"charge\u201d is simply \"accuse,\u201d carrying with it no intimation of governmental involvement, here, if the word \"charge\u201d is measured by the gist of what happened, there was not only a charge or accusation by an individual, but a booking by the police, an authorization by the prosecution to lodge the suspect on the charge, and an involvement by the magistrate recognizing these actions. Thus, even if \"charge\u201d connotes the existence of governmental involvement, that was present here.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">At best, one might conclude that the use of \"charge\u201d in its technical formal sense was inaccurate. We cannot accept this as a basis for liability. To do so would totally eviscerate the \"breathing space\u201d that the constitution requires in order to protect important First Amendment rights. When writing about criminal justice or legal matters, newspapers would be forced to recapitulate technical legal terminology employed by courts or law enforcement personnel even where popular words might be clearer for the lay reader. Attempting to reframe legal documents and events with legal significance into popular or lay terminology would be fraught with peril, and newspapers would do so at their risk. As one court remarked, there is \"no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>authority for plaintiff\u2019s contention that a newspaper article reporting a judicial proceeding must indicate every possible interpretation of every word used in a complaint or other legal document.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We agree. Having conducted an independent review of the record to determine whether use of the word \"charge\u201d rendered the article materially false, we conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s additional complaint falls within the second category of cases arising under the substantial truth doctrine, those that involve minor inaccuracies. Plaintiff protests the article\u2019s suggestion that he was identified by his children, rather than the children of his former wife. The Court of Appeals concluded that this constituted material falsity because it seemed to eliminate the possibility that there was a mistaken identification. We cannot accept this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Numerous courts have considered the falsity of articles in which the gist of the story was accurate, but minor inaccuracies marred the report. <em>Drury v Feeney, </em>505 So 2d 111 (La App, 1987), cert den 506 So 2d 1225 (1987), is illustrative. Despite the defendant\u2019s failure to report precisely the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s conviction, the court found that the article was substantially true. The article described the plaintiff\u2019s conviction of \"21 counts of mail fraud to cheat insurance companies and his clients of money in car accident suits.\u201d Actually, the plaintiff had been convicted for failure to disclose to his clients a fee-splitting arrangement. In colorful language, the court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>that the discrepancy was \" 'an infinitesimal aberrant grain of sand hidden in an entire seashore of reprehensible conduct and truths ....\u2019\u201d 505 So 2d 112.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Like courts in other jurisdictions, Michigan courts have found substantial truth despite minor inaccuracies in the details of an article. <em>McCracken v Evening News Ass\u2019n, </em>3 Mich App 32; 141 NW2d 694 (1966), epitomizes the reasoning that undergirds such a finding. The defendant newspaper reported that the plaintiff was charged with \"$100,000 fraud\u201d when, in fact, he had altered construction invoices in an amount between $37,000 and $39,000. The Court of Appeals rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the article was substantially untrue, noting that this constituted \"an inaccuracy that does not alter the complexion of the affair and would have no different effect on the reader than that which the literal truth would produce.\u201d 3 Mich App 40.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The essence of plaintiff\u2019s argument is that the statement in the article that his children had identified him would eliminate in the reader\u2019s mind the possibility of a mistake. We think the gist or sting of the article was that plaintiff was arrested on the basis of the identification of per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>sons who knew him. While we might agree that a reader acquainted with the facts might have more reason to suspect the motives of the identifiers, this is an argument regarding the weight of the identification, not its truth or falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">In sum, neither of the asserted errors, taken individually or as a group, alters the gist or sting of the article. The sting of the article was that the plaintiff had been identified by persons to whom he was well known and was charged with esc i. That is true. The question whether a formal warrant had been issued or an arraignment held, like the question whether it was his children or former stepchildren who identified him, did hot affect the article\u2019s substantial truth. Thus, the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">After painstaking review of the whole record in light of Michigan libel law and the latest constitutional pronouncements on the subject, we conclude that the evidence was not sufficient to establish material falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Accordingly, because we disagree with the reasoning and result of the Court of Appeals, we vacate its opinion and remand this matter to the trial court for entry of judgment in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b371-8\">Brickley, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-6\"> Both of these values are explicitly embodied in Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">Every person may freely speak, write, express and publish his views on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of such right; and no law shall be enacted to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\"> This case began more than a decade ago and has been considered twice by the Michigan Court of Appeals and once by this Court.

Nevertheless, we observe that plaintiff\u2019s theory regarding fault apparently was that the newspaper reporter had been poorly trained and consequently failed to further investigate information provided to him by the police. The existence and scope of any constitutionally based doctrine of neutral reportage remains as yet undefined. See <em>Smith v Daily Mail Publishing Co, </em>443 US 97, 102; 99 S Ct 2667; 61 L Ed 2d 399 (1979) (\"state action to punish the publication of truthful information seldom can satisfy constitutional standards\u201d); <em>The Florida Star v BJF, </em>491 US 524; 109 S Ct 2603; 105 L Ed 2d 443 (1989); <em>Butterworth v Smith, </em>494 US 624; 110 S Ct 1376; 108 L Ed 2d 572 (1990); <em>Landmark Communications, Inc v Virginia, </em>435 US 829; 98 S Ct 1535; 56 L Ed 2d 1 (1978); <em>Oklahoma Publishing Co v District Court, </em>430 US 308; 97 S Ct 1045; 51 L Ed 2d 355 (1977); <em>Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing Ass\u2019n v Bresler, </em>398 US 6; 90 S Ct 1537; 26 L Ed 2d 6 (1970); <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp v Cohn, supra. </em>Other state and federal courts have questioned the extent to which newspapers should be required to verify information obtained from governmental sources such as police reports absent evidence that the publisher had good reason to suspect falsity. <em>Torres-Silva v El Mundo, </em>3 Media L Rptr 1508, 1512 (PR, 1977); <em>Wilson v Capital City Press, </em>315 So 2d 393 (La App, 1975); <em>Appleby v Daily Hampshire Gazette, </em>395 Mass 32; 478 NE2d 721 (1985); <em>LaMon v Butler, </em>44 Wash App 654; 722 P2d 1373 (1986); <em>Walters v Sanford Herald, Inc, </em>31 NC App 233; 228 SE2d 766 (1976); <em>Ricci v Venture Magazine, Inc, </em>574 F Supp 1563 (D Mass, 1983).

I also agree with the majority that the decision of the Court of Appeals must be vacated. However, as a threshold matter, I suggest that plaintiff\u2019s failure to allege and identify in his pleading, supplemental pleading, and answers to defendant\u2019s interrogatories, specifically which statements he considered to be materially false and how the newspaper either was negligent or reckless in publishing the story, were proper grounds for summary judgment by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In <em>Locricchio v Evening News Ass\u2019n, </em>438 Mich 84, 115-116; 476 NW2d 112 (1991), we reviewed our common-law precedent<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and listed the four components required to state a cause of action for libel: (1) a false and defamatory statement of and concerning the plaintiff, (2) an unprivileged communication to a third party, (3) fault amounting to at least negligence on the part of the publisher, and (4) either actionability of the statement irrespective of special harm or the existence of special harm caused by publication. We also stated that a cause of action for libel requires a plaintiff to show defamatory meaning as well as falsity, fault, and publication. <em>Locricchio, supra </em>at 116. Inherent in these requirements is the well-established rule that a defamation plaintiff must plead with specificity who published the defamatory statement, when it was published, and, most importantly, a plaintiff must identify the precise materially false statement published. <em>MacGriff v Van Antwerp, </em>327 Mich 200, 204-205; 41 NW2d 524 (1950). In <em>Mac</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number><em>Griff, </em>we held that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to directly identify the defamatory statements entitled the defendant to summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 204. In subsequent cases, the Court of Appeals routinely followed this rule by affirming trial court rulings that granted summary judgment to defamation defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">In recent years, however, a conflict developed in the Court of Appeals over whether a general allegation of malice is sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact. The conflict began with <em>Parks v Johnson, </em>84 Mich App 162, 169; 269 NW2d 514 (1978), wherein a Court of Appeals panel held that because courts are liberal in finding the existence of a genuine issue of material fact, they should not grant summary judgment unless convinced that the claim cannot be supported at trial. The <em>Parks </em>rationale was disapproved, however, in <em>Hayes v Booth Newspapers, Inc, </em>97 Mich App 758, 774-775; 295 NW2d 858 (1980); <em>Lins v Evening News Ass\u2019n, </em>129 Mich App 419, 435; 342 NW2d 573 (1983); <em>Dienes v Associated Newspapers, Inc, </em>137 Mich App 272, 283; 358 NW2d 562 (1984); and again in <em>Kurz v Evening News Ass\u2019n, </em>144 Mich App 205, 213; 375 NW2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>391 (1985), vacated on other grounds 428 Mich 886; 403 NW2d 805 (1987). These panels of the Court of Appeals concluded that a plaintiff must plead specific facts in support of showing actual malice to defeat a motion for summary judgment. The issue was settled until yet another panel held that <em>Parks </em>was correct; malice can be generally alleged and plaintiff should be given ample opportunity to demonstrate actual malice. <em>Grostick v Ellsworth, </em>158 Mich App 18, 23; 404 NW2d 685 (1987). The <em>Grostick </em>decision was abandoned shortly thereafter in <em>Smith v Fergan, </em>181 Mich App 594, 597; 450 NW2d 3 (1989). The <em>Smith </em>Court reaffirmed the principle that because the issue of actual malice is one for the jury, specific supporting facts must be alleged and general allegations of malice are, therefore, insufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact. The <em>Smith </em>decision is now controlling authority, and under Administrative Order Nos. 1990-6, 1991-11, binding precedent. See <em>Gonyea v Motor Parts Federal Credit Union, </em>192 Mich App 74, 80; 480 NW2d 297 (1991); <em>Prysak v R L Polk Co, </em>193 Mich App 1, 14; 483 NW2d 629 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In a similar vain, MCR 2.111(B)(1), and its predecessor GCR 1963, 111.1(1) requires plaintiffs to state in their pleadings \"[a] <em>statement of the facts, </em>without repetition, <em>on which the pleader relies in stating the cause of action, with the speci\u00f1c allegations necessary reasonably to inform the adverse party of the nature of the claims </em>the adverse party is called on to defend\u201d (emphasis added).

Plaintiff objected to the supplemental interrogatories, arguing that the question \"deal[s] with legal principles or at least the application of facts to legal principles which only Plaintiff\u2019s attorney is qualified to answer . . . .\u201d Defendant responded with a motion for summary judgment alleging first, that the article is substantially true \u2014 because the falsity issue did not relate to whether he committed the assault, but rather to whether the defendant\u2019s report of plaintiff\u2019s arrest was accurate \u2014 and, second, that it is privileged under Michigan\u2019s common-law qualified privilege and the official proceedings act, MCL 600.2911(3); MSA 27A.2911(3). Plaintiff also moved for summary judgment alleging that defendant admitted in its affirmative defense that the story was false, and, therefore, the only issue at trial was damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Calhoun Circuit Court Judge Stanley Everett denied both motions, but ordered plaintiff to answer defendant\u2019s supplemental interrogatories. At this hearing, Judge Everett recognized that plaintiff had failed to plead with specificity the defamatory statements published, how the statements related to him, and what was materially false within the statement. Judge Everett also recognized that the specificity requirement is needed in defamation pleadings, as it is in the ordinary negligence cases, to allow the parties to narrow their focus on the allegedly libelous statements and to determine if the article, taken as a whole, is materially false.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s counsel again ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>gued that his client\u2019s guilt or innocence of the underlying assault is determinative regarding whether the article is materially false. Defense counsel posited in response that \"the Judge put his finger on it when [he] made the analogy to the negligence case. All that [plaintiff\u2019s] complaint says is that . . . the publication was made maliciously. Now, under the [Court] Rules, . . . there has to be some showing of falsity and knowledge of falsity, and so on, ... to make out a case [for] libel</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Upon receiving plaintiff\u2019s answers to the supplemental interrogatories \u2014 which stated that the article was false because he did not commit the rape, and that defendant committed various omissions in publishing the story \u2014 defendant moved again for summary judgment. Defense counsel argued that \"none of those answers state or raise any issue of malice in the sense that is applicable to this libel action.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiff responded by alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>that the article was not privileged under the official proceedings act, that the article was defamatory because it falsely accused him of a crime he did not commit, and that the paper failed to make an effort to assess the truthfulness of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">This time, Judge Everett granted defendant\u2019s motion. He based his conclusion on the fact that there was a qualified privilege to publish the story, and that plaintiff failed to specify in his answers to the supplemental interrogatories \"any allegation which suggests that the statements were known to be false on the part of the people involved in its publication or with reckless disregard whether they were false or not.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Thus, I write separately to indicate my agreement with the trial court and to emphasize my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>belief that although this Court abandoned the \"actual malice\u201d standard for private person-public interest defamation actions in <em>Rouch I</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and adopted the \"negligence\u201d standard of liability, defendant was, nevertheless, entitled to summary disposition, as a matter of law, on the basis of our common-law precedent<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and our court rules.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The relatively simple requirement of pleading facts to support allegations of material falsity, negligence, or reckless disregard for the truth should be followed by plaintiffs in defamation actions, and, pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(8), defendant should have been entitled to summary disposition on this ground alone a decade ago.</p>\n<judges id=\"b379-4\">Griffin, J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\"> <em>Nuyen v Slater, </em>372 Mich 654, 662, n *; 127 NW2d 369 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-5\"> <em>De Guvera v Sure Fit Products, </em>14 Mich App 201, 206; 165 NW2d 418 (1968) (\" '[t]he law requires the very words of the libel to be set out in the declaration in order that the court or judge may judge whether they constitute a ground of action\u2019 \u201d); <em>Pursell v WolverinePentronix, Inc, </em>44 Mich App 416, 421; 205 NW2d 504 (1973) (applying the <em>De Guvera-MacGriff </em>rule to slander actions); <em>Hernden v Consumers Power Co, </em>72 Mich App 349, 356; 249 NW2d 419 (1976) (a plaintiff\u2019s failure to allege \"where, when, or to whom this statement [publication that the plaintiff was fired for lack of productivity] was published, or that there even was a publication to anyone other than the plaintiff himself\u201d); <em>Ledl v Quik Pik Food Stores, Inc, </em>133 Mich App 583, 589-590; 349 NW2d 529 (1984) (referring to <em>Hernden </em>and <em>Pursell </em>with approval, the <em>Ledl </em>Court held that the failure of a plaintiff to set forth with specificity the necessary elements of a defamation cause of action: the defamatory words complained of, the connection of the defamatory words with the plaintiff, and the publication of the alleged defamatory words, entitled the defendant to summary judgment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b375-5\"> <em>Rouch v Enquirer &amp; News of Battle Creek, </em>427 Mich 157, 204; 398 NW2d 245 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b375-6\"> Plaintiff\u2019s complaint, dated December 2, 1980, alleged the following facts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">3.

That test has been reiterated in case after case in our courts; that where a publication is made by a news media of a newsworthy story, the burden is upon the plaintiff to establish that the publication was made with malice, that is, with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of falsity. It is our position, Your Honor, that none of the answers to the interrogatories that are on file in any way establish that at the time that the news story was published, that anyone at the newspaper knew that the matter \u2014 material was false or had reckless disregard of the falsity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>It is also important to recognize that defense counsel did not rely on the official proceedings act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b378-11\"> The court concluded with the following thoughts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-12\">Now, many of the things set forth which you read, Mr. Jereck, relate to events after the publication which might very well go to damages and mitigating damages, but the fact as presented to the court at this time is that the reporter contacted the police, was given information, some of which, admittedly, was true; but the important point was false, and that is that there had been an authorization for a warrant charging the defendant with a specific criminal offense of some significance. I don\u2019t find anything that suggests there was an actual knowledge of the falsity of the statement or anything to suggest there was reckless disregard of the truthfulness or falsity of the statements. Consequently, I am satisfied \u2014 and I am relying on particularly on <em>Schultz v Newsweek Incorporated </em>[668 F2d 911 (CA 6, 1982)], which is the most recent decision which has been called to my attention, at least, in this evolving state of law. I am satisfied that (1) there is a qualified privilege, (2) that no suggestion has been made on the part of plaintiff that he can substantiate malice; and, therefore, that the defendant is entitled to have the matter dismissed by way of summary judgment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\"> <em>Rouch, </em>n 3 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b379-9\"> <em>MacGriff, supra </em>at 204-205.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b379-10\"> MCR 2.111(B)(1).

I agree that the correct legal test is one of material falsity and that the court is required to conduct an independent review of the record. I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s conclusion that there is insufficient evidence of material falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The disputed article in this case does contain inaccuracies. The defendant concedes that the plaintiff was not identified by his own children, but by his ex-wife\u2019s children. In addition, the article\u2019s assertion that the plaintiff was \"arrested and charged\u201d was inaccurate if \"charged\u201d is interpreted to mean subjected to formal charges. And, perhaps most significantly, there were never any charges \"authorized by the Calhoun County Pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>ecutor\u2019s Office.\u201d Under long-established principles of defamation law, however, the issue is not merely whether there are inaccuracies but whether the inaccuracies constitute material falsity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The test is whether the evidence supports the finding that the article was materially false in that the \"sting\u201d of the article would have a different effect upon the mind of the reader than would the literal truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In determining whether the concededly false aspects of the publication are significant, for defamation purposes, in relation and comparison to the concededly true portions, the inquiry necessarily goes beyond the strictly factual level and requires interpreting the likely effect of the publication on the reader\u2019s mind, and the likely meaning conveyed. But as the Court in <em>Locricchio v Evening News Ass\u2019n, </em>438 Mich 84, 111, n 17; 476 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>NW2d 112 (1991), recognized, \"in reviewing a libel verdict an appellate court does not and should not exercise review of credibility determinations, disregard previous factfindings, or create new factfindings. Rather, the court should exercise independent judgment regarding whether, as a matter of constitutional law, the evidence in the record supports the verdict.\u201d Similarly, the United States Supreme Court has declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">Indeed, it is not actually necessary to review the \"entire\u201d record to fulfill the function of independent appellate review .... The independent review function is not equivalent to a \"de novo\u201d review of the ultimate judgment itself, in which a reviewing court makes an original appraisal of all the evidence to decide whether or not it believes that judgment should be entered for plaintiff. [Bose <em>Corp </em>v <em>Consumers Union of United States, Inc, </em>466 US 485, 514, n 31; 104 S Ct 1949; 80 L Ed 2d 502 (1984).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The task before this Court, therefore, is to undertake an independent review of the record and make a judgment regarding whether the evidence supports the finding that this article was materially false. While the standard calls for \"independent appellate review,\u201d and this Court is not constrained to agree with the jury, it is important to recognize that in this case a jury, adequately instructed with respect to the need for material falsity, has reached a conclusion regarding the likely effect of the article at issue on the mind of the average reader.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, when the entire news<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>paper article consists of only ten sentences, and those ten sentences contain six factual inaccuracies, this Court should not lightly overturn the jury\u2019s conclusion that the overall effect was materially false.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Turning now to a review of the evidence in this case, the Court of Appeals declared that the article was materially false in two respects: (1) by inaccurately stating that the plaintiff had been identified as the assailant by his own children when in fact it was his former stepchildren who had identified him, and (2) by stating several times that plaintiff was arrested <em>and </em>charged with sexual assault when he was in fact merely arrested. As a purely factual matter, the statement that the plaintiff\u2019s own children had identified him as the assailant was false; the question, however, is whether it was a materially false statement; would it create a different impression in the mind of the reader than would the actual truth? I would conclude that the evidence supports such a finding. A man\u2019s children would presumably know him very well by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>sight, and their reported identification of him would likely be treated by the reader as deserving of exceptional credibility because it \"would seem to eliminate the possibility that there might have been a mistaken identification.\u201d 184 Mich App 36. In light of the \"sting\u201d of the entire article, that there was more involved than a mere apprehension of a suspect, this statement would have had a strong effect on the mind of the reader. This Court previously declared that both the fact of the arrest and \"the facts used to establish the probable cause for the arrest\u201d are of public concern. <em>Rouch I, </em>427 Mich 206. Certainly identification by one\u2019s own children would affect probable cause for the arrest and, in determining whether the reasons for the arrest were materially false, the misidentification of the stepchildren as children is not inconsequential. Even if this question is seen as a close one, I cannot conclude that the reader would not have a different reaction than if the literal truth had been reported. Therefore, the jury\u2019s determination should stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The second aspect of falsity flows from the declaration that the plaintiff was \"charged\u201d with criminal sexual conduct. As a legal matter, it was inaccurate to state that the plaintiff had been \"charged.\u201d In fact, no warrant had been issued by the prosecutor, the plaintiff had not been arraigned, and there had been no judicial determination of probable cause; the plaintiff was merely arrested and booked on suspicion of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">As a preliminary matter, the dissenting judge on the Court of Appeals is correct, in maintaining that \"newspapers should not be held to technical legal language. Instead, they should be held to the use of words as they are customarily and popularly used.\u201d 184 Mich App 53 (opinion of Allen, J.). But even in light of common, colloquial usage by non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>lawyers and the general public, when the article declared that the prosecutor had authorized the charge, the allegations became one of formal charges, not merely suspicion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The effect on the mind of the reader was materially different from the effect that would have resulted from the actual truth. Indeed, the last sentence of the article strongly suggests that the term \"charged\u201d was being employed in the formal sense; the article claimed that \"[t]he charge against Rouch was authorized Friday by the Calhoun County Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\u201d Within this context the term \"charge\u201d would normally be interpreted to mean formal charges. Since no formal charges were ever pursued, this could properly have been considered by the jury to constitute a material falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">A final note in this area is that I believe it is inappropriate for the majority to focus merely on the definition of the single word \"charge.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 263.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Michigan\u2019s law of libel requires an examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>tion of the article as a whole. See <em>Gustin v Evening Press Co, </em>172 Mich 311, 314; 137 NW 674 (1912) (\"To test its libelous quality, a publication must be considered as a whole . . .\u201d); <em>O\u2019Connor v Sill, </em>60 Mich 175, 181; 27 NW 13; 28 NW 162 (1886) (\"The article . . . must all be read together. Parts of it cannot be severed . . .\u201d). Read as a whole, the article conveyed the impression that there was overwhelming evidence and that judicial proceedings had been instituted against Rouch. The effect of this on the mind of the reader is different from that of a mere \"apprehension.\u201d <em>Rouch I, </em>427 Mich 172. The \"sting\u201d that results from this impression of formal charges created a substantially different effect on the mind of the reader. The evidence demonstrated, and the jury obviously found, that the article as a whole conveyed an impression quite different from that which the actual truth would have produced.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>The plain language <em>and </em>clear implication of the <em>Enquirer </em>article are that there was more than a simple accusation against plaintiff The article says twice that plaintiff was charged with a sex crime, and the final paragraph says that the prosecutor\u2019s office authorized the charge. The prosecutor, as is <em>commonly known </em>and as noted by the trial judge, does not just accuse; the prosecutor authorizes formal criminal proceedings, and that is exactly what the article says happened. There can be no doubt that both the details as reported and the gist of the article say that plaintiff was formally charged with a serious crime, not that there was merely an accusation of wrongdoing.

The article said that Rouch had been \"arrested and charged,\u201d and that \"[t]he charge against Rouch was authorized Friday by the Calhoun County Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Arrests are often made by police officers without prior authorization from the prosecutor. The import therefore of a news article describing an arrest merely as a \"charge\u201d is significantly different than the import of an article stating that a person has been \"arrested and charged\u201d and that the \"charge\u201d \"was authorized\u201d by the prosecutor. In stating that Rouch had been arrested and charged, and that the charge was authorized by the prosecutor, the news article implied that the governmental official responsible for the administration of justice had concluded that Rouch should be arrested and charged. This suggests more than an ordinary arrest by a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The majority dwells at length on the meaning of \"charge.\u201d The sentence stating that the charge \"was authorized\u201d by the prosecutor significantly changed the import and sting of the article. As stated by the Chief Justice, the article read as a whole conveyed \"the impression that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>overwhelming evidence and that judicial proceedings had been instituted against Rouch.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ags\">Rouch was arrested and detained at 5:25 a.m. by police officers without prior authorization by the prosecutor.

The Court of Appeals, on consideration of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Palenkas v Beaumont Hosp, </em>432 Mich 527; 443 NW2d 354 (1989), concluded that the judge did not err in denying a remittitur.

Under this analysis, if the gist, or sting, of the article is substantially true, the falsity test is not met. The earlier Supreme Court opinion in this case specifically rejected this approach: \"[W]e decline to distinguish, as did the Court of Appeals, the essence of the article from its supporting facts or details.\u201d 427 Mich 204. [184 Mich App 31-32.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">This Court in its earlier <em>Rouch </em>opinion, however, did not even address the issue of material falsity. The language quoted by the Court of Appeals is taken out of context. In the quoted passage, this Court was discussing whether the article constituted speech of public concern, not whether the falsity must be a material one. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals applied the test for material falsity and concluded that the plaintiff should prevail under either test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">[W]hether the article is read for its gist or simply for the information presented as fact, plaintiff has met his burden of proving falsity. <em>[Id. </em>at 32.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Accordingly, this error by the Court of Appeals does not require reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\"> The trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">Secondly, that statements in the article were false.
