The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court, rejecting its conclusion that the facts presented no cognizable claim for nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">We are persuaded that the boundaries of a traditional nuisance claim should not be relaxed to permit recovery on these facts. Compensation for a decline in property value caused by unfounded perception of underground contamination is inextricably entwined with complex policy questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>regarding environmental protection that are more suitably resolved through the legislative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, reinstate the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of defendants, and remand to the trial court for a continuation of proceedings as to the remaining plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">In 1984, the plaintiffs sued the Thomas Solvent Company in the Calhoun Circuit Court for damages and injunctive relief from injuries allegedly resulting from the improper handling of chemicals and industrial waste. Claiming that the Thomas Solvent Company\u2019s and other defendants\u2019 improper handling and storage of toxic chemicals and industrial waste had contaminated the ground water, the plaintiffs brought claims sounding in negligence, continuing nuisance, continuing trespass, strict liability, and ultrahazardous activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Originally, approximately fifty plaintiffs brought suit against the Thomas Solvent defendants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Grand Trunk Railroad defendants,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wesley E. Carter, a private individual doing business as Ray<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>mond Road Landfill and O.K. Wrecking Company, and Hannah\u2019s Cement Products, Inc., the lessor of the land used as Raymond Road Landfill. The plaintiffs claimed that toxic chemicals and industrial wastes were released accidentally or intentionally at sites owned by the defendants. The plaintiffs complained of contaminants emanating from two sites owned or operated by the Thomas Solvent defendants. The plaintiffs alleged that contamination issued from a facility on Raymond Road which included an office building, a warehouse, a dock for storing drums, and twenty-one underground bulk storage tanks. In addition, the plaintiffs complained that contamination stemmed from a facility on Emmett Street, which the Thomas Solvent defendants allegedly leased from Grand Trunk Western Railroad. The Emmett Street facility included two underground bulk storage tanks, one aboveground tank, and a loading dock adjacent to a railroad spur. The plaintiffs also complained that contamination originated at the Raymond Road Landfill.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In 1985, the complaint was amended and approximately nineteen plaintiffs were added. Discovery continued, and various motions for summary disposition were brought as the parties and the court sought to sharpen and narrow the issues. As discovery continued, it became clear that contaminants allegedly discharged into the ground water by the defendants never reached these plaintiffs\u2019 property. The plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Yaron Sternberg, concluded that a ground water divide separated the flow of ground water in the area, with water on the north side of the divide flowing generally north or northwesterly and the water on the south side of the divide flowing in a westerly direction. He testified that no contaminants from the Thomas Solvent facilities had any effect on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>properties of these plaintiffs, which were located south of the divide.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">This appeal involves the claims of twenty-two plaintiffs who live over 2000 feet south and east from the Thomas Solvent facilities and whose claims were eventually dismissed by the trial court. The Grand Trunk Railroad defendants filed a motion for summary disposition, seeking to dismiss the claims of those plaintiffs whose property was not affected by the contaminants allegedly released by Grand Trunk. The Thomas Solvent defendants joined in the motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs filed a responsive brief and stipulated that the claims of these twenty-two litigants be dismissed except to the extent that they claimed damages for property depreciation. On June 16, 1987, the trial court heard oral arguments on the motion. The plaintiffs argued that a tortious event and a range of damages occurred when toxic substances left the defendants\u2019 property. They conceded that no contaminants ever reached these twenty-two plaintiffs\u2019 property, but urged the court to impose liability on the defendants for any loss in property values due to public concern about the contaminants in the general area. Concluding that any damages that these plaintiffs suffered resulted from unfounded public perception that their ground water was contaminated, the trial court dismissed their claims. On June 29, 1987, an order was entered, dismissing the property depreciation claims of these twenty-two plaintiffs against the Thomas Solvent defendants and concluding that no reason existed for delay and that a final judgment should enter in favor of the Thomas Solvent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>defendants. The plaintiffs moved for reconsideration and to amend their complaint to add claims regarding contamination of municipal well'water. The trial court denied these motions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The plaintiffs claimed an appeal as of right from the trial court\u2019s summary disposition order. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s order and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. Recognizing that no contamination had reached or would reach the well water of the plaintiffs, the Court of Appeals nevertheless concluded that the trial court had erred in finding that the plaintiffs had not shown some damage \"and in summarily dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claims merely because the ground water beneath their properties had not been contaminated.\u201d 184 Mich App 693, 696; 459 NW2d 22 (1990). Emphasizing that to recover damages for nuisance, a litigant need not show physical intrusion onto the land, and distinguishing nuisance from trespass, the Court of Appeals relied on this Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Whittemore v Baxter Laundry Co, </em>181 Mich 564; 148 NW 437 (1914), and <em>Hadfield v Oakland Co Drain Comm\u2019r, </em>430 Mich 139, 151; 422 NW2d 205 (1988), citing Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 87, p 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">This Court granted the defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal to consider whether the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>of Appeals erred when it reversed the trial court\u2019s summary disposition order. 437 Mich 929 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10). The parties had agreed, both in a stipulation filed with the court and during oral argument on the motion, that no ground water contamination from the defendants\u2019 property ever reached the plaintiffs\u2019 property because of a ground water divide which acted as a hydrogeological barrier that precluded the possibility of migration of any contaminants from defendants\u2019 property. The trial court concluded that the defendants would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>General Motors Corp v Detroit, </em>372 Mich 234; 126 NW2d 108 (1964), cert den 377 US 977 (1964). For a summary disposition to be upheld on appeal, the Court must review the record to ascertain whether the defendants would have been entitled to the judgment as a matter of law. <em>American Employers\u2019 Ins Co v Christman &amp; Bros Co, </em>284 Mich 36; 278 NW 750 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The Court of Appeals held that because a physical intrusion or physical effect is not required to sustain a claim for nuisance, the trial court erred in dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. For the reasons that follow, we find that the trial court did not err in dismissing the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Historically, Michigan has recognized two distinct versions of nuisance, public nuisance and private nuisance. <em>Had\u00f1eld, supra, </em>p 205. A private nuisance is a nontrespassory invasion of another\u2019s interest in the private use and enjoyment of land. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>4 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 821D, p 100. It evolved as a doctrine to resolve conflicts between neighboring land uses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because nuisance covers so many types of harm, it is difficult to articulate an encompassing definition. Imprecision in defining nuisance leads to confusion regarding the interest it is designed to protect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the gist of a private nuisance action is an interference with the occupation or use of land or an interference with servitudes relating to land.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There are countless ways to interfere with the use and enjoyment of land including interference with the physical condition of the land itself, disturbance in the comfort or conveniences of the occupant including his peace of mind, and threat of future injury that is a present menace and interference with enjoyment. The essence of private nuisance is the protection of a property owner\u2019s or occupier\u2019s reasonable comfort in occupation of the land in question. Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>supra, </em>p 619. It involves \"not only a defect, but threatening or impending danger ... to the property rights or health of persons sustaining peculiar relations to the same . . . .\u201d <em>Kilts v Kent Co Supervisors, </em>162 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Mich 646, 651; 127 NW 821 (1910).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The pollution of ground water may constitute a public or private nuisance. 4 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 832, p 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">According to the Restatement, an actor is subject to liability for private nuisance for a nontrespassory invasion of another\u2019s interest in the private use and enjoyment of land if (a) the other has property rights and privileges in respect to the use or enjoyment interfered with, (b) the invasion results in significant harm (c) the actor\u2019s conduct is the legal cause of the invasion, and (d) the invasion is either (i) intentional and unreasonable, or (ii) unintentional and otherwise actionable under the rules governing liability for negligent, reckless, or ultrahazardous conduct. 4 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7\u00a7 821D-F, 822, pp 100-115.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Prosser &amp; Keeton\u2019s enumeration of the requirements to recover on a private nuisance theory is similar. They set forth the following requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">(1) The defendant acted with the intent of interfering with the use and enjoyment of the land by those entitled to that use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">(2) There was some interference with the use and enjoyment of the land of the kind intended, although the amount and extent of that interference may not have been anticipated or intended;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">(3) The interference that resulted and the physical harm, if any, from that interference proved to be substantial. It is this requirement and the next that is most important in distinguishing between trespassory-type invasions from those that are actionable on a nuisance theory. Any intentional and unprivileged entry on land is a trespass without a showing of damage, since those who own land have an exclusive right to its use; but an act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>that interferes with use but is not in itself a use is not actionable without damage. The substantial interference requirement is to satisfy the need for a showing that the land is reduced in value because of the defendant\u2019s conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">(4) The interference that came about under such circumstances was of such a nature, duration or amount as to constitute unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the land. This does not mean that the defendant\u2019s conduct must be unreasonable. It only means that the interference must be unreasonable and this requires elaboration.<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> [Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>supra, </em>pp 622-623.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Once these general definitions have been stated, application to any given set of facts is, nevertheless, problematic. Despite almost a century during which this Court has repeatedly recognized the difficulty in defining the concept of nuisance,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Michigan jurisprudence has focused on delineating the contours of various defenses, but has seldom elaborated the elements and proofs necessary to sustain a claim in nuisance, absent special defenses. In this case, the Court considers whether property depreciation based on unfounded fears falls within the boundaries of an action for private nuisance in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants\u2019 improper handling and storage of toxic chemicals and hazardous waste contaminated underground water in the area, thus supporting their recovery of money damages for nuisance. Although the plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint failed to specify whether their claims were founded on public or private nuisance, the parties have argued, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>case was considered in the lower courts pursuant to, a theory of private nuisance.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The Court of Appeals focused upon the lack of any physical intrusion onto plaintiffs\u2019 land, stressing that an interference with the use and enjoyment of land need not involve a physical or tangible intrusion. We do not disagree with this rule of law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we conclude that the trial court properly found that the plaintiffs failed to trace any significant interference with the use and enjoyment of land to an action of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The crux of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is that publicity concerning the contamination of ground water in the area (although concededly not their ground water) caused diminution in the value of the plaintiffs\u2019 property. This theory cannot form the basis for recovery because negative publicity resulting in unfounded fear about dangers in the vicinity of the property does not constitute a significant interference with the use and enjoyment of land.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Examination of the historic development of nuisance law helps to clarify the fallacy underlying plaintiffs\u2019 theory of recovery. Initially, the assize of novel disseisin was available for a complainant whose enjoyment of his free tenement was disturbed by the defendant. The tort of trespass later developed to remedy this situation in which the defendant interfered with the complainant\u2019s interest in land. The source of the injury was always on the complainant\u2019s land.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Later, the assize of nuisance arose to redress injury due to an act of the defendant that interfered with the complainant\u2019s interest, although the injury did not involve an entry onto the complainant\u2019s land.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Eventually, the action for trespass upon the case for nuisance developed. The appeal of this form of action was its remedy, damages, rather than abatement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The doctrine of nuisance traditionally encompassed geographic, temporal, and proprietary aspects. In geographic terms, nuisance arose when occupants of neighboring land had a dispute, typically over the proper use of the defendant\u2019s land.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>This Court articulated a geographic component to liability for nuisance in <em>Kilts, supra, </em>p 650. The <em>Kilts </em>Court differentiated between a weak structure on a private person\u2019s land \"so far from the street and other\u2019s property\u201d that it would not constitute a nuisance and a structure that \"was adjacent to an adjoining proprietor\u2019s land so that it was a menace to his property, or to his person in the use of his land . . . .\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In temporal terms, nuisance normally required some degree of permanence. If the asserted interference was \"temporary and evanescent,\u201d there was no actionable nuisance.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This requirement is normally subsumed in the question whether the interference with the use and enjoyment of property is substantial. In proprietary terms, nuisance required that the plaintiff have some interest in the land that was interfered with. Unlike the early assize of novel disseisin, nuisance did not limit suit to freeholders, but permitted lessees and then occupants to sue.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">As the doctrine of trespass was gradually transmuted into the action upon the case for nuisance, the requirement that the injury involve entry onto the complainant\u2019s land was eliminated.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> To limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the broader action on the case for nuisance, courts added the requirement that a litigant seeking to recover for nuisance must show a legally cognizable injury, requiring proof of a significant interference with the use and enjoyment of land.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Although much confusion has arisen because of the failure to discern that injury and damage are different concepts, an interference that is not substantial and unreasonable does not give rise to an action for damages against the person causing it, damnum absque injuria.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Stated otherwise, while nuisance may be predicated on conduct of a defendant that causes mental annoyance, it will not amount to a substantial injury unless the annoyance is significant and the interference is unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>sonable in the sense that it would be unreasonable to p\u00e9rmit the defendant to cause such an amount of harm without paying for it.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Nuisance on the case thus involved the common law\u2019s attempt to ensure accommodation between conflicting uses of adjoining property. An early opinion from this Court explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">As a rule, the owner may make such use of his premises as his business or taste may dictate, and the only limitation upon his right is that he must so use his property as not to cause injury to the property or rights of those owning property in the vicinity. <em>[McMorran v Fitzgerald, </em>106 Mich 649, 652; 64 NW 569 (1895).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Because the doctrine sought to acknowledge the right of both the property owner to carry out a particular use and the neighbor whose property or use and enjoyment of property might be injured by the use, de minimus annoyances were not actionable. Only for a substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of property would an action lie. As a part of this scheme, courts frequently concluded that diminution in property values alone constitutes damnum absque injuria.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AUS\">The reasoning in <em>Gunther v E I DuPont de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>Nemours &amp; Co, </em>157 F Supp 25 (ND W Va, 1957), app dis 255 F2d 710 (CA 4, 1958), exemplifies this reluctance to find a nuisance for mere diminution of property value on the basis of unfounded beliefs or fear of injury. In <em>Gunther, </em>the plaintiffs unsuccessfully sought damages and injunctive relief for claimed injuries to their property and person from test explosions conducted by the defendant in the vicinity of their property. The court refused to find nuisance, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">The Court believes it a fair inference from the evidence that the Gunthers\u2019 enjoyment of their property was lessened because <em>they believed </em>that the test blasting had injured them. If such belief is unfounded, what is left other than depreciation in value? Mere diminution of the value of property because of the use to which adjoining or nearby premises is devoted, if unaccompanied with other ill results, is <em>damnum absque injuria </em>\u2014 a loss without injury, in the legal sense. <em>[Id., </em>p 33. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">That same reasoning applies to this case. Plaintiffs have stipulated the dismissal of all claims except those predicated upon an alleged depreciation in the market value of the property because of the unfounded fears of purchasers. The fact, as the dissent recognizes, that plaintiffs make no claim for \"relief arising out of their own 'fears,\u2019 \u201d <em>post, </em>p 362, illustrates the point that defendants\u2019 activities have not interfered with their use and enjoyment of property.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">This Court has held that property depreciation alone is insufficient to constitute a nuisance. <em>Plassey v S Loewenstein &amp; Son, </em>330 Mich 525, 530; 48 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>NW2d 126 (1951); <em>Warren Twp School Dist v Detroit, </em>308 Mich 460, 469-470; 14 NW2d 134 (1944); <em>Garfield Twp v Young, </em>348 Mich 337; 82 NW2d 876 (1957). Although there is early authority to the contrary involving circumstances largely subsumed in zoning regulations,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> most recently this Court has held that a cause of action for nuisance may not be based on unfounded fears.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>Smith v Western Wayne Co Conservation Ass'n </em>380 Mich 526, 543; 158 NW2d 463 (1968). In <em>Smith, </em>the plaintiffs sought to have a gun range declared a nuisance, contending that it created fear of injuries, thus decreasing their property values. Adopting the trial court\u2019s opinion that \"no real or actual danger\u201d existed from the use of the gun range, the Court further held that, even assuming a decrease in property values, this was not \"in itself sufficient to constitute a nuisance.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 542-543.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Just as the development of nuisance on the case responded to the limitations of trespass by recognizing a cause of action when there was damage, but not injury amounting to use, the modern formulation of nuisance in fact, acknowledges changing conditions by declining to recognize a cause of action where damage and injury are both predicated on unfounded fear of third parties that depreciates property values. The rationale may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>expressed by observing that reasonable minds cannot differ that diminished property value based on unfounded fear is not a substantial interference in and of itself. Thus, in rejecting a claim that tort liability could be based on the creation of fear that depreciates property values, one federal district court observed that the theory was based on \"a public reaction which is conjectural, transitory and ephemeral.\u201d <em>Good Fund, Ltd </em>\u2014 1972 <em>v Church, </em>540 F Supp 519, 534 (D Colo, 1982), rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom <em>McKay v United States, </em>703 F2d 464 (CA 10, 1983).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">This response also corresponds with the historical premise underlying tort liability for nuisance in fact, i.e., that when some significant interference with the use and enjoyment of land causes the property value loss, courts of law accommodate conflicting interests by recognizing claims designed to shift the loss.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> However, on the present state of the record, plaintiffs do not contend that the condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>tion created by the defendant causes them fear or anxiety. Thus, not only have these plaintiffs not alleged significant interference with their use and enjoyment of property, they do not here posit any interference at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Plaintiffs correctly observe that property depreciation is a traditional element of damages in a nuisance action. See, e.g., Prosser, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 89, pp 637-640. We are not persuaded, however, and the dissent has not cited authority to the contrary, that an allegation of property depreciation alone sets forth a cognizable claim in private nuisance of significant interference with the use and enjoyment of a person\u2019s property. Diminution in property values caused by negative publicity is, on these facts, damnum absque injuria \u2014 a loss without an injury in the legal sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s observation, neither <em>Garfield Twp, Smith, Plassey, </em>nor <em>Warren Twp School Dist </em>stand for the proposition that plaintiffs in this case have a cognizable claim of nuisance. Defendant\u2019s business is a lawful business, and the fact that violations of the law may have occurred on the property does not make the conduct of the business a nuisance in fact. Indeed, <em>Garfield Twp </em>rejects the precise argument upon which the dissent relies.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Nor can we accept the dissent\u2019s suggestion that because some authorities relied on here involve claims for equitable relief, they do not support a damage award in this case. We agree that different considerations apply to the remedies appropriate, and that injunctive relief is sometimes available when a tort is merely threatened or denied on the basis that damage is the more appropriate relief. In both law and equity, however, there must be a cognizable claim of a substantive interest invaded or threatened. Thus the dissent misperceives the use of authority holding that equitable relief is not available to address unfounded fears. Our point is that unfounded fears cannot constitute an allegation of a nuisance in fact with regard to these plaintiffs.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">We are thus unpersuaded by the dissent\u2019s attempt to avoid the stipulation of the parties by referring throughout the opinion to facts and counts that are not before us. Nor do we find convincing the dissent\u2019s disparagement of the 600-year provenance of the concept of damage without injury, or the assertion that the assumption on which we proceed \u201cpresents an abstract, desiccated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>question of law . . . <em>(Post, </em>p 328.) Unlike the dissent, we proceed on the assumption the parties presented to us. We do not know why counsel chose not to assert claims of personal discomfort or annoyance as he did with regard to other plaintiffs, or to appeal from the trial court\u2019s order denying leave to amend. These were probably strategy decisions based on his clients\u2019 responses in discovery. We are entitled to assume that counsel\u2019s present posture is motivated by legitimate interest in securing an appellate court decision that diminution in value is recoverable without a showing of substantial interference with use or enjoyment of property. In that event, these plaintiffs could become judgment creditors in the bankruptcy action. So viewed, the structuring of this lawsuit involves not a hypertechnical issue, but an issue of considerable significance to these plaintiffs, to litigants similarly situated, and to the jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In short, we do not agree with the dissent\u2019s suggestion that wholly unfounded fears of third parties regarding the conduct of a lawful business satisfy the requirement for a legally cognizable injury as long as property values decline. Indeed, we would think it not only \"odd\u201d (Levin, J., <em>post, </em>p 349), but anachronistic that a claim of nuisance in fact could be based on unfounded fears regarding persons with aids moving into a neighborhood, the establishment of otherwise lawful group homes for the disabled, or unrelated persons living together,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> merely because the fears experienced by third parties would cause a decline in property values.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>When appropriate, we have not hesitated to examine common-law doctrines in view of changes in society\u2019s mores, institutions, and problems, and to alter those doctrines where necessary. <em>Myers v Genesee Co Auditor, </em>375 Mich 1, 7; 133 NW2d 190 (1965); <em>Gruskin v Fisher, </em>405 Mich 54, 58; 273 NW2d 893 (1979); <em>Placek v Sterling Heights, </em>405 Mich 638, 656-657; 275 NW2d 511 (1979); <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672, 722-723; 299 NW2d 304 (1980); <em>Falcon v Memorial Hosp, </em>436 Mich 443, 472-473; 462 NW2d 44 (1990).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> In a given case, the dangers posed by environmental contamination may not be adequately addressed by statutorily created private actions or by traditional rules adopted prior to the existence of these problems.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This case does not present that situation.

After defendants moved for summary disposition against any claims by plaintiffs who failed to show that their properties or persons were contaminated by exposure to chemicals emanating from the defendants, counsel stipulated to dismiss all claims of this group of plaintiffs except those based upon property depreciation. Thus, we are not presented with plaintiffs who allege an increased risk of illness, threat to safety, or lack of a habitable dwelling caused by contaminants released by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The plaintiffs concede that a ground water divide prevented the migration of contaminated water to their property. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs seek to recover for damages because the defendants allegedly contaminated property in the general area. Under such a theory, a cause of action could be stated on behalf of any individual who could demonstrate an effect on property values even if the polluted ground water had neither strayed from defendants\u2019 own property, nor disturbed a plaintiff\u2019s enjoyment by the fear that it would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">If any property owner in the vicinity of the numerous hazardous waste sites that have been identified<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> can advance a claim seeking damages when unfounded public fears of exposure cause property depreciation, the ultimate effect might be a reordering of a polluter\u2019s resources for the benefit of persons who have suffered no cognizable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>harm at the expense of those claimants who have been subjected to a substantial and unreasonable interference in the use and enjoyment of property.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Thus, while we acknowledge that the line drawn today is not necessarily dictated by the spectral permutations of nuisance jurisprudence, if the line is to be drawn elsewhere, the significant interests involved appear to be within the realm of those more appropriate for resolution by the Legislature.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Crampton &amp; Boyer, <em>Citizen suits in the environmental held: Peril or promise?, </em>2 Ecol L Q 407, 412 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that the Court of Appeals erred when it reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of the defendants\u2019 summary disposition motion.

The Restatement does not suggest that absent an interference with the use and enjoyment of land, the deaf person could recover on the basis that hearing persons would not pay as much for his house. That is the appropriate analogy to the facts of this case. Likewise, according to the Restatement, a cognizable claim of nuisance will lie where conduct is otherwise actionable under the rules governing liability for negligent, reckless, or ultrahazardous conduct, <em>provided </em>there is a nontrespassory invasion of another\u2019s interest in the use and enjoyment of land. <em>(Post, </em>\u00a7 in, pp 341-343.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\"> McRae, <em>The development of nuisance in the early common law, </em>1 U Fla L R 27, 29-30 (1948).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\"> Winfield, <em>Nuisance as a tort, </em>n 7 <em>supra, </em>pp 190-191.

See, e.g., <em>Am-land Properties Corp v ALCOA, </em>711 F Supp 784; 29 ERC 1538 (D NJ, 1989).

There, the Court concluded that a railroad\u2019s use of a public highway to lay railroad tracks could not be deemed a nuisance with respect to the litigant until the use of the street unreasonably interfered with his property. The Court noted that a lot owner with proprietary rights in the street might sue for the wrongful encumbrance upon his property and recover for diminished market value or decreased rental value. However, because this litigant lacked proprietary rights in the street, the Court concluded that \"diminution . . . occasioned by the placing of the track in the street\u201d was damnum absque injuria with regard to him until the railroad\u2019s use of the tracks resulted in unnecessary noise or other legal grievance affecting his property. <em>Id., </em>p 71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\"> Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 88, p 626.

Plaintiffs, a group of Battle Creek homeowners, claim that the Thomas Solvent defendants contaminated soil and ground water in the vicinity of their homes through negligent or intentional discharge of toxic chemicals and industrial wastes. The contamination has not reached and will not reach plaintiffs\u2019 land. Plaintiffs nevertheless claim that the contamination of neighboring land has adversely affected the value of their homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The majority holds, as a matter of law, that because \"diminution in property values alone constitutes damnum \u00e1bsque injuria,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the instant plaintiffs, whose land was not contaminated, do not seek to recover damages other than for a reduction in the market value of their homes, plaintiffs may not maintain a nuisance action.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Plaintiffs should, in our opinion, be allowed to recover damages in nuisance on proofs introduced at a trial tending to show that the defendants actually contaminated soil and ground water in the neighborhood of plaintiffs\u2019 homes with toxic chemicals and industrial wastes, that the market perception of the value of plaintiffs\u2019 homes was actually adversely affected by the contamination of the neighborhood, and thus that plaintiffs\u2019 loss was causally related to defendants\u2019 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Preservation of property value is, in itself, a legally cognizable interest in this setting, whether any structure on the land is a home or rental<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or other commercial or industrial property.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">A condition, tortiously or intentionally created or maintained on neighboring property, that is a substantial and unreasonable nontrespassory interference with the use and enjoyment of property, may constitute a nuisance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such a condition may cause personal injury, property damage, or a reduction in the market value of property. The condition may be reflected in a reduction of the market value of a home although no personal injury or other property damage is suffered by the homeowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">We would hold that a homeowner may maintain a nuisance action to recover damages for a decline in the market value of his home that reflects interference with the use and enjoyment of his home by a condition tortiously created or maintained by the defendant on neighboring property, and that the homeowner may do so without demonstrating interference with use or enjoyment that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>might result in further, separately compensable injuries to persons or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The majority asserts, factually, that \"unfounded fears of third parties,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rather than the conduct of defendants, were responsible for any reduction in the value of plaintiffs\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In finding as a fact, without a trial on the merits, that any decline in the value of plaintiffs\u2019 homes was attributable to unfounded fears, the majority proceeds on the assumption \u2014 without requiring defendants to evidentially support, or providing plaintiffs an opportunity to evidentially refute that assumption \u2014 that none of the reduction in value was attributable to well-founded concern about contamination by the defendants of soil and water supply in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">It appears \u2014 contrary to the majority\u2019s \"unfounded\u201d fear characterization \u2014 that the claimed reduction in the value of plaintiffs\u2019 homes was attributable <em>both </em>to factually well-founded concern about contamination of the soil and water supply in the neighborhood, and unfounded concern of soil and water supply contamination respecting plaintiffs\u2019 homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">If the majority were to allow plaintiff homeowners their day in court, plaintiffs might establish that the claimed decline in the value of their homes was in fact partly attributable to well-founded concern of potential buyers about contamination of soil and water supply in the neighborhood, although also in part attributable to unfounded concern about contamination of the soil and water supply for plaintiffs\u2019 homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Even if potential buyers were to be made aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>that the soil and water supply for plaintiffs\u2019 homes is not contaminated, and thus were unfettered by \"unfounded fear,\u201d they nonetheless would pay no more for plaintiffs\u2019 homes than the claimed reduced market value. Thus, to the extent that the value of plaintiffs\u2019 homes has declined because of well-founded concern about the contamination of soil and ground water in the neighborhood, educating potential buyers that plaintiffs\u2019 homes are not in fact contaminated would not necessarily rectify damage suffered by plaintiffs because of the contamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">At a trial, defendants would have an opportunity to show, if they can, that any decline in the market value was temporary, and that fully informed buyers later offered to pay prices for plaintiffs\u2019 homes that fully rectified any decline in the market value attributable to well-founded concerns that defendants had contaminated soil and ground water in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">This does not appear to be a case where the plaintiffs seek to recover damages for a decline in value that is attributable to mass hysteria without any unlawful or tortious misconduct on the part of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The plaintiffs seek only an opportunity to produce evidence in a court of law tending to show that the negligence or intentional misconduct of the Thomas Solvent defendants did in fact contaminate soil and ground water in the neighborhood and caused plaintiffs economic loss in the form of a decline in the market value of their homes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The general rule is that where there are multiple causes \u2014 here, well-founded fears concerning contamination of soil and water supply in the neighborhood and unfounded fears that soil and water supply for plaintiffs\u2019 homes were contaminated \u2014 the tortfeasor is subject to liability as long as his misconduct is a cause of the decline in market value; it need not be the sole cause of plaintiffs\u2019 loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">It would be to announce an essentially , unprecedented but nevertheless somewhat trendy exception<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to this general rule for this Court to direct that in a nuisance action a jury should apportion damages on the basis of the jury\u2019s assessment of the proportions of plaintiffs\u2019 loss attributable to well-founded and unfounded perceptions of contamination. But the majority does not even allow the plaintiffs that much.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The Thomas Solvent defendants<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> owned or operated two sites in Battle Creek where toxic chemicals and industrial wastes were stored.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>claim that in late 1981 public health officials detected contamination of Battle Creek Municipal water supply wells by toxic chemicals and industrial waste. Similar contaminants were found in private residential wells in the vicinity of defendants\u2019 facilities, all involving the same aquifer system.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">It does not appear on the record by what means this news was disseminated, whether plaintiffs were told by governmental agencies not to drink well water, or whether plaintiffs were supplied with or obtained bottled water. Plaintiffs argue in this Court that \"the neighborhood was told not to drink their water, and bottled water was supplied by government agencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">During the course of discovery, it became apparent that the property of the twenty-two plaintiffs who are parties to this appeal had not been and never would be contaminated by any toxic substances migrating from defendants\u2019 facilities. A feature of the underground landscape known as a hydrogeological divide prevented ground water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>flowing from the direction of defendants\u2019 property from reaching the property of these plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The Thomas Solvent defendants, claiming that there was no genuine issue of material fact, moved for summary disposition with respect to all claims of the instant plaintiffs, whose properties are located over 2,000 feet south and. east of the Thomas Solvent facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Plaintiffs stipulated to dismissal of their claims against defendants except to the extent that plaintiffs claimed damages for reduction in the market value of their homes. Defendants\u2019 brief asserts that, by entering into the stipulation, plaintiffs have \"abandoned any claims for loss of use and enjoyment of their property,\u201d including any right to rely on allegations of altered conduct in response to the publicized contamination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The circuit court concluded that any reduction in value should be attributed to unfounded public perception of contamination, and not to the claimed conduct of defendants, and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims against the Thomas Solvent defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for trial, stating that \"[pjlaintiffs are not precluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>from bringing a nuisance cause of action, even assuming that their only damages are a decrease in property values.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The majority acknowledges that \"property depreciation is a traditional element of damages in a nuisance action.\u201d The majority asserts, however, that \"an allegation of property depreciation alone\u201d does not set forth \"a cognizable claim in private nuisance of significant interference with the use and enjoyment of a person\u2019s property.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The majority continues that \"[diminution in property values caused by negative publicity is, on these facts, damnum absque injuria \u2014 a loss without an injury in the legal sense.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">In stating that the \"issue [is] whether plaintiffs may proceed with their nuisance in fact claims <em>solely </em>on the basis of property depreciation due to public concern about contaminants in the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>area,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the majority proceeds on the assumption that this case presents an abstract, desiccated question of law, divorced from actual conditions that may face residents and prospective residents of plaintiffs\u2019 neighborhood. This approach likens the instant plaintiffs\u2019 claims to the effect of a psychical neutron bomb, that deleteriously affects life in the neighborhood while leaving the physical condition of the property itself eerily untouched.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">There is no basis in the record for assuming, without factual support, that the only change caused to plaintiffs\u2019 neighborhood by the contamination of property in the area is an attitudinal shift in the community or a statistical shift in the value of homes and other property in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Were this case to be remanded for trial, it might appear \u2014 indeed, it seems far more probable that it would appear \u2014 that the character of the neighborhood has changed for the worse. If, as plaintiffs have alleged, the conduct of defendants contaminated soil and ground water in the neighborhood with toxic chemicals and industrial wastes, efforts to \"mop up\u201d the contamination might be of limited efficacy, resulting in an unusual number of abandoned, neglected, and otherwise depressed properties in the neighborhood, with inimical effect on the market value of all property in the vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">An award of damages for a <em>reduction in the value of uncontaminated land </em>was affirmed in <em>Exxon Corp v Yarema, </em>69 Md App 124; 516 A2d 990 (1986). Exxon operated a service station with leaking underground gasoline storage tanks. Contamination reached property owned by <em>some but </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number><em>not all the plaintiffs. </em>The court held that no rule of law prevented an award of damages simply because there was \"no tangible or physical impact on plaintiff\u2019s property\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATo\">According to the general view, there must be a substantial interference with the plaintiff\u2019s reasonable use and enjoyment of its property. We believe that our conclusion does not violate the established rule that the mere diminution of property value, <em>absent such tortious </em>interference, is not sufficient basis for recovery.<footnotemark>[15]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The plaintiffs, here as in <em>Exxon, </em>complain of \"tortious interference.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The Maryland appellate court explained that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>holding \"does not mean that plaintiffs may recover for diminution of property value without proof of harm to their property but rather that <em>harm to property should be construed broadly to include intangible tortious </em>interferences\u201d with the use and enjoyment thereof.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">Exxon has interfered with [the plaintiffs\u2019] use and enjoyment of their land. <em>Gasoline contamination of ground water imposed crippling restrictions not only on the contaminated land but on all the property adjacent to that land. </em>The Baltimore County Health Department forbade plaintiffs from using their ground water, building houses on their land or selling the land even at a reduced price. <em>These are injuries for which the plaintiffs are entitled to recover if the jury believed that they were caused by Exxon\u2019s tortious interference with their property rights. </em>The fact that the reputation of the plaintiffs\u2019 land is inextricably interwoven in the assessment of damages is not reason to avoid an award.<footnotemark>[18]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\"><em>The instant plaintiffs similarly allege that they were told not to drink their well water and were unable to sell their property </em>after adverse information was disseminated through governmental agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Plaintiffs do not allege that the sale of their property was prohibited outright. Were this case remanded for trial, however, plaintiffs might be able to show that they have been unable to sell their property at any but a significantly reduced, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>or a ruinously low, price.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \"These are injuries for which the plaintiffs are entitled to recover if the jury believe[s] that they were caused by [the defendant\u2019s] tortious interference with their property rights.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The majority distinguishes <em>Exxon </em>on the ground that the instant case presents \"no claim of contaminated well water or the preclusion of sale. This case comes to us <em>singularly </em>on the issue whether plaintiffs may proceed with their nuisance in fact claims <em>solely </em>on the basis of property depreciation due to public concern about contaminants in the general area.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The majority misapprehends plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claim for relief as a bare assertion that popular fears of contamination should subject defendants to liability for property depreciation. The complaint sought compensation for personal injury and property damage.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 <em>factual allegations </em>are broader, than their remaining <em>claim </em>for a specific element of damages. They have alleged a range of facts amounting to an interference with interests in the use and enjoyment of property beyond \"mere\u201d reduction in the market value of their homes.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Such indicia of interference with use and enjoyment remain relevant to the question whether property depreciation was caused by defendants\u2019 conduct, and to the broader question whether defendants\u2019 conduct substantially interfered with plaintiffs\u2019 interests in the use and enjoyment of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Although plaintiffs have stipulated to relinquish the right to seek damages for interference with their use and enjoyment of property in forms distinct from depreciation, the disposition of this case should not depend on whether they so stipulated rather than continuing to insist on seeking to recover damages for personal injury as well as for a decline in market value. To rely on plaintiffs\u2019 decision not further to seek damages for personal injury, a narrow point without legal foundation until today\u2019s decision, reduces the jurisprudential significance of this case to a hypertechnicality, and encourages parties generally to give no quarter in litigation, lest the trial or an appellate court find against the stipulating party on a hypertechnicality.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">According to the majority, \"[t]his Court has held that property depreciation alone is insufficient to constitute a nuisance.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The majority relies largely on decisions of this Court denying <em>injunctive relief </em>to plaintiffs who claimed that the establishment or maintenance of a business would constitute a nuisance.

In declining to enjoin condemnation to preclude potential damage to the plaintiffs\u2019 property, the Court said that the plaintiffs <em>would have </em>a cause of action for damages \"if conditions they now claim are threatened should hereafter arise.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In <em>Plassey, </em>the Court reaffirmed the rule that equity \" 'will not interfere <em>in advance of the creation of a nuisance </em>where the <em>injury is doubtful or contingent, </em>and anticipated merely from the use to which the property is to be put.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>complained of in the instant case \u2014 intentional, negligent, or accidental discharge of toxic chemicals and industrial wastes \u2014 was not, in contrast with the slaughterhouse and rendering plant at issue in <em>Plassey, </em>a \"lawful business\u201d free from violations of \"applicable law.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Decisions denying injunctive relief in nuisance cases do not necessarily justify dismissal of an action for damages, because a judgment denying injunctive relief may turn on application of rules relating to equitable remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The usual rule of equity applies to the instant plaintiffs\u2019 claim for property depreciation; before an injunction will issue,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">there must be such an injury as from its nature is <em>not susceptible of being adequately compensated by damages at law, </em>or such as from its continuance or permanent mischief must occasion a constantly recurring grievance, which cannot be otherwise prevented but by an injunction. ...

Nonetheless, just as a deaf plaintiff suffers a \"genuine interference with the use and enjoyment of his land\u201d when the use of neighboring property reduces the willingness of other persons to visit his property, plaintiffs here should be able to recover damages for a \"genuine interference with the use and enjoyment of [their] land\u201d if defendants\u2019 use of neighboring property reduces the willingness of potential purchasers to occupy property in the neighborhood, substantially and adversely affecting the value of plaintiffs\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The majority rejects plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the <em>conduct of defendants, </em>rather than negative publicity or the \"unfounded fears of third parties,\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>caused an interference with plaintiffs\u2019 interest in the use and enjoyment of property.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">One might hypothesize a category of cases in which \"negative publicity\u201d only remotely connected with the defendant\u2019s conduct adversely affects the value, of the plaintiff\u2019s property, but defendants have not established that the instant case belongs in such a category.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the majority\u2019s concerns, plaintiffs have not asked to be excused from the \"requirement that a litigant seeking to recover for nuisance must show ... a significant interference with the use and enjoyment of land.\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> It is rather the majority that, by deciding this case on its own factual assumptions and barring remand for trial, has prevented plaintiffs from making such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Manifesting greater concern about the diffusion of liability than the instant defendants are alleged to have shown for the diffusion of hazardous waste, the majority sounds an alarm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">Under [plaintiffs\u2019] theory, a cause of action could be stated on behalf of any individual who could demonstrate an effect on property values even if the polluted ground water had neither strayed from defendants\u2019 own property, nor disturbed a plaintiff\u2019s enjoyment by the fear that it would do so.<footnotemark>[89]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">The majority\u2019s hypothetical case, in which con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>tamination never \"strayed from defendants\u2019 own property,\u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> is counterfactual; plaintiffs allege that contamination \"strayed\u201d from defendants\u2019 facilities, and rendered homes in the neighborhood unsafe to inhabit.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">vi</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The majority concludes by animadverting upon a claim that recognition of the instant plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action might lead to \"reordering of a polluter\u2019s resources for the benefit of persons who have suffered no cognizable harm at the expense of those claimants who have been subjected to a substantial and unreasonable interference in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>use and enjoyment of property.\u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> The majority observes that polluters sometimes seek refuge in the bankruptcy courts \"as a result of clean-up costs required under various statutes and private litigation seeking money damages for injuries due to the contamination,\u201d and that Thomas Solvent Company did so in 1984.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The majority\u2019s fears are unfounded \u2014 possibly the only truly unfounded fears in this case.

The plaintiffs, a group of community members, alleged that they had been <em>physically injured </em>by contamination present in a water treatment plant located downhill and downstream from a Martin Marietta facility generating large quantities of toxic waste. The court held that, having failed to refute the defendants\u2019 epidemiological evidence or to present appropriate epidemiological findings of their own, the plaintiffs had not sustained their burden of demonstrating exposure to the contaminants at levels sufficient to cause the claimed injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">The instant case presents no dispute whether contamination has migrated from defendants\u2019 to plaintiffs\u2019 property or has adversely affected plaintiffs\u2019 <em>health. </em>Rather, plaintiffs seek an opportunity to prove that the value of their property has been diminished as a result of the contamination of neighboring land. Plaintiffs (whose property was not contaminated) and their neighbors (whose property was contaminated) may have suffered distinct and independent injuries to their respective property rights by the same conduct of defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"92\">\n<p id=\"b459-6\"> <em>Ante, </em>pp 318-319.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"93\">\n<p id=\"b459-7\"> <em>Id., </em>p 319, n 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Plaintiffs amended their complaint in 1985 to add a fraudulent conveyance claim, alleging that the Thomas Solvent corporate defendants had been reorganized, and their assets shifted, on the eve of the April 1984 filing of a Chapter 11 petition.
