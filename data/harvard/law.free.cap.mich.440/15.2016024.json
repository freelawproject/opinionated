FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">On February 24, 1988, defendant Hasson traveled by air from Los Angeles to Lansing\u2019s Capital City Airport. He had a return ticket to Los Angeles on a flight scheduled to leave less than four hours after his arrival, yet he had checked two large suitcases. Acting on a tip from airline agents relayed through the Los Angeles police, the Michigan State Police met Hasson\u2019s flight. Before Has-son claimed his luggage, a police dog alerted officers to the presence of illegal drugs in both suitcases. The police observed Hasson deplane, retrieve his luggage, make a call from a public phone, and walk outside to the public driveway. After about thirty minutes, Hasson flagged down a car driven and owned by defendant Bullock. Bullock\u2019s seventeen-year-old grandson was a passenger in the car. Hasson placed his luggage in the trunk and got in the car, which began to pull away.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">At that point, the police stopped the car and arrested all three occupants. The police, without attempting to obtain a warrant, then proceeded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>search the entire car.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They examined the glove compartment, Bullock\u2019s purse which she left in the car, and the luggage Hasson had placed in the trunk. They found traces of cocaine in the glove compartment and Bullock\u2019s purse, and over fifteen kilograms of cocaine in Hasson\u2019s luggage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This cocaine was admitted as evidence at trial over Hasson\u2019s and Bullock\u2019s objections, and both were convicted, in separate jury trials, of knowingly possessing 650 grams or more of cocaine in violation of MCL 333.7403(2)(a)(i); MSA 14.15(7403)(2)(a)(i).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As mandated by that statute, in conjunction with MCL 791.234(4); MSA 28.2304(4), both defendants were sentenced to life in prison without any possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The Court of Appeals, in separate unpublished opinions per curiam decided April 24, 1990,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> reversed both defendants\u2019 convictions. The Court held that the cocaine found in Hasson\u2019s luggage should have been excluded as the fruit of an invalid search because, while the police had probable cause to believe the luggage contained contraband and therefore were justified in seizing it, the police had no warrant to search it and the case did not fall within the so-called \"automobile exception\u201d to the warrant requirement. Because the state lacked sufficient evidence to prosecute without the excluded cocaine, the Court did not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>mand for retrial in <em>Hasson. </em>The Court, while finding that Bullock lacked standing to challenge the search of Hasson\u2019s luggage, held that the traces of cocaine found in Bullock\u2019s purse and the glove compartment should also have been excluded as the fruit of an illegal search. Because the Court found that the introduction of that cocaine as evidence was not harmless with regard to Bullock\u2019s conviction for possession of the cocaine in Hasson\u2019s luggage, the Court reversed the conviction and remanded for retrial in <em>Bullock.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">We granted leave to appeal, 436 Mich 881 (1990), and subsequently agreed to consider whether the mandatory penalty of life in prison without possibility of parole was invalid under either the federal or state constitutions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following oral argument during the 1990-91 term, we ordered reargument this term to address the effect of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decisions in <em>California v Acevedo, </em>500 US \u2014; 111 S Ct 1982; 114 L Ed 2d 619 (1991) (dealing with the search issue), and <em>Harmelin v Michigan, </em>501 US \u2014; 111 S Ct 2680; 115 L Ed 2d 836 (1991) (dealing with the penalty issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">A. THE SEARCH ISSUE: <em>HASSON</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">There is no basis in the Michigan Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>for excluding from evidence the cocaine discovered in this case. Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11 provides that it \"shall not be construed to bar from evidence in any criminal proceeding any narcotic drug . . . seized by a peace officer outside the curtilage of any dwelling house in this state.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our analysis is thus governed exclusively by the United States Constitution, as currently construed by the United States Supreme Court. See <em>People v Chapman, </em>425 Mich 245, 252-253; 387 NW2d 835 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">While the reasoning of the Court of Appeals on this issue constitutes a plausible application of federal constitutional search and seizure law as it existed at the time of that Court\u2019s decision, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>California v Acevedo, supra, </em>plainly destroys any claim that Hasson might have had on this issue, and compels reversal of the Court of Appeals. The Court in <em>Acevedo, </em>overruling <em>Arkansas v Sanders, </em>442 US 753; 99 S Ct 2586; 61 L Ed 2d 235 (1979), as reaffirmed in <em>United States v Ross, </em>456 US 798, 812-813, 824; 102 S Ct 2157; 72 L Ed 2d 572 (1982), expanded the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement and held that police may open and search any container placed or found in an automobile, as long as they have the requisite probable cause with regard to such a container, even if such probable cause focuses specifically on the container and arises before the container is placed in the automobile. See <em>Acevedo, </em>114 L Ed 2d 630-634.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The Court of Appeals rejected Hasson\u2019s claim that probable cause was lacking in this case, and that holding is not challenged before this Court. Thus, given that the police had probable cause to search Hasson\u2019s luggage, and because the placement of the luggage in Bullock\u2019s car brings this case within the automobile exception as defined by <em>Acevedo, </em>the failure to obtain a warrant does not render the search invalid. The cocaine was properly admitted as evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">B. THE SEARCH ISSUE: <em>BULLOCK</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Just as in <em>Hasson, </em>for reasons noted above, our analysis here is governed exclusively by the United States Constitution, as currently construed by the United States Supreme Court. The Court of Appeals found the search of Bullock\u2019s purse and the glove compartment of her car invalid, not for lack of a warrant \u2014 which, assuming probable cause, would clearly have been unnecessary under the automobile exception even prior to Acevedo\u2014 but because it found insufficient probable cause. The Court of Appeals correctly noted that even a search of a car without a warrant pursuant to the automobile exception is strictly limited in scope by the objects of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe they may be found, as the United States Supreme Court noted in <em>Ross, </em>456 US 824, and strongly reaffirmed in <em>Acevedo, </em>114 L Ed 2d 634. The Court of Appeals reasoned that the probable cause in this case extended to Hasson\u2019s luggage and no further. The people contest the Court of Appeals holding that there was insufficient probable cause to search the passenger compartment of Bullock\u2019s car, given the probable cause relating to Hasson\u2019s luggage and the circumstances under which Hasson arrived at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the airport and was picked up by Bullock, apparently in response to Hasson\u2019s phone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Probable cause is by its very nature an issue closely tied to the specific facts of each case, and the question in this case is arguably a close one. We need not decide that question, however. Under <em>New York v Belton, </em>453 US 454; 101 S Ct 2860; 69 L Ed 2d 768 (1981), the police may, as a contemporaneous incident of a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, search the entire passenger compartment of the automobile and any containers found therein, including glove compartments and purses. Because Hasson\u2019s arrest, at least, was unquestionably valid, there can be no doubt that this search was also valid, irrespective of the existence of probable cause, a warrant, or exigent circumstances. See <em>Chapman, </em>425 Mich 250-252. The traces of cocaine found in Bullock\u2019s purse and in the glove compartment were thus properly admitted as evidence at trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>C. THE PENALTY ISSUE: <em>BULLOCK </em>AND <em>HASSON</em></p>\n<p id=\"ATl\">1. THE APPLICABILITY OF CONST 1963, ART 1, \u00a7 16</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The United States Supreme Court, in <em>Harmelin v Michigan, supra, </em>rejected a challenge, brought under the \"cruel and unusual punishments\u201d clause of the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution, to Michigan\u2019s mandatory penalty of life in prison without possibility of parole for possession of 650 grams or more of a mixture containing cocaine. We address here a challenge to that penalty on the basis of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16, which is worded differently from,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and was ratified more than 171 years after, the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">While <em>Harmelin </em>is binding and authoritative for purposes of applying the United States Constitution, it is only persuasive authority for purposes of this Court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Michigan Constitution. This Court alone is the ultimate authority with regard to the meaning and application of Michigan law. See <em>In re Apportionment of State Legislature </em>\u2014 1982, 413 Mich 96, 116, n 11; 321 NW2d 565 (1982), app dis for want of substantial federal question sub nom <em>Kleiner v Sanderson, </em>459 US 900 (1982). In the case of a divided United States Supreme Court decision, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>may in some cases find more persuasive, and choose to rely upon, the reasoning of the dissenting justices of that Court, and not the majority, for purposes of interpreting our own Michigan Constitution. See n 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">To note that we have the authority to interpret the Michigan Constitution more expansively than the United States Constitution does not, of course, lead to the conclusion that we should or will choose to exercise that authority in any particular area.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is entirely possible, in a given case or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>area, that our independent judgment will lead to our agreeing with the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court. See, e.g., <em>Doe v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>439 Mich 650; 487 NW2d 166 (1992) (rejecting a state constitutional right to abortion funding). For example, in the area of search and seizure law, governed by the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11, this Court has held, on the basis of a careful examination of the text and history of the latter clause, and the understanding of the voters who adopted it, that it should not be interpreted to afford any greater protection than the parallel federal clause, absent a \"compelling reason\u201d for doing so. See <em>People v Collins, </em>438 Mich 8, 25-29; 475 NW2d 684 (1991); <em>People v Perlos, </em>436 Mich 305, 313, n 7; 462 NW2d 310 (1990); <em>People v Nash, </em>418 Mich 196, 208-215; 341 NW2d 439 (1983) (opinion of Brickley, J.). See also <em>People v Hill, </em>429 Mich 382, 393; 415 NW2d 193 (1987); <em>People v Collier, </em>426 Mich 23, 39; 393 NW2d 346 (1986) (interpreting the Self-Incrimination Clause of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The application of the \"compelling reason\u201d standard remains an issue on which jurists of reason may differ, as they have differed in the past.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>have no need, however, to further explore this broad issue in these cases. We find that regardless of whether it is or should be necessary to adduce a \"compelling reason\u201d to interpret Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16 more broadly than the United States Supreme Court interprets the Eighth Amendment, at least three compelling reasons do, in fact, exist to interpret our state constitutional provision more broadly in these cases than the United States Supreme Court interpreted the Eighth Amendment in <em>Harmelin. </em>We set forth these reasons in parts II(c)(2), (3), and (4). Furthermore, we find that a proper interpretation of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16, in accordance with this Court\u2019s longstanding precedent in this area, requires us to strike down the penalty at issue as unjustifiably disproportionate to the crime for which it is imposed, and therefore \"cruel or unusual.\u201d See part II(c)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">2. TEXTUAL DIFFERENCES</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">First, as we have already noted, the Michigan provision prohibits \"cruel <em>or </em>unusual\u201d punishments, while the Eighth Amendment bars only punishments that are both \"cruel <em>and </em>unusual.\u201d This textual difference does not appear to be accidental or inadvertent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Language providing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\"no cruel or unusual punishments, shall be inflicted\u201d was included in Article II of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. Michigan\u2019s first Constitution, adopted in 1835, provided that \"cruel <em>and unjust </em>punishments shall not be inflicted.\u201d Const 1835, art 1, \u00a7 18 (emphasis added). The Constitution of 1850 provided that \"cruel <em>or </em>unusual punishment shall not be inflicted . . . .\u201d Const 1850, art 6, \u00a7 31 (emphasis added). Identical language was adopted as part of the 1908 and 1963 Constitutions. See Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 15; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">This Court, in <em>People v Lorentzen, </em>387 Mich 167, 171-172; 194 NW2d 827 (1972),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> took specific note of this difference in phraseology and suggested that it might well lead to different results with regard to allegedly disproportionate prison terms. \"The prohibition of punishment that is unusual but not necessarily cruel carries an implication that unusually excessive imprisonment is included in that prohibition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As this Court noted in <em>Collins, </em>a \"significant textual difference[ ] between parallel provisions of the state and federal constitutions\u201d may constitute a \"compelling reason\u201d for a different and broader interpretation of the state provision. 438 Mich 32.</p>\n<p id=\"ATt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>3. HISTORICAL FACTORS</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\">Second, while two members of the <em>Harmelin </em>majority maintained that the historical circumstances and background of the adoption of the Eighth Amendment preclude the notion that the federal clause contains a \"proportionality principle,\u201d see 115 L Ed 2d 846-858 (opinion of Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J.), such a conclusion cannot be reached with regard to the framing and adoption of the Michigan Constitution of 1963. Whatever the legal terms \"cruel\u201d and \"unusual\u201d were understood to mean in 1791 when the Eighth Amendment was ratified \u2014 or in 1689 when its antecedent, the English Bill of Rights, was adopted \u2014by 1963 those words had been interpreted and understood by the United States Supreme Court <em>and by this Court </em>for more than half a century to include a prohibition on grossly disproportionate sentences. See <em>Weems v United States, </em>217 US 349, 366-367, 371; 30 S Ct 544; 54 L Ed 793 (1910); <em>Harmelin, </em>115 L Ed 2d 876 (White, J., dissenting); <em>People v Mire, </em>173 Mich 357, 361-362; 138 NW 1066 (1912).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">This would constitute another \"compelling reason\u201d under <em>Collins </em>for a broader view of state constitutional protection, in that \"history provide^] reason to believe that those who framed and adopted the state provision had a different purpose in mind,\u201d 438 Mich 32 \u2014 different, at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>rate, from the historical understanding asserted by Justice Scalia.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">4. LONGSTANDING MICHIGAN PRECEDENT</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Finally, this Court, in interpreting Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16, has long followed an approach more consistent with the reasoning of the <em>Harmelin </em>dissenters than with that of the <em>Harmelin </em>majority. Twenty years ago, in <em>People v Lorentzen, supra, </em>we struck down, under both the Eighth Amendment and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16, a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years in prison (reducible to approximately ten years by earning \"good time\u201d) for selling any amount of marijuana. See 387 Mich 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Our analysis in <em>Lorentzen </em>foreshadowed in a striking manner the three-pronged test later adopted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Solem v Helm, </em>463 US 277, 290-291; 103 S Ct 3001; 77 L Ed 2d 637 (1983). Thus, <em>Lorentzen </em>noted the severity of the sentence imposed and the fact that it would apply to a marijuana sale by \"a first offender high school student.\u201d 387 Mich 176; accord <em>Solem, </em>463 US 290-291 (\"[f]irst, we look to the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty\u201d). <em>Lorentzen </em>then compared the penalty to those imposed for numerous other crimes in Michigan. 387 Mich 176-177; accord <em>Solem, </em>463 US 291 (\"[s]econd, it may be helpful to compare the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction\u201d). <em>Lorentzen </em>further compared Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>gan\u2019s penalty for selling marijuana to the penalties imposed for that offense by other states. 387 Mich 179; accord <em>Solem, </em>463 US 291-292 (\"[t]hird, courts may find it useful to compare the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions\u201d). Finally, <em>Lorentzen </em>applied a fourth criterion rooted in Michigan\u2019s legal traditions, and reflected in the provision for \"indeterminate sentences\u201d of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 45: the goal of rehabilitation. See 387 Mich 179-181.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">It is unclear, in the wake of <em>Harmelin, </em>whether Lorentzen\u2019s or Solem\u2019s analysis survives as a matter of federal constitutional law,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that need not concern us in any event. Lorentzen\u2019s analysis, although relying in the alternative on the Eighth Amendment, was firmly and sufficiently rooted in Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16. Indeed, we preceded our proportionality<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> analysis in <em>Lorentzen </em>with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>lengthy review of Michigan case law dating back to 1879. See 387 Mich 173-176. We believe the precedential weight of <em>Lorentzen </em>and its antecedents, as a matter of Michigan law, constitutes a very compelling reason not to reflexively follow the latest turn in the United States Supreme Court\u2019s Eighth Amendment analysis. We therefore continue to adhere, on the basis of the Michigan Constitution, to the analysis set forth in <em>Lorentzen </em>and later adopted in Solem,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AtC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>5. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Applying the <em>Lorentzen-Solem </em>analysis to these cases, we conclude, largely for the reasons stated by Justice White in his dissenting opinion in <em>Harmelin, </em>that the penalty at issue here is so grossly disproportionate as to be \"cruel or unusual.\u201d The penalty is imposed for mere possession of cocaine, without any proof of intent to sell or distribute.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The penalty would apply to a teenage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>first offender who acted merely as a courier.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Indeed, on the basis of the information before this Court, it appears that prior to the offense giving rise to this case, defendant Bullock, a forty-eight-year-old grandmother, had never been convicted of any serious crime<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and had held a steady job as an autoworker for sixteen years.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>It is true, as Justice Kennedy noted in <em>Harmelin, </em>that the collateral effects flowing even from mere possession of cocaine are terrible indeed. See 115 L Ed 2d 870-871. But conviction of the crime involved here does not require any proof that the defendant committed, aided, intended, or even contemplated any loss of life or other violent crime, or even any crime against property. As Justice White correctly noted in <em>Harmelin, </em>\"[t]o be constitutionally proportionate, punishment must be tailored to a defendant\u2019s personal responsibility and moral guilt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>115 L Ed 2d 883. While we emphatically do not minimize the gravity and reprehensibility of defendants\u2019 crime, it would be profoundly unfair to impute full personal responsibility and moral guilt to defendants for any and all collateral acts, unintended by them, which might have been later committed by others in connection with the seized cocaine. Persons who independently commit violent and other crimes in connection with illegal drugs can and should be held individually responsible by our criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Thus, even under Justice Kennedy\u2019s restrictive view of <em>Solem, </em>it is clear that an application of <em>Solem\u2019s </em>first prong \"leads to an inference of gross disproportionality.\u201d <em>Harmelin, </em>115 L Ed 2d 871 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Application of the second and third prongs of the <em>Lorentzen-Solem </em>analysis strongly reinforces that inference.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As Justice White noted in <em>Harmelin, </em>aside from irian<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ufacture, delivery, possession with intent to deliver, and possession of 650 grams or more of a substance containing cocaine or illegal narcotics, only first-degree murder \u2014 that is, \"wilful, deliberate, and premeditated\u201d murder, or murder committed in the course of certain serious felonies \u2014 is punishable in Michigan by mandatory life imprisonment without possibility of parole. See 115 L Ed 2d 885; MCL 750.316; MSA 28.548. The defendants in this case have been punished more severely than they could have been for second-degree murder, rape, mutilation, armed robbery, or other exceptionally grave and violent crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Furthermore, as Justice White also noted, no other state in the nation imposes a penalty even remotely as severe as Michigan\u2019s for mere possession of 650 grams or more of cocaine. See 115 L Ed 2d 885-886. \"Of the remaining 49 States, only Alabama provides for a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole for a first-time drug offender, and then only when a defendant possesses ten kilograms or more of cocaine.\u201d <em>Id., </em>115 L Ed 2d 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In sum, the only fair conclusion that can be reached regarding the penalty at issue is that it constitutes an unduly disproportionate response to the serious problems posed by drugs in our society. However understandable such a response may be, it is not consistent with our constitutional prohibition of \"cruel or unusual punishment.\u201d The penalty is therefore unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">The proportionality principle inherent in Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16, is not a simple, \"bright-line\u201d test, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>and the application of that test may, concededly, be analytically difficult and politically unpopular, especially where application of that principle requires us to override a democratically expressed judgment of the Legislature. The fact is, however, the people of Michigan, speaking through their constitution, have forbidden the imposition of cruel or unusual punishments, and we are duty-bound to devise a principled test by which to enforce that prohibition, and to apply that test to the cases that are brought before us. The very purpose of a constitution is to subject the passing judgments of temporary legislative or political majorities to the deeper, more profound judgment of the people reflected in the constitution, the enforcement of which is entrusted to our judgment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">For the reasons stated in parts ii(a) and (b), we reverse the judgments of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the convictions of both defendants at bar. For the reasons stated in part n(c), however, we strike down the sentences imposed on both defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>dants as \"cruel or unusual\u201d under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16-</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The remaining question is what remedy to afford. In considering this question, we are guided by several factors. First, there are three aspects to the severity of the penalty at issue: (1) its length (life); (2) its mandatory character, i.e., the absence of individualized consideration for each defendant at the sentencing stage; and (3) the absence of any possibility of individualized parole consideration for each defendant. Second, our holding today is necessarily limited to the precise issue before us; we do not address today the validity of a hypothetical penalty lacking any of these three attributes. Third, the defendants at bar, in challenging this penalty, focused especially on the absence of the possibility of parole.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Finally, our decision today necessarily invalidates the sentences of all defendants currently incarcerated under the same penalty, and for committing the same offense, as the defendants at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">We conclude that the most appropriate remedy under the circumstances is to ameliorate the no-parole feature of the penalty. We therefore strike down, with regard to these defendants and all others who have been sentenced under the same penalty and for the same offense, that portion of MCL 791.234(4); MSA 28.2304(4) denying such defendants the parole consideration otherwise available upon completion of ten calendar years of the sentence. Thus, each such defendant shall, upon serving ten calendar years of the sentence, become subject to the jurisdiction of the parole board and eligible for parole consideration in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>MCL 791.234(4)(a)-(d), (5); MSA 28.2304(4)(a)-(d), (5).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b143-5\">Levin, Brickley, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\"> The police did telephone the Clinton County Prosecutor\u2019s office to ask if a warrant was needed to search the car and the suitcases in the trunk.

Our holding on the underlying issue, however, obviously affects Bullock no less than Hasson, as indeed it affects all other persons sentenced under the same penalty and for the same offense as the defendants at bar. See part in. We conclude that it would be incongruous and not conducive to substantial justice to limit our consideration of the penalty issue to Hasson and not Bullock. We, of course, \"may, at any time . . . permit the reasons or grounds of appeal to be amended or new grounds to be added,\u201d and \"enter any judgment or order that ought to have been entered, and enter other and further orders and grant relief as the case may require . . . .\u201d MCR 7.316(A)(3), (7).

Cocaine has long been grouped with the true narcotic drugs such as heroin for purposes of legal control, and, indeed, was legally defined as a \"narcotic\u201d at the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted. See 1948 CL 335.51(13) (Mason\u2019s Supp, 1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\"> Bullock raised three additional challenges to her conviction in the Court of Appeals that that Court did not explicitly address: (1) that the admission into evidence of the traces of cocaine found in the glove compartment and Bullock\u2019s purse was erroneous because it constituted \"other acts\u201d evidence not admissible under MRE 404(b); (2) that the denial of Bullock\u2019s request to waive jury trial because of lack of prosecutorial consent, in accordance with MCL 763.3; MSA 28.856 (as amended by 1988 PA 89, \u00a7 1, effective June 1, 1988, shortly before Bullock\u2019s trial took place), was inconsistent with then-MCR 6.101(F)(1)(c)(ii), thereby unconstitutionally transgressing this Court\u2019s authority to promulgate rules of court procedure under Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5; and (3) that the evidence was insufficient to support Bullock\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Whatever merit the first contention may have, we note that Bullock failed to raise any timely objection at trial on the basis of MRE 404(b), and we therefore reject this contention on that basis. The second contention, whatever merit it may have had at the time, is now moot in light of MCR 6.401 (effective October 1, 1989), which provides, consistently with MCL 763.3; MSA 28.856, that a defendant\u2019s waiver of jury trial is contingent on the consent of the prosecutor.\u201d See also MCR 6.302(B)(3)(b) (effective October 1, 1989). Any retrial of Bullock would obviously be governed by the current court rules, and we therefore reject her second contention on that basis. (We note that Bullock has not challenged the denial of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>request to waive jury trial on the ground that such denial violates any constitutional right to waive jury trial, and we therefore express no view on that issue in this case.) The Court of Appeals implicitly rejected Bullock\u2019s third contention by remanding the case for retrial, which is barred on double jeopardy grounds when a conviction is reversed because of insufficient evidence. See <em>Burks v United States, </em>437 US 1; 98 S Ct 2141; 57 L Ed 2d 1 (1978). Upon review of the record, we find this contention devoid of merit and reject it also.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b127-13\"> US Const, Am VIII provides: \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel <em>and </em>unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

The duty of the appellate courts to review trial court sentences within the applicable statutory ranges for abuse of discretion, as reaffirmed in <em>Milbourn, </em>is rooted not in Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16, but rather reflects the Legislature\u2019s intent \"in setting a range of allowable punishments for a single felony . . . .\u201d 435 Mich 651. <em>Milbourn </em>obviously has no applicability to a legislatively mandated sentence because the trial court, in that case, lacks any discretion to abuse. <em>Milbourn </em>involved the relationship between the trial and appellate courts as they work together to fulfill the Legislature\u2019s intent, under the belief \"that judicial sentencing discretion should be exercised, within the legislatively prescribed range, according to the same principle of proportionality that guides the Legislature in its allocation of punishment over the full spectrum of criminal behavior.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By contrast, the issue under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16, as raised in these cases and others, concerns whether the punishment concededly chosen or authorized by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the Legislature is so grossly disproportionate as to be unconstitutionally \"cruel or unusual.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\"> Justice Riley would discard this Court\u2019s unanimous decision in <em>Lorentzen </em>as \"wrongly decided.\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 46. It is true, of course, as <em>Lorentzen </em>itself conceded, that some of the early \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d case law of this Court is equivocal and open to conflicting interpretation, but we must take issue with our colleague\u2019s description of much of that case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">For example, while our colleague cites language from <em>People v Morris, </em>80 Mich 634; 45 NW 591 (1890), concededly supportive of her argument, see <em>post, </em>p 51, <em>Morris </em>also contains language that, in the alternative, applied proportionality analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">But for the disposition of this case we may adopt the rule contended for, and then we must find (in order to declare the law unconstitutional) that the minimum punishment provided by the law is so <em>disproportionate to the offense </em>as to shook [sic] the moral sense of the people. <em>[Id. </em>at 639. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">Contrary to our colleague\u2019s assertion, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Robison v Miner, </em>68 Mich 549; 37 NW 21 (1888), did not involve only the \"excessive fines\u201d clause of Const 1850, art 6, \u00a7 31. Cf. Riley, J., <em>post, </em>p 49, n 6. In fact, the liquor law at issue authorized not only the imposition of fines but also imprisonment and, in the case of a second offense, suspension of the privilege of selling liquor for five years. Obviously, the latter penalty could not be regarded as a mere monetary \"fine\u201d; in describing the relevant issue, <em>Robison </em>quoted Const 1850, art 6, \u00a7 31 in its entirety, including the prohibition on \"cruel or unusual punishment.\u201d 68 Mich 559-560. Indeed, the <em>\u00f1nes </em>imposed by the liquor law, like the imprisonment penalties, were <em>upheld </em>in <em>Robison, </em>and were not even regarded as central to the dispute. See <em>id. </em>at 560, 564; accord <em>Luton v Newaygo Circuit Judge, </em>69 Mich 610, 613; 37 NW 701 (1888).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">In striking down the five-year suspension penalty under Const 1850, art 6, \u00a7 31, <em>Robison </em>expressly emphasized the fact that such a penalty has a different and far more severe character than a mere monetary fine. See 68 Mich 562-563.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>These <em>punishments </em>have always been regarded as incompatible with our institutions, and there can be no doubt that <em>the cruel and unusual punishments </em>forbidden by the United States Constitution had special reference to the barbarities of the old law of felony. <em>It is equally clear </em>that any fine <em>or penalty </em>is <em>excessive </em>which seriously impairs the capacity of gaining a business livelihood. The <em>penalties </em>in this act, which are imperative and not discretionary, must necessarily break up business, and <em>are not measured by any standard of proportion </em>or amount. <em>[Id. </em>at 563. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">It is thus clear that <em>Robison </em>strongly foreshadowed the development of the proportionality component of our \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d jurisprudence, as this Court-recognized in <em>Lorentzen, </em>387 Mich 174. The only language from <em>Robison </em>quoted by our colleague is from the separate opinion of Chief Justice Sherwood, who <em>dissented </em>from the <em>Robison </em>Court\u2019s decision to strike down the five-year suspension penalty as \"cruel or unusual.\u201d See 68 Mich 573; Riley, J., <em>post, </em>p 49, n 6. Even Chief Justice Sherwood, however, suggested agreement with the principle of proportionality, by stating that the issue was whether the Legislature\u2019s \"enactments are so far in excess of what is necessary to furnish the protection desired as to be obnoxious to the Constitution, which forbids 'cruel and unusual punishments\u2019 . . . .\u201d 68 Mich 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Our colleague suggests that <em>People v Murray, 72 </em>Mich 10; 40 NW 29 (1888), involved only nonconstitutional sentence review analogous to that applied in <em>People v Milbourn, </em>435 Mich 630; 461 NW2d 1 (1990). Riley, J., <em>post, </em>p 49, n 6. While it is true that <em>Murray </em>involved a judicially imposed discretionary sentence, rather than a sentence mandated by the Legislature, this Court stated that \"the <em>Constitution </em>has not left the liberty of the citizen of any state entirely to the indiscretion or caprice of its judiciary, but enjoins upon all that <em>unusual punishments </em>shall not be inflicted.\u201d 72 Mich 17 (emphasis added). <em>Murray </em>thus clearly foreshadowed modern <em>constitutional </em>proportionality analysis. The fact that <em>Murray </em>also stated that \"the present case shows an abuse of the discretion vested by the statute in the circuit judge,\u201d <em>id., </em>thereby also foreshadowing <em>Milbourn </em>analysis to some extent, does not change the constitutional aspect of the case. See n 17 (explaining the distinction between <em>Milbourn </em>proportionality analysis and constitutional proportionality analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Our colleague states that <em>People v Armstrong, </em>73 Mich 288; 41 NW 275 (1889), \"never addressed the issue\u201d whether the challenged municipal handbill ordinance was unconstitutionally harsh, \"because it found that the municipality did not have the authority to enact the ordinance in question.\u201d Riley, J., <em>post, </em>p 50, n 6. <em>Armstrong, </em>however, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">The unreasonableness of this ordinance is made apparent when we consider the penalty which may be imposed for its violation, \u2014 a fine of $100, and costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment, imprisonment in the county jail or Detroit House of Correction for a period of six months. [73 Mich 295.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>The Court concluded: \"This ordinance <em>not only </em>does not come within the power granted by the charter, <em>but it is also unreasonable and unwarranted.\" Id. </em>at 296 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Our colleague makes short shrift of <em>People v Mire, supra, </em>which, as even she concedes, strongly supports Lorentzen\u2019s proportionality approach. See Riley, J., <em>post, </em>p 52; <em>Mire, </em>173 Mich 361-362, quoted in <em>Lorentzen, </em>387 Mich 175-176. <em>Mire </em>has never been overruled or questioned by this Court. We disagree with our colleague\u2019s contention that <em>Mire </em>was \"abandoned\u201d in <em>Smith v Wayne Probate Judge, </em>231 Mich 409; 204 NW 140 (1925). See Riley, J., <em>post, </em>p 52. <em>Smith </em>did not cite <em>Mire </em>and did not address the proportionality issue. Chief Justice McDonald\u2019s plurality opinion merely found that the involuntary sterilization of \"feeble-minded persons\u201d did not involve any \"element of punishment,\u201d being supposedly \"analogous to compulsory vaccination,\u201d and that the \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d clause was therefore not even implicated. 231 Mich 416. We agree fully with the unremarkable dicta in <em>Smith </em>(quoted with emphasis by our colleague, Riley, J., <em>post, </em>pp 52-53) to the effect that the purpose of the clause \"is to place a limitation on the power of the legislature in fixing punishment for crimes,\u201d and that \"[i]t has reference only to punishments inflicted after convictions of crimes.\u201d 231 Mich 416.

By choosing to prosecute these defendants solely for possession, the people avoided the need to meet the heavy burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that these defendants intended to sell or distribute. Therefore, they must be deemed innocent of any such intent for purposes of analyzing the facial proportionality of the disputed penalty to the offense for which it is imposed. It would be inconsistent with the most basic norms of our system of justice to treat these defendants, for present purposes, as guilty of a crime of which they were never convicted, and for which the people never even sought to prosecute them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\"> Indeed, we may take judicial notice that the penalty has already been applied to several teenage first offenders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\"> According to her presentence investigation report, Bullock was convicted of three misdemeanors in 1960, when she was twenty years old: drunkenness ($5 fine), operating a vehicle with a suspended license (fine and costs of $18), and gambling (fine and'costs of $15 and fifteen days in jail).

Because of the mandatory character of the penalty, no sentencing hearings were ever held. While the record before us contains presentence investigation reports prepared with regard to e'ach defendant, neither the people nor the defendants had any incentive to challenge the accuracy, weight, or significance of the information contained therein. Thus, we could not, at this particular stage of the litigation, properly analyze the constitutionality of the penalty as applied to these particular defendants. We must simply determine whether the penalty is facially unconstitutional in light of the specific crime for which it is imposed. Because we conclude that it is, we need not express any view regarding how defendant Hasson\u2019s alternative as-applied challenge to the penalty would properly have been dealt with, or whether a remand for sentencing hearings would have been necessary with regard to both Bullock and Hasson, in order to properly address any as-applied challenge.

Because neither I nor my colleagues are prepared to act as sentencing judges, these cases should be remanded to the trial court for sentencing hearings.

However, a careful analysis of <em>Lorentzen </em>reveals that the conclusion reached by the majority is clearly wrong. The <em>Lorentzen </em>decision is founded on the following four premises.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">First, that this Court has construed the Michigan \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d clause to mean that if a sentence is not in excess of a statute, then the Supreme Court has no control over the punishment imposed. <em>Lorentzen, supra </em>at 173.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">Second, that this Court has determined that the prohibition against \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d was an attempt by our founders to prevent the government from inflicting inhumane or barbarous punishment. <em>Id. </em>at 174.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">Third, that the Legislature has the exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>sive power to determine the length of imprisonment for a felony. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">Fourth, that this Court has directly, or by inference, applied the test of proportionality to the sentence imposed when challenged under the \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d clause. <em>Id. </em>at 174-175.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The <em>Lorentzen </em>Court then reached the following conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">It will be seen from the above discussion of the leading United States Supreme Court case<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> and cases decided by this Court that the dominant test of cruel and unusual punishment is that the punishment is in excess of any that would be suitable to fit the crime. <em>[Id. </em>at 176.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Because I am persuaded that the analysis in <em>Lorentzen </em>does not adequately support its fourth premise and ultimate conclusion, I dissent from my colleagues\u2019 reliance on that case. I believe that a proper analysis of the cases illustrates that the \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d clause was intended to prohibit inhumane and barbarous treatment of the criminally convicted, and does not have a proportionality component.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">II. THE <em>LORENTZEN </em>CASES<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">The first case in which this Court directly ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>dressed the meaning of the \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d clause was <em>People v Morris, </em>80 Mich 634; 45 NW 591 (1890).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Morris, convicted of stealing a horse, was sentenced under the pertinent statute to a mandatory seven years\u2019 imprisonment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>His argument (similar to the one made by the defendants in this case) was that the penalty prescribed in the statute was \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d because it was greater than the penalties for similar criminal offenses. The Court rejected defendant\u2019s argument that Const 1850, art 6, \u00a7 31 commands the Legislature to prescribe a punishment that is proportional to the criminal offense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">Counsel for defendants claims that, as properly understood, it means, when used in this connection, punishment out of proportion to the offense. If by this is meant the degree of punishment, we do not think the contention correct. <em>[Id. </em>at 638.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Morris </em>Court relied on the original meaning of the clause and the reason for its inclusion in the Michigan Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The <em>Morris </em>Court also relied on Justice Cooley\u2019s treatise on Constitutional Limitations and the conclusion reached therein that punishment was not \"cruel or unusual\u201d if inflicted in the same way, or in a similar mode, as permitted by the common law. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (4th ed), p 408, as quoted in <em>Morris, supra </em>at 639. Under Justice Cooley\u2019s analysis, punishments forbidden by the clause were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">\"those degrading punishments, which in any state had become obsolete before its existing constitution was adopted, we think may well be held forbidden by it as cruel and unusual. We may well doubt the right to establish the whipping-post and the pillory in states where they were never recognized as instruments of punishment, \u00f3r in states whose constitutions, revised since public opinion had banished them, have forbidden cruel and unusual punishments. In such states the public sentiment must be regarded as having condemned them as cruel, and any punishment which, if ever employed at all, has become altogether obsolete, must certainly be looked upon as unusual.\u201d <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Although the <em>Morris </em>Court discussed the proportionality argument in its opinion, it certainly did not rely on proportionality for its holding. Rather, in a separate portion of its analysis, the Court assumed arguendo that if proportionality were a component of the \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d clause, the penalty prescribed by the Legislature in <em>Morris </em>would not violate Const 1850, art 6, \u00a7 31. <em>Morris, supra </em>at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>The <em>Morris </em>interpretation of the \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d clause was followed by this Court until <em>People v Mire, </em>173 Mich 357; 138 NW 1066 (1912), wherein, departing from precedent <em>(Morris </em>and its progeny),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the <em>Mire </em>Court determined that a challenge to a sentence as \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d focused on the act committed by the defendant, not the statute prescribing the penalty, thereby inferring that proportionality was to be considered in sentencing. However, the <em>Mire </em>interpretation was abandoned a decade later in <em>Smith v Wayne Probate Judge, </em>231 Mich 409; 204 NW 140 (1925).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In <em>Smith, </em>the law giving parents the right to sterilize their \"feeble-minded children\u201d was challenged. The issue raised was whether the means provided by the statute to \"carry out its object are so cruel, inhuman, unreasonable and oppressive, that the legislature has no constitutional right to enforce them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416. However, before addressing the issue, the Court stated:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>The only purpose of this constitutional provision is to place a limitation on the power of the legislature in \u00f1xing punishment for crimes. </em>There is no element of punishment involved in the sterilization of feeble-minded persons. In this respect it is analogous to compulsory vaccination. Both are nonpunitive. It is therefore plainly apparent that the constitutional inhibition against cruel or unusual punishment had no application to the surgical treatment of feeble-minded persons. <em>It has reference only to punishments in\u00f1icted after convictions of crimes. [Id. </em>at 416. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">For almost fifty years after the <em>Smith </em>decision (and before <em>Lorentzen), </em>the law in Michigan remained settled with regard to the meaning of the \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d clause.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When reviewing challenges to punishment as \"cruel or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>unusual,\u201d this Court uniformly applied two principles: 1) that the drafters of the state constitution were cognizant of the abuses imposed by the Stuarts, during the reign of King James II, and sought to prohibit the recurrence of the inhumane and barbarous treatment of criminals by restricting the type of punishment the Legislature could impose under the law; and 2) that the length of incarceration, although subject to the constitutional prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment, is a legislative choice not subject to judicial abrogation unless truly inhumane or barbarous. In sum, the conclusion reached by the majority today, relying on <em>Lorentzen </em>to justify a test of proportionality with regard to punishments prescribed by the Legislature, is simply untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">hi</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD\">\"That the legislative solution appears undesirable, unfair, unjust or inhumane does not of itself empower a court to override the legislature and substitute its own solution.\u201d <em>[Doe v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>439 Mich 650, 681; 487 NW2d 166 (1992).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">In addition to my disagreement with the majority over the correctness of Lorentzen, I also do not agree with the reasons offered by my colleagues to conclude that Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16 commands a different meaning than that of the Eighth Amendment. First, the majority finds that the state constitution is an independent source of rights that supersedes federal law, and second, it concludes that there are \"compelling reasons\u201d to hold that Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16 is broader in scope than the Eighth Amendment, as currently construed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Harmelin, supra. </em>I disagree with both arguments for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>A</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">[T]he limits of legislative power are defined by our federal and state constitutions, not by the sentiment of the judiciary. <em>[Doe, supra </em>at 681.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In its analysis of the role this Court plays in state constitutional adjudication, the majority first contends that the Michigan Constitution is an independent source of rights, different in scope from the federal counterpart, and that the federal court decisions interpreting the parallel constitutional provisions are not presumptively correct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> I cannot subscribe to the majority\u2019s argument because it is evidence of its decision to eschew the historical foundations which the Michigan constitutional provision shares with its federal counterpart.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Furthermore, I view it as nothing more than an attempt to substitute a judicial policy choice for the policy choice already made by our Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Clearly evidencing its policy choice regarding control over the increased drug use in Michigan since 1978, the Michigan Legislature has twice amended the penalty provisions of the Controlled Substances Act, MCL 333.7401; MSA 14.15(7401), MCL 333.7403; MSA 14.15(7403). The first amendment, which took effect on March 30, 1988, reduced the mandatory minimum sentence for the possession of 225 grams, but less than 650 grams, from twenty years to ten. The mandatory minimum for possessing 50 to less than 225 grams was lowered from ten years to five at the same time. The statute was also amended to allow the sentencing court to depart from the minimum terms specified for all the amounts, except 650 grams or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>more, \"if the court finds on the record that there are substantial and compelling reasons to do so.\u201d MCL 333.7401(4); MSA 14.15(7401)(4), MCL 333.7403(3); MSA 14.15(7403)(3). However, the Legislature amended the act a second time in 1989, and reinstated the mandatory minimum prison terms to their original levels. The Legislature never amended the penalty for those convicted of possessing over 650 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Admittedly, from time to time the legislative process may appear to be agonizingly slow and unresponsive. Frustrated in the quest for a legislated amendment, there may be those (including members of the Legislature) who would urge this Court to act, because the Legislature may not. However, while this Court may disagree with the legislative mandate of life imprisonment without parole for drug dealers, it is not within the power of this Court to correct the perceived injustice by judicially legislating a socially or politically desirable result. Yet in reaffirming the erroneous principle of <em>Lorentzen </em>that Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16 demands proportional sentences, the majority has assumed the power to do just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">B</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">We believe that [a] compelling reason for an independent state construction might be found if there were significant textual differences between parallel provisions of the state and federal constitutions, and, particularly, if history provided reason to believe that those who framed and adopted the state provision had a different purpose in mind. <em>[People v Collins, </em>438 Mich 8, 32; 475 NW2d 684 (1991) (opinion of Griffin, J.).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">In addition to my disagreement with my colleagues\u2019 deviation from federal constitutional anal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>ysis, I believe that their opinion fails to advance a \"compelling reason\u201d for this Court to find the \"no parole\u201d statute unconstitutional under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16 where the United States Supreme Court has found the statute to be valid under the Eighth Amendment in <em>Harmelin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">In <em>Harmelin, </em>the United States Supreme Court reviewed the same statute that is currently before this Court and rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument that mandatory life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for possessing <em>672 </em>grams of cocaine violates the prohibition against \"cruel and unusual punishment\u201d under the Eighth Amendment. <em>Id., </em>115 L Ed 2d 864-865. A majority of the Court, agreeing with part iv of Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion, concluded that the \" 'individualized capital sentencing doctrine,\u2019 \u201d which takes into account the particular circumstances of the crime and of the criminal, only applies to <em>capital cases </em>and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole does not violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. <em>Id., </em>115 L Ed 2d 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The majority, however, was divided over the correctness of <em>Solem v Helm, supra, </em>and the assumption that proportionality is a component of the cruel and unusual punishment clause. Justice Scalia, writing for himself and Chief Justice Rehnquist, reviewed the history of the clause and found that proportionality is not a component of the Eighth Amendment. Justice Kennedy, writing for himself and Justices O\u2019Connor and Souter, felt constrained by stare decisis to hold that a narrow proportionality principle encompasses <em>noncapital </em>cases. However, these three justices were of the opinion that the dangers flowing from drug offenses and the circumstances of the crime demonstrate that the Michigan penalty scheme did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>exceed constitutional limits, and that under the facts of the <em>Harmelin </em>case the accused\u2019s sentence was not so disproportionate as to constitute cruel or unusual punishment. <em>Id., </em>115 L Ed 2d 873-874. Justices White, Marshall, Stevens, and Blackmun dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">While I agree with Justice Scalia\u2019s analysis and conclusion in <em>Harmelin, supra, </em>that <em>\"Solem </em>was simply wrong; the Eighth Amendment contains no proportionality guarantee,\u201d 115 L Ed 2d 846, I recognize that <em>Harmelin </em>is a plurality opinion. I base my finding that MCL 333.7403(2)(a)(i); MSA 14.15(7403)(2)(a)(i) is constitutional solely on the historical foundations of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16. The majority submits three arguments for its deviation from Justice Scalia\u2019s analysis, and, for that matter, from Justice Kennedy\u2019s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. In doing so, the majority advocates a broader right under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16, with which I disagree for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">1</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agl\">To set aside petitioner\u2019s mandatory sentence would require rejection not of the judgment of a single jurist, as in <em>Solem, </em>but rather the collective wisdom of the Michigan Legislature and, as a consequence, the Michigan citizenry. <em>[Harmelin, </em>115 L Ed 2d 872-873 (Kennedy, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The majority first contends that there is a \"significant\u201d textual difference in the Eighth Amendment (cruel <em>and </em>unusual punishment), from that in Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16 (cruel <em>or </em>unusual punishment), which enables the Court to give a \"broader\u201d interpretation of our constitutional prohibition against \"cruel or unusual punishment.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>31. History, and this Court\u2019s use of the text of the clause, does not support its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">It is true that the prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment has been part of this state\u2019s constitutional jurisprudence for nearly two hundred years. Along with the panoply of rights incorporated in the Northwest Ordinance, Congress provided that, \"[a]ll fines shall be moderate; and no cruel or unusual punishments shall be inflicted.\u201d Northwest Ordinance 1787, art II.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The drafters of Michigan\u2019s first constitution in 1835 incorporated the clause, but phrased it as a prohibition against \"cruel and unjust punishments.\u201d Const 1835, art 1, \u00a7 18. The phrase was changed to a prohibition against \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d in 1850. Const 1850, art 6, \u00a7 31. The Reports of the Proceedings and Debates of the Constitutional Convention of 1850 (Debates), and the Journal of the Constitutional Convention of 1850 (Journal), do not suggest that the delegates replaced the phrase \"and unjust\u201d with \"or unusual\u201d to give our constitutional provision a greater source of rights than that of the parallel federal clause. As the majority concedes,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>no material to supplement the contention that there is a <em>deliberate </em>difference between the Eighth Amendment and our analogous provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Moreover, the delegates to each of the State Constitutional Conventions had the option of specifically including a proportionality component in the \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d clause.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Several jurisdictions had such a provision in their own bills of rights, even at the time the leaders of Michigan were first considering the clause in 1835. See also <em>Harmelin, supra, </em>115 L Ed 2d 853-858 (opinion of Scalia, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In 1963, when our most recent constitution was adopted by the people of the State of Michigan, there were five states that constitutionally mandated punishments proportional to the offense in the \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d clauses.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Presuming that the delegates of the 1963 Constitutional Convention were aware of these states\u2019 provisions, they must have considered and rejected the idea of amending the existing clause to require sentences proportional to the offense.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Therefore, contrary to the suggestion put forth by the majority,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> I can find no tenable reason to believe that the replacement of the conjunctive \"and\u201d by the disjunctive \"or\u201d supports the argument that the drafters of the state constitution intended for this Court to interpret the phrase differently from the meaning that the United States Supreme Court has given the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">2</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">\"It is a fundamental principle of constitutional construction that we determine the intent of the framers of the Constitution and of the people adopting it.\u201d <em>[People v Collins, supra </em>at 32 (opinion of Griffin, J.).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The majority\u2019s second \"compelling reason\u201d is that \" 'history provide[s] reason to believe that those who framed and adopted the state provision had a different purpose in mind,\u2019 438 Mich 32\u2014 different, at any rate, from the historical understanding asserted by Justice Scalia.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>pp 32-33. Again, for the reasons stated in section ii of my analysis, I must disagree with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The Michigan constitutional prohibition against \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d shares the same historical foundation as the Eighth Amendment. Proportionality is not, and has never been, part of that history. Thus, because the <em>Lorentzen </em>decision is not well founded in the history of this provision, the assertion of an opposite conclusion cannot be seriously maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Moreover, the argument advanced by the majority, that history supports a finding that the drafters of the most recent state constitution had a purpose in mind different from that of the Eighth Amendment, fails to take into account the history and events surrounding the debates of the delegates at the 1961 Constitutional Convention. Before 1961, the United States Supreme Court rejected the argument that the rights of the criminally accused contained in the Bill of Rights apply to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. The Warren Court, however, significantly altered state constitutional jurisprudence when it began to use the Fourteenth Amendment as a tool to selectively incorporate the Bill of Rights and make it applicable to the states. The total effect of the selective incorporation doctrine was not yet known by the delegates to the 1961 Michigan Constitutional Convention because <em>Mapp v </em>Ohio, 367 US 643; 81 S Ct 1684; 6 L Ed 2d 1081 (1961), the first case incorporating a rule of criminal procedure to the states, was decided while the convention was meeting. 1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, pp 488-533, 674-688.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The delegates could not predict from the <em>Mapp </em>opinion that in the following decade, all but four of the Bill of Rights guarantees relating to the criminal justice process would be made applicable to the states by the United States Supreme Court. I am persuaded that by extending the guarantees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>of the federal constitution to the residents of our state, the delegates intended the interpretation of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16 to parallel the corresponding federal provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Moreover, even assuming a compelling reason is required to deviate from federal jurisprudence, the majority fails to substantiate its assertion that history provides a \"compelling reason\u201d to find that those who framed and adopted the state provision had a different purpose in mind from those who framed the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">3</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">[T]he risk of assessing evolving standards [of decency] is that it is all too easy to believe that evolution has culminated in one\u2019s own views. <em>[Thompson v </em>Oklahoma, 487 US 815, 865; 108 S Ct 2687; 101 L Ed 2d 702 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">The third \"compelling reason\u201d advanced by the majority is premised on its belief that \"the penalty at issue . . . constitutes an unduly disproportionate response to the serious problems posed by drugs in our society.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 40. This observation parallels the one made in <em>Lorentzen </em>concerning the \"evolving standards of decency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">In responding to this issue, I believe that the amicus curiae supplemental brief of the Prosecuting Attorneys Association correctly identifies the problems with an evolving standards test. As their brief posits at pp 15-16, \"if 'evolving standards of decency\u2019 as to the appropriate (proportionate) sentence for a crime are to be the measure of the constitutionality of a legislatively set penalty, how is such an inquiry to be carried out? What is the measure? What informs the judgment? What tools <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>does a court have to make it? What enables a court to overrule society\u2019s expression of its 'standard of decency,\u2019 communicated through statute, imposing a different standard, which is also supposed to be <em>society\u2019s </em>standard and not the court\u2019s? Would not the court\u2019s role be to <em>discover </em>or <em>identify </em>society\u2019s 'standard of decency\u2019 \u2014 not what it should be, but what it <em>is', </em>and how better could society express [its] standard of decency than through its elected lawmakers? The alternative ... for the judiciary is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">\"it is for <em>us </em>(the judiciary) to judge, not on the basis of what we perceive the Eighth Amendment originally prohibited, or on the basis of what we perceive the society through its democratic processes now overwhelmingly disapproves, but on the basis of what we think 'proportionate\u2019 and 'measurably contributory to acceptable goals of punishment\u2019 \u2014 to say and mean that, is to replace judges of the law with a committee of philosopher-kings. <em>Stanford v Kentucky </em>[492 US 361, 379; 109 S Ct 2969; 106 L Ed 2d 306, 324 (1989)].\u201d [Opinion of Scalia, J., emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Moreover, the same problem arises when a court relies on the \"grossly disproportionate\u201d theory. In tracking Justice Kennedy\u2019s analysis in <em>Harmelin, </em>my colleague, Justice Boyle, suggests that \"[t]o ensure appropriate deference to legislative judgments regarding the gravity of a particular crime, and the extent to which varying penological goals inform the scheme of punishment, a court\u2019s threshold inquiries should be only whether the sentence is grossly disproportionate.\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">However, as I view it, the problem with a \"grossly disproportionate\u201d analysis is that, at best, it is a subjective standard to measure the constitutionality of a sentencing statute under Const 1963, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>art 1, \u00a7 16.1 am persuaded that our inquiry should not be whether a particular defendant\u2019s sentence conflicts with what a justice of this Court might think proper but rather, as Justice Holmes recognized in his dissent in <em>Lochner v New York, </em>198 US 45, 75-76; 25 S Ct 539; 49 L Ed 937 (1905):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">Some . . . laws embody convictions or prejudices which judges are likely to share. Some may not. But a constitution is not intended to embody a particular [theory]. It is made for people of fundamentally differing views, and the accident of our finding certain opinions natural and familiar or novel and even shocking ought not to conclude our judgment upon the question whether statutes embodying them conflict with the Constitution of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Additionally, with all respect, I cannot agree with my colleague Justice Mallett\u2019s conclusion that \"the constitutional infirmity of the statute rests not with the no-parole feature, but with the statute\u2019s mandatory uniform and blanket application to all defendants.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 44. I believe that the Legislature has the constitutional power to enact mandatory sentences requiring uniform application to all defendants convicted of certain crimes. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has opined that except with regard to capital sentences, mandatory sentences are constitutionally permissible. <em>Sumner v Shuman, </em>483 US 66; 107 S Ct 2716; 97 L Ed 2d 56 (1987). However, more problematic, in my opinion, is the fact that Justice Mallett does not provide guidance to trial courts regarding what \"substantial, compelling, objective and verifiable reasons\u201d might render the penalty at issue unconstitutional as applied to a particular defendant. <em>Ante, </em>p 45. Again, while we may disagree with the denial of discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>sentencing in light of individual factors in a particular case, I am persuaded that such determinations are solely within the province of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Not every state has a drug problem as severe as the State of Michigan, and the Legislature appears to have recognized this by penalizing drug dealers with nonparolable life imprisonment. Whether the legislation it enacted to address our drug problem is well conceived, or ill conceived, is not for this Court to decide. Our role is limited; we must make a principled neutral decision with regard to whether the legislative choice of punishment violates Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16 prescription against cruel or unusual punishment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If the question is whether punishment meets the \"evolving standards, of decency,\u201d the answer must come from the democratically elected representatives of the people: the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">In sum, I believe that <em>Lorentzen </em>was wrongly decided, and that the majority has failed to proffer independent grounds or compelling reasons to support its conclusion that Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16 has a different meaning from that of the Eighth Amendment. In essence, my colleagues conclude that a sentence will be considered \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d if a majority of this Court is uncomfortable with the punishment prescribed by the Legislature. The majority today, even in the face of pending legislation that would amend the Controlled Substances Act and reduce the penalties prescribed, has chosen, with deliberation, to step into the breach. However, the fact that the Legislature has not as yet amended the \"no parole\u201d provision of the Controlled Substances Act, is not a sound reason for this Court to assume the legislative mantle.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Therefore, because I cannot persuade my colleagues to exercise restraint, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\"> At the time of her arrest, Ruth Bullock had in her automobile one burnt marijuana cigarette remnant in the ashtray and another in the glove box, along with assorted cocaine paraphernalia and a bag of cocaine residue.

It appears clear, from the majority\u2019s response, that we have an honest philosophical difference over the meaning of \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d and the correctness of <em>Lorentzen. Ante, </em>p 35, n 18. The difference runs deep, even to the meaning of separation of powers. <em>Ante, </em>p 41, n 24. The majority does concede, however, that the <em>Lorentzen </em>Court allowed for differing interpretations of the case law it relied on. <em>Ante, </em>p 35, n 18. Therefore, I invite readers to review the cases referenced in <em>Lorentzen </em>to draw their own conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b149-6\"> The <em>Lorentzen </em>Court refers to several other cases decided by this Court before <em>Morris </em>which do not support a finding of proportionality in the \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d clause. In <em>Cummins v People, </em>42 Mich 142; 3 NW 305 (1879), the first reported decision in which this Court considered the \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d clause of Const 1850, art 6, \u00a7 31, we rejected the argument that a sentence was \"cruel or unusual\u201d when the punishment imposed was <em>within </em>the penalty prescribed by the Legislature. <em>Id. </em>at 144. Nine years later, the Court struck down a penalty, under the \"excessive fines\u201d clause of Const 1850, art 6, \u00a7 31, that required a druggist to forfeit his business for five years after twice being convicted of violating the state liquor law. <em>Robison v Miner, </em>68 Mich 549; 37 NW 21 (1888). The <em>Robison </em>Court surveyed the common law and concluded that the law had never inflicted such a severe penalty for any type of similar criminal behavior. <em>Id. </em>at 563. Chief Justice Sherwood agreed with the majority that the forfeiture penalty was an \"excessive fine,\u201d as prohibited by Const 1850, art 6, \u00a7 31, but admonished his colleagues to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">pause long and consider well the action by the Legislature in establishing [the penalties], before it will say those fixed by its enactments are so far in excess of what is necessary to furnish the protection desired as to be obnoxious to the Constitution .... <em>[Id. </em>at 574.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">It is important to note that the <em>Robison </em>Court did not refer to <em>Cummins </em>because the issue in <em>Robison </em>was whether a fine was \"excessive\u201d under the state liquor law, rather than whether the fine was \"cruel or unusual punishment.\u201d A few months later, the Court was asked to clarify its position in <em>Robison </em>and determine if the penalty for violating the liquor law as a first offender was also constitutionally defective as an \"excessive fine.\u201d <em>Luton v Newaygo Circuit Judge, </em>69 Mich 610; 37 NW 701 (1888). Although uncomfortable with the penalty, the Court held that it was not an excessive fine.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-9\">While we may think this penalty a very severe one for a first offense, yet it is one within the discretion of the Legislature, with which discretion the courts cannot interfere. . . . <em>Whether such distinction was made wisely or unwisely is no concern of the courts, provided the Legislature had the power to make it. The injustice of the statute, if it exists, must be remedied by the people through the Legislature. [Id. </em>at 613-614. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">Next, in <em>People v Murray, </em>72 Mich 10; 40 NW 29 (1888), the defendant challenged his conviction and sentence of fifty years for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>statutory rape as \"cruel or unusual punishment\u201d under Const 1850, art 6, \u00a7 31. The challenge to his punishment, however, was not aimed at the underlying statute (permitting indeterminate sentencing), but rather to the penalty imposed by the trial judge. The <em>Murray </em>Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">Where the punishment for an offense is for a term of years, to be fixed by the judge, it should never be made to extend beyond the average period of persons in prison life, which seldom exceeds 25 years. <em>[Id. </em>at 17.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Although cited in <em>Lorentzen, </em>the Court, in <em>People v Armstrong, </em>73 Mich 288; 41 NW 275 (1889), never addressed the issue that the defendant\u2019s punishment was \"cruel or unusual,\u201d because it found that the municipality did not have the authority to enact the ordinance in question.

I would hold that the statute is not grossly disproportionate under either the Eighth Amendment or Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16, each of which contain a proportionality principle. For the reasons stated by Justice Kennedy in his concurrence in <em>Harmelin v Michigan, </em>501 US \u2014; 111 S Ct 2680; 115 L Ed 2d 836 (1991), I also believe that the mechanistic formula applied in <em>People v Lorentzen, </em>387 Mich 167; 194 NW2d 827 (1972), fails to give sufficient deference to the judgment of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Nevertheless, although I am in agreement with Justices Riley and Mallett that Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16 does not require a different interpretation than the federal constitution, it is neither permissible to conclude that Michigan\u2019s cruel or unusual punishment provision provides less protection than the Eighth Amendment (Justice Riley),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> nor necessary to accept the suggestion that <em>Lorentzen </em>was rightly decided (Justice Mallett). The Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Harmelin </em>recognizes a proportionality principle, and, under either constitution, the mandatory penalty is not facially disproportionate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">I write separately to briefly state my reasons for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>agreement with Justice Mallett\u2019s conclusion that proportionality review is not precluded by either the state or federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In <em>Harmelin v Michigan, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court upheld Michigan\u2019s mandatory statutory penalty against an Eighth Amendment challenge. In so doing, a splintered Court offered differing approaches to the question whether a proportionality principle is embodied in the protections afforded by the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the United States Constitution. Justice Scalia announced that the understanding of the Eighth Amendment articulated in <em>Solem v Helm, </em>.463 US 277; 103 S Ct 3001; 77 L Ed 2d 637 (1983), \"was simply wrong; the Eighth Amendment contains no proportionality guarantee.\u201d <em>Harmelin, </em>111 S Ct 2686. Chief Justice Rehnquist was the only other justice to agree with this analysis. Justice Kennedy, emphasizing the principle of stare decisis, concluded that \"the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause encompasses a narrow proportionality principle.\u201d <em>Id., </em>111 S Ct 2702. Justices O\u2019Connor and Souter joined in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Because the United States Supreme Court recognizes a proportionality principle limiting punishment in noncapital punishment cases, proportionality is part of this state\u2019s prohibition<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>cruel or unusual punishment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The scope of that principle is hazy, and the proper test for considering its application in any particular case is subject to dispute. <em>Harmelin </em>did not resolve that dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Notwithstanding Justice Scalia\u2019s suggestion that no proportionality principle survives outside the death penalty context, it is apparent that seven justices of the Court do not agree. Justice Kennedy emphasized that several principles can be discerned regarding the proper scope and method of proportionality review. First, Justice Kennedy stressed the notion that decisions regarding the length of prison terms constituted a \"substantive penological judgment\u201d predicated upon \"[djeterminations about the nature and purposes of punishment for criminal acts implicating] difficult and enduring questions respecting the sanctity of the individual, the nature of law, and the relation between law and the social order.\u201d <em>Id., </em>111 S Ct 2703. Second, Justice Kennedy emphasized the belief that the Eighth Amendment \"does not mandate adoption of any one penological theory.\u201d <em>Id., </em>111 S Ct 2704. Third, Justice Kennedy underscored the importance of federalism and its recognition that states adhering to different \"penological assumptions\u201d might arrive at differing \"sentencing schemes.\u201d <em>Id., </em>111 S Ct 2704. Finally, Justice Kennedy highlighted the principle that sentencing review should be based on objective factors as much as possible. <em>Id. </em>Summarizing, Justice Kennedy observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">All of these principles \u2014 the primacy of the legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>lature, the variety of legitimate penological schemes, the nature of our federal system, and the requirement that proportionality review be guided by objective factors \u2014 inform the final one: the Eighth Amendment does not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence. Rather, it forbids only extreme sentences that are \"grossly disproportionate\u201d to the crime. <em>[Harmelin, </em>111 S Ct 2705, quoting <em>Solem.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">The dissenters in <em>Harmelin </em>advocated a broader interpretation of the proportionality principle. Justice White, joined by Justices Blackmun and Stevens, urged continued use of the three-factor test employed in <em>Solem </em>emphasizing that punishment must be \"tailored to a defendant\u2019s personal responsibility and moral guilt.\u201d <em>Harmelin, </em>111 S Ct 2716. Justice Marshall dissented as did Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun concurred. The linchpin of analysis in each of the separate dissents was the notion that a proportionality principle is embodied in the Eighth Amendment and requires the Court to scrutinize legislative enactments to determine whether the punishment is disproportionate. <em>Harmelin, </em>111 S Ct 2709-2720.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Like federal authority, our own precedents recognize a proportionality principle, but fail to provide a clear answer to the manner of review or the scope of protection afforded by the proportionality principle embodied in Michigan\u2019s Constitution. Chief Justice Cavanagh traces his proportionality analysis to this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Lorentzen. Ante, </em>pp 34-35. He apparently advocates a broad proportionality review, although he concludes that \"even under Justice Kennedy\u2019s restrictive view of <em>Solem, </em>it is clear that an application of Solem\u2019s first prong leads to an inference of gross disproportionality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 39, quoting <em>Harmelin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">I disagree with the majority regarding both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>scope of the inquiry and the result. Since a majority of the United States Supreme Court has not agreed with Justice Scalia\u2019s view that <em>\"Solem </em>was simply wrong,\u201d <em>Harmelin, </em>111 S Ct 2686, we may not disregard the precedents of that Court, and must attempt to predict how a majority of the Supreme Court would describe its contours.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">I would apply a narrow proportionality principle to sentencing cases such as this one. To ensure appropriate deference to legislative judgments regarding the gravity of a particular crime, and the extent to which varying penological goals inform the scheme of punishment, a court\u2019s threshold inquiries should be only whether the sentence is grossly disproportionate. In this case, the sentence is mandatory life without parole for the crime of possession of more than 650 grams of cocaine. This penalty is not grossly disproportionate on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The issue before us is defendant Hasson\u2019s challenge to the statute on its face.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the absolute magnitude of the crime is grave and the principle of proportionality does not permit the judiciary to impose on the Legislature its subjec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>tive view of appropriate responses to perceived evils, the statutory scheme passes constitutional muster. Our Legislature has created a statutory scheme that gives clear notice that punishment is tied to quantity, rather than to the underlying act, thus actually reducing the likelihood that sentencing discretion will subject an unwary offender to the ranges of an indeterminate scheme. The majority\u2019s finding that the penalty is cruel or unusual because it is imposed for mere possession of cocaine without any proof of intent to sell or deliver, is simply a non sequitur. The clear purpose of the Legislature is to deter the possibility of dissemination of such an amount, whether it is possessed with intent to deliver, or is subsequently lost, stolen, or misplaced.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To suggest that the penalty is grossly excessive because that possibility is neither rational nor sufficiently grave, requires accepting the unacceptable. No sentient citizen of Michigan can ignore the barbarousness of the drug culture, the destructive effects on our children, and the threat to the very survival of our urban centers. To suggest that the crime is not grave because it is not violent, is, as Justice Kennedy observed, \"false to the point of absurdity.\u201d <em>Harmelin, </em>111 S Ct 2706.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Unquestionably, the sentence is harsh. Nevertheless, where the social harm caused by the criminal conduct at issue is as devastating as that created by the drug epidemic in existence today, the penalty is not unconstitutional._</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">It must be emphasized that the United States Supreme Court has forcefully observed that the proportionality principle will rarely result in a successful challenge because of the \"substantial deference that must be accorded legislatures and sentencing courts . . . <em>Solem, supra </em>at 290, n 16. Indeed, the prosecution does not dispute that in some rare case on its particular facts the statute may be unconstitutionally applied. <em>People v Broadie, </em>37 NY2d 100; 332 NE2d 338 (1975).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Thus, the mere fact that a punishment falls within statutory limits of a constitutional statute does not end the inquiry.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Even where a statute is concededly valid, there may exist extraordinary circumstances that render it unconstitutional as applied under the facts of the case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Institutional concerns counsel \u2022 a cautious approach to review of sentence length lest a court merely substitute its judgment of the most appropriate punishment in light of its judgment regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ing the gravity and social harm attached to the conduct. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit explained these concerns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-4\">It is one thing for a court such as we to contemplate an extreme case such as the felonizing of overtime parking, striking down such an action as outlandish, and quite another for us to interfere in the various gradations of punishment specified by the legislator for crimes which <em>no </em>one disputes are serious ones \u2014 and to do so on Constitutional grounds, at that. We may be competent to contemplate outrageous disproportion and declare that it cannot be; certainly, however, we are not equipped, nor do our procedures lend themselves to equipping us, with the factual knowledge and common sense of what <em>is </em>proportional, what punishments <em>should </em>be administered for particular offenses, and along what general lines the positive legislative attack on criminality should proceed. One who is to do this has need, like Antaeus, to touch the earth pretty frequently, an exercise to which our isolation does not conduce. <em>[Terrebonne v </em>Butler, 848 F2d 500, 506-507 (CA 5, 1988).

Further, a proposal to abolish the death penalty was rejected during the Constitutional Convention of 1835 and was only implemented by the Legislature eight years later, after several failed attempts.

That fact may suggest to the Legislature that an escape hatch is also appropriate in the over 650-gram situation. The question is, of course, for the Legislature to resolve.
