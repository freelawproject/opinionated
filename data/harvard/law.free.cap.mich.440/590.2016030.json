We also consider whether intoxication can turn an intentional act into an accidental one under the insurance policy language.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">On New Year\u2019s Eve, 1983, eighteen-year-old Arthur Smith went out with a friend, bought a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>twelve-pack of beer, and drove around awhile drinking. Smith drank six of the twelve beers in approximately thirty to forty-five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Smith and his friend then went to a New Year\u2019s Eve party where Smith drank two more beers and a pint of peppermint schnapps, except for four shots drunk by a friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">About 11:00 p.m., Smith left the party and began walking home. He knew that he was drunk and that his speech was slurred. Officer Czopek, a defendant in the instant action, testified that he saw Smith walking down the center of Gudith Road, weaving from side to side. As a result, Smith was interfering with traffic and putting himself at great risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Officer Czopek stopped his car, turned around, and drove back down the road. He pulled up next to Smith and tried to talk him into getting off the road. Smith refused and became belligerent. Czopek then made a u-turn, radioed for back-up assistance, and watched Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Smith turned off the road and began to walk across a field to avoid the traffic light at the corner of West and Gudith Roads. He then tried to cross West Road. As he started to cross the street, he dove or fell into the westbound lane of traffic. Officer Czopek drew even with Smith and again told him to get out of the road. Smith again began shouting at the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">Czopek turned into a nearby driveway near Smith, got out of the car, and called to Smith. Instead of listening to the officer, Smith stopped and, as Czopek approached, began shouting that he had to go home because his father was going to kill him. Officer Czopek tried to calm him down, but Smith grabbed him by the lapels. Czopek then realized that Smith was extremely drunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">When Corporal Herdis Petty arrived on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>scene, Smith became hostile and belligerent. The two policemen tried to handcuff Smith. The struggle which ensued lasted nearly one hour. Smith lay on the ground and kicked and swung his legs. As the two police officers tried to put him into the police car, he wrapped one leg around part of the car while still kicking with the other. Each time they got him partially in the car, Smith tried to get out.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">As a result of their struggle with Smith, Officers Czopek and Petty suffered injuries. Officer Czopek suffered frostbite on one of his hands; Officer Petty had some ribs broken where Smith kicked him. Smith also bit his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Smith admitted that he knowingly resisted arrest because he did not want to go to jail. However, he did not recall kicking or hitting anyone and, because of this, did not think he harmed either officer. He admitted, however, that he intended to resist arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">Smith was charged with assault and battery, and was fined $250 at his criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">The officers filed a civil suit against Smith\u2019s parents. Group Insurance Company of Michigan (gicom) was the parents\u2019 homeowner\u2019s insurer. It filed the instant action, asking the court to declare that it was not required to defend or indemnify Arthur Smith. Trial judge Richard Hathaway granted gicom\u2019s motion for summary disposition. The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court\u2019s decision in an unpublished opinion per curiam.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">In lieu of granting leave to appeal, this Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins Co v DiCicco, </em>432 Mich 656; 443 NW2d 734 (1989), and to discuss whether forcibly resisting arrest can be considered an \"occurrence\u201d within the policy language, regardless of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the injury was intended or expected from the standpoint of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">On remand, the Court of Appeals again found in an unpublished opinion per curiam in favor of gicom. According to the panel, there was no \"occurrence\u201d within the meaning of the policy. Further, the panel found that even in light of the <em>DiCicco </em>\"intended or expected\u201d language, the incident fell within the exclusionary clause of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Officers Czopek and Petty filed an application for leave to appeal in this Court on November 16, 1990. We granted leave to determine whether the injuries suffered were the result of an occurrence. Further, we consider whether an intoxication can vitiate making the insured\u2019s actions \"accidental\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">We find that Arthur Smith\u2019s actions were intentional, and therefore there was no \"occurrence\u201d as defined within the policy. Further, we find that an intoxicated person can intend the results of his actions. Thus, an intoxicated person\u2019s actions need not be considered \"accidental\u201d under the policy. We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in favor of plaintiff gicom.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">The first step in determining if an insurance policy applies is to determine whether the policy is clear and unambiguous on its face. If an ambiguity exists, the policy must be construed in favor of the insured. <em>Powers v DAIIE, </em>427 Mich 602, 624; 398 NW2d 411 (1986). Under the heading Coverages, the policy at issue states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-11\">COVERAGE E \u2014 PERSONAL LIABILITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-12\">This Company agrees to pay on behalf of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage, to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The next heading in the policy is \"Exclusions,\u201d under which the following appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">This policy does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">1. Under Coverage e \u2014 Personal Liability and Coverage f \u2014 Medical Payments to Others:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">f. to bodily injury or property damage which is either expected or intended from the standpoint of the Insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">On the same page, under the heading \"Additional Definitions,\u201d the policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-11\">5. \"occurrence\u201d: means an accident, including injurious exposure to conditions, which results, during the policy term, in bodily injury or property damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">The terms used in an insurance policy either are clearly defined within the policy or are given their commonly used meaning. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins Co v Ex-Cell-O Corp, </em>702 F Supp 1317, 1323, n 7 (ED Mich, 1988). Omitting the definition of a word that has a common usage does not create an ambiguity within the policy. We conclude that the provisions in the gicom policy are clear and unambiguous. We cannot create ambiguity where none exists. <em>Edgar\u2019s Warehouse, Inc v United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co, </em>375 Mich 598, 602; 134 NW2d 746 (1965). It is also improper for us to rephrase or interpret the clear and unambiguous language of the policy. Instead, we must enforce the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>of this contract as it is written. <em>Eghotz v Creech, </em>365 Mich 527, 530; 113 NW2d 815 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Further, the exclusions to the general liability in a policy of insurance are to be strictly construed against the insurer. <em>Francis v Scheper, </em>326 Mich 441, 448; 40 NW2d 214 (1949). Clear and specific exclusions must be enforced. An insurance company cannot be found liable for a risk it did not assume. <em>Illinois Employers Ins of Wausau v Dragovich, </em>139 Mich App 502, 507-508; 362 NW2d 767 (1984); <em>Kaczmarck v La Perriere, </em>337 Mich 500; 60 NW2d 327 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">We must consider whether Arthur Smith\u2019s assault on officers Petty and Czopek constituted an \"occurrence\u201d under the policy. We find that it did not. The policy language supplied coverage on behalf of the insured for all of the bodily injuries caused by the insured that constituted an occurrence. An occurrence is defined by the policy as \"an accident, including injurious exposure to conditions, which results, during the policy term, in bodily injury or property damage.\u201d The meaning of \"accident\u201d in insurance policies has been defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">anything that begins to be, that happens, or that is a result which is not anticipated and is unforeseen and unexpected by the person injured or affected thereby \u2014 that is, takes place without the insured\u2019s foresight or expectation and without design or intentional causation on his part. In other words, an accident is an undesigned contingency, a casualty, a happening by chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated, and not naturally to be expected. <em>[Guerdon Industries, Inc v Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number><em>of New York, </em>371 Mich 12, 18-19; 123 NW2d 143 (1963).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In his deposition, Mr. Smith admitted that he intended to prevent the arrest. His actions, biting and swinging his arms and legs, were intended to make it impossible for the officers to easily get him into the squad car and on his way to the police station. Because of Arthur Smith\u2019s admission in his deposition, we are unwilling to conclude that his resisting arrest, which resulted in injuries to the policemen, was an \"accident.\u201d It clearly was not an undesigned contingency or something that happened by chance. <em>Guerdon, supra. </em>Unlike the Court in <em>DiCicco, </em>we do not find that the factual situation in this case is so unclear as to allow us to say that there was an occurrence. Accordingly, we agree with the Court of Appeals that forcibly resisting arrest is not an \"accident\u201d within the meaning of the insurance policy\u2019s definition of \"occurrence,\u201d thus coverage for the officer\u2019s injuries is barred under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The next question before us is whether intoxication can vitiate intent so that the actor\u2019s acts can be considered accidental under the policy. We believe that an intoxicated actor can be liable for his actions, and that such actions might be said to be unintentional for purposes of insurance policy language.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Defendant Arthur Smith consumed a substantial amount of alcohol before he assaulted the police officers. Yet, he admitted in a deposition that he knew he was resisting arrest and that two men were trying to get him into a police car. This shows that Smith was capable of forming some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>intent even though he was significantly intoxicated. Further, he resisted arrest for nearly an hour. Again, it is evident that Arthur Smith was capable of expecting his actions to harm the officers. Mr. Smith\u2019s resisting arrest was not rendered accidental simply because he happened to be intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The Court of Appeals recently looked at the question of voluntary intoxication in terms of insurance policies and determined that intoxication is not a factor mitigating intent. In <em>Allstate </em>Ins <em>Co v Hampton, </em>173 Mich App 65; 433 NW2d 334 (1988), the plaintiff sought declaratory judgment to establish that it did not have a duty to provide coverage for the defendant under a homeowner\u2019s policy. Defendant James Hampton allegedly engaged in sexual relations with his adopted twelve-year-old daughter, and she sued to recover under his homeowner\u2019s policy. The policy language excluded coverage for bodily injury that could reasonably have been expected to result from the intentional or criminal acts of the insured or that were intended by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Defendant Hampton argued that his voluntary intoxication should vitiate intent. The Court of Appeals found that \"[wjhere an insured voluntarily ingests alcohol, he may not, as a defense to an exclusionary clause in an insurance policy such as the one at bar, assert that he lacked the capacity to form the intent to act or harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The panel found support for its position in <em>Allstate Ins Co v Sherrill, </em>566 F Supp 1286 (ED Mich, 1983), where the plaintiff sought declaratory judgment to determine if it was required to provide coverage under a homeowner\u2019s policy for a series of outrageous acts committed by the insured. Richard Sherrill\u2019s policy contained language that excluded coverage for bodily injury that was ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>pected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Richard Sherrill walked into a convenience store with a gun, robbed the cashier, abducted her, and then violently sexually assaulted the woman. He pled nolo contendere to the charges. However, he claimed that because he had ingested three \"hits\u201d of mescaline (an hallucinogen), approximately one and one-half bottles of schnapps, and several bottles of beer, and had smoked two or three marijuana cigarettes before he walked into the store, he could not form the intent necessary to be convicted of the crimes. Sherrill claimed he had no recollection of the crimes he committed that night, that his acute intoxication prevented him from being able to form the intent to harm, and that he lacked the capacity to intentionally act. <em>Id. </em>at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The court did not agree. It stated that public policy required that \"a voluntary departure of one\u2019s good judgment and rational decision-making abilities should not permit the insured to abrogate his financial responsibility to those he brutally injures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The court held that \"where an insured voluntarily ingests alcohol or drugs he may not assert a defense to an exclusionary clause such as the one at bar based on his lack of capacity to form the intent to act or harm, where the defense is based solely on the effects of the alcohol and/or drugs.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>We find the reasoning applied by the Courts in <em>Sherrill </em>and <em>Hampton </em>persuasive. An intoxicated person is responsible for his actions, even though he may have voluntarily ingested intoxicating substances. In the case before us, Arthur Smith, of his own accord, consumed a significant amount of alcohol. He admits that he remembers some of what occurred between him and the police officers. The fact that Smith drank eight beers and a bottle of schnapps does not excuse the fact that he resisted arrest and assaulted two policemen.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The precedent of self-immunity that such a policy would create would allow commission of a crime without the requisite responsibility. Further, to allow voluntary intoxication as a defense in a civil action is also unjust. Where an insured willingly consumes an intoxicating substance, he may not use that consumption as a defense to the requirement of intent in an insurance policy. To allow such a defense would be to create the ability to act unwisely without the requisite financial responsibility. Arthur Smith\u2019s actions are not covered under his parents\u2019 homeowner\u2019s policy because they cannot be considered accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">We find that, because there was no occurrence resulting from Mr. Smith\u2019s actions, coverage for the injuries suffered by the officers is barred. Further, it is possible for an intoxicated individual to form the requisite intent to purposely injure others. Intoxication does not vitiate or mitigate that intent. Arthur Smith intended to injure officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Petty and Czopek in some manner when he resisted arrest, and therefore, because there was no occurrence, coverage under the gicom policy is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We therefore affirm the Court of Appeals resolution of this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b702-6\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, Riley, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Mallett, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\"> See Justice Levin\u2019s dissent, <em>post, </em>p 630, n 27. In <em>Sherrill, </em>the court followed an established legal principle. Because no Michigan law existed on the topic, the federal court was required to determine what a Michigan state court would do when confronted with a similar case. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">Recognizing the lack of judicial guidance on this issue, the Court believes that if confronted with this question the Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>gan Courts would be constrained to hold that such a defense is not available to one whose alleged incapacity results solely from a voluntary ingestion of alcohol or drugs. [566 F Supp 1288.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Boyle, J.</p>\n<p id=\"AIf7\"><em>(concurring). </em>I agree with the majority that the insurer does not have a duty to defend in the underlying tort action, and I agree that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed. I also agree that in this context voluntary intoxication does not provide the insured with a defense to the operation of an intentional-acts exclusion. I write separately to state that because the insurance contract does not require an examination of the accidental nature of the event from the insured\u2019s perspective to determine whether an \"accident\u201d that resulted in the officers\u2019 bodily injuries was an occurrence, the accidental nature of the event must be viewed from the officers\u2019 perspective. I would hold that the injuries received by the officers were the result of an accident, and that, therefore, the injuries were caused by an occurrence. I would also hold that because the officers\u2019 injuries were caused by an occurrence, an examination of the intentional-acts exclusion is necessary. The language of the policy mandates that the insured\u2019s subjective intent both to act and to injure be examined relative to the exclusion for intentional injuries. It is not disputed that the insured intentionally resisted arrest and intentionally bit the police officer. Because the insured fought with the officers for almost an hour in subfreezing weather, the officers\u2019 injuries were expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured and are therefore excluded from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">As the lead opinion sets forth, on remand from this Court the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court, which had ordered Group Insurance Company of Michigan (gicom) to defend its insured in the underlying negligence claim. Unpublished opinion per curiam, decided October 26, 1990 (Docket No. 127020). The Court held that \"Smith\u2019s voluntary ingestion of excessive amounts of alcohol resulting in his forcibly resisting arrest was not an 'accident\u2019 within the meaning of the insurance policy\u2019s definition of 'occurrence.\u2019 \u201d It reasoned that because the insured admitted in his deposition that he intended to resist arrest, and because the insured \"described his intentional physical acts of resistance, such as biting the officer,\u201d it was \"unwilling to hold that his voluntary intoxication and his wilful, unlawful resistance resulting in injury, was an 'accident,\u2019 an undesigned contingency or something which happened by chance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Judge Murphy dissented and stated that, \"the majority on remand has failed to address the issue framed by the Supreme Court.\u201d He reasoned that, while an insured may not use voluntary intoxication to avoid an exclusion in an insurance contract, the insured\u2019s voluntary intoxication was not relevant to the threshold issue of insurance coverage. According to Judge Murphy, there simply was nothing in the coverage clause, \"the 'occurrence\u2019 language,\u201d that would \"prevent[] acts committed by the insured as a result of intoxication from qualifying as occurrences under the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">I agree with Judge Murphy\u2019s conclusion. Because the language of the insurance contract does not specify the perspective from which to view an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>accident that results in bodily injury,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the accidental nature of the incident must be evaluated from the standpoint of the injured person. The officers did not invite Smith\u2019s attack, and thus their resultant bodily injuries were \"caused by an occurrence.\u201d I would further hold that because Smith admitted that he intended to resist arrest and intended to injure the officer by biting him, and because the underlying complaint is based on the insured\u2019s intentional acts of \"pushing, striking, punching, biting and kicking\u201d the officers, gicom does not owe its insured, Smith, a duty to defend him in the underlying negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\"Insurance policies have a common structure.\u201d Fischer, <em>The exclusion from insurance coverage of losses caused by the intentional acts of the insured: A policy in search of a justi\u00f1cation, </em>30 Santa Clara L R 95, 103 (1990). Policies describe what they cover, \"the scope of coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After defining the scope of coverage, policies contain the \" 'take aways,\u2019 \u201d or exclusions. <em>Id. </em>There are, therefore, two ways in which an insurer may limit its duties toward its insured: it may draft its coverage clause to include only certain events, or it may specifically exclude events through an exclusionary clause. <em>Id. </em>at 105.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>The duty to defend exists if the allegations in the underlying complaint \"even arguably\u201d fall within acts covered by the policy. <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman </em>and <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins Co v DiCicco, </em>432 Mich 656, 662; 443 NW2d 734 (1989). It is the substance of the complaint that controls, and we focus on the \"basis for the injury,\u201d <em>id., </em>to resolve the arguable scope of coverage. See also <em>Illinois Employers Ins of Wausau v Dragovich, </em>139 Mich App 502; 362 NW2d 767 (1984); <em>Reurink Bros Star Silo, Inc v Maryland Casualty Co, </em>131 Mich App 139; 345 NW2d 659 (1983).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">This is not to say that liability insurance is litigation insurance. The duty to defend is limited by the exclusions in the insurance contract. <em>Meridian Mut Ins Co v Hunt, </em>168 Mich App 672, 677; 425 NW2d 111 (1988). \"The insurer is not required to defend against claims for damage expressly excluded from policy coverage. The exception in the policy is part of the contract between the parties.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Thus, gicom has a duty to defend Smith if the acts and injuries alleged in the underlying tort complaint arguably come within the scope of acts and injuries covered under the insurance contract with Smith\u2019s parents. If, however, these acts and injuries also fall within the class of acts and injuries expressly excluded by the policy, coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>is precluded, and gicom does not owe Smith a duty to defend in the underlying tort action. As we held in <em>Freeman/DiCicco, supra </em>at 668, the analysis of the question \"requires that we first determine whether coverage exists, and then whether an exclusion precludes coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The coverage clause in \"Section n Coverages\u201d of the policy issued by gicom provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">This Company agrees to pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage, to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence.

Emphasis added.]<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">However, while it is correct in the context of accident insurance to say that an accident is an event that takes place \"without the <em>insured\u2019s </em>foresight or expectation and without design or intentional causation on his part,\u201d because the insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>and the injured person are one and the same, see, generally, 43 Am Jur 2d, Insurance, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, pp 73-79, this conclusion does not follow in the context of analyzing a contract of liability insurance. In the latter context, the insured may or may not be the party injured. We therefore look to the words of the insurance contract at issue to determine from which perspective the parties intended to view the accidental nature of the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"AnPm\">As observed in <em>Freeman/DiCicco, </em>before 1966, a split of authority existed regarding the perspective from which to view the accidental nature of the injury claimed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even where the insured intended to injure the victim, the majority of courts addressing the question held that the accidental nature of the injuries must be viewed from the victim\u2019s standpoint. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the injuries were the result of an accident, and the insurer was liable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Competing policy questions dictated the conflicting results. On the one hand, individuals should not be indemnified for intentional injuries inflicted upon another. On the other hand, injured persons should be compensated for their losses. Viewing the accidental nature of the injury from the victim\u2019s standpoint promoted the compensation policy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Those courts viewing the accidental nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>the injury from the insured\u2019s standpoint promoted the deterrence policy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">As a result of the competing policies and conflicting decisions, the National Bureau of Casualty Underwriters and the Mutual Insurance Rating Bureau revised the standard policy language in 1966 to make it clear that the accidental nature of the event was to be viewed from the insured\u2019s perspective.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The industry addressed the possibility of viewing the accidental nature of the event from the victim\u2019s perspective by specifically providing that it was to be viewed \"from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Because gicom\u2019s policy is silent with respect to the question from whose perspective the \"accident\u201d is to be viewed, we are faced with answering the same question presented before the 1966 revision of liability insurance policy language. While other insurance policies include the viewpoint in their definitions of \"occurrence,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the instant policy does not. It provides coverage for \"occurrences\u201d and defines occurrences as \"accident[s] . . . which result[ ] ... in bodily injury or property damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Where the policy is silent regarding perspective, the court must evaluate the accidental nature of the injury from the victim\u2019s perspective. <em>Ashland Oil, Inc v Miller Oil Purchasing Co, </em>678 F2d 1293 (CA 5, 1982). In <em>Ashland Oil, </em>the insured carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>liability insurance through two different insurers. One had specified in the policy that the accidental nature of the occurrence should be evaluated from the insured\u2019s standpoint and one had not. Because one policy did not specify the standpoint, and because Louisiana case law provided that such occurrences be evaluated from the standpoint of the injured party, the court held that, under the policy that did not specify the perspective, the accidental nature of the occurrence must be evaluated from the victim\u2019s perspective. As a result, the intentional injection of hazardous materials into an oil company\u2019s pipeline was an \"occurrence\u201d under one policy and was not an \"occurrence\u201d under the policy that provided that the damage be neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 1320-1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">We have not been directed to, nor has independent research disclosed, decisions in this jurisdiction holding that the accidental nature of an injury is to be viewed from the victim\u2019s perspective in interpreting homeowners\u2019 insurance policies. However, there is authority that holds that under general automobile liability policies injuries are accidents, even when intentionally inflicted. In <em>State Farm Mut Automobile Ins Co v Coon, </em>46 Mich App 503; 208 NW2d 532 (1973), the Court of Appeals evaluated authority both from Michigan and from other jurisdictions and held that, where the insured intentionally drove his vehicle, striking a pedestrian, the accidental nature of the event should be viewed from the victim\u2019s standpoint. The Court noted, however, that if the victim acted as the aggressor, the event would not be an accident, and coverage would not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">A law enforcement officer, acting within the scope of his duties, will not be deemed to have been the aggressor in an altercation. <em>Tomlin v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><em>State Farm Mut Automobile Liability Ins Co, </em>95 Wis 2d 215; 290 NW2d 285 (1980). Thus, a state trooper who had stopped a vehicle and was stabbed by the driver was accidentally injured under the driver\u2019s automobile liability policy. The court noted that the accidental nature of the injury must be viewed from the victim\u2019s perspective. This was true in general liability policies, and the court saw no reason to apply a different rule to automobile liability policies. Furthermore, where the officer was acting within the scope of his duties as a law enforcement officer, he would not be deemed the aggressor who started the chain of events that led to his stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Similarly, where a garage owner shot a person during a dispute, the injuries were suffered accidentally when viewed from the victim\u2019s perspective. <em>New Amsterdam Casualty Co v Jones, </em>135 F2d 191 (CA 6, 1943). Analyzing and applying Michigan law, the court held that \"whether the injury is an accident, is to be determined from the standpoint of the one suffering it, rather than from the standpoint of the one inflicting it . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193. The court stressed, however, that it was not the insured who was seeking indemnity in this instance, but, rather, it was the victim who had attempted to collect a judgment from the insurance company through garnishment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In the absence of language in the insurance contract indicating an intent to the contrary, I agree that, because the officers were performing their duties as law enforcement officers, they did not act as aggressors in the instant case. From the officers\u2019 perspective, Smith\u2019s resisting arrest, which caused frostbite, broken ribs, and a bitten hand, were all undesigned contingencies, casualties, happenings by chance, out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>not naturally to be expected. The injuries were the result of-an accident, and were, therefore, caused by an occurrence as required for coverage under gicom\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The policy language itself supports this interpretation. Gicom has made it clear that it is able to specify the viewpoint to be used when it so desires. The intentional-acts exclusion in the gicom policy expressly states that the bodily injury that results from an insured\u2019s acts may not be expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured. Had gicom wished to expressly provide the perspective from which to view the accidental nature of the injury, it could have done so in the definition of \"occurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The conclusion that the injuries suffered by the officers were caused by an occurrence does not resolve the question of the insurer\u2019s duty to defend. Gicom\u2019s policy provides that it does not apply \"to bodily injury or property damage which is either expected or intended from the standpoint of the Insured.\u201d The language is unambiguous, <em>Freeman/DiCicco, supra, </em>and requires that we look to the subjective intent or expectation of the insured to determine whether the officers\u2019 injuries will be excluded from coverage. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The intentional-injury exclusion applies where the insured intended to act and also intended or expected to injure the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 718. Once the intent to act and the intent or expectation to injure are present, it is \" 'immaterial that the actual harm caused was of a different character or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>magnitude from that intended by the insured . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting anno: <em>Construction and application of provision of liability insurance policy expressly excluding injuries intended or expected by insured, </em>31 ALR4th 957, 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">While the insured stated that he was surprised to learn that the officers had been injured, he admitted intending to prevent his arrest. He also admitted intending to bite the officer to prevent the officer from \"yank[ing] the side of [his] face off.\u201d Thus, the insured intended to actively resist arrest, and intended to injure by biting the officer. Once the intent to injure is shown, it is irrelevant that the injury was different from that intended by the insured. Furthermore, the insured fought with the police officers for nearly an hour in subfreezing temperatures. \"[T]o claim that the insured did not expect or intend to cause injury 'flies in the face of all reason, common sense and experience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Freeman/DiCicco, supra </em>at 720, quoting <em>CNA Ins Co v McGinnis, </em>282 Ark 90, 93; 666 SW2d 689 (1984). Certainly all \"reason, common sense and experience\u201d tell us that frostbite will occur from exposure to subfreezing temperatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Not only has the insured admitted intending to act and intending to injure the officers, but the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not allege acts that arguably escape the exclusion and come within the policy coverage. We look beyond the nomenclature<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in the complaint to its substance, <em>Freeman/ </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>DiCicco, supra </em>at 663; <em>Dragovich, supra </em>at 507, and focus on the \"basis for the injury,\u201d not the form of the complaint. <em>Freeman/DiCicco, supra </em>at 662. See also <em>Dragovich, supra </em>at 507.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The underlying complaint alleges that Smith \"negligently and repeatedly cause[d] injury to the Plaintiffs by pushing, striking, punching, biting and kicking the Plaintiffs on or about their bodies.\u201d While the complaint earlier alleges that, because of his intoxication, Smith \"lacked voluntary control over his actions,\u201d Smith\u2019s own deposition testimony belies this allegation. He admitted biting the officer and admitted resisting arrest. The basis for the officers\u2019 injuries, therefore, was Smith\u2019s intentional act and not negligence as expressly alleged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The events and injuries of December 31, 1983, were an \"occurrence\u201d as defined in gicom\u2019s policy. However, the bodily injuries suffered by the officers were intended or expected from the standpoint of its insured and are therefore specifically excluded under the policy. The insured intended to act and intended or expected to injure the officers. His conduct falls squarely within the intentional-acts exclusion as written in gicom\u2019s policy. Furthermore, the allegations in the complaint do not arguably fall within the coverage of the insurance policy at issue here. The insured\u2019s voluntary intoxication will not provide him with a defense against the operation of the intentional-acts exclusion. Gicom, therefore, owes Smith no duty to defend him under its insurance policy. I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\"> Gicom\u2019s policy does not include in its definition of \"occurrence\u201d that the accident that results in bodily injury or property damage may not be expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured, language that is often found in the coverage clauses of other insurance policies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-8\"> For instance, many insurers limit the scope of coverage to only accidental conduct by drafting the policy\u2019s coverage clause in terms of an occurrence as the covered event. \"Occurrence\u201d is then defined as \"an accident which occurs during the policy period resulting in bodily injury or property damage 'neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u2019 \u201d Fischer, <em>supra </em>at 105. Where this limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>tion of the definition of accident does not appear in the coverage clause, insurers have drafted exclusionary clauses that specifically exclude from coverage \"injury or loss 'expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\"> Where several theories of liability are asserted in a complaint, some of which fall within policy coverage and some of which dp not, the insurer has a duty to defend if any of the theories asserted would be covered by the policy. <em>Meridian Mut Ins Co v Hunt, </em>168 Mich App 672, 677; 425 NW2d 111 (1988).

He was \"extremely drunk,\u201d having consumed, in two and one-half hours, eight twelve-ounce beers and a pint of peppermint schnapps \u2014 less four shots a friend drank.

Smith swore at Czopek and kept walking. Czopek again told Smith to get off the road. Smith again swore at Czopek, and kept walking. Czopek called for backup, parked his vehicle, and walked up to Smith, who began screaming that he had to get home or his dad would kill him. Smith then began to run.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Czopek recognized that Smith was \"extremely drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Czopek and backup officer Petty followed Smith. They caught up with him where he had stopped to rest and was leaning against an automobile. Smith testified that a man jumped on his back. He had not identified himself as a police officer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Then another man came up in front of him. By then, Smith recognized the men as police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Czopek and Petty attempted to place Smith in a squad car, but he refused. Smith testified he told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>them that all he wanted to do was go home. He also testified that he knew he was \"resisting arrest\u201d by refusing to enter the squad car. Smith further testified that, to prevent the officers from placing him in the vehicle, he braced himself against the car with his feet and hands. Czopek testified that as the officers attempted to handcuff Smith, he fell to the ground and began swinging his arms and kicking his feet so that they could not get near him. .</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">While Smith was on the ground, Petty grabbed Smith\u2019s left arm, and Czopek grabbed his right arm. When Smith attempted to get up from the ground, Czopek slipped and fell, and Smith jerked his right arm loose from Czopek\u2019s grip.

The Court of Appeals ordered entry of summary disposition with respect to both claims. This Court remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liabilitys Ins Co v DiCicco, </em>432 Mich 656; 443 NW2d 734 (1989), and directed the Court of Appeals to \"discuss whether forcibly resisting arrest is an 'accident\u2019 within the meaning of the insurance policy\u2019s definition of 'occurrence,\u2019 regardless of whether the resultant bodily injury was expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d The Court of Appeals again found that Group Insurance is not required to defend.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The majority disposes of this case on the ground that there was no \"occurrence\u201d as that term is defined in the policy.

He said he was unaware of the subfreezing temperatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Czopek and Petty both testified during deposition that Smith did not kick or punch them, although Smith swung his arms and kicked his legs in an effort to prevent them from approaching him.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">This Court cannot appropriately decide as a matter of law that Smith acted with the intention of injuring Czopek or Petty or that his actions were such that the result must have been injury to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">The majority further concludes, as a matter of public policy, that 'voluntary intoxication cannot provide a factual basis for denying the operative effect of the exclusionary clause.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">The majority relies on <em>Allstate Ins Co v Sherrill, </em>566 F Supp 1286 (ED Mich, 1983).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> I have found decisions in two other states that also have con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>eluded that voluntary intoxication \"was of no consequence\u201d and may not preclude, in a particular situation, a finding that the insured did not expect or intend injury.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The majority of. courts in other jurisdictions, however, have held that voluntary intoxication may provide a factual predicate for a determination that injuries were not expected or intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">In the specific factual situation here presented, where the insured was voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the alleged assault, most courts have held that intoxication may destroy, for purposes of the exclusion, the capacity to form the requisite intent.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Thus, in <em>Burd v Sussex Mut Ins Co, </em>56 NJ 383, 386; 267 A2d 7 (1970), the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that where a drunken insured was convicted of \"atrocious assault and battery,\u201d coverage for the resulting civil claim was not necessarily barred by the exclusion.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The court said that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the insured\u2019s conviction for assault and battery did not collaterally estop him from asserting that his voluntary intoxication was such that he could not form the intent to injure.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The court said it was the insurer\u2019s burden to establish that the insured, despite his intoxication, formed the requisite intent to injure the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">I conclude that the factual situation in this case is not clear enough to allow this Court to say that there was no occurrence, as that term is defined in the policy. I conclude further that Smith\u2019s actions, even if characterized as resisting arrest, do not require a determination as a matter of law that he intended thereby to injure Czopek and Petty. In light of Smith\u2019s testimony that he did not intend to injure Czopek or Petty, it is a question of fact whether, assessing the extent to which he was intoxicated, he had formed, or was capable of forming, the requisite intent to injure Czopek or Petty.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand for trial._</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-7\"> When asked whether he was going to arrest Smith, Czopek responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">I don\u2019t know.

From the standpoint of the insured, an assault is an intentional act. But from the standpoint of the injured party, the assault may well be an unforeseen, unexpected and unanticipated event. See 11 Couch, Insurance, 2d (rev ed), \u00a7\u00a7 44:298, 44:300, pp 465-467, 469-470; anno: 72 ALR3d 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">Some courts have ruled that whether an event is an accident is to be determined from the standpoint of the injured party. See <em>Georgia Casualty Co v Alden Mills, </em>156 Miss 853; 127 So 555 (1930). Other courts have held that the issue is to be determined from the standpoint of the insured.

The first class involves those cases where the insured intended the act, but did not intend the injury. The second class involves those cases where- the insured intended the act, \"the result of which injury can only occur.\u201d 432 Mich 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">In the first class of cases \u2014 intended act, but unintended injuries\u2014 injury is said to be \"caused intentionally\u201d within the meaning of the clause so as to preclude coverage \"if the insured intended the act <em>and to cause some kind of bodily injury or damage </em>. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718. Asking whether the insured subjectively \"expected or intended\u201d the injuries resulting from his intentional acts, courts have found (see <em>DiCicco for case </em>citations) there was coverage where</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">\u2014the insured intentionally burned his property, but without the intent to cause injury or damage, but in fact caused injury or damage;</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">\u2014the insureds intentionally pointed their guns, but either the discharge of the gun, or the striking of the injured party was unintentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">In the second class of cases \u2014 intended act of the sort from which injury <em>must </em>result \u2014 courts presume or infer from the circumstances that the insured intended the resulting injury or damage.

The fight came to an abrupt end. DiCicco returned to his room, and the other student walked down the hallway. DiCicco came out of his room holding an open hunting knife and called the other student offensive names. The other student returned to the hall, saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>the knife, and challenged DiCicco to use the knife. DiCicco responded by poking the student in the chest with his empty hand while holding the open knife in his other hand. DiCicco backed the student against the wall. The student reacted, and in the scuffle that followed DiCicco stabbed the student in the stomach.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">\"DiCicco denies any intent to use the knife, claiming that he went to get the knife merely to scare away the other persons he considered to be a threat. No one observed him make a gesture of moving the knife as though to stab Gravenmier. The knife was held in his right hand and the poking was done with his left. DiCicco denies knowledge of in fact stabbing. Immediately following the stabbing, DiCicco looked-shocked. Gravenmier obviously did not expect DiCicco would use the knife or he would not have engaged in his act of bravado.\u201d [432 Mich 664, 710.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Relying on those findings, the plurality found that \"[i]t is obvious that these findings will not require the conclusion that DiCicco expected or intended to injure [the other student],\u201d and that it could not be said that \"brandishing a knife always results in injury \u2014 that DiCicco\u2019s actions preclude coverage as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710, 720. The plurality concluded, therefore, that the exclusionary clause was not relevant, and the insurer was bound to provide a defense to DiCicco in the underlying tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">The lead opinion, in dissent, would have held that \"if the court determines .that the insured acted intentionally, then the 'expected or intended\u2019 language is satisfied by a finding that injury resulted as the 'natural, foreseeable, expected, and anticipated\u2019 consequence of those intentional acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676.
