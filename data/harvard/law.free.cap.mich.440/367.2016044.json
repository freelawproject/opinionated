We hold that the 1986 amendments of the dramshop act bar both a minor\u2019s estate and the family of that minor from recovery under the act. Therefore, we reverse the decisions of the Court of Appeals in <em>Waranica v Cheers Good Time Saloons, Inc, </em>186 Mich App 398; 464 NW2d 902 (1990), and <em>LaGuire v Kain, </em>185 Mich App 239; 460 NW2d 598 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Each of these cases arises out of an automobile collision that occurred after the defendant liquor licensee allegedly illegally served alcohol to the driver of a vehicle, a minor, who became intoxicated, caused a collision resulting in the minor\u2019s death, and injured others.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">In <em>LaGuire v Kain, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, Michael John Mihailuk, then seventeen, purport<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>edly used an altered driver\u2019s license to purchase alcoholic beverages from the defendant liquor licensee, William James Kain, doing business as Copa Nite Club. After leaving the bar, the decedent drove his car across the center line and collided head-on with another vehicle, injuring the driver, Lisa Lord, and killing himself. Lisa Lord sued Betty Jane LaGuire, personal representative of the estate of the decedent, Michael John Mihailuk, and his parents, Michael Grant Mihailuk and Janet Sue Mihailuk. The defendants in the original suit, the minor\u2019s estate and parents, filed cross-claims against the liquor licensee. After Lisa Lord, the original plaintiff, settled with the minor\u2019s estate and family and gave up her claim against the licensee, the trial court realigned the parties and ordered a revised caption, which represented the original defendants, the minor\u2019s estate and his family, as plaintiffs, and the licensee as the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The defendant licensee moved for summary disposition on the basis that the statute failed to create a cause of action in favor of plaintiffs. Relying on <em>Cornack v Sweeney, </em>127 Mich App 375; 339 NW2d 26 (1983), the defendant argued that no cause of action existed in favor of the minor or his estate before the 1986 amendments and that the 1986 amendments of the statute created no cause of action in their favor. In response, the plaintiffs focused on subsection 10 of the dramshop act, MCL 436.22(10); MSA 18.993(10). In analyzing that provision, the plaintiffs relied on <em>Stowers v Wolodzko, </em>386 Mich 119; 191 NW2d 355 (1971), for the rule of statutory construction providing that the expres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>sion of one thing in a statute excludes the inclusion of other similar things. Plaintiffs claimed that because neither the minor nor the minor\u2019s family were specifically mentioned in subsection 10, which barred actions by visibly intoxicated persons, the statute was not intended to bar their claims. The trial court agreed with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The defendant filed a motion for reconsideration, noting that <em>Rosas v Damore, </em>171 Mich App 563; 430 NW2d 783 (1988), had been released after argument of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition. The defendant contended that <em>Rosas </em>had interpreted the amended statute to preclude a noninnocent party, including a minor, from recovering damages under the statute. In response, the plaintiffs sought to undermine the authority of <em>Rosas </em>by suggesting that it erroneously relied on <em>Longstreth v Gensel, </em>423 Mich 675; 377 NW2d 804 (1985), a case involving common-law liability of social hosts and not applicable to dramshop liability under the statute. Concluding that it was bound by <em>Rosas, </em>the trial court granted the motion for reconsideration and granted summary disposition for the defendant with respect to the claims of the minor\u2019s estate and the claims of the minor\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that both the minor\u2019s estate and the minor\u2019s family were entitled to sue under the amended statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Noting that before the 1986 amendments the actions would have been barred, the Court of Appeals examined the language and structure of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>amended statute in light of several rules of construction, concluding that both a minor and the minor\u2019s family could sue. The Court then certified that its opinion conflicted with <em>Rosas v Damore, supra, </em>and <em>Saavedra v Ghannan, </em>183 Mich App 234; 454 NW2d 134 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We granted leave to appeal. 437 Mich 1046 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">In <em>Waranica v Cheers Good Time Saloons, Inc, </em>the parents of decedent Deborah Waranica, Thomas and Barbara Waranica, and two siblings, Colleen and John Waranica, sued a liquor licensee, Cheers Good Time Saloons, claiming that the licensee unlawfully sold, gave or furnished alcohol to Deborah Waranica, a minor, before her death in a car accident on April 10, 1987. The plaintiffs claimed that, as a result of her intoxication, Deborah Waranica drove her car on the wrong side of a state highway and collided head-on with another car.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">The defendant unsuccessfully sought summary disposition, contending that MCL 436.22 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 18.993 <em>et seq. </em>did not provide a cause of action for the family of a minor who had been illegally served alcohol. The Court of Appeals granted the defendant leave to appeal the trial court\u2019s order denying summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling, deciding that the minor\u2019s family had a cause of action under the amended statute. The Court of Appeals took as its starting point the traditional interpretation of the dramshop act that precluded the intoxicated person\u2019s action, the non-innocent party doctrine. It then examined the 1986 amendments to see whether the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>changed prior law to give the imbiber a cause of action. Disagreeing with the <em>LaGuire </em>Court\u2019s rationale, the <em>Waranica </em>Court concluded that the Legislature did not intend to allow minors who are noninnocent parties to sue. Reviewing the effect of changes in subsections 4, 6, 8, and 10, the Court concluded that, although the minor\u2019s suit was precluded by the noninnocent party doctrine, the family\u2019s suit was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">This Court granted the defendant leave to appeal and ordered that the case be argued and submitted to the Court together with <em>LaGuire v Kain. </em>437 Mich 1046 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The dramshop act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> occupies the field of liability arising out of the selling, giving or furnishing of alcoholic liquor to minors or visibly intoxicated persons. <em>Jackson v PKM Corp, </em>430 Mich 262, 279; 422 NW2d 657 (1988). In enacting the dramshop act, the Legislature created a new remedy, not available at common law, and \"provided a specific action with which to achieve that remedy.\u201d <em>Browder v Int\u2019l Fidelity Ins Co, </em>413 Mich 603, 613; 321 NW2d 668 (1982). This Court previously acknowledged that the Legislature has attempted to keep the act internally balanced, <em>id. </em>at 614, resulting in a \"complete and self-contained solution to a social problem not adequately addressed at common law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615. Therefore, in interpreting the various provisions of the dramshop act, this Court must reconcile seeming inconsistencies, if possible, in order to give a common effect to the entire act that is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>In re State Hwy Comm, </em>383 Mich 709, 714; 178 NW2d 923 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Statutory interpretation analysis must begin with an examination of the words chosen by the Legislature. Subsection 4 of the dramshop act, as amended in 1986, sets forth the persons entitled to bring a cause of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">Except as otherwise provided in this section, <em>an individual </em>who suffers damage or is personally injured by a minor or visibly intoxicated person by reason of the unlawful selling, giving, or furnishing of alcoholic liquor to the minor or visibly intoxicated person, if the unlawful sale is proven to be a proximate cause of the damage, injury, or death, <em>or the spouse, child, parent, or guardian of that individual, </em>shall have a right of action in his or her name against the person who by selling, giving, or furnishing the alcoholic liquor has caused or contributed to the intoxication of the person or who has caused or contributed to the damage, injury, or death. [MCL 436.22(4); MSA 18.993(4). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Before its amendment in 1986, the dramshop act provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">A wife, husband, child, parent, guardian, or other person injured in person, property, means of support, or otherwise, by a visibly intoxicated person by reason of the unlawful selling, giving, or furnishing of intoxicating liquor to the person, if the sale is proven to be a proximate cause of the injury or death, shall have a right of action in his or her name against the person who by the selling, giving, or furnishing the liquor has caused or contributed to the intoxication of the person or who has caused or contributed to the injury. [Subsection 22(5) of the Michigan Liquor Control Act, 1980 PA 351.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">The first question we address is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>amended wording of subsection 4 provides an imbibing minor\u2019s estate with a cause of action. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Before the 1986 amendments to the dramshop act, former subsection 5 set forth the parties who were entitled to recover for injuries proximately caused by the selling, giving or furnishing of intoxicating liquor to a visibly intoxicated person. Under the former wording, the enumeration of the parties who could recover included \"[a] wife, husband, child, parent, guardian, or <em>other person </em>injured in person, property, means of support, or otherwise, by a visibly intoxicated person . . . .\u201d 1980 PA 351, \u00a7 22(5) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Construing substantially similar language in <em>Brooks v </em>Cook, 44 Mich 617, 618-619; 7 NW 216 (1880), this Court considered whether the intoxicated person could recover under the act. We noted that the intoxicated person \"may generally be supposed to be injured in some degree by intoxication, so that his case would furnish the most frequent occasion for a suit if he should see fit to resort to legal proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded, however, that although the intoxicated person could be included within the scope of the words \"other person,\u201d had the Legislature intended to benefit the intoxicated person it would have expressed its intention distinctly and unequivocally. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, this Court held that an intoxicated person did not have a cause of action under the act as previously worded. The judicially created \"noninnocent party doctrine,\u201d first adopted in the <em>Brooks </em>case, has been applied consistently to bar recovery by an intoxicated person under the dram-shop act since 1880.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The plaintiffs concede that before the 1986 amendments of the act an intoxicated person had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>no cause of action. However, the plaintiffs argue that the new language of subsection 4, creating a class of plaintiffs referred to as \"individuals\u201d and certain relatives of those \"individuals,\u201d broadened the class of persons who could recover to include a minor or his estate. The defendants assert that the new language of subsection 4 precludes a suit by an imbibing minor or that minor\u2019s estate because an imbibing minor is not an individual who suffers damage or is personally injured by a minor or a visibly intoxicated person. We agree with the defendants that neither an imbibing minor nor that minor\u2019s estate has a cause of action under the dramshop act, as amended in 1986. While the former wording of the act left some question whether an intoxicated person could recover, because of the Legislature\u2019s inclusion of the words \"other person\u201d in its enumeration of the persons who may sue under the act, subsection 4 now leaves no doubt that an imbibing minor may not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Subsection 4, as amended, divides the persons at issue under the act into three distinct categories: 1) \"individuals] who suffer[] damage or [are] personally injured,\u201d as well as the spouses, children, parents, or guardians of <em>those </em>individuals, all of whom are given a cause of action; 2) minors and visibly intoxicated persons who damage or personally injure \"individuals\u201d; and 3) persons who, by selling, giving, or furnishing alcoholic liquor, have caused or contributed to the intoxication of the person or have caused or contributed to the damages, injury, or death, against whom the \"individuals\u201d and spouses, parents, etc., in the first category have a cause of action under the act. Thus, in order to recover under the dramshop act, as amended, a person must qualify as an \"individual\u201d or the \"spouse, child, parent, or guardian of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>individual.\u201d Clearly, an imbibing minor falls into the category of those persons who injure, rather than those who are <em>injured by </em>a minor or visibly intoxicated person, referred to in subsection 4 as \"individuals.\u201d Therefore, because an intoxicated minor is not an \"individual\u201d who \"suffers damage or is personally injured by a minor or visibly intoxicated person . . .,\u201d MCL 436.22(4); MSA 18.993(4), neither the minor nor his estate has a cause of action under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Having concluded that the revised language of subsection 4, in its ordinary meaning, does not contemplate recovery by the imbibing party, whether he is a minor or a visibly intoxicated person, we must next determine whether the family of an imbibing minor has a cause of action under the amended act. Because an intoxicated minor does not qualify as an \"individual\u201d under subsection 4, neither do members of his family qualify as parents, guardians, etc., of an \"individual\u201d as used in that subsection. Therefore, in order to have a cause of action, the relatives of an imbibing minor must qualify as \"individuals\u201d themselves. We conclude that recovery by the plaintiffs in the instant cases was not contemplated by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Originally, the emphasis of the dramshop act was placed on recovery by the wives and children of habitual drunkards. The title to 1875 PA 231 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">An act to prevent the sale or delivery of intoxicating liquors, wine, and beer, to minors, and to drunken persons, and to habitual drunkards; to provide a remedy against persons selling liquor to husbands or children in certain cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Although an intoxicated person was barred from recovery under the former language of the dram-shop act by the noninnocent party doctrine, <em>Brooks, supra, </em>early cases allowed the family of an intoxicated person to recover. Most commonly, the wife of an habitual drunkard would sue a liquor seller for loss of her means of support due to the sale of intoxicating beverages to her husband.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The original version of the act gave a cause of action to \"[e]very wife, child, parent . . . who shall be injured in person or property, means of support, by any intoxicated person, or by means of the intoxication of any person . . . .\u201d 1875 PA 231, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Although the right of family members of an intoxicated person to recover was clear under the former wording of the act, this Court considered whether strangers to the intoxicated person had a cause of action in <em>Flower v Witkovsky, </em>69 Mich 371; 37 NW 364 (1888). In that case, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant had Unlawfully sold whiskey to two minors and that the minors damaged the plaintiff\u2019s property by reason of their intoxication. The defendant argued that the only persons entitled to recover under the act were those persons who stood in some relation to the intoxicated person. This Court rejected such a narrow interpretation of the act, reasoning that the Legislature\u2019s use of the words \"or other person\u201d in its enumeration of possible plaintiffs was intended to cover all persons injured in person or property by intoxicated persons, and specifically was meant to cover just such a case as the one at bar. <em>Id. </em>at 373-374.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Thus, under the former wording of the act, the class of possible plaintiffs included both persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>related to the intoxicated person and strangers. Further, before the 1986 amendments a plaintiff could recover both for direct personal injury or property damage, as well as for more indirect injury that is dependent on the injury of another person, such as the loss of \"means of support, or otherwise.\u201d 1980 PA 351, \u00a7 22(5). The \"or otherwise\u201d language would encompass such injuries as loss of services, parental training, guidance or companionship, etc. The former version of the act did not distinguish between the different classes of plaintiffs with regard to the kind of injury for which each could recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In contrast, the new wording of subsection 4 separates the persons who have a cause of action into two distinct classes. First, an \"individual\u201d who suffers damage or is personally injured by a minor or visibly intoxicated person is given a cause of action. MCL 436.22(4); MSA 18.993(4). Further, the spouse, child, parent, or guardian of <em>that </em>\"individual\u201d may also recover. <em>Id. </em>Thus, as under the wording of the former act, both persons who are directly injured by an intoxicated person, and persons whose injuries are more indirect and dependent upon another person\u2019s injury, such as the loss of means of support, may recover. However, under the amended wording, the pool of potential plaintiffs who have a cause of action for indirect injury has been significantly narrowed to include only the spouse, child, parent, and guardian of an injured \"individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The amended wording of subsection 4 indicates the Legislature\u2019s shift in emphasis from protecting the family of an habitual drunkard to protecting third persons. This new emphasis on recovery by third persons, as opposed to recovery by the family of an intoxicated person, does not support the conclusion that the Legislature intended the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\"individual\u201d to apply to the members of an intoxicated minor\u2019s family. While the Legislature retained a cause of action for certain relatives, the Legislature carefully specified that only the relatives of an \"individual,\u201d as used in subsection 4, could recover. To allow a minor\u2019s family members to recover under the dramshop act as \"individuals\u201d would be contrary to the Legislature\u2019s expressed intent and would also significantly increase the number of potential plaintiffs, a result that is inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s creation of a narrowly tailored right and remedy unknown at common law. <em>Browder, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">For example, in order for Michael and Janet Mihailuk to recover, these parents of an intoxicated minor must be \"individuals\u201d pursuant to subsection 4. Therefore, according to that interpretation of the revised wording, the Mihailuks\u2019 parents, the grandparents of the intoxicated minor, also have a cause of action under subsection 4. Likewise, the <em>siblings </em>of an intoxicated minor, Colleen and John Waranica, would also have a cause of action as \"individuals\u201d under subsection 4, despite the fact that if Colleen and John Waranica were siblings of an injured \"individual\u201d they would <em>not </em>be able to recover because subsection 4 does not extend a cause of action to the \"siblings\u201d of an \"individual.\u201d Even more absurd, by allowing the relatives of an imbibing minor to recover as \"individuals,\u201d then <em>their </em>spouses, children, parents, and guardians may also recover under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Clearly, the Legislature could not have intended the family of an intoxicated minor to enjoy a greater potential for recovery than the narrowly delineated classes of relatives of an \"individual,\u201d when the minor himself does not even have a cause of action. The dissent argues that nothing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the amended wording of subsection 4 supports the assertion that a family member of a visibly intoxicated person or minor cannot recover as an \"individual.\u201d Boyle, J. at 390. However, if the members of an intoxicated minor\u2019s family may recover as \"individuals\u201d under subsection 4, then <em>any person </em>who suffers indirect injury, whether or not he is the spouse, child, parent, or guardian of the person directly injured, would also have a cause of action as an \"individual\u201d under subsection 4.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Clearly, the dissent\u2019s construction makes superfluous and meaningless the <em>explicit </em>enumeration in subsection 4 of the parties other than an \"individual\u201d who may recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Neither do we believe that the \"legislative history\u201d cited by the dissent counsels against our holding that the family of an imbibing minor cannot recover under subsection 4. See Boyle, J. at 391-394. While the dissent characterizes the question whether to allow the minor\u2019s family to recover as a \"critical issue\u201d before the conference committee, there is no indication that such was the case. Although the dissent describes the \"legislative history\u201d as showing that various groups and individuals focused their lobbying efforts on the issue what persons would be entitled to sue under the amended act, the sources cited by the dissent support the conclusion that the real critical debate concerned whether the family of <em>any </em>intoxicated person, whether an adult or a minor, would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>given a cause of action. See <em>id. </em>at 393, n 14. It appears that the Legislature resolved this debate by eliminating, through the new wording of subsection 4, any cause of action for the families of an intoxicated person.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Finally, the dissent\u2019s claim that subsection 4 should be read to give an intoxicated minor\u2019s family a cause of action, because of the Legislature\u2019s continued \"special treatment\u201d of minors and their families in other statutory provisions, <em>id. </em>at 394, is clearly undercut by the dissent\u2019s agreement with our holding that the intoxicated minor, like his adult counterpart the visibly intoxicated person, is barred from recovery under the dramshop act, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Thus, we believe that the Legislature was quite careful to limit which family members may recover and to whom they must be related in order to have a cause of action. Because we hold that an imbibing minor cannot recover under the act, as amended, we also hold that the family members of that minor, who are not \"individuals\u201d pursuant to subsection 4, also have no cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Our holding that neither a minor\u2019s estate nor the family of an intoxicated minor may recover under subsection 4 of the dramshop act is support\u00e9d by the literal wording of other subsections of the act using the term \"minor.\u201d Subsection 6 provides: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Because we cannot envision that a minor\u2019s estate and the relatives of a minor would have a cause of action <em>against the minor </em>for injuring himself, it appears that neither of these parties could satisfy the \"name and retain\u201d requirements of subsection 6. See <em>Scholten v Rhoades, </em>67 Mich App 736, 743-744; 242 NW2d 509 (1976).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>An action under this section against a retail licensee shall, not be commenced unless the minor or the alleged intoxicated person is a named defendant in the action and is retained in the action until the litigation is concluded by trial or settlement. [MCL 436.22(6); MSA 18.993(6).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>The Court of Appeals has created an exception to the name and retain requirement on facts similar to those presented in the instant cases. <em>Scholten, supra. </em>In <em>Scholten, </em>the Court reasoned that because a parent could recover under the dram-shop act for injury to a child occasioned by the child\u2019s own misdoing, by reason of the sale of intoxicants to that child, a literal application of the name and retain provision would be \"awkward, strained and absurd.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744. Whatever persuasiveness the Court of Appeals opinion may have had, the <em>Scholten </em>decision predated the 1986 amendments of the dramshop act. As we held above, although the former wording of the act clearly allowed for recovery by the family of an intoxicated person, the new wording of subsection 4 has eliminated such recovery. Therefore, although a literal application of the name and retain requirement would have been strained and absurd in <em>Scholten, </em>under the amended version of the statute a literal reading of subsection 6 is entirely consistent with our holding that neither an imbibing minor\u2019s estate nor the family of that minor may recover under the dramshop act.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Likewise, our holding is supported by the literal wording of subsection 8, which provides, in pertinent part: \"All defenses of the alleged visibly intoxicated person or the minor shall be available to the licensee. . . .\u201d MCL 436.22(8); MSA 18.993(8). Because we cannot envision that a minor\u2019s estate and the relatives of a minor would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>have a cause of action against the minor for injuring himself, a literal application of subsection 8 means that a cause of action by these plaintiffs against the liquor licensee would also fail.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, as with subsection 6, an exception to this subsection is not required to avoid an absurd or strained result because the minor\u2019s estate and his family are already barred from suit under subsection 4.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Finally, our holding is also not inconsistent with subsection 10.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Subsection 10, on its face, neither eliminates nor preserves recovery under the act by a minor\u2019s estate or the family of an intoxicated minor. The plaintiffs urge us to interpret subsection 10 according to the rule of statutory construction that the express mention of one thing in a statute implies the exclusion of others. See 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (5th ed), \u00a7 47.23, p 216 ff. Subsection 10 purports to establish exclusions from the operation of subsection 4. Thus, the statutory interpretation maxim would indicate that subsection 4 should apply to all cases not specifically excluded in subsection 10. <em>Id. </em>at 217. Therefore, under the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the two subsections together, both a minor\u2019s estate and the family of the minor have a cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>action under subsection 4 merely because they are not explicitly precluded from recovery under subsection 10. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">If the wording of subsection 4 were ambiguous, then perhaps the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of subsection 10 would tip the balance.-However, while our holding with regard to subsection 4 appears to make subsection 10 surplusage,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the alternative would be to force a construction upon subsection 4 that is not supported by the wording of that subsection merely to explain an absence of language in subsection 10. Further, to divine a legislative intent from the omission of the word \"minor\u201d in subsection 10, in order to allow recovery by the minor\u2019s estate and his family, creates substantial conflicts between the other subsections of the act. Such a holding would require us to explain away the specific language of subsections 4, 6, and 8, supporting the conclusion that these parties do not have a cause of action. We acknowledge a possible ambiguity arising from the absence of language in subsection 10, yet we decline to adopt the plaintiffs\u2019 construction of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">We hold that consistent interpretations of subsections 4, 6, and 8 support the conclusion that the Legislature, in its shift of emphasis from protecting the family of an intoxicated person to protecting third persons, intended to prevent recovery by both a minor\u2019s estate and the minor\u2019s family.

The majority\u2019s conclusion requires the assumption that the Legislature indirectly eliminated an historically recognized cause of action through the subsection authorizing claims, while omitting clear language in the exception clause that would have directly accomplished the same result. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">After review of the factors available to assist in construing the statute,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>amended wording of subsection 4 permits an individual, including a family member of an imbibing minor, to recover. Therefore, we concur with the reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>LaGuire v Kain, </em>185 Mich App 239; 460 NW2d 598 (1990), insofar as it pertains to the cause of action of the minor\u2019s estate. We dissent in the reversal of <em>Waranica v Cheers Good Time Saloons, Inc, </em>186 Mich App 398; 464 NW2d 902 (1990), and <em>LaGuire </em>regarding the existence of a cause of action for the minor\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">As originally constructed, the language in the dramshop act, subsection 5, provided a cause of action to families of intoxicated persons through the enumeration of potential plaintiffs, \"[a] wife, husband, child, parent, guardian . . . .\u201d The original language provided a cause of action to third parties through the language \"other person.\u201d Gradually, \"other person\u201d expanded to include various third persons and siblings of the intoxicated person and the enumeration of \"wife, husband, child\u201d language was extended to encompass the heirs of an innocent third party.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This broad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ening of both aspects of the language eventually caused confusion, and arguably resulted in duplicitous litigation, interfering with dramshop defendants\u2019 ability to settle cases because they could not be sure that some additional \"other person\u201d might not still bring a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">To avoid this, the Legislature reworded subsection 4, eliminating the listing of potential plaintiffs that included the phrase resulting in recognition of a claim for even an ex-wife of a decedent, the \"other person.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In its place, the Legislature provided that \"an individual\u201d or the \"spouse, child, parent or guardian of that individual\u201d had a right of action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the same time, the Legislature made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>several other minor wording changes in subsection 4.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nothing in the revised text supports the assertion that a family member of an intoxicated person or minor might not fall within the category of \"individual[s]\u2019\u2019 who suffer damages or are injured because of the unlawful provision of alcoholic beverages that is the proximate cause of the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Thus, the text of subsection 4 supports the view that family members are entitled to recover. Indeed, the majority concedes that \"as under the wording of the former act, both persons who are directly injured by an intoxicated person, and persons whose injuries are more indirect and dependent upon another person\u2019s injury, such as the loss of means of support, may recover.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p 380.)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Consideration of the structure of the statute in conjunction with the text of subsection 10, also counsels against the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute. Subsection 4 authorizes recovery for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>particular persons and categories of persons. Subsection 10 creates an exception to the categories of persons entitled to sue under subsection 4. Thus, the class created in subsection 4 is necessarily larger and inclusive of the exception class created in subsection 10. Family members of the intoxicated person or minor fall within the category of persons who can recover as \"individuals\u201d who suffer damage or who are personally injured as a result of the unlawful provision of alcohol to the minor or intoxicated person. Then, subsection 10 excepts from recovery claims of the visibly intoxicated person and the family of that person.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Additionally, a fair reading of the legislative history provides support for recovery for the minor\u2019s family. The Senate substitute for House Bill 4550 added the word \"minor\u201d to what is now subsection 4, clarifying that a cause of action existed when the licensee provided alcoholic beverages either to a minor or a visibly intoxicated person.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A similar change was made in substitute 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>for House Bill 4550.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These changes in the House and Senate versions of the bill marked the beginning of the distinction made throughout the final statute between a minor and a visibly intoxicated person.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Both the House and Senate versions included language providing a cause of action to an individual injured by a minor or intoxicated person or the family of the injured person. The versions differed regarding the right of the family of the non-innocent party to recover.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The House version precluded suit by the visibly intoxicated person and the visibly intoxicated person\u2019s family.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Senate version eliminated a cause of action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>both the family of the minor and the family of the visibly intoxicated person.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Eventually the two versions were submitted to a conference committee. A critical issue before the committee was whether to adopt language precluding suit by both the visibly intoxicated person\u2019s, family and the minor\u2019s family or to adopt language which precluded only the visibly intoxicated person\u2019s family from bringing suit.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The confer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>ence report included the language from the House version. It was adopted by both houses and signed by the Governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The conclusion that the minor\u2019s family has a cause of action is also buttressed by the observation that the Legislature continued the special treatment afforded to minors and their families by virtue of MCL 436.33; MSA 18.1004. In fact, while revising the act in 1986, the Legislature increased the penalties for serving persons who are underage, MCL 436.20; MSA 18.991, and made no changes to eliminate the cause of action recognized under \u00a7 33 in which minors may sue social hosts in <em>Longstreth v Gensel, </em>423 Mich 675, 681-683; 377 NW2d 804 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Although the majority finds support for its conclusion that the minor\u2019s family lacks a cause of action in a literal reading of subsection 6, the name and retain provision, we are unable to agree with a literal reading of that subsection to abolish an historically recognized cause of action when the language, prior judicial construction, and legislative history all support a different approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Subsection 6 was first enacted in 1972 as an amendment of the dramshop act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> From its inception, the scope of the provision has occasioned difficulty. Both this Court and various Court of Appeals panels have fashioned judicial exceptions to the literal application of the language of subsection 6.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To be sure, as the defendants note, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Court has strictly construed the name and retain provision where the parties have sought to circumvent its protections against collusion and fraud.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, even after opinions in which this Court \"returned to the course of strict construction,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> panels of the Court of Appeals continued to find that subsection 6 did not bar the claims of the families of the intoxicated person. In <em>Newman v Hoholik, </em>138 Mich App 66; 359 NW2d 253 (1984), the Court of Appeals considered the holding of <em>Putney, </em>.noting that it affirmed the continuing vitality of <em>Salas </em>and its rationale, that it failed to reference <em>Scholten, </em>and that it employed narrow language. On the basis of these factors, the panel concluded that <em>Putney </em>did not impliedly abrogate the holdings of <em>Scholten </em>and its progeny.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">When the Legislature embarked on this comprehensive review of the dramshop act, opinions of this Court and the Court of Appeals existed that limited the scope of the name and retain provision in some circumstances. One must be cautious about imputing a meaning to legislative inaction,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>but the existence of <em>Salas </em>and <em>Scholten </em>and its progeny with no legislative change in subsection 6 supports the view that whatever the Legislature intended to accomplish with the name and retain provision, it did not intend to abolish the minor\u2019s family\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">This conclusion is strengthened by consideration of the Legislature\u2019s explicit rejection of a proposal to abolish the cause of action of the minor\u2019s family in subsection 10. If, as the defendants contend, the name and retain provision had eliminated claims by the family of the minor, it seems inexplicable that the question whether to exclude the minor\u2019s family\u2019s claims in subsection 10 would be the focus of debate. Yet, that issue was one of several that divided the House and Senate, resulting in the passage of two versions of the bill and the necessity for a conference committee to create a compromise. It is implausible that the Legislature engaged in this debate regarding the scope of subsection 10 if a previously existing subsection had already eliminated the claims of the minor\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Ultimately, the language of subsection 10 barred the claims of the families of visibly intoxicated persons, while omitting language which would have barred the claims of the families of the minor. The majority concludes, despite this omission, that the Legislature implicitly eliminated the claims of the minor\u2019s family through subsection 6. This Court has recognized that where the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ture has affirmatively rejected language that would support an interpretation of a statute, that rejection evidences a legislative intent toward a contrary construction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In light of the existing case law suggesting a different interpretation to the name and retain provision, as well as the Legislature\u2019s explicit rejection of language that would have accomplished this precise result, we conclude that the Legislature did not intend that the name and retain provision bar these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">The majority also finds support for its conclusion in the literal wording of subsection 8.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We disagree. Statutory construction is an holistic endeavor. We reiterate that it seems unlikely that the Legislature sought to achieve indirectly in subsection 8 a result that it explicitly rejected in subsection 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">To be sure, if read in isolation, the language of subsection 8, like that of subsection 6, is susceptible to an interpretation that would preclude suit by the minor\u2019s family. A more natural reading of subsection 8 would be that it was intended to allow the licensee to assert available defenses when the plaintiff had a claim against the third party. The Supreme Court Committee on Standard Jury Instructions postulated that the most proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>ble effect of this change will be to allow the licensee to assert the no-fault threshold defenses as well as eliminating the potential for the licensee to be liable to the plaintiff injured in a fight, although the intoxicated person would escape liability by raising the defense of self-defense.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">This interpretation falls short of the most desirable result, which would reflect a consistent approach to the situation the Legislature addressed. The decision-making process we are engaged in is neither \"linear\u201d nor \"purely deductive.\u201d Eskridge &amp; Frickey, <em>Statutory interpretation as practical reasoning, </em>42 Stan L R 321, 348 (1990). It involves consideration of a broad range of evidence and factors to determine the meaning of a particular text within the context of a particular application.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We reach this result, however, because the critical legislative debate indicates an alteration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>what may have been the initial purpose of subsection 4. The addition of the word \"minor\u201d in subsection 4 and the insistence on not precluding the minor\u2019s family\u2019s cause of action in subsection 10 indicates a purpose we may not ignore in the interest of tidying up the ragged edges of the legislation. In this case, \"different values will pull the interpreter in different directions,\u201d Eskridge &amp; Frickey, supra, p 324. When read in conjunction with the statute as a whole, its text, its background and structure, and the context within which it was passed, we think the pull of the literal language of subsection 8 (or subsection 6) is less than the force of the interpretive pull toward other factors.</p>\n<judges id=\"b499-4\">Justice Mallett concurred with Justice Boyle.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\"> 1986 PA 176, MCL 436.22 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 18.993 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-9\"> Prior opinions of this Court have emphasized the goal to properly interpret and apply the statute in accord with the legislative intent and as articulated by the text.

Careful review of opinions of this Court will reveal a shifting emphasis on intent, purpose, text, context, structure, canons of construction, and other factors depending on the particular case.

Notably, the suggestions dealt with two separate issues, those pertaining to \"[t]he non-interested party\u201d and those pertaining to \"[relatives of the non-innocent party.\u201d The options recommended for addressing the \"non-interested party\u201d included 1) defining a cause of action to include an injured innocent party or the estate of such party under the wrongful death act and the spouse, child, parent, or guardian of the injured innocent party; or 2) restricting eligibility to the injured innocent party or the estate of a deceased injured party under the wrongful death act. The language changes in subsection 4 were intended to implement the first option.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b489-10\"> This language closely followed the first option discussed in the suggestions described in n 4. The text of the amended statute is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">Except as otherwise provided in this section, an individual who suffers damage or is personally injured by a minor or visibly intoxicated person by reason of the unlawful selling, giving, or furnishing of alcoholic liquor to the minor or visibly intoxicated person, if the unlawful sale is proven to be a proximate cause of the damage, injury, or death, or the spouse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>child, parent, or guardian of that individual, shall have a right of action in his or her name against the person who by selling, giving, or furnishing the alcoholic liquor has caused or contributed to the intoxication of the person or who has caused or contributed to the damage, injury, or death. [MCL 436.22(4); MSA 18.993(4).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b490-12\"> Specifically, the Legislature replaced \"injured in person, property, means of support or otherwise\u201d with \"who suffers damage or is personally injured.\u201d In addition, the Legislature replaced \"by a visibly intoxicated person\u201d with \"by a minor or visibly intoxicated person.\u201d The addition of the word \"minor\u201d in the language defining who had a cause of action was designed to eliminate the need to prove that the minor was visibly intoxicated in order to recover. The change apparently was made in response to concerns articulated to Representative Stopczynski, Ch\u00e1ir of the House of Representatives Liquor Control Committee, by Patricia J.

The commission urged the Legislature that the act of selling alcoholic beverages to a minor be sufficient for a cause of action when the sale contributes to or results in death or injury, without also requiring that the minor be visibly intoxicated.

Recognizing a \"possible ambiguity\u201d arising from subsection 10, the majority resolves it against granting a cause of action for family members of intoxicated minor\u2019s despite the longstanding history of recovery for these persons. If the Legislature wants to abolish an historically recognized cause of action, we believe it should speak more clearly than it has done with these amendments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\"> Except as otherwise provided in this section and sections 22H and 221, a person injured in person or property by a minor or visibly intoxicated person by reason of the unlawful selling, giving, or furnishing of alcoholic liquor to the minor or the visibly intoxicated person, if the selling, giving, or furnishing is proven to be a proximate cause of the injury or death, or the spouse, child, parent, or guardian of the injured person, shall have a right of action in his or her name against the retail licensee who by the selling, giving, or furnishing of the alcoholic liquor has caused or contributed to the intoxication of the person or has caused or contributed to the injury.

The State Bar of Michigan also took a position against the bill objecting to proposals to \"put a limit on what could .be recovered from those responsible for a drunk\u2019s condition, bar the drunk\u2019s dependents from suing those who knowingly made him drunk, and otherwise significantly limit the ability of those who are seriously injured by drunks to fully recover their damages.\u201d Press Release, State Bar of Michigan, Michael Frank, State Archives of Michigan, RG 91-286, Box 1, Folder 12. In addition, the Michigan Insurance Bureau prepared a survey of insurers regarding the availability of liquor liability insurance and gathered their comments regarding proposed dramshop reforms. Several major insurers within the state commented that removal of the right to sue from intoxicated persons and their families would help solve problems with insurance.

The process of construction, therefore, is not an exercise in logic or dialectic: The aids of formal reasoning are not irrelevant; they may simply be inadequate. The purpose of construction being the ascertainment of meaning, every consideration brought to bear for the solution of that problem must be devoted to that end alone. To speak of it as a practical problem is not to indulge a fashion in words. It must be that, not something else. Not, for instance, an opportunity for a judge to use words as \"empty vessels into which he can pour anything he will\u201d \u2014 his caprices, fixed notions, even statesmanlike beliefs in a particular policy.
