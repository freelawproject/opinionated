Upon review, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient respecting the first count but insufficient with regard to the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Defendant Lemiel David Wolfe and several companions were arrested on December 9, 1987, about two hours after an undercover police officer made a controlled purchase of crack cocaine at a second floor apartment on Sixth Street in the City of Saginaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The undercover officer approached the apartment at about 8:30 p.m. and asked for a \"$10 rock\u201d of crack cocaine. He then passed two marked $5 bills through an open window and received in exchange a small baggie containing crack cocaine. Shortly thereafter, the undercover officer obtained a warrant, and entered the apartment with several other officers to execute a search. They found six individuals in the apartment \u2014 four men, one woman, and a juvenile. In the group were defendant Lemiel Wolfe and Daven Rogers, as well as two other men, Anthony Winstead and Leonard Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Items recovered in the search included a loaded 12-gauge shotgun and an unspecified number of packets of crack cocaine, which appeared to be packaged for individual sale. When the officers entered the back bedroom of the apartment they saw Winstead hovering over an open vent in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>floor from which the grate had been removed. Additional packets of crack cocaine then were found beneath the vent in the apartment directly below. The total weight of all the crack cocaine recovered was less than fifty grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">At trial, officers who participated in the search testified concerning the contents and appearance of the apartment. As they saw it, no one was living in the apartment. It contained only a few items of furniture \u2014 a couch, a refrigerator, and a broken television set. The apartment had no running water, and the toilet was not in working condition. It was apparent that the bath tub, partially filled with human excrement, was being used as a toilet.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Defendant Wolfe was arrested, searched, and found to be in possession of $265 in cash, including the two $5 bills that had been used for the controlled cocaine purchase. In addition, he had a beeper and a key to the back door of the apartment. Rogers was also arrested and searched. His possessions included a piece of paper with the number of defendant Wolfe\u2019s beeper written on it and an extra shell for the shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">During the trial, Wolfe testified that he lived in Detroit, and that he had traveled to Saginaw to visit a friend, Sharon Jones, whose aunt lived in the first floor apartment directly below the second floor apartment on Sixth Street. The other men found in the second floor apartment were also from Detroit. Wolfe had invited them to Saginaw and instructed them to meet him at the Sixth Street apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Wolfe and Rogers were jointly tried on charges of possession with intent to deliver less than fifty grams of cocaine and felony-firearm. Each was convicted on both counts; however, only the convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>tions of defendant Wolfe are at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Finding the evidence insufficient, the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction of defendant Wolfe for possession with intent to deliver, and explained: \"the evidence demonstrates, at best, that defendant was at the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Then, in view of the absence of a conviction on the principal felony drug charge, the panel also reversed the felony-firearm conviction,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> finding it unnecessary to review the sufficiency of the evidence with regard to that count.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We then granted leave to appeal. 437 Mich 1047 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In determining whether the prosecution has presented sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction, an appellate court is required to apply the standard adopted by this Court in <em>People v Hampton, </em>407 Mich 354, 366; 285 NW2d 284 (1979), cert den 449 US 885 (1980). There, we stated that a reviewing court \"must consider not whether there was any evidence to support the conviction but whether there was sufficient evidence to justify a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>rational trier of fact in finding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">This standard was articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Jackson v Virginia, </em>443 US 307; 99 S Ct 2781; 61 L Ed 2d 560 (1979), and has been applied regularly in the courts of this state. See <em>Hampton, supra, </em>407 Mich 366; <em>People v Petrella, </em>424 Mich 221, 268; 380 NW2d 11 (1985); <em>People v Lewis, </em>178 Mich App 464, 468; 444 NW2d 194 (1989). The sufficient evidence requirement is a part of every criminal defendant\u2019s due process rights. It is an attempt to give \"concrete substance\u201d to those rights, by precluding irrational jury verdicts. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>443 US 315. As the <em>Jackson </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">The <em>[In re Winship, </em>397 US 358; 90 S Ct 1068; 25 L Ed 2d 368 (1970)] doctrine [requiring proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt] requires more than simply a trial ritual. A doctrine establishing so fundamental a substantive constitutional standard must also require that the factfinder will rationally apply that standard to the facts in evidence. A \"reasonable doubt,\u201d at a minimum, is one based upon \"reason.\u201d Yet a properly instructed jury may occasionally convict even when it can be said that no rational trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt .... [443 US 316-317.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Of course, appellate courts are not juries, and even when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence they must not interfere with the jury\u2019s role:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">[An appellate court] must remember that the jury is the sole judge of the facts. It is the function of the jury alone to listen to testimony, weigh the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>evidence and decide the questions of fact. . . . Juries, not appellate courts, see and hear witnesses and are in a much better position to decide the weight and credibility to be given to their testimony. <em>[People v Palmer, </em>392 Mich 370, 375-376; 220 NW2d 393 (1974).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">With such considerations in mind, this Court determined long ago that when an appellate court reviews the evidence supporting a conviction, factual conflicts are to be viewed in a light favorable to the prosecution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">In testing this case we are not required to take that which respondent relies upon and that which would tend against him, and from a comparison thereof determine which was the stronger and better, or deducting the one from the other, say what, if anything, was left. This would be but a weighing of the evidence and was entirely within the province of the jury. Nor are we to take the evidence in the order, question and answer, in which it was given, but finding it where we may, and putting what was most favorable to the prosecution together, and discarding all other, can this Court say it fairly tended to establish the charge made? <em>[People v Howard, </em>50 Mich 239, 242; 15 NW 101 (1883); see also <em>People v Chesbro, </em>300 Mich 720, 723; 2 NW2d 895 (1942); <em>People v Szymanski, </em>321 Mich 248, 254; 32 NW2d 451 (1948).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In short, when determining whether sufficient evidence has been presented to sustain a conviction, a court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of the crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Hampton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number><em>supra, </em>407 Mich 368; <em>Petrella, supra, </em>424 Mich 268.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">We turn now to consider whether the evidence presented in this case was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">In its opinion, the Court of Appeals concluded that the prosecution had failed to present <em>any </em>evidence of possession with intent to deliver. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">Our review of the record does not, however, indicate <em>any connection </em>between defendant and the cocaine dropped down the vent by Winstead. There is <em>no evidence </em>linking defendant to the prior drug sale to the undercover officer, or that he had given <em>any type </em>of assistance, support, encouragement to <em>anyone </em>regarding the possession or delivery of the cocaine. [Emphasis added. Slip op, p 3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">We disagree. Viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, our review convinces us that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to p\u00e9rmit a rational jury to conclude that defendant Wolfe knowingly possessed the cocaine found at the Sixth Street apartment with the intent to deliver it.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">As the Court of Appeals explained, to support a conviction for possession with intent to deliver less than fifty grams of cocaine, it is necessary for the prosecutor to prove four elements: (1) that the recovered substance is cocaine, (2) that the cocaine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>is in a mixture weighing less than fifty grams, (3) that defendant was not authorized to possess the substance, and (4) that defendant knowingly possessed the cocaine with the intent to deliver. <em>Lewis, supra </em>at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Upon appeal, defendant has challenged the sufficiency of the' evidence only with respect to the fourth element \u2014 that he knowingly possessed cocaine with intent to deliver. Defendant argued, and the Court of Appeals panel concluded, that he did not possess the cocaine or intend to deliver it to anyone. In its opinion, the panel recited facts as represented by the testimony of defendant Wolfe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">At trial, defendant testified that he went to Saginaw to visit a friend. He arrived around 6:00 p.m. that evening and went to the Sixth Street apartments to visit Sharon Jones, whose relatives lived in the downstairs apartment. Defendant left shortly thereafter and went to another friend\u2019s house where he stayed until he returned to the Sixth Street apartment around 10:00 p.m. When he arrived, defendant spoke briefly with the downstairs residents, then joined his friends upstairs for a party. Defendant went to the local store for food and beer, after collecting money from the others. When he returned, Leonard Jones repaid a prior $20 debt, giving defendant four $5 bills, two of which were the \"marked\u201d bills that [Leonard] Jones had received earlier that night from the undercover police ofiicer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">As the group sat and watched television, defendant saw [Leonard] Jones smoking cocaine, but testified he saw no other drugs than that which [Leonard] Jones used. Shortly after his return from the convenience store, the police raided the apartment and arrested defendant, along with several others. [Slip op, p 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Presumably, if the jury had believed defendant\u2019s testimony, it would have exonerated him.. How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>ever, other evidence was presented at the trial which raised serious doubts, to say the least, about the defendant\u2019s credibility and his version of the facts. For example, after testifying that the purpose of his trip to Saginaw on March 9, 1987, was to visit Sharon Jones, he later admitted that he spoke with her for only five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Similarly, at one point in his testimony, defendant claimed that he arrived in Saginaw at 6:00 p.m., but that he did not meet his Detroit associates at the Sixth Street apartment until 8:00 p.m. He also claimed that after he met his Detroit associates at the apartment, he stayed for only a few minutes, then left to visit another friend. He testified that he did not return to the apartment until approximately 10:00 p.m., and that he did not receive the marked $5 bills from Rogers until that time. In contrast, Rogers testified that defendant Wolfe met him and the other men at the apartment at 6:00 or 6:15 p.m., and that Wolfe stayed as long as two hours.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rogers also testified that Leonard Jones gave defendant the marked $5 bills before defendant left the Sixth Street apartment to visit his other friend. Rogers\u2019 testimony provided evidence that allowed the jury to infer that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Wolfe was at the apartment for most of the evening, and that he was there when the sale of crack cocaine was made to the officer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>Q. </em>He [Wolfe] testified that it was about 8:00 o\u2019clock when he saw you. Is he correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\"><em>A. </em>I don\u2019t really know what \u2014 really what time it was, but when we got there, it was about 6:00 and when we seen him standing outside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\"><em>Q. </em>And how long after he [Wolfe] came back up did he stay upstairs with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\"><em>A. </em>A good little while.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\"><em>Q. </em>How long is a \"good little while\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-13\"><em>A. </em>I\u2019d say an hour, two hours.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Further, there was evidence that contradicted defendant\u2019s claim that when the officers arrived to search the apartment he was there just drinking beer and watching television with friends. The testimony of the police officers was that the television set was broken, and that the condition of the apartment was, at best, ill-suited for an evening of socializing with friends. The apartment had no running water and no toilet facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Finally, there was evidence that contradicted Wolfe\u2019s insistence that a key found in his possession did not fit -the lock on the back door of the second floor apartment. Wolfe testified that the key was for the door to his mother\u2019s residence in Detroit. However, one of the officers testified that he tested the key in the lock of the back door of the Sixth Street apartment and that the key fit that lock.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Because the jury, unlike the Court of Appeals, had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses in assessing their credibility, certainly it was not irrational for the jury to reject Wolfe\u2019s version of the facts in favor of the evidence offered by Rogers and the police officers. Nevertheless, because doubt about credibility is not a substitute for evidence of guilt, we move now to a review of the evidence related to the fourth and critical element of the crime. As noted above, this element, knowing possession with intent to deliver, has two components, (1) possession and (2) intent. See CJI2d 12.3. We shall consider separately the evidence adduced in support of each of these components.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">A person need not have actual physical posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>sion of a controlled substance to be guilty of possessing it. Possession may be either actual or constructive. <em>People v Harper, </em>365 Mich 494, 506-507; 113 NW2d 808 (1962), cert den 371 US 930 (1962); see also <em>People v Mumford, </em>60 Mich App 279, 282-283; 230 NW2d 395 (1975). Likewise, possession may be found even when the defendant is not the owner of recovered narcotics. <em>Id. </em>See also <em>People v Germaine, </em>234 Mich 623, 627; 208 NW 705 (1926). Moreover, possession may be joint, with more than one person actually or constructively possessing a controlled substance. <em>Id. </em>See also <em>People v Williams, </em>188 Mich App 54, 57; 469 NW2d 4 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In this case, there was no direct evidence that defendant Wolfe actually possessed the cocaine. Rather, the evidence produced at trial showed that he constructively possessed the cocaine, i.e., that he \"had the right to exercise control of the cocaine and knew that it was present.\u201d <em>Germaine, supra </em>at 627; <em>Mumford, supra </em>at 282. The courts have frequently addressed the concept of constructive possession and the link between a defendant and narcotics that must be shown to establish constructive possession. It is well established that a person\u2019s presence, by itself, at a location where drugs are found is insufficient to prove constructive possession. See, e.g., <em>Harper, supra </em>at 500; <em>People v Summers, </em>68 Mich App 571, 581-582; 243 NW2d 689 (1976); <em>United States v Castillo, </em>844 F2d 1379, 1392 (CA 9, 1988); <em>United States v Rackley, </em>742 F2d 1266, 1271 (CA 11, 1984). Instead, some additional connection between the defendant and the contraband must be shown. <em>Castillo, supra, </em>844 F2d 1392, citing <em>United States </em>v <em>Disla, </em>805 F2d 1340 (CA 9, 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Any one of various factors may be sufficient under given circumstances to establish this con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>nection. For example, constructive possession of cocaine was shown in <em>Rackley, supra, </em>where, in addition to the defendant\u2019s presence at the location where the cocaine was found, traces of cocaine were discovered on shirts stored in his pickup truck. 742 F2d 1272. In <em>Thompson v United States, </em>567 A2d 907, 908-909 (DC App, 1989), constructive possession was shown where the defendant was found in a sparsely furnished apartment that contained cocaine packets and large sums of money lying about in plain view. In <em>United States v Perez-Paredes, </em>678 F Supp 259, 263 (SD Fla, 1988), constructive possession of cocaine was established when the defendant drove a codefendant to a location where cocaine was being processed and then remained at that location despite the obvious and nauseating smell of ether, which is an integral component in the processing of cocaine. As these cases suggest, constructive possession exists when the totality of the circumstances indicates a sufficient nexus between the defendant and the contraband. <em>Rackley, </em>742 F2d 1272. The court in <em>Disla </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">We have stated that constructive possession may be demonstrated by direct or circumstantial evidence that the defendant had the power to dispose of the drug, or \"the ability to produce the drug . . .,\u201d or that the defendant had the \"exclusive control or dominion over property on which contraband narcotics are found . . . .\u201d Constructive possession may also be proven by the defendant\u2019s participation in a \"joint venture\u201d to possess a controlled substance. The ultimate question is whether, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the government, the evidence establishes a sufficient connection between the defendant and the contraband to support the inference that the defendant exercised a dominion and control over the substance. [805 F2d 1350 (citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>omitted). See also <em>Summers, supra, </em>68 Mich App 584.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In this case, at least three factors were shown that linked the defendant with the crack cocaine found at the Sixth Street apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">First, there was evidence that defendant Wolfe was in control of the premises where the drugs were found. Wolfe testified that he invited the other men to Saginaw and arranged to meet them at the Sixth Street apartment. He testified that the others who came from Detroit that day did not know where the apartment was located. Defendant Wolfe planned to show them where it was, and, as Rogers testified, he did show them. According to Rogers, he and the others were flagged down by Wolfe from the porch of the apartment when he saw them approaching from the street. Further, Wolfe was the only person found to have a key to the apartment. Surely, it was reasonable for the jury to infer that the evidence \"demonstrated more than [Wolfe\u2019s] mere presence at the apartment as a casual invitee.\u201d <em>Castillo, supra, </em>844 F2d 1393. Indeed, because testimony of the officers supported the conclusion that Wolfe had the only key to the apartment and was the only one of the men from Detroit who knew the precise location of the apartment, a rational jury could logically have inferred from all the circumstances that, among those found in the apartment, Wolfe was the one with control over the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Second, Wolfe fled with the other men into a back bedroom when the police entered the apartment to search it. There was evidence that attempts were being made in that bedroom to conceal the crack cocaine. In <em>Williams, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals determined that sufficient evidence of possession was shown when \"defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>was discovered by police officers in an abandoned home, crouching over a can containing packets of cocaine in an apparent attempt to destroy them.\u201d 188 Mich App 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Third, there was substantial evidence that Wolfe was working with the other men in this crack-selling operation. Evidence was presented that a sale of similarly packaged cocaine had been made from the apartment earlier in the evening and that Wolfe was involved in that sale. The undercover officer whq purchased the crack heard other voices in the apartment at the time of the purchase. Rogers testified that he and Wolfe were at the apartment around the time of the sale.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Wolfe subsequently was found in possession of the two $5 bills that were used to purchase the cocaine. Further, Wolfe admitted that he knew there was crack cocaine in the apartment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> More significantly, Wolfe arranged the meeting in Saginaw at the apartment. Although he denied it, one of the officers testified that Wolfe was in possession of a beeper at the time of the search. It would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>reasonable to infer that he carried the beeper to stay in contact with the other men who traveled together from Detroit and were shown to have the number of that beeper. In light of these facts, we cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that there was \"no evidence linking defendant to the prior drug sale to the undercover officer,\u201d nor can we agree that the prosecution failed to provide \"any connection\u201d between defendant Wolfe and the cocaine found in the apartment. Because strong evidence was presented connecting Wolfe with the vacant apartment, the crack cocaine in the apartment, and the other men in the apartment (at least one of whom unquestionably sold cocaine from the apartment), a rational jury could have concluded that Wolfe knew the cocaine was present, and that he had the right to exercise control over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Just as proof of actual possession of narcotics is not necessary to prove possession, actual delivery of narcotics is not required to prove intent to deliver. Intent to deliver has been inferred from the quantity of narcotics in a defendant\u2019s possession, from the way in which those narcotics are packaged, and from other circumstances surrounding the arrest. See <em>United States v Montes-Cardenas, </em>746 F2d 771, 779 (CA 11, 1984); <em>Mumford, supra, </em>60 Mich App 283; <em>People v Delongchamps, </em>103 Mich App 151, 160; 302 NW2d 626 (1981); <em>People v Gay, </em>149 Mich App 468; 386 NW2d 556 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">In this case, uncontradicted evidence was presented that cocaine was sold from the apartment. There was evidence that the recovered crack cocaine was packaged for sale in individual enve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>lopes. None of the evidence suggested that the cocaine was possessed simply for personal use. No glass pipes or other paraphernalia typically used to smoke cocaine were found. Rather, all of the evidence indicated that the cocaine was possessed with the intent of selling it.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Equally compelling evidence was presented that Wolfe was one of those who intended to sell the cocaine. Defendant Wolfe arranged the meeting at the apartment in Saginaw. Among those who came from Detroit, he was the only one who knew the precise location of the apartment. He was the only person found to have a key to the apartment. He was in possession of a beeper; Rogers had the number of that beeper. According to an expert who testified at trial, beepers are commonly used in the drug trade. Wolfe was found in possession of th\u00e9 two $5 bills that were used in the controlled cocaine purchase, as well as $255, mostly in bills of small denomination. Taken together, these pieces of evidence support much more than an inference that Wolfe simply was \"at the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d Indeed, Wolfe\u2019s possession of the marked money, coupled with his exclusive knowledge of the location of the vacant apartment and his possession of the only key to the apartment, suggest that Wolfe was a principal or primary figure in this cocaine selling operation. It is reasonable to infer that Wolfe was given the money from the controlled sale (and perhaps other drug sales) because he was in charge of this crack house in Saginaw. In short, viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence permits the inference that Wolfe arranged the March 9 meeting at this uninhabited and uninhabitable apartment with the intent to participate in the activity for which the apartment was ideally suited \u2014 the sale of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Although the evidence of possession with intent to deliver in this case was circumstantial, we conclude that it is sufficient. Possession with intent to deliver can be established by circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences arising from that evidence, just as it can be established by direct evidence. <em>Peterson v Oceana Circuit Judge, </em>243 Mich 215, 217; 219 NW 934 (1928); <em>People v Maliskey, </em>77 Mich App 444, 453; 258 NW2d 512 (1977).

Cf. <em>People v Edgar, </em>75 Mich App 467, 473; 255 NW2d 648 (1977); <em>People v Daniels, </em>163 Mich App 703, 707; 415 NW2d 282 (1987); <em>People v Corbett, </em>97 Mich App 438, 445; 296 NW2d 64 (1980); <em>People v Carson, </em>189 Mich App 268, 269; 471 NW2d 655 (1991). Although the Court cited <em>Davenport, </em>we do not read its opinion as holding that the prosecution must negate all reasonable theories of innocence. Instead, the Court\u2019s decision appears to be based upon a finding that the prosecution failed to provide <em>any </em>evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt. For example, the panel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">There is <em>no evidence </em>linking defendant to the prior drug sale to the undercover officer, or that he had given any type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>assistance, support, encouragement to <em>anyone </em>regarding the possession or delivery of the cocaine. [Slip op, p 3. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">As our review of the evidence indicates, we disagree with the Court of Appeals and conclude that, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, sufficient evidence, albeit circumstantial, was presented that would permit a rational trier of fact to conclude that defendant\u2019s guilt was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Under these circumstances and because the issue is not properly raised, we see no need to consider the so-called <em>Davenport </em>standard in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b628-6\">Boyle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1N\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>This case presents the Court with the opportunity to clarify the standard for sufficient evidence and its application to convictions of possession with intent to deliver less than fifty grams of cocaine and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. The jury relied on circumstantial evidence to convict the defendant without specifying whether liability was direct or based on the prosecutor\u2019s aiding and abetting theory. I agree with the majority that, while the Court of Appeals articulated the proper test, it did not properly apply it.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The conclusion of the Court of Appeals is explicable either by a mistaken application of the <em>Hampton </em>standard,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or under a theory that because the evidence was circumstantial, the prosecution was under an affirmative duty to rule out every hypothesis except that of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The standard for appellate review of convictions based on circumstantial evidence has been a persistent source of confusion and conflict for decades.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the failure of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>majority to deal fully with the issue presents the potential for further confusion, I write briefly to elaborate upon that issue, and to state that the felony-firearm question should be remanded to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Court of Appeals for resolution in light of the appropriate standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The defendant argues that the Court of Appeals properly applied the sufficiency of evidence rule to reverse his conviction. He emphasizes that the Court of Appeals articulated the proper standard, <em>People v Hampton, </em>407 Mich 354; 285 NW2d 284 (1979). Despite the Court of Appeals citation of <em>People v Davenport, </em>39 Mich App 252; 197 NW2d 521 (1972), defendant contends that the Court did not rely on <em>Davenport </em>for the proposition that the prosecution must disprove all reasonable theories of innocence. Thus, he urges this Court to avoid discussion of the conflicting lines of authority regarding the prosecutor\u2019s burden in a circumstantial evidence case.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The defendant instead seeks to frame the issue as whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction under <em>Hampton. </em>Stressing that presence alone does not establish criminality, the defendant relies on <em>People v Burrel, </em>253 Mich 321; 235 NW 170 (1931), and <em>People v Lewis, </em>178 Mich App 464; 444 NW2d 194 (1989), to support the argument that more than mere association with an item must be shown to establish possession and that circumstantial evidence in this case is lacking because it shows only that \"Wolfe <em>may </em>have had a connection to the <em>previous sale </em>of cocaine.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Emphasizing that the evidence linked Wolfe to the domicile, not to the drugs that were seized, and that others were present and had access to the drugs, the defendant contends that the circumstantial evidence presented is insufficient. Explicit in this argument and the Court of Appeals analysis is the standard of appellate review of a sufficiency claim in respect to a convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>tion based on circumstantial evidence. Implicit in the argument is the notion that, unless the prosecutor negates theories of innocence, that is, proves that no one else possessed the drugs to the exclusion of the defendant, the jury is not entitled to infer possession with intent to deliver from the facts presented.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Thus, the significance of this case is not whether <em>Davenport </em>is expressly referenced for the disputed proposition, but, rather, the appropriate standard of appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence in criminal convictions. As explained in 2 Wright, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Criminal (2d ed), \u00a7 467, p 655, the standard to be applied by a trial court in deciding a motion for judgment of acquittal is the same standard that an appellate court should apply when reviewing the matter. The theory that there is a special rule applicable to cases based on circumstantial evidence that requires the exclusion of every hypothesis except that of guilt, <em>id. </em>at 655-662, has been rejected by the United States Supreme Court, <em>Holland v United </em>States, 348 US 121, 140; 75 S Ct 127; 99 L Ed 157 (1954), by this Court, <em>People v Bercheny, </em>387 Mich 431; 196 NW2d 767 (1972), and by virtually every federal circuit court. \"It is now understood that a single test applies, regardless of the kind of evidence . . . .\u201d Wright, <em>supra </em>at 662-663.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The majority properly emphasizes that, \"when determining whether sufficient evidence has been presented to sustain a conviction, a court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of the crime were proven beyond a rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>sonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Griffin, J., <em>ante, </em>p 515. This standard underscores the critical differences between the functions of the trier of fact and the reviewing court. The trier of fact must be sure of every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the jury must be persuaded that the evidence it believes and upon which it relies is sufficiently strong to exclude a doubt based on reason regarding the defendant\u2019s innocence. In <em>State v Poellinger, </em>153 Wis 2d 493, 504-506; 451 NW2d 752 (1990), the Wisconsin Supreme Court identified the importance of the distinction between trial and appellate functions in the context of appellate challenges to convictions based on circumstantial evidence, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">[T]his court has often failed to maintain the appropriate distinction between the applicability of the hypothesis of innocence rule at the trial court level and the applicability of the reasonable doubt standard of review on appeal. We have recognized that the elimination of hypothesis of innocence is the process by which the trier of fact reaches a determination of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and we have mistakenly stated that a conviction based on circumstantial evidence may be sustained on appeal or review if the evidence is sufficiently strong to exclude every reasonable theory of innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">The defendant is, in essence, asking this court to sit as a judge or jury making findings of fact and to apply the hypothesis of innocence rule <em>de novo </em>to the evidence presented at her trial to determine if, in our view, the hypothesis that she did not know that she possessed cocaine is sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>reasonable to warrant reversal of her conviction. It is not the role of an appellate court to do that. To the extent that prior decisions of this court have suggested that the hypothesis of innocence rule is in any way applicable in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we . . . take the opportunity presented in this case to clearly state that it is not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The Ohio Supreme Court aptly observed that the rule that the prosecutor must disprove reasonable innocence theories turns the \"standard on its head.\u201d <em>State v Jenks, </em>61 Ohio St 3d 259, 267; 574 NE2d 492 (1991). Similarly, although defendant\u2019s argument has been presented with exceptional skill, it mistakenly suggests that the negation of reasonable theories consistent with innocence is the standard of appellate review. The result of adopting this suggestion would be to permit the reviewing court to ask whether any reasonable juror could have found the defendant innocent, not, as required under <em>Hampton, </em>whether any reasonable juror could have found the defendant guilty. As this Court explained in <em>People v Fuller, </em>395 Mich 451, 455; 236 NW2d 58 (1975),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">It is for the trier of fact to determine if the prosecution has \"negate[d] every reasonable theory consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence of the crime charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">At the appellate level, all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the prosecution, and then, if any reasonable juror could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the verdict must be upheld. A major focus of the defendant\u2019s argument in the Court of Appeals and this Court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>that there was insufficient evidence connecting him to the cocaine and the weapon. Relying on <em>People v </em>Millard, 53 Mich 63, 70; 18 NW 562 (1884), the defendant asserted that the prosecution\u2019s \"case was not only circumstantial and weak, it was too weak to overcome the reasonable theory of innocence Mr. Wolfe presented throughout the trial.\u201d The defendant suggests that \"even if the Court of Appeals in this case did implicitly apply the circumstantial evidence rule, it was not error to do so.\u201d The defendant\u2019s argument, the Court of Appeals focus on the circumstantial nature of the evidence, and the panel\u2019s conclusion that the evidence demonstrates, \"at best, that defendant was at the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d all evidence an approach that transmits the reviewing court into a thirteenth juror weighing inferences against the prosecution. Unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, decided December 19, 1990 (Docket No. 113403). As Chief Judge Julian Cook observed in rejecting a similar circumstantial evidence claim in <em>United States v </em>Turner, 490 F Supp 583, 590 (ED Mich, 1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">It would be improper to . . . hold that when <em>any </em>inference of innocence (arising out of circumstantial evidence) exists, the Court must acquit. ... To hold otherwise would be to return to the old and rejected \"only hypothesis\u201d rule. [Emphasis in the original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Several Court of Appeals opinions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> have misread <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the holding of <em>People v Millard, supra, </em>and applied it to the issue of sufficiency of the evidence of a crime where more than one person might be participating.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>People v Spann, </em>3 Mich App 444, 454; 142 NW2d 887 (1966), the Court extended the <em>Millard </em>rule to reverse a conviction where the \"prosecution failed to present a theory of the case and proof that excluded all possible theories of innocence explaining [the defendant\u2019s] conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Axv\">Other authority has extended the rationale of <em>People v Burrel, supra, </em>to expand the standard of appellate review. The defendant in <em>Burrel </em>was convicted for aiding and abetting the statutory rape of a young woman by a codefendant. The defendant drove his car and, at the direction of the codefendant, picked up a young girl who got into the back seat with the codefendant where they had consensual intercourse. There was no evidence that the defendant was aware that the girl was underage or knew that the codefendant intended statutory rape. The <em>Burrel </em>Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis that mere presence is not enough to make a person an aider or abettor. Thus, no inference of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>criminality could logically be drawn from the facts of <em>Burrel. </em>The holding does not authorize reviewing courts to thwart the factfinder from drawing permissible inferences from a defendant\u2019s presence at the scene of a crime or at the scene of contraband.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The rule that mere presence is not enough to conclude that a defendant is guilty does not mean that a jury may not draw any inference regarding possession or intent to deliver from the defendant\u2019s presence in compromising circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">When applied to a circumstantial evidence case for possession of, or possession with intent to deliver, drugs, and involving more than one potential defendant, an expansive interpretation of the authority of the reviewing court produces the anomalous consequence that each defendant must be acquitted because all might be guilty. Thus, the Court of Appeals here concluded that the evidence merely shows that defendant was one of many who had access to the apartment from which cocaine was sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">In viewing evidence that could support conflicting inferences, the trier of fact is free to \"believe, or disbelieve, in whole or in part, any of the evidence presented.\u201d Fuller, <em>supra </em>at 453. The trier of fact can choose among rational inferences from evidence presented and reject an inference consistent with acquittal. Thus, when a reviewing court is presented with a record of historical facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>that could support more than one inference, an appellate court is obligated to accept the inference drawn by the trier of fact and defer to that resolution as long as <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v </em>Virginia, 443 US 307; 99 S Ct 2781; 61 L Ed 2d 560 (1979).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The appellate court is not authorized to substitute its judgment for that of the factfinder when additional evidence beyond mere presence has been presented.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For purposes of appellate review, \" 'mere proximity to illegal drugs, mere presence on the property where they are located or mere association with persons who do control them, without more, is insufficient to support a finding of possession.\u2019 \u201d However, \" 'such proximity, presence, or association is sufficient when accompanied ... with testimony connecting the defendant with the incriminating surrounding circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v </em>Rogers, 921 F2d 1089, 1093 (CA 10, 1990). In other words, while mere presence cannot result in a conviction, the fact that the prosecution need not disprove all reasonable innocence theories means that the prosecution need not affirmatively prove that no individual other than the defendant had access to the contraband for the conviction to survive appellate challenge. When an appellate court independently reviews the evidence, it asks whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>reasonable juror could have found that the essential elements of the crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Hampton, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Because it concluded that the underlying felony required reversal, the Court of Appeals did not address the felony:firearm count except to note that the evidence was \"tenuous.\u201d Slip op, p 3, n 1. The parties here have focused largely on the underlying felony and issues surrounding that count. Rather than decide the issue without the benefit of a' full record, I would remand the case to the Court of Appeals for its consideration of that issue. In doing so, I would observe, however, that the evidence shows more than mere presence. The jury could have found that defendant had the exclusive means of access to the apartment and, given the compactness of the apartment and the visibility of the weapon, might have concluded that he had constructive possession of the weapon as well as the cocaine. See <em>United States v LaGuardia, </em>774 F2d 317 (CA 8, 1985); <em>United States v Curry, </em>911 F2d 72 (CA 8, 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Thus, I concur in the majority\u2019s reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstatement of the defendant\u2019s conviction with respect to the first count, possession with intent to deliver. I respectfully, but strenuously disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to opine with respect to the second issue, and would remand this question to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\"> <em>People v Hampton, </em>407 Mich 354; 285 NW2d 284 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b628-9\"> Compare, e.g., <em>People v Davenport, </em>39 Mich App 252; 197 NW2d 521 (1972), <em>People v Simpson, </em>104 Mich App 731; 305 NW2d 249 (1980), and <em>People v Lewis, </em>178 Mich App 464; 444 NW2d 194 (1989), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>with <em>People v Mumford, </em>60 Mich App 279; 230 NW2d 395 (1975), <em>People v Edgar, </em>75 Mich App 467; 255 NW2d 648 (1977), and <em>People v Carson, </em>189 Mich App 268; 471 NW2d 655 (1991).

Thus, <em>Millard </em>involved a review of jury instructions, not the sufficiency of evidence. Furthermore, the <em>Millard </em>Court focused on the corpus delicti rule that where \"independent evidence was as consistent with death from natural causes as from poison,\u201d a conviction cannot be sustained. Perkins, Criminal Law (3d ed), p 147. This Court more recently explained that the corpus delicti of a crime means \"the essential wrong\u201d and does not require independent proof of every essential element of the crime charged. <em>People v Williams, </em>422 Mich 381, 392; 373 NW2d 567 (1985). Rather, we embraced the approach taken by Wigmore, that the corpus delicti includes two elements, the fact of the specific loss and someone\u2019s criminality. 7 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn rev), \u00a7 2072, pp 524-526.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b636-10\"> Other panels have applied the same rationale without citing <em>Burrel. </em>See, e.g., <em>People v Lewis, supra </em>(the Court reversed a conviction because it concluded that the \"most\u201d that the evidence showed was that the defendant was not the only person who had access to the inside of a house where drugs were sold); <em>People v Simpson, </em>n 2 <em>supra </em>at 733-734.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b637-6\"> See <em>Poellinger, supra </em>at 505-507.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\"> See, e.g., <em>People </em>v <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 454 (the defendant\u2019s activities \"were consonant with a theory of active participation\u201d in the crime as a lookout); <em>People v Dockery, </em>20 Mich App 201, 206, n 1; 173 NW2d 726 (1969) (where the defendant knowingly took advantage of the fear induced in the rape victim by two codefendants who had raped her first his \"participation goes far beyond . . . mere presence\u201d); <em>People v Valot, </em>n 2 <em>supra </em>(the Court held that the defendant\u2019s control of the drugs was reasonably inferred from the fact that he registered for the room, paid the rent, was arrested in the room where the odor of marijuana was strong, and marijuana was found in proximity to the defendant\u2019s bed in which he was sleeping).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
