We conclude that the jury instructions given do not accurately set out the duty of a premises owner. Accordingly, we reverse the decisions of the lower courts and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Plaintiff Vance Riddle has worked with or around coils of steel for over seventeen years. At the time of his accident, Riddle was employed with W. T. Cartage Manufacturing Company as a truck driver and steel and general freight hauler.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">In 1983, Riddle began hauling steel coils from defendant McLouth Steel\u2019s Trenton plant to its Gibraltar plant on a daily basis. Prior to Gibraltar plant delivery, the steel coils are treated to prevent rusting in a process called \"pickling.\u201d Under this process, cold rolled steel is unrolled and covered with oil. The steel coils are then rerolled and placed on racks in a coil field<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> where the excess oil is allowed to drain. The treated steel coils are then loaded onto trucks and taken to McLouth\u2019s Gibraltar plant. Here, the steel coils are unloaded and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>stored on metal rails where they continue to drain until moved for additional processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">As a consequence of the \"pickling\u201d process, oil drips and accumulates on the plant floor creating slippery conditions. There are no signs posted at the Gibraltar plant warning of the slippery conditions. While there are designated walkways around the coil field, there are no signs prohibiting McLouth employees from walking through the coil field. Sometimes the accumulated oil remains on the floor for six to eight weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">On January 19, 1984, the date of his injury, Vance Riddle and another truck driver, Charles Pfeiffer, were engaged in loading and unloading treated steel coils at the Gibraltar plant. Riddle was asked by a McLouth employee to deliver a box of computer billing cards to McLouth\u2019s receiving clerk\u2019s office before leaving for the Trenton plant. After unloading their trucks, Riddle and Pfeiffer cut across the coil field to the clerk\u2019s office. Evidence submitted at trial indicated that the path that Riddle and Pfeiffer took through the coil field was the most direct route to the clerk\u2019s office. Although steel coils were being stored in the coil field about thirty feet from their path, both Riddle and Pfeiffer testified that they did not realize the area through which they walked contained oil. Moreover, Riddle and Pfeiffer testified that they had observed a McLouth employee cleaning the area earlier in the day. While crossing the coil field, Riddle suddenly lost his balance and fell backward. His hard hat flew off and he hit his head on one of the metal rails and lost consciousness. Riddle sustained severe injuries, including a cerebral concussion, injury to the left shoulder and elbow, and back strain.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Vance Riddle brought suit against defendant McLouth Steel to recover lost wages, and his wife, Lucinda Riddle, made claims for loss of consortium. Riddle argued that McLouth breached its duty to exercise reasonable care and that Mc-Louth\u2019s failure to warn of the slippery condition of the coil field was the proximate cause of his injuries. McLouth argued that Riddle had knowledge of the presence of oil in the coil field and therefore McLouth had no duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The jury awarded Vance Riddle $4,680,000, and Lucinda Riddle $320,000 for loss of consortium, but reduced the award after it found Vance Riddle thirty percent comparatively negligent. After trial, McLouth filed motions for a directed verdict, for a new trial, or remittitur. The trial court denied all motions. McLouth then filed a motion for reconsideration, which was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The Court of Appeals found no instructional error and affirmed the decision of the circuit court, 182 Mich App 259; 451 NW2d 590 (1990), and denied McLouth\u2019s motion of rehearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">We granted leave by order dated March 27, 1991. 437 Mich 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">It is well settled in Michigan that a premises owner must maintain his or her property in a reasonably safe condition and has a duty to exercise due care to protect invitees from conditions that might result in injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Beals v Walker, </em>416 Mich 469, 480; 331 NW2d 700 (1982); <em>Torma v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co, </em>336 Mich 468, 476; 58 NW2d 149 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">However, a premises owner\u2019s duty to warn extends to hidden or latent defects. <em>Samuelson v Cleveland Iron Mining Co, </em>49 Mich 164; 13 NW 499 (1882). The rationale underlying this rule is that liability for injuries resulting from defectively maintained premises should rest upon the one who is in control or possession of the premises and, thus, is best able to prevent the injury. See <em>Nezworski v Mazanec, </em>301 Mich 43, 56; 2 NW2d 912 (1942); <em>Smith v Peninsular Car Works, </em>60 Mich 501, 504; 27 NW 662 (1886). This Court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">Every man who expressly or by implication invites others to come upon his premises, assumes to all who accept the invitation the duty to warn them of any danger in coming, which he knows of or ought to know of, and of <em>which they are not aware. [Samuelson </em>at 170, Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Later cases carried this proposition forward. In <em>Caniff v Blanchard Navigation Co, </em>66 Mich 638; 33 NW 744 (1887), the plaintiff fell through an open hatch on a ship being docked for the winter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the danger was not hidden, this Court denied plaintiff a cause of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">The occupier of premises, no doubt, is bound, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>to persons thereon by his express or implied invitation, to keep the premises free from, or give a warning of, danger known to him and unknown to the visitor. But this rule has no application to a case where a person who from his experience, through many years, in sailing a vessel, knows that it is customary to leave the hatchways of vessels open while lying in port, and whom observation teaches that they are liable to be open rather than closed, and are sources of danger which he must avoid at his peril. [66 Mich 647.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Similarly, in <em>Nezworski v Mazanec, supra, </em>the plaintiff sued for injuries sustained when she descended a darkened stairway on the defendant\u2019s premises.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This Court expressed the rule simply: \"If there were hidden dangers in connection with the doorway, platform, stairway, and alley, it was [the premises owner\u2019s] duty to give warning thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61. Thus, if the dangers are known or obvious to the invitee, no absolute duty to warn exists, and the invitee cannot recover on that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">This Court adopted the definition provided in 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 343 of the general legal duty that a premises owner owes an invitee. In <em>Ackerberg v Muskegon Osteopathic Hosp, </em>366 Mich 596, 600; 115 NW2d 290 (1962), we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">\"A possessor of land is subject to liability for bodily harm caused to business visitors by a natural or artificial condition thereon if, but only if, he (a) knows, or by the exercise of reasonable care could discover, the condition which, if known to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>him, he should realize as involving an unreasonable risk to them.\u201d<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The plaintiff in <em>Ackerberg </em>sustained severe head injuries after falling from an unguarded rear platform at the entrance of the defendant\u2019s premises. This Court found that, despite the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence, there was a question of fact regarding the defendant\u2019s negligence that was appropriate for jury consideration, and reversed the directed verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In <em>Quinlivan v Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co, Inc, </em>395 Mich 244; 235 NW2d 732 (1975), we affirmed Ackerberg. and adopted the revised \u00a7 343 and subsections (b) and (c), which further define a premises owner\u2019s duty to invitees. 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 343 reads in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">A possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm caused to his invitees by a condition on the land if, but only if, he (a) knows or by the exercise of reasonable care would discover the condition, and should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to such invitees, and (b) should expect that they will not discover or realize the danger, or will fail to protect themselves against it, and (c) fails to exercise reasonable care to protect them against the danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-7\"><em>Quinlivan </em>overruled existing case law which held that a premises owner owed no duty to a business invitee regarding obvious hazards arising from natural accumulations of ice and snow. We held that \"[a]s such duty pertains to ice and snow accumulations, it will require that reasonable measures be taken . . . .\u201d <em>Quinlivan </em>at 261.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Finally, in <em>Williams v Cunningham Drug Stores, Inc, </em>429 Mich 495, 500; 418 NW2d 381 (1988), this Court held that a premises owner is not an insurer of the safety of invitees. Moreover, we held that a possessor of land does not owe a duty to protect his invitees where conditions arise from which an unreasonable risk cannot be anticipated or of dangers that are so obvious and apparent that an invitee may be expected to discover them himself. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, we found that, as a matter of law, the duty of reasonable care a merchant owes its invitees does not extend to providing armed, visible security guards to protect customers from the criminal acts of third parties. <em>Id. </em>at 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Further, we noted the standard outlined in 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 343A, whereby the invitee\u2019s knowledge of dangerous conditions may be properly considered in determining a premises owner\u2019s liability. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 500, n 12. 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 343A(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">A possessor of land is not liable to his invitees for physical harm caused to them by any activity \u25a0or condition on the land whose danger is known or obvious to them, unless the possessor should anticipate the harm despite such knowledge or obviousness.<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Our conclusions in these Michigan cases correctly define the law regarding a premises owner\u2019s duty of care to invitees.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The Court of Appeals incorrectly determined that the \"no duty to warn of open and obvious danger\u201d rule is inconsistent with comparative negligence and should be abolished. 182 Mich App 266. The adoption of comparative negligence in Michigan does not abrogate the necessity of an initial finding that the premises owner owed a duty to invitees. Moreover, we find that the duty element and the comparative negligence standard are fundamentally exclusive \u2014 two doctrines to be utilized at different junctures in the determination of liability in a negligence cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The threshold issue of the duty of care in negligence actions must be decided by the trial court as a matter of law. <em>Antcliff v State Employees Credit Union, </em>414 Mich 624; 327 NW2d 814 (1982). In other words, the court determines the circumstances that must exist in order for a defendant\u2019s duty to arise. <em>Smith v Allendale Mut Ins Co, </em>410 Mich 685, 714-715; 303 NW2d 702 (1981). See, generally, Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), ch 5. Duty may be established \"specifically by mandate of statute, or it may arise generally by operation of law under application of the basic rule of the common law, which imposes on every person engaged in the prosecution of any undertaking an obligation to use due care, or to so govern his actions as not to unreasonably endanger the person or property of others.\u201d <em>Clark v Dalman, </em>379 Mich 251, 261; 150 NW2d 755 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Moreover, the \"no duty to warn of open and obvious danger\u201d rule is a defensive doctrine that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>attacks the duty element that a plaintiff must establish in a prima facie negligence case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A negligence action may only be maintained if a legal duty exists which requires the defendant to conform to a particular standard of conduct in order to protect others against unreasonable risks of harm. If the plaintiff is a business invitee, the premises owner has a duty to exercise due care to protect the invitee from dangerous conditions. <em>Beals, supra. </em>However, where the dangers are known to the invitee or are so obvious that the invitee might reasonably be expected to discover them, an invitor owes no duty to protect or warn the invitee unless he should anticipate the harm despite knowledge of it on behalf of the invitee. <em>Williams, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Once a defendant\u2019s legal duty is established, the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s conduct under that standard is generally a question for the jury. See <em>Smith v Allendale, supra </em>at 714. The jury must decide whether the defendant breached the legal duty owed to the plaintiff, that the defendant\u2019s breach was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, and thus, that the defendant is negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">If, for example, the dangerous conditions on the premises are hidden or latent, the premises owner is obliged to warn the invitee of the dangers. Defendant\u2019s failure to warn under these circumstances may indicate a breach of the legal duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>owed plaintiff. If the conditions are known or obvious to the invitee, the premises owner may nonetheless be required to exercise reasonable care to protect the invitee from the danger. <em>Quinlivan, supra </em>at 260-261. What constitutes reasonable care under the circumstances must be determined from the facts of the case. While the jury may conclude that the duty to exercise due care requires the premises owner to warn of a dangerous condition, there is no absolute duty to warn invitees of known or obvious dangers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Conversely, comparative negligence is an affirmative defense. Michigan adopted this standard to promulgate a \"fair system of apportionment of damages.\u201d See <em>Placek v Sterling </em>Heights, 405 Mich 638; 275 NW2d 511 (1979). Under this doctrine, a defendant may present evidence of a plaintiff\u2019s negligence in order to reduce liability. Before the adoption of comparative negligence, a plaintiff was wholly precluded from bringing a negligence action against a defendant if the plaintiff was contributorily negligent. Although the adoption of comparative negligence may have limited a defendant\u2019s defenses, the defendant\u2019s initial duty has not been altered.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">We find persuasive the analysis of the Illinois Supreme Court in <em>Ward v K mart Corp, </em>136 Ill 2d 132; 554 NE2d 223 (1990). In <em>Ward, </em>the plaintiff sustained injuries when he walked into a concrete post, while leaving the defendant\u2019s department store. The Illinois Supreme Court reversed the judgment notwithstanding the jury\u2019s verdict for the defendant and found that the defendant\u2019s duty to exercise reasonable care extended to invitees even when the conditions are as obvious as a concrete post in the entryway.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Considering the plaintiff\u2019s negligence in relation to the defendant\u2019s duty, the <em>Ward </em>court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>We agree with plaintiff that the fact a person\u2019s injury resulted from his encountering a known or open and obvious condition on a defendant\u2019s premises is a proper factor to be considered in assessing the person\u2019s comparative negligence. It is unquestionably relevant to whether the injured party was exercising a reasonable degree of care for his own safety. And in this respect a plaintiff\u2019s own fault in encountering such a condition will not necessarily bar his recovery. As discussed below, however, we find that the obviousness of a condition is also relevant to the existence of a duty on the part of defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">Initially we reject plaintiff\u2019s argument that the adoption of comparative negligence in this State has affected the basic duty a landowner or occupier owes to entrants upon his land with respect to such conditions. Some courts and commentators have apparently embraced the position taken by plaintiff in this respect. . . . The primary justification for this approach is the proposition that a consequence of the adoption of comparative negligence is the elimination of those common law devices which act as absolute bars to recovery. We find this argument unpersuasive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">... In the present case, however, we are not so much concerned with the defenses available to defendant, but rather with the existence of a duty on the part of defendant in the first instance. In a common law negligence action, before a plaintiff\u2019s fault can be compared with that of the defendant, it obviously must first be determined that the defendant was negligent. It is fundamental tort law that before a defendant can be found to have been negligent, it must first be determined that the defendant owed a legal duty to the plaintiff. . . . We hold therefore that the adoption of comparative negligence in this State has no effect on the basic duty a defendant owes to a plaintiff. <em>[Id. </em>at 143-145.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">In light of the above discussion, we hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\"no duty to warn of open and obvious dangers\u201d rule remains viable in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">On appeal, McLouth argued that the trial court inappropriately instructed the jury pursuant to SJI2d 19.03. The following instruction was given:<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">It is the duty of a possessor of premises <em>to exercise reasonable care for the protection of an invitee, </em>the status that Mr. Riddle had in this case. <em>The possessor must warn the invitee of dangers of which it knows or has created and must inspect the premises to discover possible dangerous conditions of which it does not know. </em>It must take reasonable precautions to protect the invitee from dangers that are foreseeable. <em>However, a possessor is not an insurer of the safety of an invitee, and his duty is only to exercise reasonable care for the invitee\u2019s protection. </em>The mere existence of a defect or danger is not enough to establish liability unless it is shown to be of such character, or such duration that it would have been discovered by a reasonably careful person. [Emphasis added.]<footnotemark>[14]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Specifically, McLouth cites the trial court\u2019s statement that \"[t]he possessor must warn the invitee of dangers of which it knows or has created . . . McLouth claims that this instruction left the jury with the impression that premises owners have an <em>absolute </em>duty to warn invitees of dangers which are known and obvious. We agree.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In light of Michigan\u2019s case law regarding a premises owner\u2019s duty to invitees, the trial judge incorrectly instructed the jury, leaving the impression that a premises owner\u2019s duty to warn an invitee of dangerous conditions on the premises is absolute and ever present. There is no dispute that the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury must be considered as a whole. <em>Shreve v Leavitt, </em>51 Mich App 235; 214 NW2d 739 (1974). Moreover, in reviewing jury instructions, this Court must ask \"[d]id the instructions as given adequately inform the jury on the applicable law reflecting and reflected by the various evidentiary claims in the particular case?\u201d <em>Huffman v First Baptist Church of Flushing, </em>355 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Mich 437, 446; 94 NW2d 869 (1959). We have reviewed the jury instructions in their entirety and find them deficient in setting forth the appropriate duty of premises owners to invitees. Considered as a whole, the other qualifying language in the jury instruction is not sufficient to dispel the premise that this defendant, as a matter of law, should have warned Riddle of the slippery conditions of the coil field.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">McLouth also claims that the jury instruction pursuant to SJI2d 12.05 constituted error requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">The General Industry Safety Standard Commission has adopted certain regulations pursuant to an authority given to it by the State statute. Rule 15 on housekeeping of the General Industry Safety Standard Commission provides that the floor of the work area, passage way, or aisle shall be maintained in a manner that does not create a hazard and that is free of accumulation of scrap, debris, water, oil, or grease and other slip and trip hazards. That regulation also provides that where a wet process is used drainage shall be maintained, or false floors, platforms, or mats used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-10\">If you find that the Defendant violated this regulation before or at the time of the occurrence, such violation is evidence of negligence which you should consider together with all other evidence in deciding whether Plaintiff [sic] was negligent. If you find that the Defendant was negligent, you must then decide whether such negligence was a proximate cause of the injuries to Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">McLouth contends that Riddle\u2019s theory of negligence did not include violation of a regulation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>thus McLouth was denied the opportunity to rebut an alleged violation at trial. However, the Court of Appeals concluded that the instruction was appropriate, given the circumstances of the case. 182 Mich App 266. We agree. The regulation requires employers to free business premises of dangers that may cause employees, or independent contractors, serious bodily injury. It is undisputed that Riddle was working as an independent contractor on McLouth\u2019s business premises when he sustained injuries. The Court of Appeals resolution of McLouth\u2019s second argument renders further discussion of SJI2d 12.05 unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The trial judge incorrectly instructed the jury with regard to the duty of a premises owner to invitees. The Court of Appeals mistakenly concluded that the \"no duty to warn of open and obvious dangers\u201d has been abolished in Michigan. The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b203-6\">Brickley, Boyle, Riley, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Mallett, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\"> The coil field is a cement floor on which metal rails have been placed to prevent the steel from rolling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-6\"> Vance Riddle continues to experience severe personality changes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>and loss of memory.

The possessor of the land may reasonably assume that he will protect himself by the exercise of ordinary care, or that he will voluntarily assume the risk of harm if he does not succeed in doing so.

It must take reasonable precautions to protect the invitee from dangers that are foreseeable. However, a possessor is not an insurer of the safety of an invitee, and his duty is only to exercise reasonable care for the invitee\u2019s protection.

We strongly believe the Court\u2019s intervention here is appropriate to avoid prospective misapplication of duty/standard of care principles. The Court of Appeals articulated an improper conclusion of law, i.e., the abolition of the \"no duty to warn of open and obvious dangers\u201d rule in light of Michigan\u2019s adoption of comparative negligence, which demanded clarification by this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b203-7\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"An4\">(dissenting). Vance Riddle, a truck driver, was severely injured when he slipped and fell on oil that had dripped from steel coils stored in a \"coil field\u201d at a McLouth Steel Products Corporation plant. The issues tried to the jury were whether McLouth breached the standard of care to be observed by a premises owner to Riddle, an invitee, and whether any negligence of Mc-Louth was a cause of Riddle\u2019s injury or, rather, whether Riddle\u2019s injury was due to Riddle\u2019s negligence in failing to take adequate precautions as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>walked through the coil field to avoid a danger that should have been known and obvious to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">There was no issue concerning the sufficiency of the evidence of McLouth\u2019s fault, or of Riddle\u2019s possible contributory fault. The majority reverses the trial court and the Court of Appeals, stating that there was an instructional omission of such importance that a new trial is required even though the trial judge instructed in accordance with a standard jury instruction \u2014 clearly applicable on the facts of the case \u2014 and the omission found by this Court to be lurking in the instruction was not perceived by McLouth\u2019s counsel at the trial level. The omission was observed and asserted for the first time on appeal in the Court of Appeals. Even then the omission was not spelled out by McLouth as this Court expresses it. Nevertheless the majority concludes that the omission was of such significance that it would be manifestly unjust to allow the judgment for Riddle to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The jury was instructed pursuant to SJI2d 19.03 that McLouth was under an obligation to warn Riddle of dangers of which McLouth knew or created. Since McLouth stored the steel coils in the coil field, and McLouth claims that the danger of oil dripping from the coils onto the coil field should have been known and obvious to Riddle, there clearly was ample evidence that McLouth, who stored the coils and thereby created the danger, both created and knew of the danger. The instruction was therefore clearly an appropriate instruction on the facts of this case. A failure to so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>instruct should<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> have been error requiring reversal had the instruction been requested by Riddle and not given, and the verdict had been for McLouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The majority concludes that the judge erred reversibly in instructing the jury, in the language of SJI2d 19.03 \u2014 an owner of premise \" 'must warn the invitee of dangers of which it knows or has created\u2019 \u201d \u2014 because the \"instruction left the jury with the impression\u201d that McLouth, as a premises owner, had \"an <em>absolute </em>duty to warn invitees of dangers which are known and obvious\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to McLouth even though the danger was also known and obvious to Riddle.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">To be sure, the court did not qualify the statement that the possessor must warn the invitee of \"dangers of which [it] knows or has created,\u201d by adverting to the possibility that a danger, known or created by McLouth, might have also been known and obvious to Riddle. It cannot properly be said, however, that because the judge did not advert to that possibility, he left the jury with the impression that McLouth had a duty to warn Riddle of dangers that were known and obvious to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">McLouth did not object to the SJI2d 19.03 instruction on the basis that the instruction would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>leave the jury with the impression that it might properly find for Riddle even if the danger was known and obvious to him. Nor did McLouth request that the jury be instructed that there is \"no duty to warn of open and obvious dangers.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">McLouth contended in its brief in the Court of Appeals that the judge should have added that \"the duty to warn is not absolute, and the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>should have been advised that <em>there are situations </em>where a failure of a premises owner to warn an invitee of known hazards will not result in the liability of the land owner.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">The Court of Appeals, ignoring that McLouth had not sought to have the jury advised of the abstraction set forth in McLouth\u2019s brief on appeal, held that the adoption of comparative negligence superseded any need to instruct on invitee negligence in ignoring a known and obvious danger.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This Court concludes that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the adoption of comparative negligence superseded any need to so instruct, and remands for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">There is no need, however, to commit error to correct the asserted error of the Court of Appeals.

Riddle contended that McLouth failed to exercise reasonable care to guard against Riddle encountering the danger in that McLouth did not inspect the floor of the coil field, warn Riddle of the presence of oil, or designate a safe path around the dangerous area.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">McLouth contended that it exercised reasonable care for Riddle\u2019s safety by providing a safe walkway around the coil field, and that Riddle was injured because, in deciding to walk through the coil field, although he knew of the oily condition, he failed to exercise reasonable care for his own safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">SJI2d 19.03 was given in a context in which it was made clear that it was for the jury to decide what McLouth should have done to discharge its obligation to keep the premises safe for invitees.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Having in mind the theories of the parties presented by the court to the jury, the single referr ence concerning McLouth\u2019s obligation to warn did not result in manifest injustice to McLouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The judge instructed the jury on McLouth\u2019s theory that Riddle \"knew or should have known the coil field contains oil,\u201d and that Riddle \"disregarded his prior knowledge,\u201d and that Riddle \"knew or should have known that in using ordinary care of the existence of oil in the coil field,\u201d and \"that was negligence on his part.\u201d The judge also instructed the jury regarding contributory negligence and comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Read as a whole, the instructions cannot properly be said, in the absence of objection, to have left the jury with the impression that McLouth had a duty to warn Riddle of dangers that were known and obvious to Riddle.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">The jury apportioned the fault of the parties. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>found Riddle to have been thirty percent at fault. It follows that the jurors concluded that Riddle\u2019s injuries were caused in part by his own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The gravamen of McLouth\u2019s appellate claims is that Riddle\u2019s knowledge of oily conditions in the coil field made the danger open and obvious to him, and thus eliminated any obligation on the part of McLouth to warn him. The only explanation for the jury finding Riddle comparatively negligent was that his knowledge of plant conditions made his decision to walk through the coil field unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The jury thus did in fact accept the proposition McLouth succeeds in urging on appeal, that Mc-Louth did not have an absolute duty to warn Riddle of the dangerous condition in the area through which he walked.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">The majority does not state, in so many words, that the instructional deficiency was the failure to state \u2014 as part of SJI2d 19.03 or as a supplement thereto \u2014 that there is \"no duty to warn of open and obvious dangers.\u201d But the opinion of the Court assuredly will be so read in light of the nine pages of discussion,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> which concludes, immediately before the discussion of the asserted deficiency, with the words: \"[i]n light of the above discussion, we <em>hold </em>that the 'no duty to warn of open and obvious dangers\u2019 rule remains viable in Michigan.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Manifestly, the opinion of the Court is saying that SJI2d 19.03 is deficient in failing to state that there is \"no duty to, warn of open and obvious dangers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">No doubt the standard civil jury instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>committee will revise the instruction in accordance with the opinion of the Court. It is to be hoped that it will understand that it should avoid the use of the word \"duty\u201d \u2014 there is no duty issue, rather only a standard of care issue.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Further, if a no duty to warn of known and obvious danger instruction should be given, it should be a balanced instruction, one that states not only that there is no obligation to warn of open or obvious dangers, but also the further qualification, set forth in the Restatement, \"unless the possessor should anticipate the harm despite such knowledge or obviousness.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ads\">The Restatement formulation appears to be well supported in the cases. Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 61, p 427, reports that while \"in the usual case, there is no obligation to protect the invitee against dangers which are known to him, or which are so obvious and apparent that he may reasonably be expected to discover them,\u201d \"something more in the way of precautions may be required\u201d notwithstanding the invitee\u2019s \"knowledge, warning, or the obvious nature of the condition.\u201d Among the particularized instances where \"something more\u201d may be required, are situations where there is reason to expect that \"after a lapse of time [the invitee] may forget the existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>the condition, even though he has discovered it or been warned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The origin of the \"no-duty\u201d rule is unclear. It may be a vestige of common-law contributory negligence theory and obsolete status definitions. When contributory negligence was an absolute bar to recovery by a negligent plaintiff, courts expressed in terms of the so-called no-duty rule the conclusion that, in certain situations, the plaintiff was contributorily negligent.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">An invitor owes an invitee a duty to exercise reasonable care to make the premises safe for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>entry and use.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Where the danger is open or obvious, reasonable care on the part of the invitor</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-4\">does not ordinarily require precautions, or even warning, against dangers which are known to the visitor, or so obvious to him that he may be expected to discover them. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">There are, however, cases in which the possessor of land can and should anticipate that the dangerous condition will cause physical harm to the invitee notwithstanding its known or obvious danger. In such cases the possessor is not relieved of the duty of reasonable care which he owes to the invitee for his protection. <em>This duty may require him to warn the invitee, or to take other reasonable steps </em>to protect him, against the known or obvious condition or activity, if the possessor has reason to expect that the invitee will nevertheless suffer physical harm. [2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 343A, comments e and f. Emphasis added.]<footnotemark>[27]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Because an invitor undeniably owes an invitee a duty to keep premises reasonably safe, the \"no <em>duty </em>to warn\u201d rule cannot be unconditionally true. An invitor would surely be subject to liability to an invitee for harm resulting from an egregiously dangerous condition even though the invitor made a concerted effort to publicize the risk. The invitor would not necessarily be absolved of liability simply because he had provided a warning. The \"no duty to warn rule,\u201d in the context of invitorinvitees assumes that the obvious danger continues to be extant after the invitor has taken reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>able steps to make the premises safe. In such a case, the obvious danger would not generally pose an \"unreasonable\u201d risk to invitees, and the invitor would not be subject to liability unless there were other reasons to expect that invitees would still be harmed.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Whether an invitor is negligent because he fails to warn an invitee of an open and obvious danger is a question of the standard of care required in a given set of circumstances, rather than a question of duty. The confusion concerning this aspect of the matter stems from the tendency to analyze virtually every aspect of negligence in terms of \"duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\"Duty\u201d refers, strictly speaking, to a legally recognized obligation to observe or conform to some particular standard of conduct toward another.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Courts developed the concept of \"duty\u201d as comprehending a specific relationship between a plaintiff and defendant, absent which no liability to observe any standard of conduct arises.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Courts have also spoken in terms of \"duty,\u201d however, to address questions relating to \"standard of care\u201d (the particular conduct required to discharge a legally recognized obligation), and even questions relating to \"proximate cause.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\"Duty\u201d thus is used equivocally in judicial opinions. If \"duty\u201d is understood to refer, as in the traditional sense, to the relationship necessary to give rise to an obligation to observe some standard of care, then it follows analytically that the adoption of comparative negligence could not supersede the need to determine, as a matter of law, that a particular defendant did or did not owe a particular plaintiff a \"duty,\u201d because the application of principles of \"comparative negligence\u201d assumes the breach of a duty. Plaintiff\u2019s comparative negligence could not relieve the defendant of his duty because plaintiff\u2019s comparative negligence merely shifts to the plaintiff the burden of sharing with the defendant the loss or damages resulting both from defendant\u2019s breach of duty in violation of the standard of care and plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Thus, where it is said that \"no duty\u201d is owed by a particular defendant, in the sense that negligence or fault of the plaintiff contributed to the harm in a particular instance, or that a danger is open and obvious because of the plaintiff\u2019s subjective knowledge of the danger, comparative negligence would indeed abrogate the \"no duty\u201d rule because a plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence does not bar recovery and a decision to encounter a dangerous condition despite subjective knowledge of the peril is relevant in deciding the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence. Application of comparative negligence principles would then call for the jury to apportion fault between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">It is evident that standard of care, not duty, lies at the heart of the present dispute.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The no-duty rule does not exhaust the obligations of invitor to an invitee.

See <em>ante, </em>p 97, n 11, and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\"> See <em>Quinlivan, </em>n 26 <em>supra, </em>p 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Although 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 343A(1), n 25 <em>supra, </em>expresses the principle that the open and obvious character of a danger does not absolutely immunize a premises owner from liability for harm caused by the danger, and is consonant with the verdict in the instant case, the same result would be reached under \u00a7 343, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">A possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm caused to his invitees by a condition on the land if, but only if, he (a) knows or by the exercise of reasonable care would discover the condition, and should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to such invitees, and (b) should expect that they will not discover or realize the danger, or will fail to protect themselves against it, and (c) fails to exercise reasonable care to protect them against the danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">See, e.g., <em>Spear v Wineman, </em>335 Mich 287; 55 NW2d 833 (1952) (under 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 343, it is for the jury to decide the question of contributory negligence where a plaintiff-customer is injured when hit by a wind-blown door of the store where she was shopping).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">In the instant case, there was evidence that workers commonly used the coil field as a shortcut to reach plant offices, and that a warning would likely have been ignored. A jury might conclude that McLouth was subject to liability despite the \"obviousness\u201d of the danger in the coil field, on the ground that it should have expected that the workers would not realize the danger or would fail to protect themselves against it, \u00a7 343(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">In addressing the obligations of an invitor to invitees regarding accumulations of ice and snow the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-13\">[W]e reject the prominently cited notion that ice and snow hazards are obvious to all and therefore may not give rise to liability. While the invitor is not an absolute insurer of the safety of the invitee, the <em>invitor has a duty to exercise reasonable care to diminish the hazards of ice and snow accumulation. [Quinlivan, </em>n 26 <em>supra, </em>p 261. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b223-10\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 91.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b223-11\"> <em>Id., </em>p 92.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b223-12\"> <em>Id., </em>p 97.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"Ak5I\"> <em>Id., </em>pp 99-100.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b223-13\"> The passages quoted by the majority imply that an owner\u2019s duty to warn extends <em>only </em>to hidden dangers. The majority quotes from <em>Samuelson v Cleveland Iron Mining Co, </em>49 Mich 164, 170; 13 NW 499 (1882):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-14\">\"Every man who expressly or by implication invites others to come upon his premises, <em>assumes to all who accept the invitation the duty to warn them of any danger </em>in coming, which he knows of or ought to know of, and <em>of which they are not aware.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added. <em>Ante, </em>p 91.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>The majority also quotes from <em>Caniff v Blanchard Navigation Co, </em>66 Mich 638, 647; 33 NW 744 (1887):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">\"The <em>occupier of premises, no doubt, is bound, </em>as to persons thereon by his express or implied invitation, <em>to keep the premises free from, or give a warning of, danger known to him and unknown to the visitor. But this rule has no application to a case where a person who from his experience . . . knows that it is customary to leave the hatchways of vessels open while lying in port . . . and are sources of danger which he must avoid at his peril.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added. <em>Ante, </em>pp 91-92.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">In both <em>Samuelson </em>and <em>Caniff </em>the premises owners were absolved of liability because of the open and obvious character of the dangers involved. These nineteenth century cases do not adequately address the interplay between the duty imposed on the premises owners and the status of plaintiffs. The results in these cases might be different if considered today. At the time these cases were written, employees were classed as \"licensees.\u201d Subsequently, employees were accorded the status of \"invitees\u201d and were owed a higher degree of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">In <em>Caniff, </em>the Court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claim that he was present on the ship as a \"licensee,\u201d because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">[t]he ship-keeper was not authorized to invite him on board, and he did not represent the owner in calling to him to come forward .... The ship-keeper was not acting in the line of his duty, but in violation of his positive orders. <em>[Id., </em>p 645.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">The Court thus intimated that plaintiff was a trespasser. Further, the passage quoted by the majority occurred in the context of the'Court\u2019s remark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">Whether he was rightfully on or not, his own negligence contributed to the injury. . . . With all this knowledge and experience on the part of the plaintiff, he walks carelessly forward in the dark .... This, under the circumstances, was inexcusable negligence on his part, and a disregard of all that his knowledge and experience had or should have taught him. <em>[Id., </em>p 646.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">The Court was clearly applying traditional principles of <em>contributory negligence </em>to bar any recovery by the plaintiff. <em>Caniff </em>thus illustrates the use of \"duty\u201d/\"no duty\u201d as a proxy for facts strong enough either to bar recovery as a matter of law under traditional contributory negligence doctrine, or that the absence of a warning would not have been a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries (because he probably would have ignored a warning anyway).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">The majority also relies on <em>Nezworski v Mazanec, </em>n 26 <em>supra, </em>p 61, for the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-15\">\"If there were hidden dangers in connection with the door<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>way, platform, stairway, and alley, it was [the premises owner\u2019s] duty to give warning thereof.\u201d <em>[Ante, </em>p 92.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-9\"><em>Nezworski </em>concerned a plaintiff who suffered injuries from a fall down the stairway leading to the basement of a restaurant. This Court affirmed a verdict in favor of plaintiff. The remark quoted by the majority was made in the course of rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim that he was not chargeable with knowledge of the condition of the premises, and therefore owed no obligation to warn of dangerous conditions. The defendant <em>did not claim </em>that he owed the plaintiff \"no duty to warn\u201d because the danger was obvious to the plaintiff. \u2022</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b225-10\"> Riddle did not claim that McLouth had an <em>absolute </em>obligation to warn him of the dangerous condition of the floor of the coil field.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
