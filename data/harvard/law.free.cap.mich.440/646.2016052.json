Plummer, Jr., a pipe fitter employed by Babcock &amp; Wilcox, a subcontractor, commenced this action against Bechtel Construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>tion Company, which acted as general contractor for the construction of The Detroit Edison Company\u2019s Belle River Power Plant, and Edison to recover damages for injuries Plummer sustained on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">A jury awarded damages of $1,100,000, against Bechtel and Edison, which was reduced to $825,000 because the jury apportioned twenty-five percent fault to Plummer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reversed, stating that Edison did not retain control of the work, that Bechtel took \"reasonable steps within its supervisory and coordinating authority to guard against 'readily observable, avoidable dangers\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Funk v General Motors Corp, </em>392 Mich 91, 104; 220 NW2d 641 (1974), and that \"it was unobservable or unforeseeable that plaintiff would get drunk and then leave the guardrailed catwalk to work on an unprotected scaffold without requesting safety assistance or tying off as he had been instructed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals concluded that neither Edison nor Bechtel \"owed a duty to plaintiff.'\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">We conclude that there was ample evidence that Edison retained control of the work and, together with Bechtel, owed Plummer the duty of taking reasonable steps to guard against dangers that were readily observable and avoidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The Court of Appeals, in concluding that Edison and Bechtel did not owe a <em>duty </em>to Plummer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>confused the questions of <em>duty </em>and <em>standard of care. </em>\"It obscures the separate issues in a negligence case (duty, proximate cause and general and specific standard of care) to combine and state them together in terms of whether there is a duty to refrain from particular conduct,\u201d <em>Moning v Alfono, </em>400 Mich 425, 432-433; 254 NW2d 759 (1977), or, in the instant case, whether Edison and Bechtel were obliged to take particular steps to guard against readily observable, avoidable dangers in common work areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">It is a factual issue, for resolution by the jury as trier of fact, whether it was readily observable that the guardrails had been removed from the unprotected scaffold or platform from which Plummer fell, and, similarly, whether there was, as Edison and Bechtel contended and Plummer disputed, a place where Plummer could have \"tied off \u201d by attaching a line from his safety belt. It is a question of the standard of care, and not duty, whether, if the jury found there was not a place where Plummer could have tied off, Edison and Bechtel should have foreseen the danger of a worker leaving the guardrailed catwalk for the unprotected platform and should therefore have caused a wire or other means of tying off to be installed when the guardrails were removed; that, too, on this record, presented an issue for submission to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">It was also for the jury to decide (i) whether Plummer had been instructed not to leave the guardrailed catwalk to work on an unprotected platform without requesting safety assistance for tying off, and, (ii) if so, whether he was one hundred percent at fault or, as the jury found, twenty-five percent at fault, in leaving the guardrailed catwalk to attempt, from the unprotected platform, to free the pipe although he had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>able to tie off and had not requested safety assistance for tying off. It was further for the jury to decide (iii) the degree of fault attributable to Plummer\u2019s inebriation, and (iv) whether Edison\u2019s and Bechtel\u2019s failure to take steps the jury found should have been taken to guard against the danger of a worker falling from the unguarded platform was a cause, or whether Plummer\u2019s inebriation was a cause or the sole cause, of the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Plummer fell from \u00e1 work platform at the Belle River construction site, suffering multiple skull fractures.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the time of the accident, he was a journeyman pipe fitter and certified welder.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The Belle River construction project involved approximately 2500 workers and a number of subcontractors. Plummer was employed on the construction project by one of the subcontractors, Babcock &amp; Wilcox.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Bechtel acted as the general contractor and one of the working contractors. It had general responsibility for managing the subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Edison owned the project. It retained the authority to hire or terminate subcontractors, or to order Bechtel to hire or terminate any subcontractor. Indeed, Edison, rather than Bechtel, hired Babcock &amp; Wilcox.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">An Edison \"site safety and insurance coordinator,\u201d Gary Western, was at the construction site daily. It was Western\u2019s responsibility to \"[o]bserve and report the basic safety operation through out the project\u201d and to assure that the safety provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>sions of the project contract were performed. Western frequently walked through the project, inspecting for safety compliance. He spoke about safety with employees of subcontractors, including Babcock &amp; Wilcox employees. Western was empowered to require that safeguards be implemented and that unsafe practices be stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Bechtel employed four persons who were at the construction site almost daily to observe and monitor subcontractor safety performance and compliance. They also had the power to require subcontractors to correct an unsafe condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The Belle River project was over two hundred feet in height.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Workers employed by a number of subcontractors were at the site at any given time. To facilitate access to the various parts of the project, a system of catwalks had been installed at different levels. Each level of the catwalk system was connected so that workers could reach the various elevations of the construction project while still remaining inside the catwalk system.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The record is unclear concerning who installed the catwalk system. It is clear, however, that workers employed by different subcontractors regularly used the system to walk to and perform their work at various levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The catwalks were constructed of caged wire. The ceiling and floor were completely enclosed with caged wire. One or both sides of the catwalk were enclosed with caged wire or guardrails. At the site of the accident, there was caged wire on one side, and, so that workers could reach and have access to the work to be done, handrails on the other side.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">In an apparent effort to provide additional access to the work under construction, platforms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>perpendicular to the catwalk had been constructed at the level where Plummer was working at the time of the accident. When originally installed, there were guardrails on both sides of the platforms.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">For at least two weeks before the accident, however, the guardrails had been removed from the platform from which Plummer fell. It does not appear who removed the guardrails. There was testimony that the guardrails had been removed because they would have made it impossible to move into place awkwardly shaped pipes that were then being installed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The guardrails that had been removed from the platform from which Plummer fell were piled in a large stack on th\u00e9 ground for the two-week period before the accident. The Edison safety supervisor, Gary Western, acknowledged that he had observed the unguarded platforms before the accident. While Western could not recall observing workers on the unguarded platforms before the accident, he acknowledged that he was aware of the platforms. Bechtel\u2019s project safety supervisor, Gary Suenkel, acknowledged that he had been in the area of the accident before Plummer fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Before reporting to work on the day of the accident, Plummer shared a pint bottle of liquor with a co-worker on the way to work. Plummer testified that he had nothing to drink after he arrived at the job site, and neither Edison nor Bechtel assert otherwise. Plummer arrived at 8:00 a.m. and the accident occurred at 10:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Upon arrival, Plummer was assigned by Babcock &amp; Wilcox to a three-man pipe fitting crew.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The pipe fitting crew was sent through the catwalk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>system to an elevation forty feet above ground level to connect a 25-foot-long, 90-degree-bent pipe. The pipe weighed more than two tons and was hard to maneuver. A crane had moved the pipe up the side of the catwalk structure where Plummer\u2019s crew was working.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">As the crew attempted to move the pipe into position, a chain that was holding the pipe onto the crane became caught on a platform, and the pipe became stuck. Although no one specifically ordered Plummer and the two co-workers to leave the guarded catwalk system, Plummer and one of the two co-workers left the protection of the guarded catwalk system and walked onto the unguarded platform to free the pipe.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Plummer testified that although caged wire precluded access to the other platforms, in this case, he and his co-worker were able to move from the catwalk to the platform because there was no caged wiring \u2014 only a guardrail \u2014 where the platform met the catwalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">While Plummer stood on the south side of the platform and his co-worker stood on the north, they attempted to free the pipe and chain. The coworker was using a two-by-four board,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Plummer was pulling on the chain. The chain released suddenly, and Plummer was pitched backward off the platform; Plummer fell about twenty feet, struck a steel girder, and fell another ten feet or so onto the top of a temporary work shed that was used by employees of a number of subcontractors to store their equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Plummer was wearing a safety belt and a standard three- or four-foot-long lanyard, but he had not tied himself by his safety rope because, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>said, he could not find a place to do so. Considerable evidence was adduced at trial on the disputed factual question whether there was a place that Plummer could have tied off. Plummer presented evidence that, given the awkward shape of the pipe and the position he was working in, it was not possible to tie off safely.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Detroit Edison and Bechtel presented evidence that there were places where Plummer could have tied off.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Edison and Bechtel offered expert testimony that on the basis of Plummer\u2019s blood sample, tested at the hospital where he was treated, he must have had a blood-alcohol level higher than 0.193 at the time of the accident. Edison and Bechtel presented further expert testimony that such a blood-alcohol level would have seriously impaired Plummer\u2019s work performance in the workplace and that such a high level probably resulted from more than the four ounces of alcohol that Plummer acknowledged consuming.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The Court of Appeals focused on Plummer\u2019s consumption of alcoholic beverages before reporting to work, and concluded that Bechtel and Detroit Edison did not owe a <em>duty </em>to Plummer because they could not have foreseen that Plummer <em>\u201dwould get drunk </em>and then leave the guardrailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>catwalk to work on an unprotected scaffold without requesting safety assistance or tying off as he had been instructed.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The duty question does not depend on, nor is it affected by, Plummer\u2019s behavior or fault. Plummer\u2019s fault pertains to the question of causation and does not bear on the questions whether Detroit Edison retained control of the work, whether the accident occurred at a common work area, whether Bechtel had supervising and coordinating authority to guard against dangers in common work areas, whether the danger of the unguarded platform was readily observable, whether it could be foreseen that a worker might leave the safety of the guardrailed catwalk for the unguarded platform in order to do the work, whether Plummer and his co-workers had been warned not to leave the guardrailed-catwalk system for an unguarded platform without requesting safety assistance to tie off, and whether, if there was no place to tie off, the accident could have been avoided by providing a place to tie off.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">While the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury properly posed this question,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals confused the issue. The Court confused the foresee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>ability of a worker falling off the unguarded platform with the foreseeability of a worker coming to work in a drunken state. The Court concluded that because Bechtel could not have foreseen the latter, it also had no duty with respect to the former. This analysis was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">The intoxication of Plummer pertains to causation. The trial judge correctly instructed the jury on this point as well.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals, however, confused the issue of Plummer\u2019s intoxication with Bechtel\u2019s duty of safety in common work areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In addition to substituting its judgment with respect to causation, the Court of Appeals substituted its judgment with respect to the element of breach. The Court concluded that because Bechtel required its subcontractors to conduct weekly safety meetings, it did not breach any duty it may have owed Plummer. This was, however, a question for the jury to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The Court of Appeals found as fact that Plummer had been instructed to request safety assistance and that he violated instructions when he left the guardrailed catwalk to work on the unprotected scaffold or platform. The evidence is far less specific. The workers were provided with safety belts, called lanyards, and were instructed to tie off. There is no evidence that they were told that they should request safety assistance for tying off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>when working in an area where they could not find a place to tie off.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Noteworthy in this connection is that one of Plummer\u2019s co-workers also left the safety of the protected catwalk for the unprotected platform. There is no evidence that he tied off or that he had had anything to drink before coming to work or on the job. Nor did Plummer give any sign of being intoxicated or unable to work during the two hours between the time he reported for work and the time the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Turning to the duty question with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Edison, this Court in <em>Funk </em>observed that \"[ordinarily a landowner is not responsible for injuries caused by a carefully selected contractor to whom he has delegated the task of erecting a structure,\u201d but that \"[a]n owner is responsible if he does not truly delegate \u2014 if he retains 'control\u2019 of the work . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">As in <em>Funk, </em>the owner here, Edison, \"exercised an unusually high degree of control over the construction project from its very inception.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> There were approximately one hundred twenty-five Edison employees at the site, including in excess of twenty inspectors for every type of discipline there might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Gary Western, Edison\u2019s site safety and insurance coordinator, had the responsibility of assuring that safety programs were implemented and that the provisions of the contract as they related to safety were being carried out. If Western became aware of a miosha violation, he was empowered to warn a subcontractor directly or to ask Bechtel to require that appropriate safety precautions be taken. Edison had contracted directly with Babcock &amp; Wilcox, but, even if it had not, it had the authority to require Bechtel to terminate any subcontractor. There was thus ample evidence that Edison had retained control of the project, and the jury could properly hold Edison subject to liability for a failure to observe reasonable safety precautions and provide reasonable safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">The mere presence of one hundred twenty-five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Edison employees at the site does not, indeed, necessarily mean that Edison retained control of the work. As set forth in comment (c) to \u00a7 414 of volume 2, the Second Restatement of Torts,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> an owner or general contractor who \"has merely a general right to order the work stopped or re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>sumed, to inspect its progress or to receive reports, to make suggestions or recommendations which need not necessarily be followed\u201d would not be deemed to have retained control. Edison would not have retained a right of control by merely overseeing the project and monitoring general progress to ensure compliance with contract specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Edison retained the authority to order Bechtel to hire or terminate any subcontractor. Indeed, Edison, not Bechtel, hired Babcock &amp; Wilcox. An Edison site safety and insurance coordinator, Gary Western, was on the construction site daily. It was Western\u2019s responsibility to observe and report concerning the basic safety operation throughout the project and to assure that the safety provisions of the project contract were performed. Western frequently walked through the project, inspecting for safety compliance. He spoke about safety <em>directly with employees of subcontractors, including Babcock &amp; Wilcox employees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The jury was not obliged to conclude that \"suggestions\u2019 7\"recommendations\u2019\u2019 from Western concerning safety, in the words of the Restatement commentary, \"need not necessarily be followed.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The jury could properly conclude that because of Edison\u2019s retained power to hire or terminate subcontractors, Western\u2019s assessments or decisions concerning safety were \"necessarily\u201d to be followed by subcontractors. Because of the retained authority to hire or terminate, there was, again in the words of the Restatement commentary? \"such a retention of a right of supervision that the contractor is <em>not entirely free </em>to do the work in his own way.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The line drawn in the Restatement commentary seeks to differentiate between a situation where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>the subcontractor \"need not\u201d follow the suggestions or recommendations of the owner/general contractor, as the case may be, or persons monitoring the work for the owner/general contractor, and a situation where the right of supervision retained by the owner/general contractor is such that the subcontractor is not \"entirely free\u201d to ignore suggestions and recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The distinction is illustrated by <em>Duplantis v Shell Offshore, Inc, </em>948 F2d 187, 193 (CA 5, 1991), where the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that although the owner, Shell Offshore, Inc., took \"an <em>active interest </em>in the safety of the employees of its independent contractor,\u201d that did \"not, in and of itself, constitute direct operational control.\u201d The Shell representative held safety meetings with the general contractor and subcontractor. He did not, however, have the authority to remove or otherwise give orders to general contractor/subcontractor personnel. \"Rather, he had to go through [the chief general contractor/subcontractor employee on the rig] in the form of suggestions or advice.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>The record in the instant case tends to show, and the jury could find, that Edispn, through Western, had the ultimate control of the level of safety on the job.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">It has been suggested<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> that the imposition of liability on Edison might discourage owners from creating a safe working environment. When the Belle River Power Plant was under construction, Edison\u2019s immediate concern was timely completion of the plant within the contemplated cost of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>struction. The immediate safety concern was not lawsuits, but compliance with osha and miosha standards and satisfying insurance carriers that the requisite steps had been taken to reduce their exposure in what was clearly a dangerous construction project.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">While Edison might be concerned about a decision of this Court concerning the extent of its liability to employees of subcontractors, such as Plummer, Edison apparently was of the view that it must retain a large measure of control in order to discharge its responsibility to its stockholders, securities underwriters, the regulatory authorities, customers, and the public generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">In <em>Everette v Alyeska Pipeline Service Co, </em>614 P2d 1341, 1347 (Alas, 1980), the Alaska Supreme Court, in reversing a summary disposition in favor of the owner, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-8\">On the other hand, if the employer retains the right to direct the manner of the independent contractor\u2019s performance of its work or to superintend the work in any meaningful way, the employer has retained sufficient control to be held liable. . . . Whether the employer has retained such control is a question of fact which ordinarily should be left to the jury or, in a bench trial, to the judge. ... In making this determination [whether summary disposition is appropriate], we are'required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, Everette [the plaintiff and injured worker], drawing all inferences in his favor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">It appears that Alaska recognizes that an employer of an independent contractor can be found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>liable although the employer retains less than the kind of direct control that agency law would require, and that an employer who affirmatively assumes safety duties can also be found liable under a \"retained control\u201d theory, even if this was undertaken gratuitously.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqOQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">In <em>Funk, </em>this Court held that a general contractor has the duty \"to assure that reasonable steps within its supervisory and coordinating authority are taken to guard against readily observable, avoidable dangers in common work areas which create a high degree of risk to a significant number of workmen.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Edison and Bechtel contend that the unguarded platform was not a common work area. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence to justify the jury\u2019s decision that it was.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Edison and Bechtel contend that the platform did not become a common work area because there was no evidence that an employee of a subcontractor other than Babcock &amp; Wilcox had ever stepped onto the platform. The worker\u2019s burden does not, however, require proof that a particular girder or platform was used by employees of another subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">When the platforms were erected, guardrails were installed. This indicates that they were erected for use by human beings \u2014 otherwise there would have been no guardrails. The record does not indicate who caused the platforms to be installed. Nor does it appear what work was to be performed from the platforms. The platforms did not facilitate the installation of the pipes that Plummer\u2019s crew was installing. Indeed, the platforms were an impediment to the installation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the pipes. That is why they had been removed from the platform from which Plummer fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">The platforms did not exist in isolation. A worker could not gain access to a platform unless he used the catwalk system. Plummer was on the platform not only because he was a Babcock &amp; Wilcox employee but also because the catwalk\u2014 clearly a common work area \u2014 provided access to this work area.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The common work area formulation was an effort to distinguish between a situation where employees of a subcontractor were working in isolation from employees of other subcontractors and a situation where employees of a number of subcontractors were working in the same work area.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The record tends to show that employees of Babcock &amp; Wilcox were working in proximity to employees of other subcontractors. At the time of the accident, four workers were positioned in the catwalk structure at an elevation just below the elevation from which Plummer\u2019s fall began. At least one of these other workers was a carpenter\u2019s helper, and thus not a Babcock &amp; Wilcox pipe fitting employee. In addition, a Bechtel iron worker was working in the same catwalk structure at an elevation just above the point from which Plummer\u2019s fall began. Employees of different subcontractors were clearly working in the catwalk system.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The common work area formulation did not contemplate a quilt work of common and non-common work areas \u2014 this fifty or hundred square feet suspended in the air being a common work area and an adjoining fifty or one hundred square feet not being a common work area.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The Edison and Bechtel inspectors did not view their responsibility as being dependent on whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>employees of two or more subcontractors had trod the same girder or this platform. It would not have occurred to Western or Suenkel that this was not an area of their responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The common work area formulation sought to distinguish between a case where it was appropriate to impose overall safety responsibility on the general contractor and one where it would not be appropriate. It does not depend on a matter of five, ten or fifteen feet, or who erected this platform, or whether an employee of another subcontractor was on this platform before Plummer. Indeed, workers were probably on the platform when it was first erected, with guardrails.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">We conclude that there was sufficient evidence to justify the jury\u2019s verdict that the catwalk/platform system from which Plummer fell constituted a common work area.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">We also conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict that the unguarded platform was readily observable, and that the risk of falling, attendant to the absence of guardrails, was avoidable. The correct inquiry is not whether the accident was anticipated, but whether such an accident <em>should </em>have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">The guardrails had been removed for a period of at least two weeks and were readily observable in a pile on the ground of the construction project. Gary Western, the Detroit Edison safety coordinator, acknowledged that he had observed the unguarded platform before the accident.

If the employer of an independent contractor retains control over the operative detail of doing any part of the work, he is subject to liability for the negligence of the employees of the contractor engaged therein, under the rules of that part of the law of Agency which deals with the relation of master and servant. The employer may, however, retain a control less than that which is necessary to subject him to liability as master. He may retain only the power to direct the order in which the work shall be done, or to forbid its being done in a manner likely to be dangerous to himself or others. Such a supervisory control may not subject him to liability under the principles of Agency, but he may be liable under the rule stated in this Section unless he exercises his supervisory control with reasonable care so as to prevent the work which he has ordered to be done from causing injury to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">b. The rule stated in this Section is usually, though not exclusively, applicable when a principal contractor entrusts a part of the work to subcontractors, but himself or through a foreman superintends the entire job. In such a situation, the principal contractor is subject to liability if he fails to prevent the subcontractors from doing even the details of the work in a way unreasonably dangerous to others, if he knows or by the exercise of reasonable care should know that the subcontractors\u2019 work is being so done, and has the opportunity to prevent it by exercising the power of control which he has retained in himself. So too, he is subject to liability if he knows or should know that the subcontractors have carelessly done their work in such a way as to create a dangerous condition, and fails to exercise reasonable care either to remedy it himself or by the exercise of his control cause the subcontractor to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">c. In order for the rule stated in this Section to apply, the employer must have retained at least some degree of control over the manner in which the work is done. It is not enough that he has merely a general right to order the work stopped or resumed, to inspect its progress or to receive reports, to make suggestions or recommendations which need not necessarily be followed, or to prescribe alterations and deviations. Such a general right is usually reserved to employers, but it does not mean that the contractor is controlled as to his methods of work, or as to operative detail. There must be such a retention of a right of supervision that the contractor is not entirely free to do the work in his own way. <em>[Id., </em>pp 387-388.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b761-7\"> 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 414, comment (c), p 387.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b761-8\"> <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b762-6\"> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Similarly, see <em>Lewis v Riebe Enterprises, Inc, </em>170 Ariz 384, 390; 825 P2d 5 (1992), cited in the concurring opinion.

I write separately simply to reaffirm that the policy on which the duty recognized in <em>Funk v General Motors </em>Corp, 392 Mich 91; 220 NW2d 641 (1974), is premised is the implementation of reasonable safeguards against high degrees of injury in common work areas at construction sites. <em>Id. </em>at 104. Where control is effectively retained, a relational obligation is created and a duty is recognized.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>existence of duty is a question of law, fact issues may be involved in application of the rule. Where varying inferences of fact are possible, the duty imposed will depend on the facts found. <em>Elbert v </em>Saginaw, 363 Mich 463, 469; 109 NW2d 879 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\"><em>Funk </em>provided that an owner who \"acts in a superintending capacity and has knowledge of high degrees of risk faced by construction workers [is not absolved] from responsibility for failing to require observance of reasonable safety precautions\u201d and may be held liable for its negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 106-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Detroit Edison has sought to buttress the Court of Appeals ruling by emphasizing that the evidence regarding its role in the project was \"primarily contractual control, safety inspections, and general oversight.\u201d It has argued in this Court that there was no evidence demonstrating its involvement in the actual construction work. To be sure, not all courts agree that retention of control that is contractual alone or that pertains to safety aspects, rather than actual construction, warrants the imposition of a duty on an owner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Detroit Edison\u2019s argument would limit the retained-control exception to instances where an owner actually exercised contractually retained control and that control pertained to the manner of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>struction, but not to control of details of construction relating to the safety aspects of the job.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The scope of duty recognized by this Court in <em>Funk </em>is limited; the limits are provided by the extent of control retained. Both contractual provisions between the owner, general contractor, and various subcontractors, and the actual control exercised are relevant considerations in determining whether an owner (or general contractor) retained control.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Justice Griffin suggests that the imposition of a duty where control is retained only with respect to the safety aspects of the job presents the possibility that owners will forgo emphasis on worker safety. <em>Post, </em>pp 677-678. I cannot agree that the majority\u2019s result will cause responsible owners to disavow an interest in the safety of workers. Humane, economic, and public relations considerations all counsel against such a course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Thus, an exception to the retention-of-control theory should not be made where the extent of control retained is limited to safety precautions to be provided on the construction site. The Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Lewis v Riebe Enterprises, Inc, </em>170 Ariz 384; 825 P2d 5 (1992), considering the liability of a general contractor is instructive here. The <em>Lewis </em>court noted that interpreting \u00a7 414 in that manner \"negates any contractual safety responsibility assumed\u201d by the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 392. Emphasizing that the division of authority in the area of safety may cause accidents by leaving uncertainty regarding whose responsibility various tasks are, the court concluded that, where a defendant contractually assumes the responsibility for safety at a work site, it is liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>for any injury resulting from its negligent exercise of that responsibility as long as the general contractor (or owner) \" '[knew] or by the exercise of reasonable care should [have known] that the subcontractors\u2019 work [was being done in a dangerous manner], and ha[d] the opportunity to prevent it by exercising the power of control which he . . . retained in himself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392 quoting 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 414, comment (b), p 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The question whether Detroit Edison was negligent is dependent on the degree of control in fact retained by Detroit Edison. The scope of Detroit Edison\u2019s duty is limited by the extent to which it retained control. See <em>Lewis v Riebe Enterprises, Inc, supra, </em>pp 388-389. Thus, if it retained control solely to inspect the job site to determine that it received the benefit of the work for which it contracted, then its duty would be similarly limited.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this case, conflicting inferences regarding the extent of retained control were possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The evidence regarding Edison\u2019s role at the site was sufficient for a jury to conclude that it retained control of the safety aspects of the job and that its negligence regarding those aspects was a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Plaintiff presented evidence tending to show that Detroit Edison had extensive experience in constructing power plants, that it had 100 to 125 employees on the site, that it provided a safety coordinator who was at the site on a daily basis, and that the safety coordinator\u2019s job was to assure that each employer had an adequate safety program. Testimony was presented tending to show that Detroit Edison sought to centralize the flow of information necessary to ensure safety at the site. Further testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>mony was offered tending to prove that Detroit Edison required subcontractors to carry out safety programs, that it was involved in establishing the content of weekly safety meetings held by subcontractors, and that it was entitled to fire, or require Bechtel to fire, any subcontractor not taking appropriate precautions.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">Thus, the trial court correctly submitted the issue to the jury. <em>Bonin v Gralewicz, </em>378 Mich 521, 526-527; 146 NW2d 647 (1966). The factfinder could conclude from this evidence that Detroit Edison retained control of the safety program. If the jury drew this conclusion, then the court was obligated to rule that Detroit Edison had a duty to ensure that it carried out this responsibility without negligence. Whether Detroit Edison properly performed its duties in that regard and whether any failure proximately caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries were also jury questions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b773-5\">Mallett, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-10\"> Although I agree that retention of control regarding safety may give rise to a duty, I do not adopt Justice Levin\u2019s explanation regarding the relationship between the duty and standard of care issues.

It seeks also to encourage implementation of reasonable safeguards against risks of injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">Placing ultimate responsibility on the general contractor for job safety in common work areas will, from a practical, economic standpoint, render it more likely that the various subcontractors being supervised by the general contractor will implement or that the general contractor will himself implement the necessary precautions and provide the necessary safety equipment in those areas. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">According to the <em>Funk </em>Court, its decision was set against the factual backdrop of an immediate employer who \"conspicuously failed to provide any safety equipment,\u201d a general contractor who was \"fully knowledgeable of the employer\u2019s dereliction,\u201d and an owner who \"exercised an unusually high degree of control over the construction project from its very inception.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 102, 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Now, in the present case, the majority of this Court has gone a long step further \u2014 and in my mind, a step too far \u2014 imposing liability in a situation where the owner and general contractor have taken the reasonable measures called for in <em>Funk </em>to insure the safety of construction workers on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">The defendant owner, Detroit Edison, created a centralized system of safety information for the project. It established the Depot Safety Organiza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>tion, which administered the dissemination of safety information and established a general first-aid facility. Each of the contractors on the job site was contractually required to operate safety programs for its employees. Those requirements were described by Edison\u2019s safety supervisor as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">Each employer was required to have a program that would incorporate as a basic minimum, the requirements of all miosha construction standards as well as any additional things that might be deemed generic to the site itself. Among that \u2014 in addition to that, each employer was required to conduct weekly safety meetings with every employee and that they were required to designate a competent employee of management that would act as their safety representative in any meetings requiring that knowledge be put forth to all the contractors in general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">Information was disseminated to the safety representatives and then further passed on down to the employees, any information that would come up as far as potential problems that might be coming up on the site, if a large load was going to be lifted or this or that, something that might require specific attention of individual employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-7\">Each employer was required to investigate accidents, to submit their injury reports to the first aid. There was one general first aid facility so that all contractors, all employers didn\u2019t have to supply their own. We wanted to try and centralize everything as much as we could with respect to the flow of information back from the contractors to make sure that they were in fact putting out the information and giving their employees what can be termed a reasonable [sic] safe place to work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Edison coordinated the safety programs of the individual contractors and observed the basic safety operation throughout the project. The general contractor, Bechtel, implemented a Bechtel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>safety program for Bechtel employees and monitored the safety programs of other contractors. Contractors such as plaintiff\u2019s employer, Babcock &amp; Wilcox, were contractually required to provide Bechtel with a copy of their safety programs, to conduct weekly safety meetings, and to provide minutes or reports of those meetings. Babcock &amp; Wilcox did in fact conduct weekly safety meetings over the six months during which plaintiff had been on the project. Plaintiff attended every one of those weekly safety meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">The imposition of liability on either Edison or Bechtel defeats the ostensible goals underlying the <em>Funk </em>decision \u2014 the call for owners and contractors to provide \"relatively safe working conditions\u201d by implementing \"reasonable safety measures.\u201d <em>Funk, supra, </em>pp 102-103. Both defendants in this case did exactly that \u2014 they provided a safe work environment by creating safety programs and insuring that all workers on the project were educated and informed about safety concerns. Although the present plaintiff, highly intoxicated at the time, was involved in a serious accident, there is no evidence in this record of continual or obvious safety derelictions such as those to which the Court pointed in <em>Funk. </em>Nonetheless, despite assurances by the <em>Funk </em>Court that its ruling did not portend the imposition of liability \" 'upon every property owner who enters into a construction contract,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>p 108, it appears now that owners and contractors will be saddled with liability even if they have implemented the presumed mandate of <em>Funk. </em>The danger that lies in this precedent was explained by an Oregon court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">An owner who reserves the right to impose or require safety precautions for the benefit of his contractor\u2019s workmen derives no possible pecuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>ary benefit from the reservation because he has contracted for a finished product. Therefore, if duties not otherwise required of owners are imposed because of the reservation of a right to require safety precautions, it is obvious that owners will not actively concern themselves with the workmen\u2019s safety. <em>[Wilson v Portland General Electric Co, 252 </em>Or 385, 396; 448 P2d 562 (1969). See also <em>Wienke v Ochoco Lumber Co, </em>276 Or 1159; 558 P2d 319 (1976).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Justice Coleman echoed this concern in her dissent in <em>Funk, supra, </em>p 116, when she stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">The majority opinion creates concepts which represent a significant departure from time tested theories of tort liability. Landowners must now disavow all but the most casual personal interest in projects undertaken on their property or assume responsibility for any on-site injuries. General contractors must now be prepared to assume responsibility for any injury received by the employee of a subcontractor, no matter how negligent the employee may be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Justice Coleman\u2019s observation applies with equal, if not greater, force to the case at hand. Because I conclude that the majority\u2019s decision constitutes the unwarranted expansion of an imprudent doctrine, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
