According to Mrs. Churchman, they often argued about Gary Churchman having legal custody of her children. She and Mr. Frost had had plans to marry, but on that night, Mary Churchman told him that she could not go through with the wedding while her ex-husband, Gary Churchman, had custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Mr. Frost became furious. He told Mrs. Churchman that he had taken his revolver and was going to kill her ex-husband. Then he said that he would kill himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Mary Churchman was not worried by this because she had heard him make similar threats in the past. Usually, Mr. Frost went for a drive to cool off.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">On that day, however, Mr. Frost did go to Gary Churchman\u2019s house. According to Leslie Kalchik, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Gary Churchman\u2019s girlfriend, she and her son were lying on the floor watching television when a car pulled into the driveway and someone knocked on the door. Mr. Churchman went to answer it. A few seconds later, Ms. Kalchik heard a shot and Gary Churchman came running up the steps saying he had been shot. Leslie Kalchik saw Mr. Frost at the door and then grabbed her son. She and her son quickly left the house and ran into the woods next door.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Mr. Frost followed Mr. Churchman up into the living room area and shot him at least three more times. The final shot he fired into Gary Churchman was into the back of his head. Before Mr. Frost left the house, he threatened to kill Beulah Churchman, Gary Churchman\u2019s mother. Mr. Frost then walked from the house to the garage, put the gun in his mouth and committed suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">It has been said that Henry Gordon Frost was a paranoid schizophrenic for most of his life; however, because of the limited procedural development of the record below, no evidence was presented on this point.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nonetheless, at the time of his death, according to Sgt. Scott Croton of the Michigan State Police, Mr. Frost was not receiving treatment of any kind for any physical or mental illnesses immediately before his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">This declaratory judgment action arises from two lawsuits that are the result of the tragic murder/suicide committed by Mr. Frost. The first was filed by Beulah Churchman, as personal repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>sentative of the estate of Gary Churchman, as well as next friend of the three Churchman children. The second was brought by Leslie Kalchik, Churchman\u2019s girlfriend, for herself and as next friend of Todd Ferguson, her son. Ms. Kalchik stated that at the time of Gary Churchman\u2019s murder, they were engaged to be married.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Henry Gordon Frost was the named insured of a homeowner\u2019s policy provided by plaintiff in the instant action, Auto-Owners Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Auto-Owners brought this declaratory action in Emmet Circuit Court in September of 1987. Trial court Judge Richard M. Pajtas held that although Michigan case law did not address the issue, a majority of jurisdictions found an exclusionary clause in an insurance policy inapplicable if the insured did not have the mental capacity to intend or expect'his actions. He then denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary disposition and encouraged Auto-Owners to appeal. In the meantime, two decisions regarding this question were issued by the Court of Appeals. Each panel came to a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Plaintiff Auto-Owners applied to the Court of Appeals for leave to appeal, which was granted on January 5, 1989. The Court affirmed the decision of the trial court in an opinion per curiam, 184 Mich App 699; 459 NW2d 24 (1990), concluding that, because of the difference of opinion between the previous panels, it was impossible to conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling was erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 702. Plaintiff filed a timely application for leave to appeal in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">We granted leave to consider whether insurance coverage is precluded as a matter of law because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>an exclusion providing no coverage for bodily injuries caused by an insured that were expected or intended by the insured where the insured is insane or mentally ill. The policy in this case stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">COVERAGE E \u2014 PERSONAL LIABILITY</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">We will pay all sums which an insured person becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury, personal injury (libel, slander or defamation of character, false arrest, detention or imprisonment or malicious prosecution; invasion of privacy, wrongful eviction or wrongful entry) or property damage covered by this policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">If a claim is made or suit is brought against the insured person for liability under this coverage, we will defend the insured person at our expense, using lawyers of our choice. We are not obligated to defend after we have paid an amount equal to the limit of our liability. We may investigate or settle any claim or suit as we think appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-11\">EXCLUSIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-12\">Under Personal Liability Coverage and Medical Payments to Others Coverage we do not cover:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-13\">7. bodily injury or property damage <em>expected or intended by an insured person. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-14\">An insurance policy is much the same as any other contract. It is an agreement between the parties in which a court will determine what the agreement was and effectuate the intent of the parties. <em>Eghotz v Creech, </em>365 Mich 527, 530; 113 NW2d 815 (1962). Accordingly, the court must look at the contract as a whole and give meaning to all terms. <em>Fresard v Michigan Millers Mut Ins Co, </em>414 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Mich 686, 694; 327 NW2d 286 (1982). Further, \"[a]ny clause in an insurance policy is valid as long as it is clear, unambiguous and not in contravention of public policy.\u201d <em>Raska v Farm Bureau Mut Ins Co of Michigan, </em>412 Mich 355, 361-362; 314 NW2d 440 (1982). This Court cannot create ambiguity where none exists. <em>Edgar\u2019s Warehouse, Inc v United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co, </em>375 Mich 598, 602; 134 NW2d 746 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Exclusionary clauses in insurance policies are strictly construed in favor of the insured. <em>Shelby Mut Ins Co v United States Fire Ins Co, </em>12 Mich App 145, 149; 162 NW2d 676 (1968). However, coverage under a policy is lost if any exclusion within the policy applies to an insured\u2019s particular claims. <em>Fresard, supra </em>at 695. Clear and specific exclusions must be given effect. It is impossible to hold an insurance company liable for a risk it did not assume. <em>Kaczmarck v La Perriere, </em>337 Mich 500, 506; 60 NW2d 327 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In the instant case, the insurance policy contained an exclusionary clause that excluded coverage for bodily injuries caused by an insured that were expected or intended by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">In order to avoid its duty to defend and indemnify, plaintiff must show that the insured subjectively intended and expected injury to result from his intentional act.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">This Court considered similar policy language in <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins Co v DiCicco, </em>432 Mich 656; 443 NW2d 734 (1989), and found that because the policy language included the phrase \" 'from the standpoint of the insured,\u2019 \u201d subjective intent was required. <em>Id. </em>at 708. The policy language in this case, \"expected or intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>by an insured person,\u201d is unambiguous and requires a subjective intent; thus, the exclusion must be applied in its plain and easily understood sense. <em>Wertman v Michigan Mut Liability Co, </em>267 Mich 508, 510; 255 NW 418 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Looking at the available facts of this case, we know that Mr. Frost left his home, stating his intentions. We also know that he drove to Gary Churchman\u2019s house, knocked on his door, and shot him numerous times. He then threatened Beulah Churchman, left the house, and killed himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">It is apparent from these facts that Mr. Frost intended to injure Gary Churchman and expected at least to seriously harm him. No other interpretation is possible. Therefore, we find that Henry Gordon Frost indeed intended or expected the resulting harm he caused. We further find that the pertinent exclusion applies to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Therefore, the next question for us to determine is whether an insane or mentally ill person is capable of intending or expecting the consequences of his actions. We must determine if Mr. Frost knew what he was doing when he shot and killed Gary Churchman. We conclude that he did. While Mr. Frost may not have been criminally liable for his acts, he was capable of foreseeing their consequences and understanding what he was doing, i.e., ending another human being\u2019s life. Criminal intent is not required in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">The ability of a mentally ill or insane person to distinguish right from wrong is not implicated in this situation. Criminal responsibility for those actions is not part of the necessary analysis in cases like the one before us today. Because we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>have determined that Henry Gordon Frost intended to take a gun and shoot Gary Churchman, the exclusionary clause of the instant insurance contract applies and there is no coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In <em>Transamerica Ins Corp of America v Boughton, </em>177 Mich App 253; 440 NW2d 922 (1989), defendant Michael Boughton was found not guilty by reason of insanity after he killed his estranged wife. The estate of Joni Boughton filed a wrongful death action against the defendant, for which he sought coverage under his homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. However, Transamerica denied it had a duty to defend Boughton because of the policy exclusion of coverage for a claim of bodily injury or property damage that was expected or intended by the insured, and sought declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals held that \"the acts of a person deemed insane may be intentional within the meaning of an 'intentional and expected\u2019 acts exclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258-259. The panel went on to say, \"[f]ailure to prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt and ability to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that an insured intended and expected injury are not necessarily contradictory propositions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">We agree with this reasoning and conclude that an insane or mentally ill person can intend or expect the results of his actions within the mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ing of an insurance policy\u2019s exclusionary clause. Further, we do not believe that it is appropriate or necessary to find that someone found not criminally liable by reason of insanity cannot be found to have intended his actions and to have expected their consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Foreign jurisdictions are in agreement with these principles. In <em>Johnson v Ins Co of North America, </em>232 Va 340; 350 SE2d 616 (1986), a mentally ill friend of the plaintiff shot the plaintiff in his home, injuring him severely. On the day in question, the plaintiff\u2019s friend had specifically planned to kill him, telling police that he simply wanted to shoot him, so he did.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">Here, when Davis aimed the pistol at Johnson, he knew that he was shooting a human being. Acting deliberately and methodically, Davis had searched for and found a pistol, loaded it, travelled to the victim\u2019s home, waited for him, begun talking with him, and shot him from close range. He acted with resolve and determination, not knowing that what he was doing was wrong because God had ordered him to act. In pointing the pistol at Johnson, Davis did not think, for example, that he was peeling a banana; he was not psychotic to an extreme degree, as the victim readily recognizes when he notes that Davis \"did have this minimal degree of awareness of his actions.\u201d That is sufficient. The shooting was not accidental, a risk insured against, but intentional. <em>[Id. </em>at 347-348.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">The <em>Johnson </em>court concluded that a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity does not negate intent, it merely excuses the act of the individual committing the crime. An individual can have every intention of performing an act and fully intend or expect the consequences that occur. <em>Id. </em>at 348. However, the punishment is not required upon a showing that the person was not guilty by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>reason of insanity. A finding of not guilty by reason of insanity does not mean lack of intent. This allows an exclusionary clause in an insurance policy to apply to these facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">In <em>Rajspic v Nationwide Mut Ins Co, </em>110 Idaho 729; 718 P2d 1167 (1986), Grace Rajspic shot William Brownson during an altercation. Rajspic was acquitted of assault with a deadly weapon because of mental disease or defect excluding responsibility. The Rajspics had an insurance policy with Nationwide Mutual, which excluded acts caused intentionally by or at the direction of the insured. The court found that it. was possible for an insane person to not be criminally liable for the acts, but still intend them as required under an insurance policy._</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>The court agreed with the general proposition that \"a person who is considered insane may still be capable of entertaining the intent to commit certain tortious acts even though he entertains that intent as a consequence of his delusion or affliction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732. (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">In <em>Colonial Life &amp; Accident Ins Co v Wagner, </em>380 SW2d 224 (Ky App, 1964), Warren Shockley walked into a Lexington, Kentucky, hotel and shot and killed the defendant\u2019s decedent. Shockley was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter. The decedent\u2019s insurance policy contained a provision that excluded coverage when the insured\u2019s death or other loss was caused by \" 'injuries intentionally inflicted upon the Insured Employee by any other person.\u2019 \u201d 380 SW2d 225. The defendant claimed that Warren Shockley was mentally ill at the time of the murder and, therefore, he was unable to intentionally commit the crime. Shockley admitted that, at the time of the shooting, he intended to injure Mr. Wagner. The court found that, although an individual may be excused from punishment for his act if he is mentally ill, the intent behind the act is not retrospectively expunged. <em>Id. </em>at 226. An insane person can intend the consequences of his acts. Under the terms of the policy, the court held that Shockley\u2019s acts were intentional and fell within the exclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Therefore, we conclude that Henry Gordon Frost was capable of intending or expecting the results of his actions as required by the exclusionary language in the homeowner\u2019s policy. Thus, coverage is precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">In conclusion, we hold that it is possible for an insane or mentally ill person to intend or expect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>the injuries he causes within the meaning of the insurance policy language. This is not to say that the insured is necessarily criminally liable for his acts. We find that an insane or mentally ill individual can still form the requisite intent to injure another and yet may not be considered criminally culpable. We also conclude that under the facts of this case, Henry Gordon Frost intended or expected the results of his acts. He purposely went to Gary Churchman\u2019s house and shot him four times at close range. Further, the exclusionary clause in plaintiff\u2019s policy is applicable, and plaintiff is relieved of its duty to defend and indemnify under the policy. Thus, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b673-4\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Mallett, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-9\"> Although the parties stipulated at one point in the lower court proceedings that Mr. Frost was mentally incapacitated, it is clear that they did so for purposes of the summary disposition motion only. Further, upon remand of the case by this Court to clarify that stipulation, the trial judge concluded that Mr. Frost did not have the requisite mental capacity to form criminal intent to commit murder. However, that is not to say, nor did the trial judge conclude, that he did not have the necessary intent to kill Gary Churchman for purposes of the instant contractual language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\"> In n 23 of his dissent, Justice Levin quotes the <em>Boughton </em>Court out of context. <em>Post, </em>p 588. In order to put this quote in context, we feel it necessary to provide the rest of the text:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">Defendants argue that, because Boughton was adjudicated to be insane at the time of the shooting, he could not intend or expect to cause his wife\u2019s death. Cases involving a policy which excludes both intentional and expected injuries hold that, in order to avoid liability through the exclusion for expected injury, the insurer must show that the injury was the natural, foreseeable, expected, and anticipatory result of an intentional act. [177 Mich App 255-256.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b671-6\"> In his dissent, Justice Levin discusses <em>Johnson, supra. Post, </em>p 588. In order to provide a clearer picture of what the court said in this case, we feel it necessary to quote from the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">On the surface, there appears to be a blatant inconsistency in concluding, as we do, that a person may be criminally insane when shooting another, and thus avoid full criminal sanctions, and yet that same individual can be denied insurance coverage because he \"intended\u201d to shoot his victim. A more careful analysis, however, will reveal there is no inconsistency at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">In the law, there are many situations in which a person may intentionally injure or kill another and not be subject to criminal punishment. For example, an individual may kill in self-defense. The executioner may kill with the sanction of the State. A soldier may injure or kill under rules of combat. This conduct is intentional, but it is also excusable. Likewise, an individual may be excused from penalty if he is insane at the time he commits a criminal act. As here, he may do the act with every intention of consummating it, but when it is shown that he was mentally ill, he is excused from the imposition of the usual sanctions. \"The absence of punishment, however, does not retrospectively expunge the original intention.\u201d <em>Colonial Life &amp; Accident Ins Co </em>[v <em>Wagner], </em>380 SW2d [224] 226 [Ky App, 1964].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">In sum, we hold, in the words of the trial judge, that Davis \"intended to shoot Kevin Johnson and he did so.\u201d The insurer carried the burden to establish that Davis was aware of what he was doing and that he intended injury to Johnson. Therefore, the exclusion applies. [232 Va 348.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b673-5\">Riley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7X\">(concurring). The exclusionary language used by the insurer in the insured\u2019s policy provides that coverage will be precluded where \"bodily injury [is] expected or intended by an insured person.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because this language is analogous to that used by the insurer in <em>Metropolitan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>Property &amp; Liability Ins Co v DiCicco, </em>432 Mich 656, 676; 443 NW2d 734 (1989), we must apply the subjective standard, as interpreted in <em>DiCicco, </em>to the facts of this case. Moreover, in the instant case, we must evaluate the one exception to the exclusionary language, i.e., whether the insured, stipulated by the parties to be insane for the purposes of plaintiff\u2019s dispositive motion, formed the requisite intent to intend the consequences of his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">As indicated by the majority, the trial court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary disposition, finding that the exclusion did not preclude coverage because the insured could not be found to have intended or expected to kill the decedent and frighten his family. The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before granting leave to appeal, we ordered the trial judge to ascertain the scope and content of the stipulation that was made by the parties for the purpose of plaintiff\u2019s motion. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court opined \"that the scope of the stipulation was that Mr. Frost was insane and did not have the mental capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his acts to form the requisite mental intent to commit murder or some type of assault.\u201d We granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The majority has identified the numerous rules of insurance contract construction on which the Court must rely to interpret an insurance contract.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is safe to assume that these rules of construction have a proinsured, procoverage bias, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>reflecting a belief that in the typical situation where a private individual, as opposed to a business entity, is purchasing insurance from an insurer, the parties do not share equal bargaining strength. <em>Powers v DAIIE, </em>427 Mich 602, 608; 398 NW2d 411 (1986) (Williams, C.J.). Nevertheless, we have also consistently followed the rule of construction that rejects the temptation to rewrite the plain and unambiguous meaning of a policy under the guise of interpretation. We will not create an ambiguity where none exists. <em>Upjohn Co v New Hampshire Ins Co, </em>438 Mich 197, 206-207; 476 NW2d 392 (1991) (opinion of Riley, J.).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Contrary to the expansive approach in evaluating coverage language,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we have taken a fairly narrow approach to interpreting exclusionary language in insurance contracts. <em>DiCicco, supra </em>at 672. We have placed a heavy burden on the insurer to draft exclusionary clauses in clear language comprehensible to lay persons for an exclusion to be operative against the insured. <em>DiCicco, supra </em>at 665; <em>Upjohn, supra </em>at 206. In short, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>exclusionary language must be clear and unambiguous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Insurers incorporate exclusionary provisions to deter intentional losses that are consciously and deliberately brought about by the insured.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The instant case presents the Court with the opportunity to explore the one limitation on the policy exclusion for intentional acts,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> i.e., the requirement that the insured must <em>intentionally </em>cause the injury to a third party.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The difficulty in this case is that the insured, who was stipulated to be insane at the time of committing the act, must be proven to have had the requisite mental capacity to commit an intentional act for the purpose of summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">In <em>DiCicco, </em>we adopted the subjective standard to measure the intent of the insured where the exclusion precludes coverage where \"bodily injury [is] expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The subjective standard, however, was not strictly applied. Had the Court applied a purely subjective standard, the exclusion would only apply when the insured committed the act resulting in a loss with the actual specific intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>bring about that loss. This Court, however, wisely rejected the pure subjective standard and, instead, blended the subjective requirement with a policy-based approach. <em>DiCicco, supra </em>at 679, 682 (opinion of Riley, C.J.) (\"[although the defendant denies any intent to injure, his actions speak louder than [his] words\u201d). See also <em>id. </em>at 718, n 12 (opinion of Boyle, J.) (\"[t]hus, as Justice Archer observes, <em>post, </em>p 731, n 11, the insured need not intend the actual bodily injury inflicted in order to fall under the exclusionary clause\u201d), <em>id. </em>at 731, n 11 (opinion of Archer, J.) (\"I wish to make it clear that the insured need not intend the actual bodily injury inflicted in order to fall within the instant exclusionary clause. It is sufficient that the fact-finder conclude the insured subjectively expected some <em>type </em>of harm reasonably foreseeable from the insured\u2019s standpoint\u201d) (emphasis in original). The difference between these approaches turns on whether the insured had intended the specific injury that in fact occurred, or whether the insured possessed a general intent to intend some injury. The general intent to injure is best characterized as requiring: (1) that the insured intended both the act as well as the infliction of an injury, and (2) that once it is found that some harm was intended, it is immaterial that the actual harm caused is of a different character or magnitude than that intended. Under our approach, the insured\u2019s intent is inferred from the nature and type of conduct that led to the loss.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is not necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>to prove that the insured intended to specifically harm the individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The majority\u2019s application of the facts to the above-quoted rule is in accord with the <em>DiCicco </em>principle. Although insane, the insured intended to kill the decedent because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">we know that Mr. Frost left his home, stating his intentions. We also know that he drove to Gary Churchman\u2019s house, knocked on his door, and shot him numerous times. He then threatened. Beulah Churchman, left the house, and killed himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">It is apparent from these facts that Mr. Frost intended to injure Gary Churchman and expected at least to seriously harm him. No other interpretation is possible. Therefore, we find that Henry Gordon Frost indeed intended or expected the resulting harm he caused. [Mallett, J., <em>ante, </em>p 568.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">I agree with this observation. The insured\u2019s intent to murder Churchman is inferred from the deliberate nature and the intentional type of conduct that led to his death. Therefore, summary disposition in favor of the plaintiff insurer must be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">In dissent, Justice Levin advocates the adoption of a per se rule, finding that if an insane individual does not have the mental capacity to commit murder under the criminal law, that person is not capable of intending or expecting the consequences of his actions for the purpose of the exclusionary language used by Auto-Owners. Levin, J., <em>post, </em>p 584. I cannot agree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">The appropriate test for measuring the mental capacity of the insured to form the requisite intent must be consistent with the understood purpose of the exclusion, not the criminal law. As we stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>earlier in this opinion, the underlying purpose of an exclusionary clause is not to afford compensation to the person who suffered the injury at the hands of the insured. Nor is moral culpability the dispositive issue. Rather, the purpose is to deter the intentional conduct that the insurer expressly precludes from coverage.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">In addition, given the nature of the subjective standard of measuring the intent of the insured that we adopted in <em>DiCicco </em>\u2014 that the insured need not intend the actual bodily injury inflicted \u2014 the rule advanced by Justice Levin cannot be adopted. Under Justice Levin\u2019s analysis, the Court would be adopting the pure subjective standard. In <em>DiCicco, </em>we unanimously rejected that standard, and concluded that the insurer need only establish that the insured intended to cause the victim some type of harm, not that he specifically intended to cause the injury as a consequence of his action. <em>DiCicco, supra </em>at 679, 682 (opinion of Riley, C.J.); <em>id. </em>at 718, n 12 (opinion of Boyle, J.); <em>id. </em>at 731, n 11 (opinion of Archer, J.). Because Justice Levin has not offered a persuasive reason to adopt the pure subjective standard for insane individuals, or any reason to retrench from the policy-blended subjective standard that we adopted in <em>DiCicco, </em>his argument must also be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The true goal of the intentional act exclusion is deterrence. Given the exclusionary language used by Auto-Owners, and the application of the policy-blended subjective standard that we unanimously adopted in <em>DiCicco, </em>we must conclude that while insane, the insured intended to kill Churchman. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Accordingly, the exclusionary provision of Auto-Owners policy precludes coverage.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b680-4\">Griffin, J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-6\"> My views on this matter are unchanged from those I set forth in my separate opinion in <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins Co v DiCicco, </em>432 Mich 656, 676-678; 443 NW2d 734 (1989).

The language used by the insurer in <em>Transameriea Ins Corp of America v Boughton, </em>177 Mich App 253; 440 NW2d 922 (1989), required the Court to use the subjective standard in evaluating the facts in that case. The <em>Boughton </em>language is analogous to the language used by the insurer in this case, and, therefore, the result is consistent with this opinion. However, the language used by the insurers in <em>Allstate Ins Co v Miller, </em>175 Mich App 515; 438 NW2d 638 (1989), Allstate <em>Ins Co v Miller (On Remand), </em>185 Mich App 345; 460 NW2d 612 (1990), and <em>Mattson v Farmers Ins Exchange, </em>181 Mich App 419; 450 NW2d 54 (1989), used language requiring the application of the objective standard. Therefore, the objective standard controlled the resolution of that case.
