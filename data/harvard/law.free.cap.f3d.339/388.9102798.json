By bringing his suit, Chapa sought to recover damages for the loss of his personal property. Upon the Government\u2019s motion under Fed.R.CivP. 12(b)(1), the district court dismissed Chapa\u2019s suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Chapa now appeals that dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-18\">In dismissing Chapa\u2019s suit, the district court reasoned that Chapa\u2019s claim was contained within an exception created by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c) to the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c), any claim arising from \u201cthe detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer\u201d is excluded from the FTCA\u2019s broad waiver of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-19\">Chapa contends that, as a result of its settlement offer, the Government was barred from raising the sovereign immunity defense. This contention is without merit. Sovereign immunity implicates subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Broussard v. United States, </em>989 F.2d 171, 176 (5th Cir.1998). Thus, the issue is not waivable and the Government may raise it at any stage of the proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-20\">We review <em>de novo </em>the issue whether a federal court has subject matter jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>tion. Price <em>v. United States, </em>69 F.3d 46, 49 (5th Cir.1995). \u201cCourts must strictly construe all waivers of the federal government\u2019s sovereign immunity, [resolving] all ambiguities in favor of the sovereign.\u201d <em>Linkous v. United States, </em>142 F.3d 271, 275 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Chapa argues that his claim is not barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c) because BOP employees are not law enforcement officers within the'meaning of the statute. This court has applied \u00a7 2680(c) to law enforcement officers other than customs or tax agents. In <em>Halverson v. United States, </em>972 F.2d 654, 656 (5th Cir.1992), we held that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c) bars claims arising from the detention of goods by any federal law enforcement officers in the performance of their lawful duties. <em>Id. </em>Other circuits have also broadly interpreted the term \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d in applying 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c). <em>See Schlaebitz v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>924 F.2d 193, 194 (11th Cir.1991) (federal Marshals included); <em>see also Ysasi v. Rivkind, </em>856 F.2d 1520, 1525 (Fed.Cir.1988) (INS border patrol agents included); <em>Formula One Motors, Ltd. v. United States, </em>777 F.2d 822, 823 (2nd Cir.1985) (DEA agents included); <em>United States v. 2,116 Boxes of Boned Beef, </em>726 F.2d 1481, 1490-91 (10th Cir.1984) (USDA inspectors included); <em>United States v. Lockheed L-188 Aircraft, </em>656 F.2d 390, 397 (9th Cir.1979) (FAA employees included).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Although the term \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d is not defined in the text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c), that term is defined in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h) as \u201cany officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). The Supreme Court has held that a victim of unlawful conduct, at the hands of BOP officials, would have a cause of action against the United States under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). <em>See Carlson v. Green, </em>446 U.S. 14, 17, 20, 100 S.Ct. 1468, 64 L.Ed.2d 15 (1980). Thus, as defined in \u00a7 2680(h), a BOP official is a federal law enforcement officer. Although <em>Carlson </em>relied on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h), and not on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c), the two sections should be considered <em>in pari materia, </em>and the holding of <em>Carlson </em>is therefore instructive in construing the term \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">We also find instructive the fact that BOP employees are considered \u201claw enforcement officers\u201d in various other contexts. Congress has determined that BOP employees are \u201claw enforcement officers\u201d for purposes of eligibility for Civil Service premium pay, for retirement benefits, and for survivorship annuities. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5541(3), 8331(20) and 8401(17)(D)(i). BOP employees are also \u201claw enforcement officers\u201d whose surviving spouses and minor children may claim eligibility for \u201cPublic Safety Officers\u2019 Death Benefits.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(b)(5). Additionally, one who fatally injures a BOP employee, while the employee is engaged in his official duties, can be charged with the offense of killing a \u201claw enforcement officer,\u201d with the potential for a federal death penalty upon a finding of guilt. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3592(c)(14)(D); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(e)(2). Construing the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity strictly, we hold that BOP employees are \u201claw enforcement officers]\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Chapa also argues that because the BOP\u2019s process of inspection and inventory before shipping a prisoner\u2019s property is not' a search, seizure, or arrest, his property was not \u201cdetained\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c). As the Sixth Circuit noted in <em>Kurinsky v. United States, </em>33 F.3d 594, 597 (6th Cir.1994), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c) uses the word \u201cdetention,\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>is generally associated with a period of temporary custody or delay, and not \u201cseizure,\u201d which is the act of taking possession of property, for example, by virtue of execution or for a violation of the law. Pursuant to the process of inspection and inventory, BOP officials took temporary custody of and detained Chapa\u2019s property. Resolving, as we must, any ambiguity in favor of sovereign immunity, <em>Linkous, </em>142 F.3d at 275, we hold that there was a detention for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The district court did not err in finding that Chapa\u2019s claim was barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c) and that it thus lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his suit. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Chapa\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
