Sections 3 and 30 of the Public Officers Law are special laws which, under the home rule provisions of the Constitution, can be superseded by an inconsistent local law. <em>(Matter of Holland v Bankson, </em>290 NY 267; <em>Baldwin v City of Buffalo, </em>6 NY2d 168; <em>Matter of Osborn v Cohen, </em>272 NY 55; <em>Matter of Kuhn v Curran, </em>294 NY 207; <em>Matter of Sherrill v O\u2019Brien, </em>188 NY 185; <em>Matter of Carey v Morton, </em>297 NY 361; <em>Adler v Deegan, </em>251 NY 467; <em>Robinson v County of Broome, </em>195 Misc 24, 276 App Div 69, 301 NY 524; <em>Matter of Roosevelt Raceway v County of Nassau, </em>18 NY2d 30; <em>Matter of 241 East 22nd St. Corp. v City Rent Agency, </em>33 NY2d 134.) II. Since Local Law No. 20 does not mandate removal without notice and hearing, it does not violate section 75 of the Civil Service Law; nor does it impermissibly deprive plaintiffs of pension rights. <em>(Mandelkern v City of Buffalo, </em>92 Misc 2d 425, 64 AD2d 279; <em>Matter of Coates, </em>9 NY2d 242; <em>Matter of Bell </em>v <em>Waterfront Comm. of N.

Local Law No. 20 does not violate the <em>concept </em>of making civil service appointments on the basis of merit and fitness. <em>(Hesse v Rath, </em>224 App Div 344, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>249 NY 436; <em>Matter of Maye v Lindsay, </em>69 Misc 2d. 276, 41 AD2d 127, 33 NY2d 552, 414 US 1069.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-5\"><em>Kenneth E.

The courts below correctly held that Local Law No. 20 is inconsistent with applicable Public Officers Law residency provisions and is, therefore, invalid. <em>(Wholesale Laundry Bd. of Trade v City of New York, </em>43 Misc 2d 816, 22 AD2d 762, 765, 15 NY2d 604; <em>City of Corning v Corning Police Dept. of Corning City Unit of Steuben County Ch., Civ.

II. The courts below correctly held Local Law No. 20 invalid by reason of its violation of section 75 of the Civil Service Law. <em>(Matter of Giliforte v City of Buffalo, </em>54 AD2d 170; <em>Matter of Coates, </em>9 NY2d 242; <em>Matter of Bell v Waterfront Comm. of N.

The courts below correctly held Local Law No. 20 invalid by reason of its violation of section 6 of article V of the New York State Constitution. <em>(Matter of Maye v Lindsay, </em>33 NY2d 552, 414 US 1069; <em>Wardwell v Board of Educ., </em>529 F2d 625.)

V. Local Law No. 20 is invalid as to the sanitationmen by reason of its violation of rights afforded by the United States and New York State Constitutions, particularly the right to equal protection of the laws. <em>(Krzewinski v Kugler, </em>338 F Supp 492; <em>Shapiro v Thompson, </em>394 US 618; <em>Matter of Schulman v New York City Health &amp; Hosps.

Sections 3 (subd 2) and 30 (subd 4) of the Public Officers Law may not be superseded by inconsistent local law. <em>(Matter of De Hond v Nyquist, 65 </em>Misc 2d 526; <em>Matter of Hesselgrave v King, </em>45 Misc 2d 256; <em>Matter of Maurer v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number><em>Gross, </em>45 Misc 2d 13; <em>Matter of Mayor of N.

Local Law No. 20 violates the constitutional requirement that appointments to the civil service of the city shall be made according to merit and fitness. <em>(Matter of Maye v Lindsay, </em>33 NY2d 552, 414 US 1069.) IV. The enactment of Local Law No. 20 is an unconstitutional impairment of pension rights of respondent. <em>(Matter of Rapp v New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement System, </em>42 NY2d 1.) V. Local Law No. 20 unilaterally and unconstitutionally impairs contract obligations and rights. <em>(Hall v Wisconsin, </em>103 US 5; <em>Indiana ex rel. Anderson v Brand, </em>303 US 95; <em>Matter of Fink v Finegan, </em>270 NY 356; <em>Matter of Gilburt v Kroll, </em>17 Misc 2d 409, 1 AD2d 819; <em>Shapiro v Thompson, </em>394 US 618.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b121-5\"><em>Robert Abrams, Attorney-General (Daniel M.

Accordingly, neither section violates the provisions of sections 2 or 3 of article IX of the New York State Constitution or the provisions of the 1963 home rule amendment (art IX, \u00a7 11). <em>(Matter of Peters v New York City Housing Auth., </em>307 NY 519; <em>People v Carcel, </em>3 NY2d 327; <em>Comiskey v Arlen, </em>43 NY2d 696; <em>Matter of Van Berkel v Power, </em>16 NY2d 37; <em>Wiggins v Town of Somers, 4 </em>NY2d 215; <em>Matter of De Hond v Nyquist, </em>65 Misc 2d 526; <em>Matter of Taylor v Sise, </em>33 NY2d 357; <em>McGowan v Maryland, </em>366 US 420; <em>Williamson v Lee Opt.

As is conceded, the law as applicable to these persons is inconsistent with exemptions from municipal residency requirements contained in section 3 (subds 2, 2-a, 9) and section 30 (subds 4, 4-a, 5) of the Public Officers Law. Contrary to the city\u2019s contention, these sections may not be superseded by local law under municipal home rule as they do not relate \"to the property, affairs or government\u201d of the city by \"special law\u201d (NY Const, art IX, \u00a7 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Home rule simply is not implicated when the Legislature acts in areas \"other than the property, affairs or government of a local government\u201d (NY Const, art IX, \u00a7 3, subd [a], par [3]). Under the limited meaning of this phrase, legislation of State import does not impinge upon municipal home rule simply because it touches matters that concern the affairs or property of the city <em>(Adler v Deegan, </em>251 NY 467 [conditions of multiple dwellings]; see <em>Hotel Dorset Co. v Trust for Cultural Resources of City of N. Y., </em>46 NY2d 358 [maintenance of cultural institutions]). While the structure and control of the municipal service departments in issue here may be considered of local concern within the meaning of municipal home rule (see <em>Matter of Osborn v Cohen, </em>272 NY 55 [duties and number of firemen, hours of work]), the residence of their members, unrelated to job performance or departmental organization, is a matter of State-wide concern not subject to municipal home rule. The city offers nothing to show the insubstantiality of the State\u2019s interest in affording residential mobility to members of the civil service.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Nor are the provisions of the statute infirm because, although cast in general terms, they may affect less than all cities. A statute dealing with matters of State concern is no less general because it classifies the cities affected on the basis of population or some other condition and extends its benefits only to one or a few cities (see <em>Hotel Dorset Co. v Trust for Cultural Resources of City of N. Y., supra; Matter of McAneny v Board of Estimate &amp; Apportionment of City of N. Y, 232 </em>NY 377). What is required is that the classification be defined by conditions <em>common to the </em>class and related to the subject of the statute (cf. <em>Farrington v Pinckney, </em>1 NY2d 74, 80-81; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>Stapleton v Pinckney, </em>293 NY 330, 335). And, it has long been recognized that New York City and other large municipal centers might reasonably receive different treatment (see <em>Matter of 241 East 22nd St. Corp. v City Rent Agency, </em>33 NY2d 134; <em>Matter of McAneny v Board of Estimate &amp; Apportionment of City of N. Y., </em>232 NY 377, <em>supra). </em>Thus, to the extent that Local Law No. 20 is inconsistent with the Public Officers Law, it cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Meyer concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
