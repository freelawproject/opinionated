We hold that, under the circumstances here, neither due process nor the privilge against self incrimination prohibits this manner of impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Defendant James Savage appeals from an order of the Appellate Division which affirmed a judgment entered upon a jury verdict convicting him of first degree assault. The conviction flowed from his shooting of one Robert Johnson in the course of an altercation outside the Central Bar on East 161st Street in The Bronx. At the trial several witnesses for the People, including Johnson, testified that Savage had drawn his gun and purposely shot Johnson. One of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, the arresting officer, testified that several weeks after the crime had been committed, when he apprehended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>the defendant, immediately after the administration of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the defendant volunteered, first, \"I\u2019m glad I\u2019m caught \u2014 I\u2019m tired\u201d and then went on to describe his role in the shooting, confessing that he had shot Johnson with a gun he possessed during an altercation outside the bar. Significantly, to the prosecutor\u2019s additional inquiry, made without objection, as to whether the defendant had \"indicate[d] anything further to you apart from what you\u2019ve just started\u201d, the officer's response was \"no\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Thereafter, during his own case, the defendant, choosing to take the stand, testified that he indeed had shot Johnson and then added by way of justification that the shooting had occurred during an altercation precipited when Johnson attempted to rob him. He also told the jury that the actual discharge of the gun was inadvertent. On cross-examination the prosecutor, in an obvious attempt to establish that the exculpatory material was a recent fabrication, essayed, and over objection was permitted, to put a short series of questions at the heart of which was the one that reads: \"Now, when you saw Detective Creegan [following the arrest], before you saw your lawyer, when you saw the police officer, did you tell the police oficer that [Johnson] attempted to rob you?\u201d The defendant\u2019s response was that he had done so. As might be expected, during the course of his summation, the District Attorney, in arguing that the detective\u2019s version of the post-<em>Miranda </em>statement was more credible, made the point that, if it was, the fact that the defendant had omitted any mention of the exculpatory circumstance at the time of his original statement militated against its truth. In our view, the prosecutor\u2019s queries to the defendant were proper and, therefore, so were the comments made in closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">It is by now well settled that the use of his postarrest silence against a defendant even for impeachment purposes may violate due process and the privilege against self incrimination. In <em>Doyle v Ohio </em>(426 US 610), fundamental fairness forebade a prosecutor to attempt to draw an adverse inference from the fact of a defendant\u2019s silence at the time of arrest because the defendant\u2019s receipt of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings had, in effect, conveyed the State\u2019s assurance that, if he elected to remain silent, his silence would not be used against him <em>(id., </em>at pp 617, 619; see <em>Jenkins v Anderson, </em>447 US 231, \u2014, 48 USLW 4693, 4696). Having been told he need not speak about the facts of the case at that time, the State cannot renege on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>its promise and use the silence to impeach him when he subsequently testifies at trial. Moreover, viewed against the obvious prejudice, the use of the silence a defendant maintained at a time when he was privileged to say nothing at all was recognized to be of dubious probative value because it cannot be determined whether, in fact, it was the existence of the privilege that induced the silence. <em>(Doyle v Ohio, supra, </em>at pp 617, 618; see <em>People v Rutigliano, </em>261 NY 103, 107.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">However, as the Supreme Court has even more recently made clear, a defendant, who, in the face of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, decides not to exercise his privilege but instead chooses to speak to the police about the charges against him, enjoys no due process protection from such an inquiry (see <em>Jenkins v Anderson, supra, </em>at p \u2014, 48 USLW, p 4696; <em>Anderson v Charles, </em>447 US \u2014, 48 USLW 3819). Rather, whether he may be impeached by the use of telling omissions from the tale he told is to be determined under State evidentiary law <em>(Jenkins v Anderson, supra, </em>at p \u2014, p 4696; cf. <em>People v Dawson, </em>50 NY2d 311, 321-322).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Against this backdrop, the case before us emerges as fundamentally different from <em>Doyle (supra). </em>For, the simple and undeniable fact is that the defendant here did not remain silent. In stark contrast to the circumstances in <em>Doyle, </em>where the defendants \" 'did not speak about the facts of the case at the time\u2019 \u201d when the silence there occurred (426 US, at p 619, as reiterated in <em>Jenkins v Anderson, supra, </em>at p \u2014, p 4694), the most cursory examination of the record reveals that Savage, for all practical purposes, did just the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">As already indicated, the direct testimony of the arresting officer established that Savage, without any overbearing of his will, responded to the opportunity to inform the officer of his involvement in the crime. Moreover, this he did in no conclusory form. A breakdown of his statement proves that he specifically stated that he possessed a pistol, that he used the weapon to shoot Robert Johnson, that the shooting occurred in the course of a dispute between him and Johnson, that the shooting took place in front of a bar and that the bar was located on 161st Street. Not only were these relevations incriminatory, they expressly incorporated essential elements of the crime with which he was to be charged. But excluded from all this was the crucial exculpatory circumstance to which the defendant later was to testify \u2014 that he had shot his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>victim unintentionally while warding off the latter\u2019s attempt to rob him.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Given defendant\u2019s voluntarily rendered narrative of his part in the shooting, this omission speaks more eloquently than words. For, what was omitted is far from an inconsequential detail or a collateral matter, but a fact of such overwhelming significance that its absence from the narrative was at least as calculated to distort his recitation as a most affirmative falsehood. It put an entirely different cast on the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">It is an elementary rule of evidence, and of common sense, in our State and almost every other jurisdiction, that, when given circumstances make it most unnatural to omit certain information from a statement, the fact of the omission is itself admissible for purposes of impeachment (3A Wigmore, Evidence [Chadbourn rev ed], \u00a7 1042; Richardson, Evidence [10th ed \u2014 Prince], \u00a7 222). This rule is firmly imbedded in behavioral expectations (cf. <em>People v Dawson, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Therefore, that the defendant decided not to offer the mitigating explanation for his conduct in amelioration of his role in the shooting he undertook to describe could challenge credulity. Having on his own ventured to communicate devastatingly incriminating information, his failure to then so much as mention the excuse he was later to put forth is well-nigh inexplicable except as a recent fabrication. Measured by the way in which almost any normal person would perceive it, the strongest considerations of self-interest would be expected to keep him from containing it within himself. In short, his conduct ran counter to human experience. And further confirmation of its significance comes from the setting in which the omission occurred: that moment of psychological truth when a defendant chooses to inculpate himself, \"that moment [when] he will tell all, and tell it truly\u201d (3 Wigmore, Evidence [Chadbourn rev ed], \u00a7 851, p 524).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the exclusion, however it might be weighed by the triers of the facts, was, to say the least, extraordinarily probative in enabling them to evaluate the reliability of the explanation when it surfaced for the first time at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Moreover, reference to the omission, because of its negative nature, could not serve substantively as evidence in chief to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>prove the commission of the crime. It did not lend itself to employment, whether by way of evidence or argument, as anything more than a device for impeachment (compare <em>United States v Agee, </em>597 F2d 350, 354, 357, cert den 442 US 944, with <em>id., </em>at pp 365-368 [dissenting opn]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Such an analysis fully grants the respect to be accorded a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, whether in the exercise of his privilege against self incrimination or to the process that is his due. But, doing so, it also recognizes that the intent behind the privilege against self incrimination, exemplified by the supportive <em>Miranda </em>procedures it has spawned, is not to induce silence but only to insure that the choice to speak is free and uncompelled (see ALI, Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure, pp 368-374). That it was so in the case before us now is unchallenged. There is not the slightest suggestion that government action, passive or active and whether via the <em>Miranda </em>warnings or otherwise, induced the omission. If anything, it can be said that the warnings provided him with a ready means by which to rationalize the omission at trial (see <em>Doyle v Ohio, </em>426 US, at p 626 [Stevens, J., dissenting]).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In striking the balance these principles bespeak, the State is denied the right to draw adverse inferences from the fact that a defendant has maintained an effective silence, even if something less than total. However, as we have seen, constitutional standards do not inhibit every use of a defendant\u2019s postarrest silence, but only those which are fundamentally unfair <em>(Doyle v Ohio, supra, </em>at pp 618, 619-620, and n 11; <em>United States v Conlin, </em>551 F2d 534, cert den 434 US 831 [to rebut defendant\u2019s claim that he told exculpatory version to police after his arrest]; cf. <em>Jenkins v Anderson, </em>447 US 231, 245, \u2014, 48 USLW 4693, 4696, 4698, n 1, <em>supra </em>[Marshall, J., dissenting, use of prearrest silence to impeach defendant\u2019s credibility]; <em>Roberts v United States, </em>445 US 552, 562-563 [Brennan, J., concurring, refusal of defendant to answer questions about coconspirators held to permit increased sentence]; <em>United States v Trujillo, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>578 F2d 285, 287-288 [postarrest silence may be pertinent to claim of insanity]).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Thus, as <em>Doyle </em>teaches, courts may not overlook the obvious fact that postarrest silence will often be (at p 617) \"insolubly ambiguous\u201d since it may be impossible to determine whether the defendant was motivated to remain silent in the exercise of his Fifth Amendment privilege or, for example, because he then possessed no acceptable explanation for the conduct for which he was in custody. But, in a case like the one before us today, where we deal with a defendant who did not stand mute, evenhanded logic dictates that time-tested evidentiary procedures for the ascertainment of truth not be ignored <em>(Anderson v Charles, </em>447 US \u2014, 48 USLW 3819, <em>supra).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Surely, that is true as to a defendant who, instead of invoking his right to silence, \" 'chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will\u2019 \u201d <em>(Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436, 460, <em>supra) </em>and, in so doing, speaks pertinently to the criminal accusation against him. When, as in the present case, the defendant, though alerted to his rights by the officer, is ready enough to make an almost cathartic confessional of both his relief at being apprehended and the role he played in the shooting itself, he manifests an unmistakable \"decision to cast aside his cloak of silence\u201d and thus should not now be permitted to forestall impeachment of his credibility with the cavalier claim that he did not so intend <em>(Jenkins v Anderson, supra, </em>at p \u2014, p 4695).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">That this case does not fit into the analytical mold of <em>Doyle </em>is also apparent from the fact that the dissenters must indulge in the utterly unwarranted presumption that the defendant, whom the <em>Miranda </em>warnings did not deter from revealing his leading part in the criminal transaction, suddenly thought the better of it and refused to say anything more in reliance on the privilege which until that instant he had completely ignored. Putting aside the fact that nothing in the record supports this tenuous assumption, as already indicated such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>an approach must proceed on the peculiar premise that the defendant would unnaturally have halted his speech solely to withhold the one thing he normally would want to put up front, his exculpatory explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">This being so, it is noteworthy that other courts, interpreting <em>Doyle </em>in like circumstances, also have sanctioned the impeachment of a defendant\u2019s credibility by confronting him with logically significant omissions from a postarrest statement (see, e.g., <em>United States v Agee, </em>597 F2d 350, 354-357, <em>supra; United States v Mireles, </em>570 F2d 1287, 1291-1293; <em>Twyman v Oklahoma, </em>560 F2d 422, 424, cert den 434 US 1071; <em>United States v Mitchell, </em>558 F2d 1332, 1334, 1335).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Most important, misapplication of the protective principles these cases indorse in the long run would but serve to undermine rather than advance the values protected by the privilege against self incrimination and those advanced by the requirement for due process. For nothing saps the strength of a legal precept more than when, as put into practice, it turns out to have an unanticipated, unrealistic and undesirable effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">For all these reasons, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\">. The weighty experiential support for this principle, Professor Wigmore has noted, has been recognized by masters of psychology as varied as Honor\u00e9 Balzac and Daniel Webster (3 Wigmore, Evidence [Chadbourn rev ed], \u00a7 851, p 524, n 2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b712-7\">. It is also worth mention that the prosecutor\u2019s question in any event could have had no more than cumulative effect; the juxtaposition of the inclusion of the exculpatory matter in the defendant\u2019s own testimony, on the one hand, and its absence from the officer\u2019s recounting of his postarrest conversation with the defendant, on the other, could hardly have been lost on the jury. Moreover, defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the pertinent questions put to the officer as to the completeness of the post-<em>Miranda </em>statement only emphasizes that the contrast between the policeman\u2019s version and that the defendant was to give was bound to introduce a full-blown impeachment issue even if the defendant had not been cross-examined at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\">. It goes without saying that, in such circumstances, the trial court, exercising its authority to supervise the cross-examination (see <em>People v Ocasio, </em>47 NY2d 55, 60), may be expected to apply standards like those we enunciated in <em>People v Dawson </em>(50 NY2d 311, <em>supra), </em>adjusted of course, for the differences between a witness in the position of the one in that case and of a defendant in a case like the present one. Thus, for example, the court should, if requested, advise the jury that the defendant was under no legal obligation to have continued speaking, and should permit the defendant the opportunity to tender explanation for his omissions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b714-8\">Chief Judge Cooke</author>\n<p id=\"Ay2\">(concurring). I concur in the result in this case. I write, however, because I believe that the majority\u2019s studied silence on the matter overrules our recent decision, in <em>People v Conyers </em>(49 NY2d 174). There, relying on both the Federal and State Constitutions, we held that defendant\u2019s postarrest silence could not be used against him, even in the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. This rule was founded on the State\u2019s implied promise not to use against a defendant the constitutionally guaranteed right to remain silent and on the rationale that it would be fundamentally unfair to permit the State to renege on that promise by later using that silence against him <em>(People v Conyers, supra, </em>at pp 179-180). Both due process and the privilege against self incrimination (NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6) prevented use of defendant\u2019s postarrest silence for impeachment purposes. Moreover, we recognized the weak probative value of postarrest silence given its inherent ambiguity <em>(id., </em>at pp 181-182). In contrast to <em>Conyers, </em>the instant case does not involve postarrest silence. Defendant here freely chose to speak. Thus, <em>Conyers </em>is inapplicable. Since <em>Jenkins v Anderson </em>(447 US 231) does not compel a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>different approach to that adopted in <em>Conyers, </em>I cannot join the majority opinion in this respect.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b715-5\">Gabrielli, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVS\">(dissenting). Pursuant to well-established legal precedent, I am compelled to dissent and vote to reverse the order of the Appellate Division. Simply stated, the People were improperly permitted, over a timely objection, to question defendant about his failure to provide the police at the time of his arrest with every detail of the explanation for his conduct that he subsequently asserted at trial. Since there existed no actual inconsistency between what defendant told the police following his arrest and his testimony at trial, cross-examination concerning defendant\u2019s partial silence at the time of his arrest is violative of due process <em>(People v Conyers, </em>49 NY2d 174; <em>Doyle v Ohio, </em>426 US 610; cf. <em>People v Dawson, </em>50 NY2d 311).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In the early morning hours of January 4, 1977, defendant shot one Robert Johnson in the abdomen during an altercation with Johnson on the sidewalk outside the Central Bar at East 161st Street and Morris Avenue in The Bronx. Fortunately, the injury was not fatal. Savage was arrested for the crime several weeks later, and after being given the warnings mandated by <em>Miranda v Arizona </em>(384 US 436), defendant told police that he was glad he had been arrested, because he was \"tired\u201d. He also admitted that he had shot Johnson outside the Central Bar, but he otherwise gave no details about the incident at that time, according to the trial testimony of the officer to whom those statements were made. At defendant\u2019s trial, Johnson and several other witnesses testified that defendant had drawn his gun and purposely shot Johnson during an argument. Defendant testified on his own behalf. He admitted shooting Johnson, but sought to justify his action, asserting that Johnson had assaulted him and was attempting to rob him. Defendant claimed that he drew the gun in the hope of frightening off Johnson and without any intention of actually using it, but that the gun accidentally discharged in the scuffle.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">On cross-examination, the court permitted the prosecutor to ask defendant the following question over a timely defense objection: \"Now, when you saw Detective Creegan [following the arrest], before you saw your lawyer, when you saw the police officer, did you tell the police officer that he [Johnson] attempted to rob you?\u201d Since the officer had already testified on direct that defendant had simply admitted shooting John<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>son and had not made any other statements following his arrest, this question was obviously intended to impeach defendant\u2019s exculpatory testimony at trial by suggesting that it was a recent fabrication. Interestingly, however, defendant responded that he had in fact told the officer his version of the incident. The prosecutor was then permitted to cross-examine defendant at some length about the discrepancy thus revealed between the testimony of the officer and that of defendant concerning the statements defendant had made to the officer. For reasons that follow I am constrained to conclude that it was error to allow the People to question defendant about his failure to tell the police his version of the facts following his arrest. Hence, there should be a reversal and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">It has long been the law in this State that a defendant\u2019s silence following his arrest may not be used against him as evidence of guilt <em>(People v Rutigliano, </em>261 NY 103). Although at one time it was permissible to use the defendant\u2019s silence as a means of impeaching his in-court testimony on the ground that it was a recent fabrication (see <em>People v Rothschild, </em>35 NY2d 355), that exception to the general prohibition against the use of a defendant\u2019s silence was sharply curtailed by the Supreme Court in <em>Doyle v Ohio </em>(426 US 610, <em>supra). </em>It was held in <em>Doyle </em>that a defendant who remains silent after being given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings may not subsequently be questioned, even for the limited purpose of impeachment, concerning that silence. Thereafter, in <em>People v Conyers </em>(49 NY2d 174, 180, <em>supra) </em>we recognized that under both the Federal and New York State Constitutions, \"the use for impeachment purposes of an accused\u2019s silence at the time of his arrest is violative of due process\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I consider this principle, which a fortiori is applicable to the assertion of the right to silence following an arrest (see <em>Doyle v Ohio, </em>426 US 610, <em>supra; </em>see, also, <em>People v Conrow, </em>200 NY 356, 367-369), to be dispositive of the instant appeal. Quite simply, the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>quoted above constituted an attempt to use defendant\u2019s postarrest silence to impeach his trial testimony by suggesting that his failure to tell the police his version of events following his arrest implied that it was a recent fabrication. As such, it falls within the bar against such cross-examination enunciated in <em>Doyle </em>and in <em>Conyers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The majority conclude that the instant case is distinguishable from <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Conyers </em>because the defendants in those cases said little or nothing to the police at the time of arrest, whereas Savage did admit that he had shot Johnson. I do not find this factual distinction to be constitutionally significant in this context. The majority impliedly suggest that a defendant who once waives his right to remain silent by speaking to the police must then either continue to speak or subject himself to cross-examination concerning his subsequent silence. I am unable to agree with that and cannot concur in the majority\u2019s decision to so neatly separate the initial assertion of the right to remain silent from any subsequent exercise of that right. A defendant who does begin to speak to the police has the absolute right to cease speaking at any time and thereby impliedly reassert his right to be silent, and no compulsion, however subtle, may be employed to persuade such a defendant to continue speaking. One who makes an admission to the police does not thereby assume any obligation to volunteer further information, and the failure to do so may not serve as a basis for discrediting a subsequent explanation. This is so because the decision to refrain from giving complete details to the police, like the decision not to speak to the police at all, must be deemed an assertion of the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. Since the State has impliedly promised every defendant that it will not use his silence against him, it would be fundamentally unfair to nonetheless allow the assertion of that right to be used even for impeachment purposes only (see <em>People v Conyers, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Clearly distinguishable are those cases in which a defendant at or following his arrest actually makes a statement which is inconsistent with his later testimony at trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>situation, the prosecution is free to use that inconsistency for impeachment purposes, even if the statement would be inadmissible on the prosecution\u2019s direct case because it was obtained without first providing the suspect with the mandatory <em>Miranda </em>warnings <em>(People v Wise, </em>46 NY2d 321; <em>People v Harris, 25 </em>NY2d 175, affd 401 US 222). There exist several reasons why a testifying defendant may be impeached by inconsistent statements obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>but not by his assertion of his right to refrain from speaking to his accusers. First, while the State promises a defendant that it will not use his silence against him and may not subsequently renege on that assurance, no similar promise is made with respect to a defendant\u2019s voluntary statements, even if obtained in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>Hence, there exists no fundamental unfairness in allowing the latter to be used for impeachment purposes. Moreover, a direct inconsistency is of much greater probative value than is a defendant\u2019s complete or partial silence. Furthermore, \"a defendant\u2019s decision to remain silent at the time of arrest is in and of itself an assertion of a basic constitutional privilege. Thus, to allow that silence to be used against a defendant is to place a burden upon the direct exercise of a fundamental right. The <em>Miranda </em>warnings, on the other hand, constitute a prophylactic device designed to prevent constitutional violations and to protect the rights of an accused. In the absence of any actual coercion, a statement made by a defendant who has not been informed of his rights is not inherently suspect, nor does the use of such a statement against a defendant penalize that defendant for the exercise of a constitutionally protected right\u201d <em>(People v Conyers, </em>49 NY2d 174, 182-183, <em>supra). </em>In sum, whenever the alleged inconsistency arises not from the defendant\u2019s words, but from his failure to speak fully at a time when he was privileged to refrain from speaking at all, the prosecution may not use that claimed inconsistency to impeach the defendant\u2019s trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">This is not to suggest that a defendant may never be cross-examined as to his failure to speak. Certainly, if the defendant himself puts the matter in issue, the trial court would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>abuse its discretion by allowing the People to pursue the subject. For example, if a defendant on direct examination, or even in response to a legitimate prosecution query during cross-examination, were to testify that he told his exculpatory version of the facts to the police, the prohibition against the use of defendant\u2019s silence would not apply. In such a case, the trial court would be empowered not only to allow cross-examination of the defendant on this point (see <em>Doyle v Ohio, </em>426 US 610, 619-620, n 11, <em>supra), </em>but also to permit the People to provide direct evidence to the contrary in rebuttal (see, also, <em>People v Wise, </em>46 NY2d 321, 328, <em>supra). </em>This is so because a defendant who is allowed, whether properly or not, to buttress his exculpatory trial testimony in such a way (see Richardson, Evidence [10th ed], \u00a7 519) creates an issue concerning the exact extent of his statements to the police and thereby opens the door to an inquiry which would otherwise be forbidden. In short, if a defendant seeks to rely on a claim that he made certain statements to the authorities, the prosecution normally should be free both to attempt to disprove the existence of those statements and to explore the circumstances surrounding their purported utterance.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">No such exception to the general bar against use of a defendant\u2019s silence is applicable to the instant case, for here the entire issue arose as a result of an improper prosecution attempt to use defendant\u2019s postarrest silence to discredit his exculpatory trial testimony. It is true that defendant did eventually testify that he had told the officers his exculpatory story. Hence, in accord with the principle discussed above, had such a statement been made either on direct or in response to permissible cross-examination, the People legitimately could have sought to pursue the matter. As it is, however, this statement was elicited by the prosecution in the course of a wholly improper inquiry and accordingly cannot serve to justify that examination <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>The legitimacy of a particular line of cross-examination must be judged prospectively, not retroactively, in the sense that testimony obtained during a particular line of questioning may not be used as an ex post facto justification for that very line of inquiry if it was clearly improper at the time it was commenced. Thus, in the instant case, the fact that the prosecution\u2019s improper cross-examination ultimately elicited testimony which could itself have served as a basis for legitimate cross-examination had it been made in a different context, does not negate the undeni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>able fact that the trial court erred, in allowing that initial inquiry (cf. <em>United States v Mavrick, </em>601 F2d 921).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Nor do I find any merit in the People\u2019s additional contention that the error in allowing the prosecution to cross-examine Savage about his silence was harmless. Although there was considerable evidence of guilt, there nonetheless remained a question of credibility for the jury as to the conflicting testimony concerning the details of the dispute between defendant and Johnson. In such a case, the assault upon defendant\u2019s credibility may well have played a significant part in the jury\u2019s ultimate determination that defendant was guilty. Especially is this true in light of the prosecutor\u2019s summation, which emphasized defendant\u2019s failure to tell the police his version of the facts following his arrest. Thus, I must conclude that there does exist a reasonable possibility that this constitutional error contributed to defendant\u2019s conviction (see <em>People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">In light of my conclusion that defendant is entitled to a new trial on this ground, I deem it unnecessary to consider any of defendant\u2019s other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Accordingly, I vote to reverse the order appealed from and to remit the case to Supreme Court, Bronx County, for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Judges Jasen, Jones and Meyer concur with Judge Fuchsberg; Chief Judge Cooke concurs in a separate opinion; Judge Gabrielli, dissents and votes to reverse in another opinion in which Judge Wachtler concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-6\">. We also held in <em>Conyers </em>that use of silence, even for impeachment purposes only, was improper under both the Federal and State Constitutions regardless of whether the defendant has actually been given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Recently, the Supreme Court in <em>Jenkins v Anderson </em>(447 US 231) has indicated that if the defendant is not given <em>Miranda </em>warnings and does not otherwise specifically indicate that he is relying upon his right to remain silent, the use of that silence for impeachment purposes is not violative of the Federal Constitution. This holding, however, does not vitiate the conclusion we reached in <em>Conyers </em>that such cross-examination is violative of our State Constitution. In any event, since Savage was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings, <em>Jenkins </em>is not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">. The People also suggest that the instant case does present an actual inconsistency in that the defendant told the officer following his arrest that he had shot Johnson during a \"dispute\u201d, whereas at trial defendant testified that he had shot Johnson during an attempted assault and robbery. I find this particular argument unpersuasive, for two reasons. First, there does not appear to be any necessary contradiction between the two accounts. That the \"dispute\u201d between defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Johnson was caused by a robbery attempt does not make it any less of a \"dispute\u201d. Moreover, the police officer did not specifically testify that the defendant actually used the word \"dispute\u201d to describe the incident; rather, that term was supplied by the prosecutor (cf. <em>Anderson v Charles, </em>447 US \u2014, 48 USLW 3819).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
