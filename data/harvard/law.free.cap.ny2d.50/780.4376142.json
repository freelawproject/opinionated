Section 2562 exclusively applies to claims against the New York City Board of Education. Section 3813 is applicable only to claims against districts and boards other than those in New York City and Buffalo. <em>(H &amp; J Floor Covering v Board of Educ., </em>66 AD2d 588; <em>Pettinelli Elec. Co. v Board of Educ., </em>43 NY2d 760; <em>Knapp v City of Brooklyn, </em>97 NY 520; <em>Cimo v State of New York, </em>306 NY 143; <em>Orinoco </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number><em>Realty Co. v Bandler, </em>233 NY 24.) II. Since the 1936 passage of section 2562, the board has utilized only that section and its own contract provisions to govern the filing of claims. It is estopped from retroactively and without prior notice now hiding behind the never before used section 3813. <em>(Bender v New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp., </em>38 NY2d 662; <em>Robinson v City of New York, </em>24 AD2d 260; <em>Fletcher-McCarthy Constr. Co. v State of New York, </em>53 Misc 2d 62.) III. The board has promulgated a form of contract with a full procedure for service of notices and claims. Having substituted its own provisions it has waived the application of section 3813. <em>(Matter of Board of Educ. [Heckler Elec. Co.], </em>7 NY2d 476; <em>Matter of Guilderland Cent. School Dist. [Guilderland Cent. Teachers Assn.], </em>45 AD2d 85; <em>Matter of Board of Educ. [Wager Constr. Corp.], 37 </em>NY2d 283.) IV. If section 3813 is applicable to claims against the New York City board, the plaintiff's claim is not barred. The cases uniformly hold that where, as here, the contract requires a final certification of debits and credits by the agency, the claim accrues when that \"accounting\u201d has been prepared and communicated to the contractor. Although the claim first accrued on November 15, 1972, defendant\u2019s actions after that date which culminated in a new and different contract price in May, 1973, estops defendant from claiming the June, 1973 notice did not comply with the statute. <em>(Edlux Constr.

Subdivision 1 of section 3813 of the Education Law requires that plaintiff asserting a claim against the Board of Education of the City of New York present a verified notice of claim to the board within three months of the accrual of that claim. <em>(H &amp; J Floor Covering v Board of Educ., </em>66 AD2d 588; <em>Kramer v Board of Educ., </em>194 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Misc 128, 275 App Div 915; <em>Harman v Board of Educ., </em>196 Misc 287, 275 App Div 694, 300 NY 21; <em>Wakefield v Board of Educ., </em>192 Misc 639, 274 App Div 884, 299 NY 664; <em>Tomkins v Board of Educ., </em>56 AD2d 924; <em>Effective Communications West v Board of Coop Educational Servs. of Sole Supervisory Dist. of Cattaraugus, Erie &amp; Wyoming Counties, </em>57 AD2d 485; <em>Brooklyn Union Gas Co. v New York State Human Rights Appeal Bd., </em>41 NY2d 84.) II. The board is not estopped from asserting section 3813. <em>(Matter of Board of Educ. [Wager Constr. Corp.], </em>37 NY2d 283; <em>Camarella v East Irondequoit Cent. School Bd., 41 </em>AD2d 29, 34 NY2d 139; <em>Matter of Ciminera v Sahn, </em>32 Misc 2d 220, 4 AD2d 749, 4 NY2d 400; <em>State of New York v New York Movers Tariff Bur., </em>48 Misc 2d 225; <em>Welsh v Gindele &amp; Johnson, </em>50 AD2d 971; <em>Robinson v City of New York, </em>24 AD2d 260; <em>Bender v New York City Health &amp; Hosps.

Contractual provisions requiring plaintiff to give notice to the person delegated to supervise the work of this contract do not have the effect of waiving compliance with section 3813 of the Education Law. <em>(Matter of Board of Educ. [Heckler Elec. Co.], </em>7 NY2d 476; <em>Matter of Board of Educ. [Minstein Constr. Co.], </em>12 AD2d 40; <em>Matter of Board of Educ. [Wager Constr. Corp.], </em>45 AD2d 63, 37 NY2d 283.) IV. As found by the court below, plaintiff\u2019s delay claim accrued when plaintiff substantially completed its performance of the contract on September 12, 1972. Since plaintiff could ascertain its damages by that date and did not file a verified notice of claim within three months thereafter, its delay claim was properly dismissed. <em>(Matter of Board of Educ.

The work was substantially completed in September, 1972, and on November 15, 1972 the board of education approved the \"Final Certificate\u201d issued by its director of the bureau of construction and authorized final payment. Payment under the certificate and resolution apparently was made shortly after December 12, 1972. Thereafter the board issued several change orders increasing the contract price and on May 23, 1973 certified a total increase in the contract price of over $72,000. On June 13, 1973 Crescent filed a notice of claim seeking the contract balance, extras, and damages for delay in consequence of the board\u2019s alleged breach of its obligations under the contract. The first trial terminated in a mistrial on consent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">On the eve of the second trial and following settlement of two of the three claims asserted, the board of education moved to amend its answer to include an affirmative defense based on Crescent\u2019s alleged failure to serve a timely notice of claim as required by subdivision 1 of section 3813 of the Education Law and on said amendment for summary judgment dismissing the complaint as to the remaining claim for delay damages. Supreme Court, concluding that Crescent had filed its notice of claim in conformity with the requirements of subdivision 1, denied the motion to amend the answer and for summary judgment. The Appellate Division reversed on the law, agreeing that subdivision 1 of section 3813 was applicable but holding that the notice of claim had not been timely filed under that subdivision, and granted the board\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">On the appeal in our court, Crescent initially sought a reversal on any one or more of four grounds, arguing that only section 2562 and not subdivision 1 of section 3813 applied to claims against the New York City Board of Education, that in consequence of its alleged practice over 40 years not to rely on subdivision 1 of section 3813 the board was estopped to contend that that subdivision was applicable to Crescent\u2019s claim, that inasmuch as the board had promulgated a form contract specifying a particularized procedure for service of notices and claims it had waived any application of subdivision 1 of section 3813, and finally that, if subdivision 1 of section 3813 were applicable, Crescent\u2019s notice of claim had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>been timely filed within the requirements of that subdivision. In its reply brief and on oral argument in our court, Crescent, as it was entitled to do, expressly withdrew all reliance on the last three arguments and now relies for reversal only on the contention that as a matter of statutory interpretation the provisions of section 2562 exclusively apply to its present claim (as to which it appears to be conceded, at least for present purposes, that there has been compliance) and that the provisions of subdivision 1 of section 3813 are wholly inapplicable. There should be an affirmance; contrary to Crescent\u2019s arguments, in asserting its present claim it was obliged to comply with the requirements of both section 2562 and subdivision 1 of section 3813.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The texts of sections 2562 and 3813 are set forth in the appendix to this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The provisions of section 2562 and its predecessor sections of the Education Law have remained substantially the same since initial adoption in 1936. The section originally applied only to a board of education of a city having a population of one million or more and appears to have been enacted to grant to the New York City Board of Education the same rights and protection with respect to the presentment of and hearings on claims against the board that the city enjoyed with respect to claims against it. Under the section then as now the board was granted the right to examine any claimant under oath and no action could be brought on the claim until after the lapse of at least 30 days following presentment of the claim. For present purposes it is significant that the section has never contained any provision limiting the time within which a notice of claim must be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">In 1938 the predecessor section of present section 3813 was enacted. It had State-wide application and contained a provision similar to that of the 2562 section proscribing the institution of any action until the expiration of 30 days after presentment of the claim. It did not, however, include any counterpart of that portion of the 2562 section according the right of prelitigation examinations of claimants, nor did it contain any limitation of time within which notices of claim had to be presented. To avoid misunderstanding of the interrelation between the new 3813 section and the pre-existing 2562 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>section, the 1938 enactment contained the following provision: \"The provisions of this section, however, shall not supersede, alter or affect the provisions of section eight hundred sixty-eight-b of this chapter [the then predecessor of section 2562].\u201d In 1943 the 3813 section was amended to provide that notices of claim must be verified and introduced a wholly new period of limitation with respect to such notices, namely, a requirement that notice of the claim be presented within three months after accrual of the claim. There was also a minor editorial change to make it abundantly clear that the revised 3813 section was to apply State-wide to all boards of education. The same express nonsuperseder provision was continued, but again there was no counterpart provision with respect to prelitigation examination of claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">It is the submission of Crescent that, in consequence of the explicit stipulation that the provisions of the 3813 section \"shall not supersede, alter or affect the provisions\u201d of the 2562 section, none of the substantive provisions of section 3813 (and specifically for present purposes that imposing the three-month period of limitation for presentment of claims) apply to claims against the New York City Board of Education. We agree with both courts below that this argument must be rejected. The provisions of sections 3813 and 2562 are complementary, not inconsistent or incongruous. There is nothing in the operative provisions of either statute which forecloses application of the other. As to the 30-day waiting period there is a duplication. Section 2562 contains a provision authorizing prelitigation examinations of claimants for which section 3813 has no counterpart; section 3813 since 1943 has contained the three-month period of limitations for which there is no correspondent in section 2562. The nonsuperseder provision serves to preserve the concurrent application of both sections with respect to claims against the New York City Board of Education and to prescribe the transcendence of section 2562 if in any particular factual situation the provisions of the two sections collide.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">For the reasons stated, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Meyer concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">Education Law</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">\u00a7 2562.
