Defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered where the Trial Judge, in denying defendant\u2019s pretrial <em>Sandoval </em>motion, failed to consider and balance in any fashion whatever the factors this court has repeatedly held to be crucial to a lawful exercise of discretion, and in fact set forth on the record and applied its own criteria, which clearly contradicted the <em>Sandoval </em>parameters. <em>(People v Kennedy, </em>47 NY2d 196; <em>People v Davis, </em>44 NY2d 269; <em>People v Mayrant, </em>43 NY2d 236; <em>People v Caviness, </em>38 NY2d 227; <em>People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371; <em>People v Ocasio, </em>47 NY2d 55; <em>People v Rahman, </em>46 NY2d 882.) II. Defendant was denied his right to a public trial where the trial court twice sealed the courtroom upon the unsubstantiated representations of the Assistant District Attorney. <em>(People v Jones, </em>47 NY2d 409.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b580-14\"><em>Robert M.

The trial court properly ruled that defendant could be cross-examined at trial about prior acts which demonstrated his pronounced willingness to place his own self-interest ahead of the interests of society. <em>(People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371; <em>People v Duffy, </em>36 NY2d 258, 423 US 861; <em>People v Ocasio, </em>47 NY2d 55; <em>People v Hendrix, </em>44 NY2d 658; <em>People v Greer, </em>42 NY2d 170; <em>People v Brown, </em>48 NY2d 921; <em>People v Rahman, </em>46 NY2d 882; <em>People v Kennedy, </em>47 NY2d 196; <em>People v Davis, </em>44 NY2d 269; <em>People v Mayrant, </em>43 NY2d 236; <em>People v Caviness, </em>38 NY2d 227.) III. Defenant\u2019s claim that a hearing should have been held before a minority of the spectators was excluded from the courtroom does not present a question of law. <em>(People v Jones, </em>47 NY2d 409; <em>People v Hinton, </em>31 NY2d 71, 410 US 911; <em>People v Cona, </em>49 NY2d 26; <em>People v Tutt, </em>38 NY2d 1011; <em>People v Patterson, </em>39 NY2d 288, 432 US 197; <em>Matter of Gannett Co. v De Pasquale, </em>43 NY2d 370.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b581-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b581-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The record demonstrates that the trial court exercised its discretion when it ruled that the prosecution would be permitted to impeach the credibility of the defendant, if he took the stand, by confronting him with his prior criminal acts. Indeed, the court, in its opinion carefully balanced the probative worth of the tendered proof against the risk of prejudice and it cannot be said that the court\u2019s ruling which would have permitted cross-examination as to these acts constituted an abuse of discretion as a matter of law <em>(People v Mackey, </em>49 NY2d 274, 281; <em>People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371, 378).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">The position advanced by the dissent calls for a reaffirmation that our decision in <em>People v Sandoval </em>(34 NY2d 371, <em>supra) </em>did not change the pre-existing law as to the permitted scope of cross-examination for impeachment purposes (e.g., <em>People v Schwartzman, </em>24 NY2d 241, cert den 396 US 846; <em>People v Sorge, </em>301 NY 198). It prescribed a procedural vehicle by means of which a defendant could obtain an advance ruling as to the scope of cross-examination which would be permitted if he were to take the witness stand. The determination of that scope remained, as it always had been, committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>explored considerations pertinent to the exercise of that discretion; we did not, however, as the dissent suggests, mandate the application of any particular balancing process. We have subsequently indicated that in the usual case, appellate review of the exercise of discretion by the trial court in any particular instance ends in the intermediate appellate court <em>(People v Mackey, </em>49 NY2d 274, 281, <em>supra). </em>It is only when the ruling of the trial court has been based on an error of law in the <em>pre-Sandoval </em>sense that reversal in our court is warranted (e.g., <em>People v Davis, </em>44 NY2d 269 [Trial Judge in a <em>pre-Sandoval </em>case erroneously held that he was barred from exercising normal discretionary supervision of scope of cross-examination]; <em>People v Mayrant, </em>43 NY2d 236 [cross-examination as to prior violent acts admitted as evidence in chief to establish propensity to commit such acts]; cf. <em>People v Kennedy, </em>47 NY2d 196, 205 [\"considerations we reiterated in <em>People v Sandoval </em>(34 NY2d 371) for determining when such cross-examination should be allowed\u201d not applicable to convictions alone but applied as well to alleged immoral, vicious or criminal acts regardless of whether those acts resulted in convictions]).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Nor does the other issue tendered by defendant call for a reversal of his conviction. The attorney for the defendant voiced a general objection to the People\u2019s request to close the courtroom during the testimony of the undercover detective and an informant. However, defense counsel made no request for a hearing nor did she dispute the People\u2019s contention that the witnesses would be in danger if the general public was not excluded. Consequently it cannot be said that the court erred in granting the People\u2019s request for closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b582-7\">Meyer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acq\">(dissenting). There should be a reversal and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">On the <em>Sandoval </em>issue it is clear that the Trial Judge used the wrong criteria and thus did not properly exercise his discretion in determining the extent of permissible cross-examination <em>(People </em>v <em>Kennedy, </em>47 NY2d 196; <em>People v Davis, </em>44 NY2d 269; <em>People v Mayrant, </em>43 NY2d 236). Admission of evidence of prior crime on the issue of defendant\u2019s credibility has, as the majority notes, always been essentially a matter for the Trial Judge\u2019s discretion. But the thrust of <em>Sandoval </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>that because a jury may be led by such evidence to infer criminal propensity and convict a defendant in fact innocent of the particular crime, defendant is in effect denied his constitutional right to be a witness in his own behalf unless he knows before he takes the stand what evidence of prior crime he will face. <em>Sandoval </em>spells out the factors on which the determination turns: how long a time has elapsed, was the crime deliberate or one of impulse or addiction, how relevant is it on credibility. The hearing, mandated by <em>Sandoval </em>so that there can be appellate review of the Trial Judge\u2019s determination, is of little value if the issue can be decided by the Trial Judge in his unfettered discretion. The irreducible minimum is that the determination be made on a reasoned basis, measuring propensity for conviction against relation to credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Judged by that standard the hearing in this case failed to meet <em>Sandoval\u2019s </em>requirement that the Trial Judge consider both \"the interests of the People and the rights of the defendant\u201d <em>(People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371, 375). This is evident from his categorical statements, first, that \"As long as the crime involved does entail moral turpitude, it seems to me that the jury has a right to know about it\u201d; second, that he was not sympathetic to the argument that cross-examination about a crime which tended to indicate a predisposition could by its prejudicial effect outweigh its materiality, because that would reward one who specialized in a particular type of crime; and, third, that it would be misleading to the jury and unfair to the People to permit defense counsel to cross-examine the informant about past crimes and not have defendant similarly questioned. Since his denial of the <em>Sandoval </em>motion was \"for all of these reasons\u201d, it is clear that there was more dogma than discretion in the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">While the ruling closing the courtroom is more debatable, I would reverse as to that also. Defendant\u2019s attorney having objected, even though indicating that she was not sanguine of a favorable ruling, the court, in order to assure \"that the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial is not being sacrificed for less than compelling reasons\u201d <em>(People v Jones, </em>47 NY2d 409, 414-415), should have required the People to present more than the prosecutor\u2019s conclusory statement that \"I think it would be dangerous, if not to his health, to possible future investigations of this [undercover police] officer, to have the courtroom open\u201d.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b583-7\">Chief Judge Cooke</author>\n<p id=\"A8e\">(dissenting). I agree with the result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>reached by Judge Meyer in dissent, but do so only insofar as it rejects the notion that a defendant who objects to closure must also specifically request a hearing before the court is required to conduct an appropriate inquiry (see <em>People v Jones, </em>47 NY2d 409).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones and Wachtler concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion; Judge Meyer dissents and votes to reverse in an opinion in which Judge Fuchsberg concurs and in which Chief Judge Cooke concurs in part in a separate dissenting memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
