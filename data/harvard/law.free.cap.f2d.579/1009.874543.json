Appellants brought this action for declarative and injunctive relief to compel the Secretary to suspend enforcement of certain provisions of the <em>Official Standard Grades for Burley Tobacco (U.S. Type 31), </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 29.3001-29.3182 (1977), which require that burley tobacco sold at auction be tied into \u201chands\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> if it is to be graded by tobacco graders of the Grading Service of the U.S.D.A. Agricultural Marketing Service. Appellants contend that these regulations promulgated by the Secretary pursuant to the Tobacco Inspection Act of 1935, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 511 <em>et seq., </em>violate the purpose of the Act, are an unconstitutional usurpation by the Secretary of powers delegated to Congress by Article I of the Constitution, and violate appellants\u2019 due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. Burley \u25a0 tobacco which is not tied into hands, but is sold in \u201clooseleaf\u201d form, is not graded. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 29.3050, 29.3126 (1977). The parties agree that tobacco which does not have an official standard grade is not eligible to receive price support.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-15\">We conclude that Congress has by 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 511 delegated to the Secretary of Agriculture discretionary authority to set standards for the inspection of tobacco, <em>see Currin v. Wallace, </em>306 U.S. 1, 59 S.Ct. 379, 83 L.Ed. 441 (1939); <em>Greer v. Cline, </em>148 F.2d 380 (6th Cir. 1945), and the Secretary has exercised his discretion in deciding that burley U.S. No. 31 tobacco shall be graded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>only if marketed in tied hands. Appellants\u2019 constitutional challenges to the Secretary\u2019s regulations are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">We note that the regulations enacting the challenged grading standard have been in effect since 1959, and that similar regulations are in effect requiring tobacco graders to grade certain other types of tobacco only if they are marketed in tied hands.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We also note that the Secretary is now consulting pursuant to 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 511m with the Council for Burley Tobacco, which includes representatives of the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association, to determine the advisability of permitting looseleaf burley to receive official standard grades which would, in turn, make it eligible for the price support program. It appears that appellants sought to have the district court order the Secretary to amend or suspend enforcement of his regulations without regard to the administrative procedure currently being utilized by the Secretary to determine the propriety of just this result. Under these circumstances the district court properly declined to impose upon the Secretary its own notion of what would be correct procedures and appropriate regulations to follow. <em>See Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>435 U.S. 519, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">. \u201cA tied hand of burley tobacco consists of about 60-70 leaves (or about what can be held in one hand as the farmer \u2018strips\u2019 the tobacco leaves from the stalk.) The hand of tobacco is then tied with a tie leaf of tobacco and placed on a stick with other hands of tobacco. . . . Looseleaf tobacco . . . refers to tobacco which is brought to market either \u2018sheeted\u2019 or \u2018baled.\u2019 Sheeted tobacco refers to tobacco brought to market . . . in a burlap sack. Baled tobacco refers to tobacco brought to market in a tied bale.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 7-8 n.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1068-16\">.. Both parties support this proposition with a citation to \u201cThe Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1935, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 4, 7; Appellee\u2019s Br. at 8. However, it is the Agricultural Act of 1949 which is codified at 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1421-1449. Appellee\u2019s Br. at 13, A-3. This Act does not appear on its face to restrict price support for burley tobacco to burley tobacco which is sold in tied hands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1069-9\">. <em>E. g., </em>Maryland Broadleaf tobacco (U.S. Type 32), 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 29.3287, 29.3353; Dark Air Cured tobacco (U.S. Types 35, 36 and 37), 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 29.3541, 29.3625. <em>See </em>Appendix at 349.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
