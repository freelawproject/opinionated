BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b951-15\">The issue in this tax refund case is whether Gulf, Mobile &amp; Ohio Railroad Company (GM&amp;O) can receive a deduction for original issue discount on the exchange of debentures for its own preferred stock. Or, in other words, is this case distinguishable from <em>Commissioner v. National Alfalfa Dehydrating &amp; Milling Co., </em>1974, 417 U.S. 134, 94 S.Ct. 2129, 40 L.Ed.2d 717? The District Court held that a deduction for discount should be allowed, and we affirm. We disagree, however, with the lower court\u2019s measurement of the discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-16\">\n<em>The Bare Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b951-17\">The preferred stock involved in this exchange was originally issued in 1940 pursuant to a plan of reorganization for three railroads. The Mobile and Ohio Railroad Company, which had been operated by court appointed receivers since 1932, was combined with the Gulf, Mobile and Northern Railroad Company and the New Orleans Great Northern Railroad Company to form the GM&amp;O.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-18\">In 1956, GM&amp;O received permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to issue 5% income debentures to be exchanged on a voluntary basis for up to 283,438V4 shares of GM&amp;O\u2019s outstanding preferred stock. One income debenture in principal amount of $100 was to be traded for one share of preferred stock with a stated value of $100. GM&amp;O would then cancel the stock. The 5% interest on the income debentures was payable currently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>only if earned, and cumulative interest was limited to 15%. Dividends on the preferred stock were payable at the rate of $5 per share per annum declared by the board of directors and were cumulative, subject, however, to certain limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">GM&amp;O advised the ICC that the primary purpose of the exchange offer was to enable the corporation to save on taxes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Payment of interest on the debentures would be deductible, unlike the dividend payments on the preferred stock. The ICC approved the exchange, and subsequently, GM&amp;O issued a total of 187,116 income debentures in exchange for a like amount of shares of preferred stock from December 31,1957, through December 31,1962,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During this period, the preferred stock and income debentures were listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">GM&amp;O later filed for a tax refund for the years ending December 31, 1959 and 1961, based on a deduction for the amortizable bond discount arising from the exchange of the debentures for the preferred stock.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Discount of $6,842,507.56 was computed by subtracting the total market value of the preferred stock ($11,869,092.44) during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>exchange period<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from the total principal amount of the debentures ($18,711,600.00). The IRS disallowed the claim, and GM&amp;O filed this action for a refund. In a decision prior to <em>National Alfalfa, </em>the District Court held for the taxpayer, S.D.Ala., 1972, 339 F.Supp. 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">\n<em>Absolute Ban Rejected</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">In <em>National Alfalfa, </em>pursuant to a recapitalization plan to eliminate arrearages <em>on </em>preferred shares,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the taxpayer corporation required its shareholders to exchange their $50 par <em>5% </em>cumulative preferred shares for $50 face value 5% sinking fund debentures. The taxpayer claimed a discount on the difference between the fair market value of the stock and the face amount of the debentures. The Tenth Circuit held in favor of the taxpayer, but the Supreme Court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">The decision produced a flood of commentary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> All the authorities, unfortunately, as well as counsel in this case, agree that <em>National Alfalfa </em>is difficult to interpret, to say the least. But difficult or not, it is our duty \u2014 without divine prescience \u2014 to divine and then apply it.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-14\">The Government argues that <em>National Alfalfa </em>establishes an absolute rule that no discount can occur when a corporation issues bonds for its own preferred stock. The exchange of bonds for stock, the Government contends, is nothing more than an adjustment of the corporation\u2019s capital accounts in which no new capital is acquired. Discount can occur only if a corporation acquired new capital in exchange for its bonds. The assets side of the balance sheet must be adjusted before there can be discount. In a stock-for-bonds exchange, only the liability and equity accounts are altered.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-15\">The Government finds support for its argument in Part IV of <em>National Alfal</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>fa. This section does mention \u201cnew capital\u201d, but the gist of Part IV is concerned with whether the taxpayer incurred any additional cost for the use of capital.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, the Court earlier in the opinion stated that \u201cthe relevant inquiry in each case must be whether the issuer-taxpayer had incurred as a result of the transaction[s], some cost or expense of acquiring the use of capital.\u201d 417 U.S. at 147, 94 S.Ct. at 2136. In Part IV the Court explained that the transaction in <em>National Alfalfa </em>was merely a swap of one form of investment for another that was identical in every significant feature. The face amount of the debentures equalled the stated value of the stock; the fixed interest on the debentures was equal to the cumulative dividend on the preferred; and the sinking fund provisions for both the preferred and the debentures were comparable. <em>Id. </em>at 153-54, 94 S.Ct. 2129. The \u201ccost of the capital invested in the corporation was the same whether represented by the preferred or by the debentures, and was totally unaffected by the market value of the shares received at the time of the issuance of the debentures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154, 94 S.Ct. at 2140. Thus, the controlling test from <em>National Alfalfa </em>is whether \u201csome cost ... of acquiring the use of capital\u201d occurred, not whether additional capital was acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Our interpretation, furthermore, is supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s emphasis in Part III of the opinion on the failure to prove market values for the stock and debentures. The Court explained that the record in <em>National Alfalfa </em>did not indicate the cash price at which the debentures could have been sold in the market had they been offered for sale. Neither did the record reveal the price at which the stock could have been purchased in the impending exchange. The Court concluded that the \u201cclaimed fair market value of both securities is somewhat artificial since the exchange is effectively insulated from market forces by the intracorporate and private nature of the transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150, 94 S.Ct. at 2138. Consequently, \u201cthe requisite evaluation of the property to be exchanged cannot occur in this intracorporate transaction and debt discount cannot be determined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151, 94 S.Ct. at 2138.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the Government\u2019s \u201cnew capital\u201d test was adopted, Part III of <em>National Alfalfa </em>would be an exercise in futility. It would make little difference what factual proof of discount might be presented if no discount could arise in a bonds-for-stock exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">Along with the Second Circuit, therefore, we refuse to read <em>National Alfalfa </em>as establishing an absolute ban on discount when a corporation exchanges its bonds for its own preferred stock. <em>Cities Service Co. v. United States, </em>2 Cir., 1974, 522 F.2d 1281, <em>cert. denied, </em>1975, 423 U.S. 827, 96 S.Ct. 43, 46 L.Ed.2d 43.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Cities Service, </em>the corporate taxpayer, a public utility, was required to simplify its capital structure under the so-called \u201cdeath sentence\u201d provision of \u00a7 11(e) of the Holding Company Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 79k(e). The reorganization plan, which was approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, provided for the issuance of new debentures in exchange for all of Cities preferred stock. The aggregate face amount of the new debentures was equal to the stated value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>the preferred, plus the call premiums and the dividend arrearages that had been accumulated over 14 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The Second Circuit held that a discount should be allowed because Cities incurred an additional cost for the use of capital. First, the face amount of the' debentures was greater than the stated value of the preferred, and second, the original issue price of the preferred stock was less than the face amount of the debentures. 522 F.2d at 1288. Thus, the preferred shares and the debentures were not identical as they were in <em>National Alfalfa. </em>Market values for the stock and the debentures also were readily available in <em>Cities Service </em>since both were traded on market exchanges.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">\n<em>Does It Smell Like Alfalfa?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">Three significant distinctions set this case apart from <em>National Alfalfa. </em>First, as in <em>Cities Service, </em>the original value received by GM&amp;O for each preferred share was less than the face amount of the debentures. The District Court, after a thorough examination of the evidence, found that the original consideration for the preferred stock was approximately $9.50 to $11.00 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">The Government argues that the District Court should have accepted the 1939 ICC finding that the consideration received for each preferred share was its stated value of $100.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The District Court in this tax case, however, is not inextricably bound by the ICC\u2019s valuation of a particular stock in a railroad reorganization, especially if it is found that the Commission did not consider all relevant factors. The lower court explained that the ICC valuation \u201cwas based upon the book value of the assets being purchased by the GM&amp;O. While an evaluation of assets at the time of the exchange might be persuasive to the court, a valuation based upon the generally unrealistic book value is deemed to be of little or no probative value and is not persuasive here.\u201d R. at 258. In <em>Cities Service, </em>for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission had determined that the exchange of debentures for preferred stock was \u201cfair and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>equitable to all parties and the debentures were the \u2018equitable equivalent\u2019 of the rights surrendered,\u201d but the District Court refused to accept the finding that the debentures were worth their face value at the time of issuance. <em>Cities Service Co. v. United States, </em>S.D.N.Y., 1970, 316 F.Supp. 61, 68 (Mansfield, J.). Even in a railroad merger, the ICC\u2019s overall findings on valuation are still subject to challenge, e. g., <em>Schwabacher v. United States, </em>1948, 334 U.S. 182, 201-02, 68 S.Ct. 958, 92 L.Ed. 1305, 1317 (ICC valuation rejected in a rail merger because Commission failed to consider rights of minority shareholders under state law). The District Court based its finding of the original issue price on substantial evidence, including market prices of the stocks, the earnings record of the constituent corporations, the value of assets received, and even an Internal Revenue Service report on the value of the assets in the GM&amp;O merger.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We do not find the District Court\u2019s conclusion clearly erroneous within the meaning of F.R.Civ.P. 52(a). And since the original value received for the preferred shares was much less than the $100 face amount of the bonds, there was an additional cost for the use of capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">GM&amp;O also incurred a cost of borrowing for a second reason. In the Exchange Offer to the shareholders, GM&amp;O explains that, unlike the preferred stock, the debentures would give holders the benefit of a sinking fund.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although to some investors this distinction may seem insignificant, the Supreme Court in <em>National Alfalfa </em>stated that the change in the corporate structure in that case was inconsequential, in part, because the \u201csinking fund provisions for both the preferred and the debentures were comparable.\u201d 417 U.S. at 154, 94 S.Ct. at 2139.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Since in this case only the debentures have a sinking fund provision, the exchange of debentures for the preferred stock was not a mere \u201csubstitution\u201d of one form for another that \u201cdid not create an obligation to pay in excess of an amount previously committed.\u201d id.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Instead, GM&amp;O at least to this extent incurred an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>additional cost for the use of capital by requiring a sinking fund for the debentures only.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this case is distinguishable from <em>National Alfalfa </em>because the exchange of debentures for preferred stock was completely voluntary and was affected by market forces.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In <em>National Alfalfa, </em>an amendment to the articles of incorporation required the preferred shareholders to exchange their shares for debentures or else have \u201call rights and privileges\u201d cease. <em>National Alfalfa, </em>10 Cir., 1973, 472 F.2d 796, 798 n.l. The Supreme Court emphasized that the \u201ccost of the capital invested in the corporation was . . . totally unaffected by the market value of the shares received at the time of the issuance of the debentures.\u201d 417 U.S. at 154, 94 S.Ct. at 2140. Indeed, even in <em>Cities Service, </em>the exchange transaction was insulated to some extent from the market because it was required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">In this case, however, while perhaps hoping for but without expecting all shareholders to participate, GM&amp;O made an offer to sell, in effect, its debentures at a certain price, i. e., a stipulated amount of preferred stock.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Both the stock and the debentures were traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The market values for these two GM&amp;O obligations could be determined by anyone with a <em>Wall Street Journal. </em>We could assume that stockholders chose to participate in the exchange out of kindness for GM&amp;O. Where market prices are clear, however, and the exchange is voluntary, it is economically more logical to assume that before deciding to trade the preferred shareholders compared the value of their stock to the value of the debentures in light of market prices and their own personal preferences. Some preferred shareholders then decided to trade, some did not. In fact, as late at 1971, over 63,000 preferred shares still had not been exchanged.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, unlike the transaction in <em>National Alfalfa </em>that was insulated from market forces, the success of this exchange was influenced by the \u201cexigencies of the competitive money market.\u201d 417 U.S. at 151, 94 S.Ct. at 2138.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">\n<em>Measure For Measure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">In a sale of debentures for cash, discount is measured by the difference in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>the face amount of the debentures and their issue price. In a free market exchange of bonds for property, however, the issue price of the debenture should equal the market value of what the corporation got for the debenture.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In this case, GM&amp;O gave up one debenture to obtain one share of preferred stock. The market value of the preferred share, therefore, should correspond to the issue price of the debenture.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">In <em>Cities Service </em>the Second Circuit directed the District Court on remand to determine the issue price by the market value of the debentures, rather than the market value of the preferred stock.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Court explained that \u201can equivalence in value of the debentures and preferred shares might be assumed if the debentures were issued for cash and/or property in the marketplace,\u201d 522 F.2d at 1290, but it concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUgv\">Any assumption of an equivalence of the debentures and the preferred is unjustified where the transaction is insulated from the marketplace since the market forces which normally would bring about an equivalence of the two are absent. Here there is no proof that the two were equal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-13\"><em>Id. </em>In <em>Cities Service </em>the amount of securities the preferred shareholders received in exchange for the debentures was determined after SEC hearings and bargaining of the parties. But each preferred shareholder had no choice about accepting the final formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">In contrast, the voluntary exchange in this case was influenced by the market. The holders of preferred shares could examine the published market prices for both the preferred and the debentures before deciding to trade. Thus, the market value of the preferred shares is a good yardstick for determining the real issue price of the debentures.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>\n<em>Jousting In The NYSE Lists</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">GM&amp;O questions, however, the lower court\u2019s determination of the value of the preferred shares. The parties stipulated that the preferred stock was actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The mean NYSE price during the exchange period was $55.25 per share.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Taxpayer\u2019s expert, however, fixed the fair market value during the exchange period at $70.00 per share, while the government expert estimated the value at $121.58 per share. The trial court \u201cin consideration of the equities between the taxpayer and the stock holders\u201d adjusted the fair market value for the purpose of calculating the bond discount to $80.00 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">GM&amp;O argues that the District Court should not have increased the price of the stock over and above the price that it traded at on the NYSE. The lower court ruled that the fair market value of the preferred shares was higher than the NYSE price because the stockholders were unaware of the tax implications of the exchange at the time the debentures were issued.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We believe, however, that ignoring market quotations is inconsistent with <em>National Alfalfa.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">The market provides a forum for the economic forces of supply and demand to act upon goods, such as securities, to determine objectively how much of one is worth so much of another. The market performs that function at maximum efficiency when each entrant is entirely free to participate or not. In <em>National Alfalfa </em>the Supreme Court, after listing several factors that affect the value of securities, stated: \u201c[Normally, the market itself performs this evaluative process.\u201d 417 U.S. at 151, 94 S.Ct. at 2138. <em>National Alfalfa </em>then was \u201cintended to avoid the very type of \u2018battle of experts\u2019 on the nebulous issue of market value which took place in this case.\u201d <em>Fed-Mart Corp. v. United States, </em>S.D.Cal., 1975, 75-2 U.S.T.C. \u00b6 9531 at 87,558, <em>aff\u2019d, </em>9 Cir., 1978, 572 F.2d 235. When market quotations are available, as in our case, they should be the sole criterion for determining the value of a bond discount. Besides, discount results from the cost of borrowing at the <em>time of issuance </em>of the debentures. If later, the parties discover that the price was wrong because of the tax implications, no one should suffer a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>In summary, we hold: (i) GM&amp;O is entitled to a deduction for discount on the exchange of debentures for its preferred stock, (ii) The amount of discount should be measured by the difference between the principal amount of the debentures and the fair market value of the preferred stock as determined by the mean NYSE price during the exchange period. We remand for the District Court to make the necessary calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-11\">. Under the reorganization plan, a committee of the Mobile &amp; Ohio (M&amp;O) receivership acquired the properties of M&amp;O by foreclosure. These properties were then conveyed to the recently organized GM&amp;O. The Gulf, Mobile and Northern (GM&amp;N) then consolidated with GM&amp;O. Holders of GM&amp;N preferred and common stock received preferred and common stock of GM&amp;O. The New Orleans Great Northern, which was controlled under a lease by GM&amp;N, was not merged with GM&amp;O, but its debenture holders were offered GM&amp;O preferred stock, and its common stockholders were offered GM&amp;O common stock. See <em>Gulf, M. &amp; O. R.R. Merger, </em>1939, 236 I.C.C. 61, 68-71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b952-5\">.

See note 21, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b952-7\">. The Internal Revenue Code at the time of this exchange did not specifically provide for a deduction for discount on the exchange of bonds for preferred stock. Section 163(a) of the Code, however, did allow corporations and individuals to deduct all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 163(a). The regulations pertaining to this statute stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-8\">If bonds are issued by a corporation at a discount, the net amount of such discount is deductible and should be prorated or amortized over the life of the bonds. For purposes of this section, the amortizable bond discount equals the excess of the amount payable at maturity (or, in the case of a callable bond, at the earlier call date) over the issue price of the bond.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.163(a). The parties agree that if the debentures had been issued for cash, in the amount of the selling price of the preferred stock at the time of exchange, the discount would be proper under the relevant statutes and regulations. 339 F.Supp. at 490. Thus, GM&amp;O argues that the preferred stock-for-bonds exchange should be treated the same as a cash-for-bonds transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">In 1969, Congress amended the Internal Revenue Code to clarify the result on an exchange of bonds for property. The statute defined issue price for bonds and other evidence of indebtedness that were exchanged for property after May 27, 1969. Tax Reform Act of 1969, Pub.L. 91-172, \u00a7 413(b), 83 Stat. 611. The relevant statute now provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX2S\">In the case of a bond or other evidence of indebtedness, or an investment unit as described in this paragraph (other than a bond or other evidence of indebtedness or an investment unit issued pursuant to a plan of reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1) or an insolvency reorganization . . ,), which is issued for property and which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-15\">(A) is part of an issue a portion of which is traded on an established securities market, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-16\">(B) is issued for stock or securities which are traded on an established securities market,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-17\">the issue price of such bond or other evidence of indebtedness or investment unit, as the case may be, shall be the fair market value of such property. Except in cases to which the preceding sentence applies, the issue price of a bond or other evidence of indebtedness (whether or not issued as a part of an investment unit) which is issued for property (other than money) shall be the stated redemption price at maturity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-18\">26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1232(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-19\">Since the debentures in this case were issued before 1969, the amended statute does not apply. Nevertheless, we think it is appropriate to mention that the considered legislative judgment is now to recognize bond discount in non-cash exchanges. The legislative history also shows that Congress regarded the amendment more as a clarification measure than an innovative one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-20\">In order to clarify the situations in which original issue discount may arise, the bill further provides that there may be original issue discount when a corporation issues a bond for a price less than its face value whether it receives cash, stock, or other property (including the assets of another corporation) for the bond. In the case where a bond is issued for property, it is provided that the issue price of the bond is to be the fair market value of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-21\">S.Rep.No. 91-552, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., [1969] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 2027, 2180.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-22\">The Government argues, however, that under the present statute no discount would be allowed in this case because the exchange is a \u201creorganization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1).\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1232(b)(2).

The Government contends that our decision in <em>Claussen\u2019s, Inc. v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1972, 469 F.2d 340, supports its \u201cnew capital\u201d test for bond discount. In <em>Claussen\u2019s, </em>a recapitalization plan provided that each share of common stock would be exchanged for (i) one-third share of new common, (ii) a stock purchase warrant for two-thirds share of new common, and (iii) one $10 face value 6% debenture. This Court disallowed any claim for discount on the issuance of the debentures because \u201cthere was no \u2018borrowing\u2019 sufficient to give rise to bond discount.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344. We distinguished the transaction, however, from an exchange of bonds for <em>preferred </em>stock.

In <em>Fed-Mart </em>debentures were issued in return for outstanding common stock. The taxpayer claimed a discount for the difference between the face value of the debentures and their fair market value at the time of issuance. Although the District Court rejected the claim, it implicitly endorsed the idea that such a discount could arise under the proper facts. The taxpayer in <em>Fed-Mart, </em>however, failed to prove the market value of the debentures, which were not actively traded. Experts testified on their value, but the Court held the testimony to be mere \u201cspeculation.\u201d The District Court also found an absence of additional cost of capital since an exchange of debentures for common stock would increase the issuer\u2019s financial leverage and earnings and result in a savings on capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">In affirming the lower court, the Ninth Circuit held that, regardless of the \u201cpropriety of allowing a deduction for debt discount in cases involving an exchange of debentures for the issuer\u2019s own stock,\u201d discount could not occur in this case because market values were a matter of \u201cpure speculation.\u201d 572 F.2d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">The Eighth Circuit in a brief discussion on whether collateral estoppel barred a taxpayer from relitigating a debt discount issue also mentioned that under <em>National Alfalfa </em>discount is possible \u201cif the net amount received by the corporation upon original issue of the old bonds or stock <em>was less than </em>the maturity value of the new bonds.\u201d <em>United States v.

United States, </em>1970, 433 F.2d 1324, 193 Ct.Cl. 257, the taxpayer claimed a discount on the exchange of bonds for preferred stock in a railroad reorganization. The ICC specifically found that a preferred share \u201cworth $250\u201d was the \u201cequitable equivalent\u201d of a bond with a maturity value of $216. The Court of Claims accepted that finding and refused to allow any discount because the bonds and shares were equivalent when exchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-15\">In this case, however, we are not faced with a specific ICC finding in 1957 that the debentures were equivalent to the preferred stock. Instead, the lower court had to determine whether an ICC finding in 1939 that the stated value of a preferred share was $100 means that the preferred share is equivalent to a debenture issued in 1957 with a maturity value of $100. Even under <em>Missouri Pacific, </em>it is unclear how the Commission would resolve this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b956-4\">.

We recognize that some exchanges involving preferred shareholders are only euphemistically styled as \u201cvoluntary.\u201d If, for instance, preferred stock has accumulated large arrears of undeclared and unpaid dividends, it is not uncommon for corporations to offer to exchange the old preferred for new preferred shares that have no arrears but have a claim to future dividends prior to that of the old preferred. If future earnings are expected to be sufficient to pay only dividends on the prior preferred, the old preferred will be forced to convert or else receive nothing.

Before computing the discount, the District Court applied a two-tier test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-11\">The measurement of bond discount shall be the difference between the issue price originally received by taxpayer for the preferred stock and the par value of the bonds, except if it can be shown that the fair market value of the preferred stock at the time of the exchange was greater than the issue price. Then, the bond discount shall be the difference between the fair market value of the preferred stock and the par value of the bonds. Provided however, that no bond discount shall exist if either the issue price or the fair market value of the preferred stock exceeds the par value of the bonds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-17\">339 F.Supp. at 498. This standard has been called the two-tier approach because it considers both the original consideration for the preferred stock and its fair market value at the time of the exchange. The test was first formulated in the initial District Court opinion in <em>Cities Service, </em>S.D.N.Y., 1970, 316 F.Supp. 61. The theory behind this approach is that discount arises only if the corporation actually suffers a cost for the use of capital. Thus, if the original consideration for the preferred stock equals the face amount of the debentures or if the preferred stock had a fair market value at the time of exchange equal to the face amount of the debentures, no cost will be incurred by the corporation and hence no debt discount will arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-18\">In this case, the original consideration for the preferred stock was much less than the face amount of the debentures or the market value of the preferred. As already explained, the District Court found that the original consideration for the stock was between $9.50 and $11.00, and its market value when exchanged was $80. Thus, the amount of discount was the difference between the $100 face amount of the debenture and its issue price as represented by the $80 market value of the preferred stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-19\">The idea, however, that discount is dependent on the original consideration for the stock is criticized for conflicting with the theory that discount is a cost of borrowing, e. g., Georgia Note, note 11, <em>supra </em>at 1002-03. Indeed, the Government argues, in the alternative, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>original value of the preferred \u2014 at least seventeen years before it was exchanged for the debentures \u2014 is not relevant to determine the here and now cost of borrowing. The only test, if any, should be the difference in the face amount of the bond and its issue price.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">This argument is now academic. We have already held that the original value of the stock was much less than the face amount of the debentures. Thus, even under the two-tier approach, the test will now be the difference in the face amount of the bond and its issue price as determined by the market value of the preferred stock.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b959-8\">.

The District Court opinion on valuation states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-16\">Apparently, the taxpayer did not anticipate a bond discount savings at the time of the exchange nor until two or three years had elapsed thereafter. It is clear the stockholders were not informed and did not anticipate a possible tax liability to them in the event of a bond discount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-17\">An additional factor stressed by the Government must enter into a figure of fair market value in this case. Any bond discount granted to the taxpayer could result in ordinary income and therefore additional tax liability of the shareholders who participated in the exchange. This created an upward thrust to the fair market value of the stock most difficult to assess. These equities between the taxpayer and the stockholders must not be overlooked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-18\">R. at 261-62.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
