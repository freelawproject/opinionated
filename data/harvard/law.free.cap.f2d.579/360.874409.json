On appeal he challenges the jury instructions and the sufficiency of the evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-28\">There was conflicting testimony, but with all inferences drawn in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>government there was testimony to support the following summary of the facts. Evans was the interim director for the Mississippi Delta Catfish Corporation, an OEO-sponsored program which hoped to promote catfish farming among low-income farmers in Mississippi. The first stage in the corporation\u2019s plan called for the purchase of a large number of one-year-old catfish (called fingerlings). The two checks upon which the indictment was based were written at Evans\u2019 direction, ostensibly to purchase fingerlings. One check, for $85,000, was made payable to T. C. Ashmore, a man who worked for Evans but who owned no fish of his own. The other check, for $58,000, was made payable to W. A. Baker, who did own a catfish farm. No fingerlings were ever delivered to the corporation. Instead, the first check was used to pay Evans\u2019 existing debt to the Production Credit Association of Pine Bluff Arkansas. The other check was used by Evans to purchase the catfish farm from Baker. Thus, with the inferences drawn in favor of the government, the evidence established that Evans had obtained the checks, and used the proceeds for his own benefit, without the knowledge of the corporation\u2019s board of directors. That evidence is sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty under section 2314.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Evans\u2019 challenge to the jury instructions focuses on the definitions of \u201cconverted\u201d and \u201ctaken by fraud.\u201d The trial court told the jury that \u201cconverted\u201d meant \u201cto appropriate dishonestly or illegally to one\u2019s own use anything of value.\u201d \u201cFraud\u201d was defined as \u201can intentional misrepresentation concealment, or nondisclosure for the purpose of inducing another, in reliance upon it, to part with something of value or surrender a legal right.\u201d Evans contends that under section 2314 \u201cconverted\u201d means only illegal takings. So, he argues, the trial court erred when it included the notion of a dishonest taking. Furthermore, he contends that the trial court was mistaken when it failed to instruct the jury that to \u201ctake by fraud\u201d required that damage be done to the defrauded party. Here, however, since the corporation received value for its checks there could be no taking by fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The last contention is but a restatement of the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. We need not decide whether it is necessary that the government prove that the defrauded property party was deprived of property. <em>Cf. United States v. Benson, </em>548 F.2d 42 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Danise v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 910, 97 S.Ct. 1185, 51 L.Ed.2d 588 (1977), for here there was sufficient evidence to show that the corporation paid money without receiving fingerlings. The corporation was therefore damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Assuming, without deciding, that a proper objection was made by Evans to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury (Fed.R. Crim.P. 30), Evans\u2019 challenges to those instructions are without merit. As this court said in <em>Lyda v. United States, </em>279 F.2d 461 (5th Cir. 1960), the language <em>of </em>section 2314 \u201creflects a congressional purpose to reach all ways by which an owner is wrongfully deprived of the use or benefits of the use of his property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464. This court has itself used the term \u201cdishonest\u201d in explaining the scope of the statute. <em>United States v. McClain, </em>545 F.2d 988, 995 (5th Cir. 1977). Finally, the trial court did instruct the jury that it must find that the corporation had been induced to \u201cpart with something of value or surrender a legal right.\u201d There was no error in instructing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
