Continental Casualty Co., </em>393 U.S. 145, 89 S.Ct. 337, 21 L.Ed.2d 301 (1968), to disclose information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>that might create an impression of bias. The losing party in an arbitration proceeding, Marc Rich &amp; Co., A.G., appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Charles L. Brieant, J., confirming the arbitration award and directing Marc Rich to pay Andros Compa\u00f1\u00eda Mar\u00edtima, S.A. the sum of $109,028.40. Marc Rich argues that the district judge denied it an adequate opportunity to present its claim that the arbitrators had not made the required full disclosure. Appellant also contends that the arbitration award should not be enforced, because it disregards the essence of the agreement between the parties. For reasons indicated below, we reject these contentions and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The controversy arises out of a charter party, dated at London, July 30, 1974, between Andros as \u201cdisponent owner\u201d of the tanker Kissavos<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Marc Rich, under which the latter chartered the tanker to carry a cargo of crude oil from West Africa to two ports on the Peruvian coast. Marc Rich agreed to pay demurrage (charges for excessive time used by the charterer in loading and discharging cargo) at a rate of $5,606.25 per day for all time expended in excess of allowed laytime of 72 hours. In accordance with instructions, the vessel carried the cargo to Peru, but was kept at the two ports well beyond the allowed lay-time. Because of the delay, Andros claimed $116,037.70 in demurrage against Marc Rich, which made partial payment but disputed its liability for the balance, some $90,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">In \u00e9arly 1975, under the arbitration clause of the charter,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Andros appointed Mr. Philip Moyles and Marc Rich named Captain George Stam as arbitrators. They, in turn, selected Mr. Manfred Arnold, manager of the Maritime Division, National Bank of North America, as the chairman of the arbitration panel. Captain Stam died before the arbitration commenced, and Marc Rich selected Mr. Jack Berg in his place.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">At the first arbitration hearing, which Moyles was unable to attend, both Berg and Arnold made preliminary statements, apparently with a view toward complying with the Maritime Arbitration Rules of the Society of Maritime Arbitrators, Inc. (1974) (the Rules).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Their disclosures were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-16\">\u201cMr. Berg. I am personally familiar with Andros Compa\u00f1\u00eda Mar\u00edtima. As a matter of fact, this afternoon I have been chairman of an arbitration panel in which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>were one of the disputants. I don\u2019t recognize Marc Rich &amp; Company at all. \u201cI am a corporate officer of Continental Grain Company and it is possible that in the course of their day-to-day business they have had business connections with either or both of these parties, and, as a matter of fact, it is possible that they have had business dealings with Andros in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\">\u201cI have never been personally involved in any of these business arrangements nor have had any problems which may have arisen from them. I know both attorneys here today. I have been appointed to arbitration [panels] in which they have represented disputants [before] the Panel. I have been appointed by both on various occasions. As far as I know my firm has had no business connections with either of the law firms involved here today. \u201cI have sat on a number of panels with Mr. Arnold in the past, and I know him quite well personally. We are both on the Board of Governors of the Society of Maritime Arbitrators.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">\u201cI do not know Mr. Moyles. I don\u2019t believe we have ever met although I would reserve judgment until after I see him.\u201d \u201cI know no other reason why I could not sit on this Panel and render a fair and impartial decision based on the evidence presented here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">* * * f: * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">\u201cThe Chairman [Mr. Arnold]. I have not had any business dealings with the owners in this case. I have been involved in arbitrations and I was appointed by And-ros as arbitrator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">\u201cI do not recognize the name of Charterers, Marc Rich. It could possibly be that my employer, National Bank of North America, might have had [some] dealings with either party of which, however, I would be unfamiliar and actually had no participation in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">\u201cAs far as the attorneys are concerned, this is the first time I meet Mr. Thoma-jan. I have not had any dealings with [his] firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-11\">\u201cI have been involved in various arbitra-tions and I am still involved with arbitra-tions in which the firm of Healy &amp; Baillie is representing disputants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-12\">\u201cMr. Berg has commented on our acquaintance. As to Mr. Moyles, I have known Mr. Moyles for possibly five or six years, stemming from the time when he was with Haight, Gardner and I was involved in an arbitration in which Mr. Moyles represented a disputant. Neither I nor my employer had had any business dealings with [his] law firm as such. \u201cI do not feel that any connection or relation which might exist would impede me from hearing this case and rendering a just and fair award.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">After each arbitrator finished, the attorney for Marc Rich stated that he had no questions or objections. The attorney for And-ros made a similar statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-14\">At the beginning of the second hearing,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moyles stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-15\">\u201cI am a member of the firm of Freehill, Hogan &amp; Mahar. Prior to joining that firm in January of this year I was a member of Fuller, Lawton &amp; Moyles. \u201cAt the time that I was appointed arbitrator, I was with the Fuller, Lawton &amp; Moyles firm; although I think all the documents at the first hearing were held subsequent to my joining the Freehill firm as partner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-16\">\u201cI know Mr. Connell on a professional basis, having had cases against his firm over the years. I know Mr. Arnold, having had cases where I presented matters to arbitrations of which he was a member. And I have a case presently pending on behalf of a client before a panel of arbitrators of which Mr. Berg is a member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-17\">\u201cI do not know either of the parties to this dispute and I have never represented either party to this suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-18\">\u201cPrior to our convening here today, I had not met with Mr. Thomajan or Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Langlios [attorney assisting Mr. Thoma-jan] or the young lady with them, Miss Haskins.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">\u201cI know of no reason why I cannot sit as a member of this panel, and I know of no reason why I cannot make a true and honest determination based upon the testimony and documents presented by each side with respect to the dispute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Again, Marc Rich\u2019s counsel (as well as An-dro\u2019s) had no questions or objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">At the arbitration hearings, we are told, Andros produced two witnesses and submitted 67 exhibits; Marc Rich produced no witnesses and 15 exhibits. The principal focus of the controversy was whether the conceded delay in unloading the tanker had been caused by a deficiency in the ship\u2019s discharge pumps or by other causes for which the ship could not be held responsible. In an award dated September 30,1977, Arbitrators Arnold and Moyles found in favor of Andros for the entire balance due ($88,178.97 plus $20,849.43 interest) for a total of $109,028.40. Arbitrator Berg dissented in part.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">In October 1977, Andros petitioned the district court for an order confirming the arbitration award. Shortly thereafter, without making a motion to vacate or challenge the award, Marc Rich noticed depositions of all three arbitrators, to be held eight days later in the office of counsel for Marc Rich. The notices did not indicate why the arbitrators were being summoned for examination, except that the notice to Arnold warned that Marc Rich intended to subpoena the following: At the time, Lloyd C. Nelson was president of Orion &amp; Global Chartering Co., Inc., the New York brokers and agents for Andros, which in turn was the managing agent for the registered owners of the Kissavos.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\">All documents in [Mr. Arnold\u2019s] possession, custody or control, evidencing or reflecting business dealings and social relationships between [Mr. Arnold] or his employer, National Bank of North America, and Orion &amp; Global Chartering Co., Inc., and any of its affiliated companies or Lloyd C. Nelson.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">The matter was assigned to Judge Brieant, and with commendable dispatch the judge called the attorneys before him to cut through a potentially complicated procedural tangle. The subpoenas were quashed, and Marc Rich was directed to move to vacate the arbitration award. The judge advised the parties that if the papers revealed \u201ca legitimate disputed factual issue\u201d concerning the adequacy of disclosure, Mr. Arnold would be called to testify in court under the judge\u2019s \u201cdirect supervision and control and briefly and quickly . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">In short order, Marc Rich did move to vacate. On the issue of disclosure, it submitted affidavits of its lawyers, one from George L. Graff, who did not participate in the arbitration proceeding, and the other from Robert Thomajan, who represented Marc Rich at the arbitration. The Graff affidavit alleged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-14\">we have recently learned that Mr. Arnold has had a close personal and professional relationship with Lloyd C. Nelson, one of the principals of Orion &amp; Global, the firm which actually operates the vessel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-15\">The Thomajan affidavit alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-16\">I discussed the [arbitration] decision, after it came down, with our client and with members of the maritime community. In the course of the inquiry, I learned that Mr. Nelson and Mr. Arnold were close friends and served together on many panels. That relationship was never disclosed nor hinted at in the course of the arbitration proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-17\">Only the Graff affidavit purported to disclose any concrete basis for the claims that Arnold and Nelson \u201cwere close friends\u201d or had \u201ca close personal and professional relationship\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Following [the arbitration award], we undertook an exhaustive review of approximately 1200 published awards of the Society of Maritime Arbitrators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-4\">Our review of those awards indicated that Mr. Arnold has sat as the neutral arbitrator on 19 panels since 1975. In 12 of those cases, one of the arbitrators who selected him was Lloyd C. Nelson. Of the remaining cases, one involved And-ros \u2014 the same owner as in this case \u2014 and, in another, Healy &amp; Baillie also represented the owner and the charterer defaulted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">In all but one of the cases in which Mr. Arnold was chairman and Mr. Nelson a member (the exception being a case in which the owner admitted liability), Mr. Arnold cast his vote, and carried the panel for the party who nominated Mr. Nelson. Indeed, in each of the 19 occasions when they have sat together on the same panel, Mr. Nelson and Mr. Arnold have voted together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">Needless to say, it would be impossible \u2014 and unnecessary \u2014 to establish that Mr. Arnold\u2019s vote in the instances in which Mr. Nelson was involved was influenced by Mr. Nelson. Yet, an adversary party of Mr. Nelson\u2019s would certainly want to know of such a relationship before submitting his case to Mr. Arnold as the neutral chairman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">We have no desire, nor do we, accuse Mr. Arnold of bias or improper conduct. It is precisely to avoid the need to consider such unseemly questions that the Supreme Court has established the <em>Commonwealth Coatings </em>requirement for complete disclosure before the arbitration takes place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">In reply, Andros submitted affidavits of its counsel, Raymond A. Connell, and of Lloyd C. Nelson, president of Orion. These affidavits stated \u2014 and it now seems conceded \u2014 that Orion is the agent for Andros in the United States and has been for more than 20 years;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that Nelson has no equity interest in Orion but has been in its employ for over 28 years, and is currently its president; that Orion appointed the local port agents for the Kissavos in Peru; and that Orion\u2019s involvement with Andros was apparent in the papers submitted at the arbitration. More significantly, Nelson swore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-10\">Over the course of more than twenty years I have served as arbitrator in scores of New York maritime arbitrations, and I have been a member of the Society of Maritime Arbitrators for more than 13 years. In my capacity as arbitrator I must have sat on panels with most members of the New York maritime community who are willing to serve as arbitrator and who are chosen to serve by those involved in a maritime dispute. Insofar as the KISSAVOS panel is concerned, both Mr. Jack Berg and Mr. Manfred Arnold are members of the Society of Maritime Arbitrators and I have served on many panels with both of those arbitrators, and, on occasion, all three of us have sat on the same panel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-11\">I first met Mr. Arnold in or about August of 1973 when we happened to be members of the same arbitration panel, and since then there have been other panels on which we have served together. Insofar as my contact with Mr. Arnold is concerned, it is limited to those instances where we happen to be members of the same panel and to occasions associated with our memberships in the Society of the Maritime Arbitrators. Neither Mr. Arnold nor his employer, National Bank of North America, have any business of financial relationship of whatsoever nature with either Orion or Andros, and insofar as I am aware there is no reasonable potential for such a relationship developing in the future. Moreover, there is no social relationship at all. I have never been to Mr. Arnold\u2019s home and he has never been to mine; our wives have never met save for one chance meeting at an affair hosted by the Maritime Law Association two years ago; my calendar indicates that aside from actual arbitration hearings and deliberations, I have had lunch with Mr. Arnold on nine occa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>sions since January 1st of this year and all nine occasions were either, for the purpose of discussing our Society\u2019s work or to deliberate on a decision on an arbitration, and on almost all of these occasions other people were present. In sum, all of my contacts with Mr. Arnold are strictly limited to activity as members of the Society of Maritime Arbitrators, and in this regard I should also note that this is the same contact I have had with Mr. Jack Berg, the arbitrator appointed by Marc Rich, except that I have known Mr. Berg since 1957 and we have sat on arbitration panels together over a much longer period of time than I have done with Mr. Arnold.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">On these papers, Judge Brieant found that Marc Rich had failed to raise a genuine factual issue requiring an evidentiary hearing. The judge denied the motion of Marc Rich to vacate the arbitration award and granted that of Andros to confirm it. Marc Rich appealed, claiming, inter alia, that it should have been allowed to depose the arbitrators and that it was entitled to an evidentiary hearing to demonstrate that Arnold\u2019s disclosure had been inadequate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The disclosure issue posed by appellant generates a somewhat unusual request for relief. Marc Rich argues not that it has demonstrated that the arbitration award should be set aside, but only that it was denied a chance to show why this should be done. At first blush, such an approach seems reasonable, particularly in light of the broad discovery usually allowed in the federal courts. We conclude, nevertheless, that the rulings of the district court were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The starting point in any discussion of the issues before us must be <em>Commonwealth Coatings Corp. v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>393 U.S. 145, 89 S.Ct. 337, 21 L.Ed.2d 301 (1968), where the Supreme Court for the first time addressed itself to the \u201crequirements of impartiality\u201d in an arbitration proceeding and held that arbitrators must \u201cdisclose to the parties any dealings that might create an impression of possible bias.\u201d 393 U.S. at 145,149, 89 S.Ct. at 339. In that case there had been a relationship between the third \u2014 and \u201csupposedly neutral\u201d \u2014 arbitrator and the successful party in the arbitration: the former had been engaged by the latter \u201cas an engineering consultant\u201d for \u201cfees of about $12,000 over a period of four or five years and the relationship even went so far as to include the rendering of services on the very projects involved in [the arbitration].\u201d 393 U.S. at 146, 89 S.Ct. at 338. The Court held that the arbitrator\u2019s failure to disclose these facts justified vacation of the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">There was an obvious tension, however, between the plurality opinion of Justice Black<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the concurring opinion of Justice White, joined by Justice Marshall. The former relied heavily on the similarity of function linking arbitrators, judges and juries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-12\">We have no doubt that if a litigant could show that a foreman of a jury or a judge in a court of justice had, unknown to the litigant, any such relationship, the judgment would be subject to challenge. This is shown beyond doubt by <em>Turney v. Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, [47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749] (1927), where this Court held that a conviction could not stand because a small part of the judge\u2019s income consisted of court fees collected from convicted defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">393 U.S. at 148, 89 S.Ct. at 339. Justice Black added that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-14\">It is true that arbitrators cannot sever all their ties with the business world, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>they are not expected to get all their income from their work deciding cases, but we should, if anything, be even more scrupulous to safeguard the impartiality of arbitrators than judges, since the former have completely free rein to decide the law as well as the facts and are not subject to appellate review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Id. at 148-49, 89 S.Ct. at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Justice White\u2019s concurring opinion, however, took pains to state at the outset:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMtG\">The Court does not decide today that arbitrators are to be held to the standards of judicial decorum of Article III judges, or indeed of any judges. It is often because they are men of affairs, not apart from but of the marketplace, that they are effective in their adjudicatory function. . . . This does not mean the judiciary must overlook outright chicanery in giving effect to their awards; that would be an abdication of our responsibility. But it does mean that arbitrators are not automatically disqualified by a business relationship with the parties before them if both parties are informed of the relationship in advance, or if they are unaware of the facts but the relationship is trivial. I see no reason automatically to disqualify the best informed and most capable potential arbitrators.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">393 U.S. at 150, 89 S.Ct. at 340. The concurring opinion continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">And it is far better that the relationship be disclosed at the outset, when the parties are free to reject the arbitrator or accept him with knowledge of the relationship and continuing faith in his objectivity, than to have the relationship come to light after the arbitration, when a suspicious or disgruntled party can seize on it as a pretext for invalidating the award. The judiciary should minimize its role in arbitration as judge of the arbitrator\u2019s impartiality. That role is best consigned to the parties who are the architects of their own arbitration process, and are far better informed of the prevailing ethical standards and reputations within their business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-9\">Of course, an arbitrator\u2019s business relationships may be diverse indeed, involving more or less remote commercial connections with great numbers of people. He cannot be expected to provide the parties with his complete and unexpurgated business biography. But it is enough for present purposes to hold, as the Court does, that where the arbitrator has a substantial interest in a firm which has done more than trivial business with a party, that fact must be disclosed. If arbitrators err on the side of disclosure, as they should, it will not be difficult for courts to identify those undisclosed relationships which are too insubstantial to warrant vacating an award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">393 U.S. at 151-52, 89 S.Ct. at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">The dissenting opinion of Justice Fortas, joined by Justices Harlan and Stewart, criticized the Court for announcing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8_\">a <em>per se </em>rule that . . . has no basis in the applicable statute or jurisprudential principles: that, regardless of the agreement between the parties, if an arbitrator has any prior business relationship with one of the parties of which he fails to inform the other party, however innocently, the arbitration award is always subject to being set aside. This is so even where the award is unanimous; where there is no suggestion that the non-disclosure indicates partiality or bias; and where it is conceded that there was in fact no irregularity, unfairness, bias, or partiality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">393 U.S. at 153, 89 S.Ct. at 341. The dissent continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-14\">I agree that failure of an arbitrator to volunteer information about business dealings with one party will, prima facie, support a claim of partiality or bias. But where there is no suggestion that the nondisclosure was calculated, and where the complaining party disclaims any imputation of partiality, bias, or misconduct, the presumption clearly is overcome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-15\">Arbitration is essentially consensual and practical. The United States Arbitration Act is obviously designed to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>tect the integrity of the process with a minimum of insistence upon set formulae and rules. The Court applies to this process rules applicable to judges and not to a system characterized by dealing on faith and reputation for reliability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">393 U.S. at 154-55, 89 S.Ct* at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The diverse views expressed in these opinions pose difficulties in applying the teachings of <em>Commonwealth Coatings. </em>It is certainly true, as Justice White\u2019s concurrence emphasizes, that the Court did not decide that \u201cthe standards of judicial decorum\u201d apply equally to arbitrators. The latter are usually recompensed for their services by the parties, a custom which would be inappropriate for judges. Also, the very practice required of arbitrators in <em>Commonwealth Coatings </em>is not now permitted to federal judges under a recent statute. Generally, a federal judge may not state for the record possible disqualifying circumstances and ask the parties to decide whether they want him to continue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> More fundamentally, the parties in a judicial proceeding do not choose their judges, as they do in an arbitration. Nevertheless, one common feature of both the plurality and concurring opinions in <em>Commonwealth Coatings </em>is clear. Disclosure by arbitrators should be encouraged; failure to make appropriate disclosure will justify setting aside an award.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">The Court has not considered these questions further since <em>Commonwealth Coatings, </em>but they have been the subject of appeals before us on a number of occasions. In <em>Garfield &amp; Co. v. Wiest, </em>432 F.2d 849 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 940, 91 S.Ct. 939, 28 L.Ed.2d 220 (1971), we refused to set aside an award despite the failure of the arbitrators to disclose dealings with one of the parties to an arbitration between two member firms of the New York Stock Exchange. The rationale of our holding was that the complaining party had waived any such objections when it joined the Stock Exchange. In <em>Reed &amp; Martin, Inc. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>439 F.2d 1268 (2d Cir. 1971), appellant claimed that the award was invalid because Westinghouse\u2019s appointee to the arbitration was affiliated with a law firm that had had \u201cdealings with General Electric Company and the latter had been litigating contract clauses identical or similar to those involved in the present case.\u201d 439 F.2d at 1275. Pointing out that \u201cthe burden of proof . . . rests upon the party asserting bias,\u201d id., we held that the failure to disclose this information did not nullify the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Similarly, in <em>Cook Industries, Inc. v. C. Itoh &amp; Co. (America) Inc., </em>449 F.2d 106 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 921, 92 S.Ct. 957, 30 L.Ed.2d 792 (1972), one of the arbitrators was an employee of a company that had sold substantial amounts of grain to Itoh, a fact which the arbitrator did not disclose. We upheld the arbitration award since there was \u201cnothing in the record which suggests the existence of any extraordinary secret deal between [Itoh] and [the arbitrator\u2019s] employer.\u201d 449 F.2d at 108. We emphasized that we have given \u201cpractical meaning\u201d to the <em>Commonwealth Coatings </em>principle of disclosure by treating \u201cthe obligation to which arbitrators are subject as being to disclose dealings of which the parties cannot reasonably be expected to be aware . . . .\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Indeed, we can find only one instance after <em>Commonwealth Coatings </em>where an appellant had any success in this court on a claim of insufficient disclosure.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Sanko S.S. Co. v. Cook Industries, Inc., </em>495 F.2d 1260 (2d Cir. 1973), Sanko claimed that the chairman of the arbitration panel should have disclosed two relationships: one, with a company which, like Cook, was \u201cone of the few major world grain dealers\u201d and with whom it arranged \u201c \u2018swaps\u2019 and \u2018sales\u2019 from time to time running into the millions of dollars,\u201d id. at 1262, and the other, with Cook\u2019s attorney in the arbitration. We did not set aside the award, however, but remanded the case to the district court to explore these matters further at an eviden-tiary hearing. We distinguished the decisions in <em>Garfield &amp; Co. v. Wiest, </em>supra, and <em>Cook Industries v. C. Itoh &amp; Co., </em>supra, on the ground that unlike those cases</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKRG\">the record in the present case, as it now stands, does not justify a holding that Sanko knew or should reasonably have known, of the undisclosed dealings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">495 F.2d at 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">These decisions demonstrate that we have viewed the teachings of <em>Commonwealth Coatings </em>pragmatically, employing a case-by-case approach in preference to dogmatic rigidity. It is certainly fair to say that we have not been quick to set aside the results of an arbitration because of an arbitrator\u2019s alleged failure to disclose information.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">The reasons for this are not hard to identify. There is an obvious possibility, alluded to by Justice White in <em>Commonwealth Coatings </em>that \u201ca suspicious or disgruntled party can seize\u201d upon an undisclosed relationship \u201cas a pretext for invalidating the award.\u201d 393 U.S. at 151, 89 S.Ct. at 340. Courts are usually reluctant to impugn the decisions of a jury because of claims of subsequently discovered bias, see <em>King v. United States, </em>(2d Cir. 1978) (citing cases), and challenges to a judge\u2019s impartiality are typically ruled untimely when the complaining party delays an objection past the point at which he is deemed on notice of potentially disqualifying circumstances. See <em>United States v. Patrick, </em>542 F.2d 381, 390 (7th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 931, 97 S.Ct. 1551, 51 L.Ed.2d 775 (1977) (citing cases); <em>Satterfield v. Eden-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number><em>ton-Chowan Board of Education, </em>530 F.2d 567, 574 &amp; n.21 (4th Cir. 1975) (citing cases). Surely, even greater caution is justified when the decision to be set aside is the product of the theoretically informal, speedy, and inexpensive process of arbitration, freely chosen by the parties. Moreover, a-principal attraction of arbitration is the expertise of those who decide the controversy. Expertise in an industry is accompanied by exposure, in ways large and small, to those engaged in it, and the dividing line between innocuous and suspect relationships is not always easy to draw. But as Justice White recognized, an arbitrator \u201ccannot be expected to provide the parties with his complete and unexpurgated business biography.\u201d 393 U.S. at 151, 89 S.Ct. at 340. The very intimacy of the group from which specialized arbitrators are chosen suggests that the parties can justifiably be held to know at least some kinds of basic information about an arbitrator\u2019s personal and business contacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">With these precedents and observations in mind, we turn to the record before us. Marc Rich alleged in the district court that Arnold had \u201ca close personal and professional relationship\u201d with Nelson, who was president of a firm (Orion) that allegedly operated the Kissavos, the vessel involved in the arbitration.5 *******<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The primary basis of the claimed close relationship was that Arnold and Nelson had \u201cserved together\u201d on 19 arbitration panels and that in 12 of these, one of the arbitrators who selected Arnold was Nelson. Marc Rich furnished no other concrete support for its characterization of Arnold and Nelson as \u201cclose personal friends,\u201d and Nelson swore that his contact with Arnold was \u201climited to those instances where we happen to be members of the same panel and to occasions associated with our membership in the Society of the Maritime Arbitrators.\u201d Nelson also swore that neither Arnold nor his employer, National Bank of North America, had any business relationship with either Orion or with Andros, the winning party in the arbitration, and that there was no social relationship between Arnold and Nelson; the two men had never so much as visited each other\u2019s homes. Nelson also pointed out that his contacts with Arnold were similar to those he had with Berg, the arbitrator appointed by Marc Rich, except that he had known Berg since 1957, while he had known Arnold only since 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-15\">We believe that on this record Judge Brieant was justified in denying both discovery and an evidentiary hearing, and in refusing to vacate the award. From the papers presented, it can fairly be concluded that the relationship between Arnold and Nelson was a professional one, growing out of their service as arbitrators. There was no \u201cbusiness relationship\u201d in the ordinary sense between them or between their employers. Whatever Orion\u2019s duties were with respect to the Kissavos, Orion had no direct financial stake in the outcome of the arbitration, and Nelson\u2019s interest was even more attenuated. Marc Rich argues that Arnold and Nelson had a relationship that should have been disclosed because allegedly \u201c(a) most of Mr. Arnold\u2019s appointments as Chairman of arbitration panels (and the fees which resulted) were attributable to Mr. Nelson, and (b) Mr. Arnold consistently voted for Mr. Nelson\u2019s side in those disputes.\u201d But appellant\u2019s own affidavits recognized that when Arnold was appointed chairman of an arbitration panel that included Nelson, the third arbitrator, as well as Nelson, chose the chairman. And And-ros points out that in all but one of those arbitrations, the award was unanimous. We simply do not regard this as the sort of information an arbitrator would reasonably regard as creating an impression of possible bias. It is worth noting that Marc Rich\u2019s own arbitrator, Jack Berg, did not think it important to disclose that he had known Nelson since 1957 and had sat with him on at least 15 panels, with Arnold on at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>10 panels, and with both Arnold and Nelson on at least three.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Obviously, Arnold knew Nelson as a fellow arbitrator and perhaps in that capacity knew him well. But their service together on arbitration panels was no secret. Marc Rich based its claim of Arnold\u2019s inadequate disclosure upon \u201can exhaustive review of approximately 1200 published awards of the Society of Maritime Arbitrators,\u201d which it conducted after the award was handed down. It could have made such a review just as easily before or during the arbitration rather than after it lost its case. Indeed, it is not at all uncommon for parties to check the past decisions of arbitrators before an arbitration begins. Nor is it an adequate response that Marc Rich had no reason to scrutinize Arnold\u2019s prior service with Nelson because it had no way of knowing that Nelson had any \u201cinterest\u201d in the proceeding. Whatever connection Orion had with the Kissavos was made clear from the documents submitted by Andros at the arbitration, and the name of its president was easily ascertainable. Finally, we note that Marc Rich was not at all concerned over Arnold\u2019s disclosures that he had been appointed as an arbitrator in the past by Andros, the opposing party in this arbitration, and that his employer \u201cmight have had [some business] dealings\u201d with Andros. Nor was Marc Rich interested in Berg\u2019s disclosure that there may have been \u201cbusiness dealings\u201d between his employer and Andros in the past. Judge Brieant obviously regarded Marc Rich\u2019s petition as a classic example of a losing party seizing upon \u201ca pretext for invalidating the [arbitration] award.\u201d <em>Commonwealth Coatings, </em>supra, 393 U.S. at 151, 89 S.Ct. at 340 (White, <em>J., </em>concurring). We believe that the judge properly denied discovery on this issue and was justified in refusing to explore it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">In so deciding, we do not dispute the authorities maintaining that the discovery procedures of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are generally applicable to Title 9 proceedings. See 7 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 81.05[7], at 81-82 (2d ed. 1975);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Int\u2019l Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>48 F.R.D. 298 (S.D.N.Y.1969); see also Fed.R.Civ.P. 81(a)(3) (Federal Rules apply to proceedings under Title 9 \u201cto the extent that matters of procedure are not provided for in those statutes\u201d). But in the special context of what are in effect post hoc efforts to induce arbitrators to undermine the finality of their own awards, we agree with the district court that any questioning of arbitrators should be handled pursuant to judicial supervision and limited to situations where clear evidence of impropriety has been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Marc Rich also attacks the merits of the arbitration award. Observing that the charter party exonerates the charterer from liability for demurrage representing delays caused by deficiencies in the vessel, appellant alleges that such a deficiency was \u201cindisputably\u201d made out in the proceeding before the arbitrator, and concludes that the award \u201ccompletely disregards both the expressed terms of the contract and the applicable law.\u201d Quoting the celebrated dictum that an arbitrator \u201cdoes not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice,\u201d <em>United Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 1361, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960), appellant urges that the district court should have vacated the instant award under the authority granted by 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>For present purposes, the actual holding of <em>Enterprise Wheel </em>and other language in the opinion are more instructive than the observation on which appellant relies. There as here, a vigorous assault had been mounted on the arbitrator\u2019s construction of a contract provision. The Court noted disapprovingly that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">[t]he Court of Appeal's\u2019 opinion refusing to enforce the [contested] portions of the award was not based upon any finding that the arbitrator did not premise his award on his construction of the contract. It merely disagreed with the arbitrator\u2019s construction of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">363 U.S. at 598, 80 S.Ct. at 1361. Justice Douglas\u2019s opinion concludes with a clear warning to all disappointed parties to arbi-tral proceedings who may be tempted to relitigate the merits in federal court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">[T]he question of interpretation of the . agreement is a question for the arbitrator. It is the arbitrator\u2019s construction which was bargained for; and so far as the arbitrator\u2019s decision concerns construction of the contract, the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different from his.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">363 U.S. at 599, 80 S.Ct. at 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">This court has not been receptive \u2014 at least in recent years \u2014 to invitations to second-guess an arbitrator\u2019s resolution of a contract dispute. In <em>I/S Stavborg v. National Metal Converters, Inc., </em>500 F.2d 424 (2d Cir. 1974), we declined to disturb an award which we characterized as \u201cbased on a clearly erroneous interpretation of the contract,\u201d adding that \u201c[w]hatever arbitrators\u2019 mistakes of law may be corrected, simple misinterpretations of contracts do not appear one of them.\u201d 500 F.2d at 432. See also <em>Local 771, I.A.T.S.E. v. RKO General, Inc., </em>546 F.2d 1107, 1113 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>Parsons &amp; Whittemore Overseas Co. v. Societe Generale de L\u2019Industrie du Papier (Rakta), </em>supra, 508 F.2d at 977; <em>Office of Supply, Government of Republic of Korea v. New York Navigation Co., </em>469 F.2d 377, 379 (2d Cir. 1972). We have consistently accorded the narrowest of readings to the Arbitration Act\u2019s authorization to vacate awards \u201c[w]here the arbitrators exceeded their powers,\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(d), especially where that language has been invoked in the context of arbitrators\u2019 alleged failure to correctly decide a question which all concede to have been properly submitted in the first instance.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">The demurrage award that we are asked to overturn grew out of a controversy that fell within the broad arbitration clause of the charter party;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the arbitrators\u2019 authority to decide the question presented to them is not disputed. The award is supported by a majority opinion that takes cognizance of every argument made by appellant to this court and simply declines to reach the requested conclusion, on grounds that are hardly evanescent even if they do not command our heartfelt concurrence. Noting Marc Rich\u2019s contentions regarding the deficiencies of the ship, including alleged inadequacies of her pumps, the panel majority conceded that one of the charter party clauses \u201cclearly excuses Charterer from having to pay demurrage for reason of vessel deficiencies.\u201d But the majority went on to emphasize the inherent ambiguity of the \u201cvessel deficiencies\u201d term. The charter party fails to set out any specific | standard of performance to which the vesjsel is to be held; absent, say, a complete 'breakdown of the ship\u2019s pumps, the question of what level of equipment performance constitutes a \u201cdeficiency\u201d is not clear-cut.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Without overruling <em>I/S Stavborg v. National Metal Converters, Inc., </em>supra, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>doing obvious violence to analogous precedents of this circuit, we cannot review for error an arbitrator\u2019s resolution of such an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">It seems that as long as even a glint of hope remains for judicial interference with the merits of an arbitration award, we must regretfully anticipate continued efforts to press contentions similar to that rejected here. The vague Arbitration Act standards for vacating awards do not foreclose these sallies altogether, and neither the Supreme Court nor our own precedents have completely slammed the door. Thus, the <em>1/3 Stavborg </em>majority emphasized that the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d interpretation it was upholding did not seem \u201cirrational.\u201d 500 F.2d at 430 n.12 and 431. Cf. <em>Wilko v. Swan, </em>346 U.S. 427, 436-37, 74 S.Ct. 182, 98 L.Ed. 168 (1953) (implying that federal courts may review for error awards rendered in \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d of applicable law). And we acknowledged in <em>Sobel v. Hertz, Warner &amp; Co., </em>469 F.2d 1211, 1214 (2d Cir. 1972) that \u201cif the arbitrators simply ignore the applicable law, the literal application of a \u2018manifest disregard\u2019 standard should presumably compel vacation of the award.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But this much at least is certain: When arbitrators explain their conclusions (we reaffirmed in <em>Sobel </em>that they have no obligation to do so) in terms that offer even a barely colorable justification for the outcome reached, confirmation of the award cannot be prevented by litigants who merely argue, however persuasively, for a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-7\">.

Among these is \u201cevident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them.\u201d Id. \u00a7 10(b). The parties in the instant case dispute whether review of their award is governed by that section or by Chapter 2 of the Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-208, the so-called Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbi-tral Awards. Article 1 of the Convention renders it applicable to awards \u201cnot considered as domestic awards in the State where their recognition and enforcement are sought.\u201d Marc Rich argues that, although this case involves two foreign parties, the award at issue was rendered in New York and should be considered domestic, removing it from the reach of the Convention and placing it within the ambit of 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10 for our purposes. Andros disagrees, citing 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 202 (which broadly restates the scope of the Convention) and <em>Antco Shipping Co. v. Sidermar S.p.A., </em>417 F.Supp. 207 (S.D.N.Y.1976), aff'd in open court by oral opinion, 553 F.2d 94 (2d Cir. 1977) (holding Convention applicable to arbitration agreement between two foreign corporations, although the arbitration was to take place in New York). Our affirmance of <em>Sidermar </em>was pursuant to Local Rule \u00a7 0.23, and is without precedential effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">We find this controversy intriguing, but we need not resolve it here. If the Convention applies, a request for confirmation of an arbi-tral award must be granted unless one of the Convention\u2019s grounds for \u201crefusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award\u201d appears. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 207. The only such ground conceivably pertinent to this case is found in Article V, section 2(b): \u201cThe recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of [the forum state].\u201d We have held that this provision \u201cis to be construed narrowly to be applied only where enforcement would violate the forum state\u2019s most basic notions of morality and justice.\u201d <em>Fotochrome, Inc. v.
