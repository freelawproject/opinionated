Because Emery had no facilities or personnel in Nevada, it used Parcel Delivery Service of Reno, Nevada, as its agent. On November 3, 1971, a Service representative went to the warehouse to check and label the cargo. He received and signed a document entitled \u201cStraight Bill of Lading \u2014 Short Form\u201d but apparently did not deliver an airway bill as required by 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 296.73. Subsequently, the razors were transported to San Francisco by truck and then to New York City by air. On arrival, the cargo was loaded onto two trucks for delivery to Norelco. One of the trucks, carrying 795 cartons of razors, was hijacked en route, and the cargo was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">On December 7, 1971, Norelco submitted a written claim to Emery for $114,003.00, the value of the lost cargo. On December 21, 1971, Emery informed Norelco that the claim was governed by the provisions of Emery\u2019s tariff, which limited its liability for negligence to $.50 per pound in the absence of a higher declared value. Because Norel-co had not declared a higher value at the time of shipment, Emery tendered a check for $10,527.50, its maximum liability under the tariff. Norelco held the check for over a year, returning it on December 28, 1972, and reasserting its claim for the full $114,-003.00. Thereafter, it filed suit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. Emery removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s claim arose under federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-16\">In the district court, Emery raised three defenses to Norelco\u2019s claim. It asserted that under its tariff all suits against it had to be instituted within one year of the disallowance of a claim and that plaintiff\u2019s suit was not timely. It also contended that the tariff relieved it of liability for losses not due to its negligence and that it had not been negligent. Lastly, it argued that, even if negligent, its liability was limited to $.50 per pound. Norelco countered that the tariff was inapplicable because no airway-bill was delivered at the time of shipping, and that therefore the common law, not the tariff, governed Emery\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-17\">After considering the pleadings, pre-trial depositions, and stipulated facts, the district judge ruled in defendant\u2019s favor, holding that delivery of an airwaybill was not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>prerequisite to the application of the tariff. The district judge decided that Emery was not negligent and could avail itself of the exculpatory provision in the tariff. He also found that the action was not begun within the one-year period and therefore was time barred. His opinion is reported at 432 F.Supp. 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Appellant and appellee are Delaware corporations doing business in the State of New York, and there was no diversity of citizenship justifying removal of appellant\u2019s action to federal court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). Appellee proceeded therefore under \u00a7 1441(b), which authorizes removal where the plaintiff\u2019s claim is one over which the federal courts would have original jurisdiction because the claim arises under the laws of the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In recent years, several courts have held that claims similar to appellant\u2019s did not arise under the laws or statutes of the United States. <em>See, e. g., Security Insurance Co. v. National Airlines, Inc., </em>413 F.Supp. 493 (E.D.La.1976); <em>Frenkel </em>v. <em>Western Union Telegraph Co., </em>327 F.Supp. 954 (D.Md.1971); <em>cf. Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Texaco Inc., </em>415 U.S. 125, 94 S.Ct. 1002, 39 L.Ed.2d 209 (1974). For this reason, we raised the question, <em>sua sponte, </em>whether original federal jurisdiction existed in the district court to pass upon appellant\u2019s claim and requested the parties to brief this issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We now hold that the district court did have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">Section 403(b) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373(b)(1), contains language which is similar to that of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 6(7), 906(c), the Federal Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 202(a), and the Motor Carrier Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 317(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The purpose of these provisions was to establish a uniformity and equality of rates in all interstate transactions to which the several statutes applied. <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Esteve Brothers &amp; Co., </em>256 U.S. 566, 572, 41 S.Ct. 584, 65 L.Ed. 1094 (1921); <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad v. ICC, </em>200 U.S. 361, 391-92, 26 S.Ct. 272, 50 L.Ed. 515 (1906); <em>United States v. Associated Air Transport, Inc., </em>275 F.2d 827, 832-34 (5th Cir. 1960); <em>Lichten v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., </em>189 F.2d 939, 941 (2d Cir. 1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Limitations of liability and cargo valuations are inherent parts of the rates, and the statutory mandate of uniformity must therefore apply to the liabilities which attend the carriage of goods. <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Esteve Brothers &amp; Co., supra, </em>256 U.S. at 571-73, 41 S.Ct. 584; <em>Kansas City Southern Railway v. Carl, </em>227 U.S. 639, 653, 33 S.Ct. 391, 57 L.Ed. 683 (1913). If a shipper in one state could hold a carrier to a higher standard or degree of liability than a shipper in another state who has paid the same rate, the first shipper would be getting a preference not granted to the second.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Vaigneur v. Western Union </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>Telegraph Co., </em>34 F.Supp. 92, 93 (E.D.Tenn. 1940). This, the various commerce acts prohibit. <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. </em>v. Es-tere <em>Brothers &amp; Co., supra, </em>256 U.S. at 571, 41 S.Ct. 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Although the liability of air carriers is not created by statute, as is the case with surface carriers, <em>see </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20(11), the prohibition against unlawful preferences is equally strong with regard to the former as the latter. <em>Twentieth Century Delivery Service, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co., </em>242 F.2d 292, 299 (9th Cir. 1957). For example, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(d) makes it unlawful to give or receive rebates or commissions in shipments by air.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It follows that both the rights and liabilities as between an airline and a shipper are determined by the shipper\u2019s valid tariffs. <em>Tishman &amp; Lipp, Inc. v. Delta Air Lines, </em>413 F.2d 1401, 1403 (2d Cir. 1969). In some cases, this conclusion is reached by treating the tariff rate as a matter of law instead of contract. <em>See Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Esteve Brothers &amp; Co., supra, </em>256 U.S. at 572, 41 S.Ct. 584; <em>Carter v. AT&amp;T, </em>365 F.2d 486, 496 (5th Cir. 1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 1008, 87 S.Ct. 714, 17 L.Ed.2d 546 (1967); <em>United States v. </em>Associated <em>Air Transport, Inc., supra, </em>275 F.2d at 833; <em>American Railway Express Co. v. American Trust Co., </em>47 F.2d 16, 18 (7th Cir. 1931); <em>Blair v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>344 F.Supp. 360, 365 (S.D.Fla.1972), <em>aff\u2019d on opinion below, </em>477 F.2d 564 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>Slick Airways, Inc. v. United States, </em>292 F.2d 515, 519 (Ct.C1.1961). In other cases, it is said that the tariff becomes part of the contract between the parties. <em>Tishman &amp; Lipp, Inc. v. Delta Air Lines, supra, </em>413 F.2d at 1405; <em>Lichten v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., supra, </em>189 F.2d at 940; <em>Mao v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., </em>310 F.Supp. 844, 846 (S.D.N. Y.1970); <em>Rosch v. United Air Lines, </em>146 F.Supp. 266, 267 (S.D.N.Y.1956); <em>Mack v. Eastern Air Lines, </em>87 F.Supp. 113, 115 (D.Mass.1949). Regardless of the rationale, it is clear that a carrier\u2019s valid federal tariffs which are applicable to the shipment at issue govern not only the nature and extent of its liability, but also the nature and extent of the shipper\u2019s right of recovery. It is in this light that we must examine the question of federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Whether a suit arises under a law of the United States must be determined from plaintiff\u2019s complaint, not defendant\u2019s answer. <em>Peyton v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>316 U.S. 350, 353, 62 S.Ct. 1171, 86 L.Ed. 1525 (1942). The court must ascertain from the complaint whether federal law is a pivotal issue in the case, one that is basic in the determination of the conflict between the parties. <em>Gully v. First National Bank, </em>299 U.S. 109, 117-18, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936); <em>Ivy Broadcasting Co. v. AT&amp;T, </em>391 F.2d 486, 489 (2d Cir. 1968). However, the lack of any reference to federal law in the complaint is not controlling. <em>Sylgab Steel &amp; Wire Corp. v. Strickland Transportation Co., </em>270 F.Supp. 264, 267 (E.D.N.Y.1967); 1A <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 0.160 at 185-87 (2d ed. 1974). Congress has created a broad, comprehensive scheme covering the interstate shipment of freight, aimed at preventing preferential treatment among shippers and es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tablishing national equality of rates and services. This has occupied the field to the exclusion of state law. <em>Illinois Produce International, Inc. v. Reliance Insurance Co., </em>388 F.Supp. 29, 35 (N.D.Ill.1975); <em>Milhizer v. Riddle Airlines, Inc., </em>185 F.Supp. 110, 112 (E.D.Mich.1960), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>289 F.2d 933 (6th Cir. 1961); <em>cf. Vogelsang v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>302 F.2d 709, 712 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>371 U.S. 826, 83 S.Ct. 46, 9 L.Ed.2d 65 (1962). <em>But see Litvak Meat Co. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>446 F.2d 329, 334-37 (10th Cir. 1971). The allegations of appellant\u2019s complaint show that its claim is based upon the loss of goods during interstate transportation by appellee as a common carrier for hire. From the substance of these allegations, it is clear that the complaint sets forth a claim arising under federal law. <em>Blair v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., supra, </em>344 F.Supp. at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Having determined that the district court had jurisdiction, we have no problem in affirming its decision on the merits. Moreover, we need add little to what the district judge has already said in his scholarly opinion. Although appellee failed to furnish an airwaybill to appellant as required by 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 296.73(a), the bill of lading governing the shipment specifically provided that the goods were received \u201csubject to the classifications and tariffs in effect on the date of the issue of this Bill of Lading.\u201d These tariffs provided in part that appellee would not be liable for losses not caused by its own negligence, and in no event unless action was brought within one year after written disallowance of a claim for loss. Judge Gagliardi held that these provisions were controlling, that appellee was not negligent, and that the action was not timely. We see no error here. <em>Tishman &amp; Lipp, Inc. v. Delta Air Lines, supra, </em>413 F.2d at 1403-06; <em>Lichten v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., supra, </em>189 F.2d at 941; <em>see also Molitch v. Irish International Airlines, </em>436 F.2d 42, 44 (2d Cir. 1970) (Warsaw Convention).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Klicker v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>563 F.2d 1310 (9th Cir. 1977), is misplaced. In that case, the concededly negligent carrier attempted to rely upon a tariff provision which completely exonerated it from liability and which had been declared unlawful by the CAB subsequent to the loss. Alternatively, the carrier attempted to rely upon a \u201creleased valuation\u201d for the valuable animal which had been shipped, although it had refused to give the shipper an opportunity to declare the animal\u2019s true value. In the present case, appellee was not negligent. Accordingly, the basis of <em>Klicker </em>\u2014 the common law rule forbidding a carrier to exculpate itself from liability for its negligence \u2014 is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Reading between the lines, we get the impression that the court in <em>Klicker </em>does not agree with this Court\u2019s holdings concerning the CAB\u2019s role in supervising tariffs and services. However, because of the critical factual differences between the two cases discussed above, and because of the enactment of the air cargo \u201cderegulation\u201d bill on November 9, 1977, Pub.L.No.95-163, \u00a7 18(a)-(e), 91 Stat. 1286-88 (to be codified in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1482(d), (g)-(i), (k)), we see no point in discussing the disagreement between the Circuits. In the deregulation bill, Congress has taken away the CAB\u2019s authority to suspend \u201cunjust or unreasonable\u201d cargo rates and to prescribe rates and rules in their place. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1482(d)(3) (Supp.1978). What effect this regulation will have on the powers of the CAB and, in turn, the courts must await future legislative or judicial clarification.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our holding herein does not address this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AOI4\">.

CAB regulations quite specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>require an air freight forwarder to prepare and deliver to consignor and consignee an \u201caccurate\u201d airwaybill which contains both a limitation of liability statement and a declared value of the shipment with charges for excess valuation. Only because the documentation provided was the functional equivalent of what the CAB ordinarily requires can the air freight forwarder take advantage of the tariff limitations on liability and time within which to bring suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">The relevant regulation is quite explicit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition to delivery, it requires that the airwaybill be \u201caccurate,\u201d that a bill be prepared \u201cfor each shipment\u201d and that it set forth a considerable amount of information including a \u201climitation of liability statement,\u201d the \u201c[d]eclared value of shipment,\u201d and charges for \u201c[ejxcess valuation.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 296.73(a)(l)(ii), (vii), (2)(iv) (1977). The regulation further specifies that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzT\">[w]here a forwarder desires to conduct an operation which entails the use of documentation different from that required herein, it is the responsibility of such forwarder to secure from the Board, in advance, permission to deviate from the requirements of this section.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkfV\">Plainly this regulation which is concededly binding has a purpose. At a minimum, it seeks to ensure that the shipper is aware of any limitations on liability. It further entitles him to declare an excess value and to pay any charges thereby incurred in order to avoid the tariff\u2019s limitations, here fifty cents a pound.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And surely the requirement that a copy of the bill be delivered to consignor and consignee<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is not surplusage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>A delivered bill is the contract of carriage and binding. <em>See generally United States v. Louisville &amp; Nashville Railway Co., </em>221 F.2d 698, 701-02 (6th Cir. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The court below and the panel majority rely on <em>Vogelsang v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>302 F.2d 709, 712 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>371 U.S. 826, 83 S.Ct. 46, 9 L.Ed.2d 65 (1962), and <em>Tishman &amp; Lipp, Inc. v. Delta Air Lines, </em>413 F.2d 1401, 1403-04 (2d Cir. 1969), for the proposition that air tariff limitations govern whether or not the documentation incorporates them. This may be true in a case where no regulations govern the subject,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but it is quite different from saying that a bill that is undelivered or is prepared contrary to CAB regulations will serve to invoke the tariff provisions. To hold otherwise is to render the regulation nugatory, a result we are without power to effectuate.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The overland bill prepared here did, as Judge Van Graafeiland points out, state that it was \u201csubject to the classifications and tariffs in effect on the date of the issue of this Bill.\u201d Moreover, the overland bill contained a space for the shipper to make the filed tariffs inapplicable to him by declaring the value of the merchandise and by paying a special charge. The net effect then of the provisions in the overland bill,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> construing them generously, is to put the freight forwarder in substantial compliance with the regulation. On this basis, but only on this basis, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-5\">. The regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-v\">Each holder of an operating authorization shall prepare an accurate airwaybill for each shipment consigned for transportation to a direct air carrier by such holder in the capacity of an air freight forwarder or internation: al air freight forwarder and a copy thereof shall be supplied to the consignor and to the consignee of each such shipment. Each such airwaybill shall contain:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_E\">(1) The following information:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alm-dedup-0\">(i) Name and address of consignor, consignee, and forwarder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcU\">(ii) A limitation of liability statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A27\">(iii) Number of packages in shipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"asx-dedup-0\">(iv) Total weight (both actual and dimensional, where applicable).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aks-dedup-1\">(v) Description of commodities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW7\">(vi) Point of origin and destination of shipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0T\">(vii) Declared value of shipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aqg-dedup-0\">(viii) Date of airwaybill preparation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"amc-dedup-0\">(ix) Name of employee or agent preparing airwaybill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEbA\">(2) The following charges, when applicable:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6ox\">(i) Commodity rate applied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"axq-dedup-0\">(ii) Total weight-rate charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aos-dedup-0\">(iii) Pickup and/or delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a1i-dedup-0\">(iv) Excess valuation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aix-dedup-0\">(v) Charges advanced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alg\">(vi) Assembly or distribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWE\">(vii) Other accessorial charges (specify).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvGX\">(viii) Insurance (liability).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"afl-dedup-1\">(ix) C.O.D. fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARB\">(x) Preparation of export documents (international air freight forwarders only).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmGn\">(xi) Total charges and an indication as to whether charges are prepaid or collect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afo7\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 296.73(a) (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Asd\">. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 296.73 (Note). Appellee argues, Brief for Appellee at 14-15, that the CAB impliedly gave such permission in advance by accepting Emery\u2019s Tariff Rule 45A which provides that, irrespective of form, nonnegotiable shipping documents presented in lieu of Forwarder Air-bills \u201cshall be subject to the Forwarder\u2019s Tariff in effect on the day of acceptance.\u201d But acceptance of the tariff, though it might have independent effect, <em>Tishman &amp; Lipp, Inc. v. Delta Air Lines, </em>413 F.2d 1401, 1405 (2d Cir. 1969), cannot displace the requirements of the regulation. Tariff Rule 45A, however, arguably falls within the dispensation from the regulation\u2019s strictures accorded by the Note appended to \u00a7 296.73; the Note refers to a forwarder desiring \u201cto conduct an operation.\u201d While we need not decide whether the activity at issue here constituted an operation it is by no means clear whether the term \u201coperation\u201d is bureau-cratese for a single transaction or contemplates a continuing course of business. The regulation could well be amended to advantage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"aas-dedup-0\">. The regulation requires that the choice given to the shipper (or passenger) to obtain either full or limited liability must be made explicit, absent which the limitations in the filed tariffs are not available. The element of choice is critical. <em>Conklin v. Canadian-Colonial Airways, Inc., </em>266 N.Y. 244, 248, 194 N.E. 692, 694 (1935); <em>American Machine &amp; Foundry Co. v. Santini Bros., Inc., </em>54 Misc.2d 886, 889, 283 N.Y.S.2d 574, 577 (Sup.Ct.1967), <em>aff'd, </em>46 A.D.2d 844, 362 N.Y.S.2d 402 (1st Dep\u2019t 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AOaj\">. Here of course a copy of the bill could not have been furnished to the consignee since the underlying goods were stolen. This is not a fatal defect, however, since the basic dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>here relates to the contract between the consignor and the air freight forwarder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\">. The opinion for the court in <em>Vogelsang </em>refers to <em>Boston &amp; Maine R. R. v. Hooker, </em>233 U.S. 97, 34 S.Ct. 526, 58 L.Ed. 868 (1914), for this proposition. There the Court held a common carrier\u2019s baggage limitation provisions valid and applicable though the passenger was not aware of them. But, and it is an important qualification, the Interstate Commerce Commission itself considered that the tariff filing was sufficient and that no other notice was required. The Court relied on the ICC\u2019s position. <em>See id. </em>at 118-21, 34 S.Ct. 526. Here the CAB required otherwise; its regulation specifies the form of notice which must be furnished to the shipper. None of the cases referred to involves a regulation with such requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AAH\">. The stipulated facts indicate that a copy of the overland bill of lading was delivered to appellant\u2019s authorized agent, Pacific Freeport Warehouse Company:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aig-dedup-1\">13. That later in the morning of November 3, 1971, Mr. Tosolini appeared at Pacific Freeport\u2019s warehouse shipping office, checked and labeled plaintiff\u2019s cargo, received the aforementioned Straight Bill of Lading and, after signing and dating said document at the bottom, returned same to a representative of Pacific Freeport Warehouse, retaining one copy thereof for his own purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsMd\">14. That there is an issue of fact to be submitted to this Court for determination as to whether or not Mr. Tosolini, at the same time and place, also prepared and delivered to Pacific Freeport Warehouse a document known as Emery Air Freight Corp. Airbill RNO-68927.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agk\">For purposes of this appeal, we must assume that an airwaybill was not delivered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
