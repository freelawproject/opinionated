Co. v. Wetzel, </em>424 U.S. 737, 96 S.Ct. 1202, 47 L.Ed.2d 435 (1976). The district court then afforded a hearing, and, on August 24, 1976, issued an injunction, enjoining defendant from using or implementing its protection benefits plan which treated \u201cpregnancy related disabilities differently from other disabilities and which does not provide coverage or other benefits for pregnancy related disabilities.\u201d The defendant was also prohibited from avoiding the effect of the order by reducing coverage to male employees. Finally, the court ordered the defendant to submit a new income protection plan which would provide coverage for pregnancy related disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">The defendant has appealed to this court under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292. We have jurisdiction to consider the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">After the appeal had been lodged in this court, the Supreme Court decided <em>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, </em>429 U.S. 125, 97 S.Ct. 401, 50 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976). We find that decision to be dispositive of the issues raised in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-17\">The plaintiffs argue that in addition to a claim of discrimination based upon deprivation of benefits because of pregnancy there has been proof of disparate treatment in hiring and promotional policies. Accordingly, the income benefit plan, they contend, should not be viewed in isolation and the case should be remanded for further consideration in the light of <em>Gilbert. </em>We are unable to accept this position. The income protection plan is clearly severable from the hiring and promotion practices of the company. The district court\u2019s injunction itself demonstrates no difficulty in separating the disability plan from other issues in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-18\"><em>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, supra, </em>holds that a disability income plan excluding pregnancy benefits does not violate Title VII. The plan under consideration there is indistinguishable in any relevant provision from that offered by Liberty Mutual. Therefore, we conclude <em>Gilbert </em>requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>that we reverse and enter judgment for the defendant on the disability income benefits issue. <em>EEOC v. Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, </em>556 F.2d 222 (3d Cir. 1977). We do not consider any other phase of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Accordingly, that portion of the partial summary judgment of January 29, 1974 pertaining to the disability income protection plan and the injunction and order of August 24,1976 will be vacated. Judgment will be entered in favor of the defendant on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that the defendant\u2019s income protection plan was in violation of Title VII.
