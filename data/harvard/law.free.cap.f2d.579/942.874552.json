BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">This case brings before this Court the increasingly vexatious difficulties created by man\u2019s quest for quick riches through smuggling. While on a routine patrol off the Florida coast, United States Customs Officers caught defendant Freeman with his hand on the rudder illegally attempting to bring aliens into the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the suppression hearing in the District Court, defendant Freeman contended that the Customs Officers violated the sanctity of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures and the trial judge agreed. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, the United States Government appeals the District Court\u2019s order granting the suppression motion. Recognizing the congressionally created, judicially approved, and constitutionally firm power of Customs Officers to board vessels within customs waters for the purpose of checking papers and documents, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-15\">On April 30, 1975, a clear day with calm winds, Customs personnel on Customs Vessel 38116 (Vessel 38116) were patrolling the waters off southern Florida. Shortly after 8:00 a. m., Vessel 38116 approached the Miami sea buoy, located approximately three nautical miles offshore. At that time Customs personnel sighted on the horizon to the northeast the mast of the <em>Topographic Oceans, </em>a 37 foot Irwin sailboat. From its position near the Miami sea buoy, Vessel 38116 headed in a northerly direction. Customs Officers continuously followed for thirty to forty-five minutes the <em>Topographic Oceans </em>course from the west<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> toward the Florida coastline. When the Customs personnel made the initial sighting the <em>Topographic Oceans </em>was well beyond the three mile territorial limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-16\">Shortly before 9 a. m., Vessel 38116 intercepted the <em>Topographic Oceans 2.8 </em>miles off the Florida coast directly east of Bakers Haulover Inlet.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Once alongside, the Customs personnel inquired about the <em>Topographic Oceans\u2019s </em>last port of call. The only individuals on deck, defendants Freeman and Graham, both replied \u201cWest Palm Beach.\u201d After consulting among themselves, the Customs Officers decided to board the <em>Topographic Oceans. </em>They based their decision on the following considerations: (i) the <em>Topographic Oceans, </em>a sailboat, was heading in a westerly direction, (ii) the <em>Topographic Oceans </em>was crossing the Gulfstream which travels north, (iii) a similar vessel from West Palm Beach would normally travel south closer to the shoreline to avoid the Gulfstream, (iv) the time of the day, and (v) the presence on deck of two middle-aged men and the apparent absence of wives or other family members. The Customs Officers reasoned that it was illogical for such a sailing vessel supposedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>traveling from West Palm Beach to sail north to south against the northern flow of the Gulfstream. Instead, the passage would be closer to the shore out of the Gulfstream\u2019s influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">As Customs Officers Sutton and McBride boarded the <em>Topographic Oceans, </em>Officer Sutton asked Freeman who was the vessel\u2019s master. Freeman responded that Graham, then on the bow of the boat, was the master. After Graham came from the bow of the vessel to the boarding party\u2019s location, Officer Sutton requested the vessel\u2019s documents. Graham indicated that his wife had placed them someplace below deck. Almost simultaneously with the receipt of this response, while standing on the deck, Customs Officer McBride glanced down through a wide-open door (hatch) to ascertain that no one with weapons was lurking below. He saw a woman holding a baby hiding in one corner and another woman hiding under a table.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">This behavior aroused his suspicion and McBride proceeded down into the vessel. McBride also stated that he proceeded down the hatch to assure that no one with weapons was hiding. In the forward section of the sailboat McBride discovered a group of black men, women, and babies who, upon later investigation, were determined to be Haitian refugees. Subsequently, both defendants were \u201cread their rights\u201d and escorted along with the <em>Topographic Oceans </em>to the Coast Guard base in Miami.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">At the suppression hearing the defense placed an expert witness on the stand who testified that anyone viewing the <em>Topographic Oceans </em>for less than half an hour could not draw a conclusion about its point of origin or its destination. The expert opined that any travel of a sailboat in the area observed by the Customs agents was consistent with \u201cordinary, normal, prudent seamanship coming from Palm Beach to Miami.\u201d The expert conceded, however, that the general direction of the vessel could have been discerned by the Customs Officers. Finally, he agreed that when first sighted by Customs officials, the <em>Topographic Oceans </em>was at least six miles from the Florida coast.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">In granting Freeman\u2019s motion to suppress, the District Court made several rulings. First, the Court found that the search was not a border search. Alternatively, the Court ruled that even if the search was a border search, there existed no reasonable suspicion to stop the vessel and conduct a search. Finally, the Court ruled that the mere observation of a vessel crossing the three mile limit, standing alone, did not invoke the authority to search under the customs statute, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">On appeal the Government seriously presses two arguments. First, the Government contends that the search was justified as a border search. Second, the Government argues that the search was a statutorily authorized customs search of a newly arrived vessel under \u00a7 1581.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">In determining whether the Customs agents acted in a constitutionally acceptable manner we divide our analysis into two phases. First we examine the statutory and constitutional authority for the stop of the <em>Topographic Oceans. </em>Next, upon finding that the stop was constitutional, we inquire about the constitutionality of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">\n<em>Shipshape Statutory Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">Through the enactment of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a), Congress authorized Customs agents to stop vessels in Customs waters for the purpose of examining the vessel\u2019s manifest, documents and papers. Section 1581(a) explicitly provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-13\">Any officer of the customs may at any time go on board of any vessel or vehicle at any place in the United States or within the customs waters . . . and <em>examine the manifest and other documents and papers </em>and examine, inspect, and search the vessel or vehicle and every part thereof and any person, trunk, package, or cargo on board, and to this end may hail and stop such vessel or vehicle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>and use all necessary force to compel compliance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">Section 1401(j) defines \u201cCustoms waters,\u201d as to an American vessel, as \u201cthe waters within four leagues [12 nautical miles] of the coast of the United States.\u201d Clearly, the literal language of \u00a7 1581(a) supplies Customs Officers with extremely broad power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">We emphasize that in the present case no warrant issued and the Government does not contend that probable cause to stop or search the vessel existed at the moment of boarding. Moreover, we fully agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Customs personnel did not have reasonable suspicion to detain the vessel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, unlike the similar Customs statutory authority of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 482 which contains a \u201creasonable cause to suspect\u201d requirement,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u00a7 1581(a) has no requirement which might limit the power granted Customs agents. Under the explicit language of \u00a7 1581(a) Customs Officers need not have even a modicum of suspicion to either stop or search vessels in Customs waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-14\">Clearly, under the authority granted by Congress, Customs Officers, within their discretion and for the purpose of examining the vessel\u2019s papers, could stop and board the <em>Topographic Oceans </em>as it sailed through Customs waters. The stop was plainly authorized by the literal language of the statute. The detention of the vessel under the authority granted by \u00a7 1581 was permissible unless violative of minimum federal Constitutional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">The Fourth Amendment<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> imposes a general reasonableness standard upon all searches and seizures. <em>See Carroll v. United States, </em>1925, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543; <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>1968, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889; <em>United States v. Caraballo, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 571 F.2d 975; <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 502 F.2d 1215, 1218; <em>United States v. McDaniel, 5 </em>Cir., 1972, 463 F.2d 129, 134, <em>cert. denied, </em>1973, 413 U.S. 919, 93 S.Ct. 3046, 39 L.Ed.2d 1041, cited in <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number><em>States </em>v. <em>Ingham, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 502 F.2d 1287, 1291 n.6, <em>cert. denied, </em>1975, 421 U.S. 911, 95 S.Ct. 1566, 43 L.Ed.2d 777. What is reasonable of course depends upon the circumstances of each case. <em>United States v. Rabinowitz, </em>1950, 339 U.S. 56, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653. The reasonableness and constitutionality of brief stops of vessels in Customs waters by Customs agents for the purpose of routine document and safety checks is beyond question. Precedent, the unique circumstances and problems of the maritime context, and the historical origin of \u00a7 1581 all dictate that document and safety inspections such as the one involved here are constitutionally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">First, no case holds that the stop of a vessel on the seas for a document or safety check is constitutionally proscribed by the Fourth Amendment. Indeed, our cases have upheld the right of Government agents to stop vessels for routine safety and document checks under the analogous statutory authority granted to the Coast Guard by 14 U.S.C. \u00a7 89(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Warren, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 578 F.2d 1058 (en banc); <em>United States v. Odom, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 526 F.2d 339; <em>United States v. One 43 Foot Sailing Vessel, 5 </em>Cir., 1976, 538 F.2d 694. It would be anomalous to suggest that the nearly identical language of \u00a7 1581(a) does not afford Customs officers the constitutionally acceptable authority to make document checks within the Customs waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">Moreover, as we emphasized in <em>United States v. Ingham, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 502 F.2d 1287, 1920, <em>cert. denied, </em>1975, 421 U.S. 911, 95 S.Ct. 1566, 43 L.Ed.2d 777, there is a substantial distinction between a landlocked vehicle and a nautical vessel for Fourth Amendment purposes. First, the national frontiers of the oceans are much more difficult to police than the territorial boundaries of the land. The exact lines are difficult to discern and there is no limit to the numbers of fixed points of entry. It\u2019s simply not practical to stop and inspect every vessel at the actual border, an imaginary line on the seas. Finally, the brief and routine Customs detention prompted by the legitimate concerns of government for the safe and lawful operation of vessels intrudes only minimally into the privacy of seafarers. <em>See generally United States v. Stanley, </em>9 Cir., 1976, 545 F.2d 661, 667, <em>cert. denied, </em>1978, - U.S. -, 98 S.Ct. 2261, 56 L.Ed.2d 757 (1978); <em>United States v. Hill, </em>5 Cir., 1970, 430 F.2d 129, 131; Comment, 77 Yale L.J. 1007, 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">Finally, the authority embodied within \u00a7 1581 may be traced back to the commencement of the Republic when the First Congress statutorily granted Customs officials broad powers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The historical signifi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>canee of the enactment of such Customs statutes by the same Congress which proposed the Fourth Amendment has been recognized by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Ramsey, </em>1977, 431 U.S. 606, 97 S.Ct. 1972, 52 L.Ed.2d 617. Clearly, members of the First Congress regarded neither seizures nor searches of the kind authorized by \u00a7 1581 \u201cunreasonable\u201d or embraced by the prohibition \u00f3f the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Boyd v. United States, </em>1886, 116 U.S. 616, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the detention and boarding of the <em>Topographic Oceans </em>in Customs waters for the purpose of a document check was statutorily authorized and constitutionally permissible. We now examine the constitutionality of the search which flowed from the initial boarding and request to inspect the vessel\u2019s documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\"><em>The Search Of The </em>Topographic Oceans</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">Once aboard the sailboat, Customs Officer Sutton requested the vessel\u2019s documents. Graham\u2019s response that the papers were stowed below deck caused Officer McBride to glance down through a wide-open hatch where he saw a woman holding a baby hiding in one corner and another woman hiding under a table. Because the Customs Officers had the right to board the <em>Topographic Oceans </em>and inspect her papers, Officer McBride had a right to be in the position from which he had a \u201cplain view\u201d of the hiding passengers. His inadvertent discovery of this manifestly suspicious activity furnished the Officers with probable cause for believing that a crime \u2014 the illegal smuggling of aliens \u2014 -was in the process of being committed in their very presence. The sight of a woman holding a baby, trying to hide in the shadows of a corner, and of another woman crouching under a table <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>on a sailboat supposedly heading from West Palm Beach, was sufficiently suspicious to provide probable cause to search below deck. The officer who went below immediately discovered the numerous Haitian passengers. Consequently, the discovery of the suspicious activity and the resultant probable cause that arose fell within the justification afforded by the plain view doctrine. <em>See United States v. McDaniel, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 550 F.2d 214, 218; <em>Thompson v. Stynch-combe, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 494 F.2d 49; <em>United States v. Green, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 474 F.2d 1385, 1389; <em>United States v. Ragsdale, </em>5 Cir., 1972, 470 F.2d 24, 26 and n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">The warrantless search of the <em>Topographic Oceans </em>was constitutionally permissible because of the combination of probable cause and the exigent circumstances attendant to a moving vessel. <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>1925, 267 U.S. 132, 153, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543. <em>Cf. Katz v. U. S., </em>1967, 389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576; <em>United States v. Warren, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 578 F.2d 1058. Moreover, it was the mere demand to inspect the vessel\u2019s documents which precipitated the probable cause and ultimate discovery of the illegal aliens. Accordingly, the search was constitutionally justified by the plain view and exigent circumstances probable cause exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">\n<em>Tallrail Remarks</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">We hold that the Fourth Amendment allows Customs agents, acting under the authority conferred them by \u00a7 1581, to board vessels within customs waters for the purpose of conducting routine document checks. <em>See also </em>14 U.S.C. \u00a7 89(a). The brief detention resulting from routine administrative inspections of this kind do not violate the Constitution. Furthermore, we conclude that Customs agents, having boarded a vessel to check documents, may subsequently search the vessel where the observations of the lawfully present agents rise to the level of probable cause to search as was the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">Under the facts of this case, we find no need to determine what geographical limitations the Fourth Amendment places on searches made pursuant to \u00a7 1581(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nor need we decide, under the facts of this case, whether <em>Almeida-Sanchez, </em>1973, 413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596, is applicable to the unique context of the maritime customs search.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The discretionary \u00a7 1581(a) customs detention and boarding of a vessel in customs waters for the purpose of a routine document check is amply justified by Fourth Amendment principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">.

In reaching its conclusion, the District Court phrased its inquiry in a way that fully supported its subsequent ruling.

Because of the manner in which we decide the present case, we need not decide whether such broad power to search without probable cause conflicts with the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">The Ninth Circuit has concluded, however, that strict application of the literal language of the statute would subvert the Fourth Amendment. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>9 Cir., 1975, 528 F.2d 303, 304, <em>cert. denied, </em>1976, 425 U.S. 960, 96 S.Ct. 1745, 48 L.Ed.2d 206. Similarly, in a non-maritime, aerospace context we have clearly indicated that a literal reading of the customs search statute would lead to patent unconstitutionality. <em>United States v. Brennan, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 538 F.2d 711, 719 n.9, <em>cert. denied, </em>1977, 429 U.S. 1092, 97 S.Ct. 1104, 51 L.Ed.2d 538.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1006-14\">. Although we reserve the question whether <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>applies in an admiralty context, we point out that the Ninth Circuit has clearly adopted <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>to \u00a7 1581(a) searches. <em>United States v. Stanley, </em>9 Cir., 1976, 545 F.2d 601, 667, <em>cert. denied, </em>1978,-U.S.-, 98 S.Ct. 2661, 56 L.Ed.2d 757 (1978); <em>United States v. Tilton, </em>9 Cir., 1976, 534 F.2d 1363, 1366. Analogously, we have recently said that <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>applies to customs searches at airports. <em>United States v. Brennan, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 538 F.2d 711, 716-19, <em>cert. denied, </em>1977, 429 U.S. 1092, 97 S.Ct. 1104, 51 L.Ed.2d 538.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
