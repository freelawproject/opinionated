We agree that the Truth in Lending Act has no application to the transaction involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-15\">When a retailer arranges credit for his purchaser through a third party, the transaction of sale becomes a \u201ccredit transaction\u201d and the retailer becomes a \u201ccreditor\u201d subject to the terms of the Truth in Lending Act. <em>Stefanski v. Mainway Budget Plan, Inc., </em>456 F.2d 211 (5 Cir. 1972). In the instant case appellant signed an \u201corder\u201d for the purchase of an automobile she had chosen from appellee\u2019s lot. This document contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-16\">\u201c . . .IN THE EVENT OF A TIME SALE, DEALER SHALL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO SELL UNTIL APPROVAL OF THE TERMS HEREOF IS GIVEN BY A BANK OR FINANCE COMPANY WILLING TO PURCHASE A RETAIL INSTALMENT CONTRACT BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO BASED ON SUCH TERMS.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-18\">It is clear from this language and from the record as a whole that the parties contemplated that credit would be arranged through a third party by further action of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-19\">If the arrangements for the extension of credit had been completed there could be little question relating to the applicability of the Act. However, the transaction for extension of credit had not been completed at the time appellant expressed dissatisfaction with her prospective purchase. Consequently, negotiations failed and credit was never finally extended. The condition precedent contained in the \u201corder\u201d form requiring approval of an appropriate financier indicates that further action was necessary to consummate the extension of credit. <em>Philbeck v. Timmer\u2019s Chevrolet, Inc., </em>361 F.Supp. 1255, 1257 n. 1 (NDGa. 1973). Ap-pellee was obligated to make the proper disclosures prior to the extension of credit, but the Truth in Lending Act does not impose penalty until credit is in fact extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-20\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-13\">. The District Court declined to exercise its pendant jurisdiction over the warranty claim raised under State law. Consequently, this State claim was dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
