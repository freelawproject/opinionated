The 1972 amendments did not, however, deal expressly with such third party actions against stevedores by plaintiffs other than vessels. The primary issue on this appeal is whether a \u201cnon-vessel\u201d can recover from a stevedore with whom the non-vessel has been found jointly responsible for injury to the stevedore\u2019s employees. The issue has caused considerable division among the district courts. Compare <em>Spadola v. Viking Yacht Co., </em>441 F.Supp. 798 (S.D.N.Y.1977); <em>S.S. Seatrain Louisiana v. California Stevedore and Ballast Co., </em>424 F.Supp. 180 (N.D.Cal.1976); <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Compania Naviera La Molinera, </em>394 F.Supp. 402 (E.D.La.1974) (denying recovery), with the decision in the instant case, 434 F.Supp. 567 (S.D.N.Y.1977); <em>Gould v.

Kurz &amp; Co., </em>483 F.2d 184 (9 Cir. 1973) (denying recovery on theory that \u201cRyan\u201d indemnity requires a seaworthiness obligation). See generally <em>Ramirez v. A/S D/A Svendborg, </em>75 Civ. 703 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 22, <em>1976); Petrosino v. Wilhelmson, </em>75 Civ. 1181 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 1976); <em>Nieves </em>v. <em>Douglas Steamship, Ltd., </em>451 F.Supp. 407 (S.D.N.Y. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">On April 12, 1974, Joseph Zapico was killed and Adolfo Millan was injured in an accident aboard the S.S. Atlantic Causeway, a vessel owned by Cunard Steamship Co., Ltd. Zapico and Millan were longshoremen employed by Atlantic Container Line, Ltd. (ACL), a stevedore. The accident occurred during the course of loading a large hydro-crane manufactured by the Bucyrus-Erie Company (Bucyrus). As the vehicle was being driven down a ramp inside the vessel, it went out of control, causing the death of Zapico and injuries to Millan. A jury found that defendant and third party plaintiff Bucyrus negligently manufactured the crane, that third party defendant ACL fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>nished an incompetent employee to drive it, and that each was 50% responsible for the accident. Judge Owen held these findings supported by the record, stating that the facts were consistent with a conclusion that \u201cwhile brake failure could have set the tragedy in motion, a competent driver could have taken reasonable steps to avoid it.\u201d In so concluding, the judge recognized that the jury also found the driver of the crane, ACL employee Antonio Fuet, not himself \u201cnegligent in his driving of the truck-crane, although it found him incompetent to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">ACL argued that it was immune from a third party suit since, as a compensation-paying employer, it had no liability under the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 905(a), 905(b), beyond the payment of workmen\u2019s compensation. Judge Owen rejected this argument, holding that while the Act immunized the stevedore from liability for contribution to Bucyrus, it did not cut off suit for partial indemnity. Although there was no express indemnification agreement nor a direct contractual relationship between ACL and Bucyrus, the court accepted Bucy-rus\u2019 argument that it was entitled to indemnity either as a third party beneficiary of the implied warranty of workmanlike performance in the stevedoring contract between ACL and the vessel or on a theory of \u201cquasi-contract.\u201d The court therefore entered judgment against Bucyrus for the full jury award, and ordered that \u201cupon payment by Bucyrus-Erie Co. of the judgment [it] shall recover from Atlantic Container Line, Ltd. . . . 50% of the amount . . . paid . . . .\u201d Thereafter ACL appealed solely from that portion of the judgment awarding Bucyrus partial recovery against it. Bucyrus did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">As a preliminary matter, we note ACL\u2019s argument that there was \u201cno basis in the record for the finding of any fault\u201d on its part. According to ACL, there were two possible theories embodied in Judge Owen\u2019s instructions upon which the jury could find ACL liable. These were that its employee Fuet, the driver of the crane, was himself negligent, or that a signalman negligently gave an all-clear sign to Fuet as he drove down the ramp. ACL argues that since the jury upon a special interrogatory found Fuet not negligent, and there was no evidence that the signalman was an ACL employee, there was no basis for assigning blame to ACL. The trial judge held, however, that the jury\u2019s finding of 50% responsibility on the part of ACL was supportable on the basis of its affirmative answer to the question whether ACL \u201cwrongfully failed to provide a competent employee or employees including the driver for the hydrocrane . .\u201d Bucyrus argues that this was consistent with the theory that although Fuet on the basis of his abilities was not found negligent, ACL may nevertheless be held for negligence in hiring an employee incapable of exercising the reasonable care required for proper performance of the job, see 8 A.L.R. 574 (1920). There was ample evidence that Mr. Fuet was incompetent to operate a hydrocrane, since he testified that he had never driven one before, never received instruction how to drive one, and could not read instruction booklets printed in English. As we conclude that, even if thus negligent, ACL was not subject to a third party suit by Bucyrus, we need not pass on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">We begin with common ground. Section 905(a) of the LHWCA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-11\">\u00a7 <em>905 Exclusiveness of liability</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Lk\">(a) The liability of an employer prescribed in section 904 of this title shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee, his legal representative, husband or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin, and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury or death .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">ACL and Bucyrus agree that this section immunizes a compensation-paying employer from third party claims for contribution. See, e. g., <em>American Mutual Liability Insurance Co. v. Matthews, </em>182 F.2d 322 (2 Cir. 1950); <em>Galimi v. Jetco, Inc., </em>514 F.2d 949, 956 (2 Cir. 1975); <em>Lopez v. Oldendorf, </em>545 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>F.2d 836 (2 Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 938, 97 S.Ct. 2650, 53 L.Ed.2d 256 (1977). However, Bucyrus argues that, as Judge Owen held, neither \u00a7 905(a) nor any other section of the Act bars its claim for partial indemnity. Predictably ACL finds this to be a mere semantic distinction without a difference. It will be useful to begin by considering the origins and nature of the two doctrines, although the discussion will necessarily traverse some familiar ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">When two or more persons\u2019 torts together cause injury, each is fully liable to the victim. Prosser, Law of Torts \u00a7 52, at 314 (4th ed. 1971). Under the principle of contribution, a tortfeasor against whom a judgment is rendered seeks to recover proportional shares of the judgment \u201cfrom other joint tortfeasors whose negligence contributed to the injury and who are also liable to the plaintiff\u201d. <em>Dawson v. Contractors Transportation Corp., </em>151 U.S.App.D.C. 401, 467 F.2d 727 (1972). The historic bar to this was the common law \u201crule\u201d that there can be no contribution among joint tortfeasors. The rule had its origin in <em>Merryweather v. Nixan, </em>8 Term.Rep. 186, 101 Eng.Rep. 1337 (K.B.1799), which itself involved intentional rather than negligent action in concert, and both English and early American cases applied the rule only in that context. Early 20th-century American courts began to disregard the caveat and there was soon a firm rule barring apportionment of loss among multiple tortfeasors. See generally Prosser, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 50 at 305-06; <em>Contribution and Indemnity in California, </em>57 Calif.L.Rev. 490, 493-94 (1969) [hereinafter Contribution]; Davis, <em>Indemnity between Negligent Tortfeasors, </em>37 Iowa L.Rev. 517 (1952). The oft-expressed \u201crationale\u201d was that as a matter of policy the courts ought not \u201cto make relative value judgments of degrees of culpability among wrongdoers,\u201d see <em>Dole v. Dow Chemical Co., </em>30 N.Y.2d 143, 147, 331 N.Y. S.2d 382, 386, 282 N.E.2d 288, 291 (1972); having been himself a wrongdoer, the defendant unlucky enough to have been sued first had only himself to blame and the courts would not sustain a claim founded upon his own wrong. See generally Leflar, <em>Contribution and Indemnity Between Tort-feasors, </em>81 U.Pa.L.Rev. 130, 131-35 (1932). It was not until the middle of this century that the rule against contribution was generally abrogated, occasionally by judicial action but more often by statute. See Pros-ser, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 50 at 307; <em>Contribution, supra, </em>57 Calif.L.Rev. at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">In contrast to the rule against apportionment of damages among joint tortfeasors was the doctrine of indemnity. Under this theory, the tortfeasor who had been cast in judgment sought not a proportionate sharing as in contribution, but rather a shifting of the loss from the one who had been forced to pay it \u201cto the shoulders of another who should bear it instead.\u201d Prosser, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 51 at 310. Somehow this seemed more palatable to courts operating in the common law tradition. See <em>Contribution and Indemnity under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, </em>6 U.Toledo L.Rev. 273, 275 (1974); <em>Rock v. Reed-Prentice, </em>39 N.Y.2d 34, 39, 382 N.Y.S.2d 720, 722, 346 N.E.2d 520, 522 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Indemnity was available on a number of grounds. One, which we may call tort indemnity, was based \u201cmerely upon a difference between the kinds of negligence of the two tortfeasors; as for instance, if that of the indemnitee is only \u2018passive,\u2019 while that of the indemnitor is \u2018active.\u2019 \u201d <em>Slattery v. Marra Bros., </em>186 F.2d 134, 138 (2 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>341 U.S. 915, 71 S.Ct. 736, 95 L.Ed. 1351 (1951). See also <em>Wallenius Bremen v. United States, </em>409 F.2d 994, 998 (4 Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>398 U.S. 958, 90 S.Ct. 2164, 26 L.Ed.2d 542 (1970); <em>Contribution, supra, </em>57 Calif.L.Rev. at 499. As Judge Learned Hand perceived, \u201c[s]uch cases may perhaps be accounted for as lenient exceptions to the doctrine that there can be no contribution between joint tortfeasors . . When both are liable to the same person for a single joint wrong, and contribution, <em>stricti juris, </em>is impossible, the temptation is strong if the faults differ greatly in gravity, to throw the whole loss upon the more guilty of the two.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>While this tort-based form of indemnity was hardly distinguishable from contribution, two other common forms clearly were. Indemnity could be based either on an express contract of indemnification or on a relationship between the two tortfeasors from which a covenant to indemnify could fairly be implied. See 2A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law 324, 334 (1976); <em>Contribution, supra, </em>57 Calif.L.Rev. at 492-93. In these areas, the person cast in judgment obtained indemnity not because of joint breaches of a tort duty to the victim as in tort indemnity, see Leflar, <em>supra, </em>81 U.Pa.L.Rev. at 147, but because of a contractual duty owed by the indemnitor to the indemnitee.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Workmen\u2019s compensation statutes like the LHWCA added an important new element to the problem because of their exclusive liability sections, as exemplified by 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a). Prior to the 1972 amendments, however, judicial interpretation of the viability of contribution and indemnity actions under the LHWCA largely paralleled the early 20th century treatment of these doctrines at common law: contribution was forbidden, but indemnity was permitted although only if contract-based. The leading Supreme Court case on contribution was <em>Halcyon Lines v. Haenn Ship Ceiling &amp; Refitting Corp., </em>342 U.S. 282, 72 S.Ct. 277, 96 L.Ed. 318 (1952), in which the Court held there was no right of contribution between joint tortfeasors in non-collision maritime cases. Although the Court did not rest its opinion on \u00a7 905(a) (then \u00a7 905) but rather on the common law rule against contribution, refusing to extend the admiralty doctrine of loss-splitting to non-collision cases in the absence of legislation, later decisions do appear to rest the <em>Halcyon </em>non-contribution rule on \u00a7 905(a). See <em>Cooper Stevedoring Co. v. Fritz Kopke, Inc., </em>417 U.S. 106, 94 S.Ct. 2174, 40 L.Ed.2d 694 (1974), <em>discussed in Galimi v. Jetco, Inc., supra, </em>514 F.2d at 955-56. In any event, this Circuit has long viewed \u00a7 905(a) (and the old \u00a7 905) as preventing a third party claim for contribution from the employing stevedore, see <em>Porello v. United States, </em>153 F.2d 605 (2 Cir. 1946), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>330 U.S. 446, 67 S.Ct. 847, 91 L.Ed. 1011 (1947); <em>American Mutual Liability Ins. Co. v. Matthews, supra, </em>182 F.2d 322; <em>Slat-tery v. Marra Bros., supra, </em>186 F.2d 134; <em>Lopez v. Oldendorf, supra, </em>545 F.2d 836. The cases have relied either on a \u201clinguistic analysis\u201d of the section or on the theory that the statute\u2019s elimination of the employer\u2019s tort liability to the victim makes it impossible for him to be jointly liable as a tortfeasor with any other party. See <em>Gali-mi, supra, </em>514 F.2d at 953, 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Four years after <em>Halcyon, </em>the Supreme Court considered the second of the doctrines, indemnity. In <em>Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic S. S. Corp., </em>350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956), the Court held that in a suit for indemnity, unlike contribution, a shipowner could recover against a stevedoring contractor amounts paid by the ship to the stevedore\u2019s employee in a personal injury suit arising out of the unsafe stowage of cargo. The Court first considered the hypothetical case of a stevedore\u2019s express contract to indemnify the shipowner. Justice Burton noted that \u00a7 905 made compensation payments the employer\u2019s exclusive liability to its employee, or to anyone \u201cclaiming under or through such employee, <em>on account of his injury or death arising out of that employment.\u201d </em>350 U.S. at 129, 76 S.Ct. at 235 (emphasis in original). But he stated that in the event of a formal bond of indemnity, the employer\u2019s liability</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-8\">springs from an independent contractual right. It is not an action by or on behalf of the employee and it is not one to recover damages \u201con account of\u201d an employee\u2019s \u201cinjury or death.\u201d It is a simple action to recover, under a voluntary and self-sufficient contract .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 130, 76 S.Ct. at 235. This analysis was then extended to the case at bar where no express contract of indemnity existed. The Court held that even without an express contract, the ship could sue based on the warranty of workmanlike performance implied in the contractual relationship between stevedore and shipowner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>The shipowner here holds petitioner\u2019s un-controverted agreement to perform all of the shipowner\u2019s stevedoring operations at the time and place where the cargo in question was loaded. That agreement necessarily includes petitioner\u2019s obligation not only to stow the pulp rolls, but to stow them properly and safely. Competency and safety of stowage are inescapable elements of the service undertaken. This obligation is not a quasi-contractual obligation implied in law or arising out of a noncontractual relationship. It is of the essence of petitioner\u2019s stevedoring contract. It is petitioner\u2019s warranty of workmanlike service that is comparable to a manufacturer\u2019s warranty of the soundness of its manufactured product. <em>Id. </em>at 133-34, 76 S.Ct. at 237.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-4\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">Petitioner\u2019s agreement ... is a contractual undertaking to stow the cargo \u201cwith reasonable safety\u201d and thus to save the shipowner harmless from petitioner\u2019s failure to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 130, 76 S.Ct. at 235.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">While the <em>Ryan </em>Court expressly did not decide whether a claim based on non-contractual tort indemnity could overcome the \u00a7 905 exclusivity clause, <em>id. </em>at 133, 76 S.Ct. 232; <em>Federal Marine Terminals, Inc. v. Burnside Shipping Co., </em>394 U.S. 404, 421 &amp; n.26, 89 S.Ct. 1144, 22 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969), unlike a contract-based claim such a suit clearly would be \u201con account of\u201d the employee\u2019s injury<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and hence a Ryan-like analysis would not save it from the force of \u00a7 905. Later Supreme Court cases have so intimated, see <em>Weyerhaeuser S. S. Co. v. Nacirema Operating Co., </em>355 U.S. 563, 569, 78 S.Ct. 438, 2 L.Ed.2d 491 (1958), and that is the law of this Circuit, see <em>Slattery v. Marra Bros., supra, </em>186 F.2d at 138-39; <em>Williams v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., </em>313 F.2d 203, 210 (1963), as well as of the majority of jurisdictions, see 2A. Larson, <em>supra, </em>at 394. But cf. <em>Wallenius Bremen, supra, </em>409 F.2d 994 (FECA case). The district judge\u2019s reliance on a theory of \u201cquasi contract\u201d was thus misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">Of course, it may be argued that even contractual indemnity is really \u201con account of\u201d the employee\u2019s injury as there would be no indemnity without it; that \u201cthe <em>Ryan </em>contractual indemnity theory seems to have been in hopeless contradiction with the <em>Halcyon </em>no contribution theory,\u201d Gilmore &amp; Black, The Law of Admiralty 443 (2d ed. 1975); see generally Cohen &amp; Dougherty, <em>The 1972 Amendments to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, </em>19 N.Y.L.F. 587, 592 (1974); that <em>Ryan </em>frustrated the intent of the Compensation Act, see Friendly, Federal Jurisdiction; A General View 131-32 (1973); and that therefore, as ACL contends, the distinction between \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cindemnity\u201d is merely one of semantics.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, these arguments were made in <em>Ryan </em>itself, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>350 U.S. at 135, 141, 76 S.Ct. 232 (Black, <em>J., </em>dissenting), and at least until the 1972 amendments the right to contract-based indemnity even against a compensation-paying stevedore was established law. See, e. g., <em>Weyerhaeuser S. S. Co. v. Nacirema Operating Co., supra, </em>355 U.S. 563, 78 S.Ct. 438, 2 L.Ed.2d 491; <em>Waterman S. S. Corp. </em>v. <em>Dugan &amp; McNamara, Inc., </em>364 U.S. 421, 81 S.Ct. 200, 5 L.Ed.2d 169 (1960); <em>Porello v. United States, supra, </em>153 F.2d at 608; <em>Rich v. United States, </em>177 F.2d 688 (2 Cir. 1949); <em>American Mutual Liability Ins. Co., supra, </em>182 F.2d at 324; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania R. R. Co., supra, </em>313 F.2d at 210; 2A Larson, <em>supra, </em>at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Section 905(b) of the LHWCA, added in 1972, reads in- pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">In the event of injury to a person covered under this chapter caused by the negligence of a vessel, then such person, or anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages by reason thereof, may bring an action against such vessel as a third party <em>and the employer shall not be liable to the vessel for such damages directly or indirectly and any agreements or warranties to the contrary shall be void.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b) (emphasis added). ACL argues that the italicized phrase was meant not only to reverse <em>Ryan </em>on its own facts but to prevent recovery on any indemnity theory, whether express or implied, by any third party plaintiff against a compensation-paying employer. However, the statute explicitly cuts off indemnity only to a \u201cvessel,\u201d which was defined by the 1972 amendments as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">The term \u201cvessel\u201d means any vessel upon which . . . any person entitled to benefits under this chapter suffers injury or death . . . and said vessel\u2019s owner, owner pro hac vice, agent, operator, charter or bare boat charterer, master, officer or crew member.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(21). The general definitional statute, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 3, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-14\">The word \u201cvessel\u201d includes every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-15\">Under these definitions, Bucyrus clearly is not a vessel. The legislative history likewise is of no assistance to ACL. It does indicate that \u00a7 905(b) was meant to prevent Ryan indemnity actions by vessels, but does not mention suits by non-vessels one way or the other. See H.R.Rep.No. 1441, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972), reproduced <em>in </em>3 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 4698, 4701-05 (1972). Neither does ACL necessarily have the better of the legislative policy argument. There is no assurance, as the stevedore claims, that if Congress had considered non-vessels it would have cut them off as well in order to make compensation payments the sole liability of the employer and to stop triangular suits once and for all. The shipowners got a <em>quid pro quo </em>for the loss of their indemnity rights. Prior to the 1972 amendments they were liable to injured longshoremen not only for the ship\u2019s own negligence but also on a strict liability theory (the \u201cunseaworthiness\u201d doctrine) for conditions which often were actually created by the stevedore. See <em>Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, </em>328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946); <em>DeGioia v. United States Lines Co., </em>304 F.2d 421, 425-26 (2 Cir. 1962); footnote 2, <em>supra. </em>The 1972 amendments eliminated the unseaworthiness theory and limited vessel liability to negligence<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in exchange for the surrender of the vessel\u2019s indemnity rights. See H.R.Rep.No. 1441, <em>supra, </em>3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 4701-05 (1972); <em>Munoz v. Flota Merchante Grancolombiana, S.A., </em>553 F.2d 837, 840 (2 Cir. 1977). No such <em>quid pro quo </em>was offered to non-vessels. Given the clear statutory language and the absence of legislative history at variance with it, we would hesitate to hold that \u00a7 905(b) by its own force cuts off the availability of <em>Ryan </em>indemnity to a non-vessel in all cases where the concurring negligence of a stevedoring compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>ny has caused injuries to the latter\u2019s employees, see generally <em>Gould v. General Mills, Inc., supra, </em>411 F.Supp. at 1183; <em>Crutchfield v. Atlas, supra, </em>403 F.Supp. 920; <em>Brkaric v. Star Iron, supra, </em>409 F.Supp. at 520, for example, although we do not intend these to be exclusive, where there is a direct contractual relationship between the third party and the stevedore or where the third party is designated as a beneficiary of an express contract between the stevedore and a vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">However, even if so much should be accepted, Bucyrus still has the heavy burden of finding an implied agreement by the stevedore to indemnify it. As we have already indicated, only contract-based indemnity could overcome the \u201con account of\u201d language of \u00a7 905(a). Here there was no express contract of indemnity between Bucyrus and ACL. Instead, Bucyrus argues that we should focus on the contractual relationship between the stevedore and the vessel, that an implied warranty of workmanlike performance arising out of that relationship still exists although it cannot be enforced by the vessel, and that this extends to the benefit of a third party like itself. It is true that both the Supreme Court and this court have held that a lack of privity does not necessarily bar recovery under a theory of contractual indemnity. See <em>Crumaday v. J. H. Fisser, </em>358 U.S. 423, 428, 79 S.Ct. 445, 3 L.Ed.2d 413 (1959); <em>Waterman S.S. Corp. v. Dugan &amp; McNamara, Inc., supra, </em>364 U.S. at 423, 81 S.Ct. 200; <em>DeGioia v. United States Lines Co., supra, </em>304 F.2d at 425; <em>Williams v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., supra, </em>313 F.2d at 212; <em>La Capria v. Compagnie Maritime Beige, </em>427 F.2d 244 (2 Cir. 1970). See also <em>United States v. San Francisco Elevator Co., </em>512 F.2d 23 (9 Cir. 1975). However, we have been cited to no authority and we know of no principle that would place Bucyrus within the \u201czone of responsibility\u201d see <em>DeGioia, supra, </em>304 F.2d at 425, created by ACL\u2019s contract with the ship and the warranty implicit therein. The law of contracts relating to third party beneficiaries distinguishes between intended and incidental beneficiaries. The Restatement of Contracts 2d \u00a7 133(1) (Tent.Draft No. 4, April 25, 1968) defines the former as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvEI\">\u00a7 133. Intended and Incidental Beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">(1) Unless otherwise agreed between promisor and promisee, a beneficiary of a promise is an intended beneficiary if recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties and either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">(a) the performance of the promise will satisfy an obligation of the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-8\">(b) the promise manifests an intention to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">An \u201cincidental beneficiary\u201d is a beneficiary who is not an intended beneficiary, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 122(a); he \u201cacquires by virtue of the promise no right against the promisor or the promisee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 147 (Tent.Draft, No. 3, April 18, 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">The record does not make clear what relationship Bucyrus had to the ship. Although Judge Owen, 434 F.Supp. at 570, and an <em>amicus </em>brief, Brief Amicus Curiae of the National Assoc. of Stevedores at 3, characterize Bucyrus as a \u201cconsignor,\u201d ACL asserts that \u201cBucyrus was neither the owner nor 'the shipper of the hydrocrane, but was only a remote manufacturer.\u201d Reply Brief at 4. The record does not permit resolution of this conflict. Even if we were to accept that Bucyrus was consignor of the crane, we see nothing to indicate that the stevedore\u2019s warranty to the vessel would cover the liability of a consignor for injury to a longshoreman. In each of the cited cases which extended the warranty beyond two-party contractual relations, this was done for the benefit of the ship itself. See <em>Crumaday, supra, </em>358 U.S. 423, 79 S.Ct. 445, 3 L.Ed.2d 413 (contract between stevedore and charterer extended for benefit of ship); <em>Waterman, supra, </em>364 U.S. 421, 81 S.Ct. 200, 5 L.Ed.2d 169 (contract between consignee and stevedore extended to the ship); <em>DiGi-oia, supra, </em>304 F.2d 421 (contract between stevedore and army to unload ship at army base); <em>Williams, supra, </em>313 F.2d 203 (contract between stevedore and a second ship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>helping to unload the third party plaintiff ship); La <em>Capria, supra, </em>427 F.2d 244, 247 (warranty of freight forwarder extended to ship without express contract when it \u201chad a monopoly on certain piers, knew . . . that the [cargo was] destined to be loaded on the vessel . and charged the ship for part of its services . .\u201d); <em>San Francisco Elevator, supra, </em>512 F.2d 23 (warranty of contractor to shipyard extended to vessel). In the cited cases it was clear that the warranty was really \u201cfor the benefit of the vessel,\u201d <em>Crumaday, supra, </em>358 U.S. at 428, 79 S.Ct. at 448, and that the third party plaintiff was \u201cinvolved in a close working relationship with [the stevedore],\u201d <em>Williams, supra, </em>313 F.2d at 212. Similarly, <em>Sanderlin </em>v. <em>Old Dominion Stevedoring Corp., </em>385 F.2d 79, 82-83 (4 Cir. 1967), where a ship\u2019s cargo checker was allowed to sue a negligent stevedore who had contracted with the ship, went on the basis that allowing the action was proper to avoid \u201cneedless and undesirable circuity\u201d and that \u201c[t]he stevedore who makes the warranty to the shipowner cannot escape the knowledge that if his performance is defective, it is the maritime employees of the shipowner who are likely to suffer.\u201d It would be going much further to hold that any warranty by ACL contemplated indemnifying consignors (assuming Bucyrus to have been one) whose defective equipment, along with the stevedore\u2019s sub-standard performance, caused injury to the stevedore\u2019s own employees for whom the latter had provided workmen\u2019s compensation. Actually, there is as much \u2014 or rather as little \u2014 reason to say that ACL was an intended third-party beneficiary of Bucyrus\u2019 \u201cwarranty\u201d of its product as to say that Bucyrus was an intended third-party beneficiary of ACL\u2019s warranty to the ship. In a sense, Bucyrus is asking us to hold a user liable to a manufacturer for the former\u2019s negligent use of the latter\u2019s defective product. This we decline to do. Cf. 2A Larson, <em>supra, </em>at 402 (\u201cBut when a purchaser buys a product, does he make an implied contract with the manufacturer to use the goods in such a way as not to bring liability upon the manufacturer? This would be stretching the concept of contract out of all relation to reality.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Bucyrus also cites us to several Second Circuit cases, e. g., <em>Munoz v. Flota Mer-chante, supra, </em>553 F.2d 837, which state that placing responsibility on the stevedore is in keeping with the intent of the 1972 amendments because the stevedore is in the best position to prevent accidents. The statements were meant, however, to apply as between the stevedore and a ship being sued for negligence, since the ship normally leaves the stevedore in day-to-day control of operations. Such statements are inappo-site to the relation between a stevedore and a manufacturer. The manufacturer can increase his level of care before the goods ever leave his plant, while the stevedore may be unable to protect his men against latent defects in the manufacturer\u2019s equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">On these facts, therefore, we find that there is simply not enough of a nexus to imply an agreement by ACL to indemnify Bucyrus based on the independent contract between ship and stevedore. If anything, this case presents a weaker argument for so doing than did the portion of <em>Hartnett v. Reiss Steamship Co., </em>421 F.2d 1011, 1017 (2 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 852, 91 S.Ct. 49, 27 L.Ed.2d 90 (1970), where we refused to extend one stevedore\u2019s warranty to a vessel to benefit a co-stevedore.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Isbrandtsen Co. </em>v. <em>Local 1291, </em>204 F.2d 495 (3 Cir. 1953) (holding that a charterer of a ship delayed in unloading as a result of an unauthorized work stoppage by longshoremen could not recover damages from the longshoremen\u2019s union as third-party beneficiary of the union\u2019s collective bargaining contract with a marine trade association of which the stevedoring company retained to unload the ship was a member), discussed in <em>Williams, supra, </em>313 F.2d at 212. We therefore have no occasion to consider other arguments made by ACL.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Bucyrus has asked that, if we should reject the district court\u2019s conclusion with respect to partial indemnity, we should nevertheless reduce its liability to its proportionate share of the damages on the basis of other theories that have surfaced in the last decade. These theories, which are based on a feeling that there is something wrong in making the negligent third party bear the whole load, attempt to avoid the stricture against contribution on the part of a compensation-paying employer in <em>Halcyon v. Haenn, supra, </em>342 U.S. 282, 72 S.Ct. 277, 96 L.Ed. 318, by instead reducing the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. Under one of these theories, announced in <em>Murray v. United States, </em>132 U.S.App.D.C. 91, 405 F.2d 1361 (1968), a case arising under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, the court argued that by accepting compensation payments the injured employee had effectively settled 50% of his claim with his negligent employer, thereby correspondingly reducing the liability of the jointly responsible defendant tort-feasor. In <em>Dawson v. Contractors Transport Corp., supra, </em>151 U.S.App.D.C. 401, 467 F.2d 727, the court assumed that the <em>\u201cMurray </em>credit\u201d would apply in actions under the LHWCA, which was the applicable workmen\u2019s compensation statute in the District of Columbia, although noting that a district court, see <em>Turner v. Excavation Construction Co., </em>324 F.Supp. 704 (D.D.C.1971) had \u201carticulated some difficulties it had with the <em>Murray </em>rule\u201d because of \u201cthe apparent inability of an employer, if <em>Murray </em>is applied, to obtain reimbursement for payments made under the compensation statute,\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933. See also <em>Brkaric v. Star Iron &amp; Steel Co., supra, </em>409 F.Supp. 516; <em>Crowshaw v. Koninklijke Nedlloyd, </em>398 F.Supp. 1224 (D.Ore.1975); Cohen &amp; Dougherty, <em>supra, </em>19 N.Y.L.F. at 606; Coleman, <em>The 1972 Amendments to the LHWCA: Life Expectancy of an Equitable Credit, </em>12 The Forum 683 (Section of Insurance, Negligence and Compensation Law, ABA) (Winter 1977) (generally approving of various formulae reducing plaintiff\u2019s recovery). The Ninth Circuit has rejected the <em>Murray </em>credit or an alternative that would determine the amount of the \u201ccredit\u201d by the proportion of the employer\u2019s negligence, <em>Dodge v. Mitsui Shintaku Ginko K.K. Tokyo, </em>528 F.2d 669, 672 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 944, 96 S.Ct. 1685, 48 L.Ed.2d 188 (1976); <em>Shellman v. United States Lines, </em>528 F.2d 675 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 936, 96 S.Ct. 1668, 48 L.Ed.2d 177 (1976). See also <em>Lucas v. \u201cBrinknes\" Schiffahrts Ges., </em>379 F.Supp. 759 (E.D.Pa.1973) (three-judge court); <em>Hubbard v.

In <em>Marant v. Farrell Lines, Inc., </em>550 F.2d 142 (1977), a divided Third Circuit surveyed the problem without deciding it; Judge Van Dusen, who objected to the extensive observations, thought that statements in our decision in <em>Landon v. Lief Hoegh and Co., </em>521 F.2d 756 (2 Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1053, 96 S.Ct. 783, 46 L.Ed.2d 642 (1976), would necessarily align us with the Ninth Circuit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A few months after <em>Marant </em>a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit proffered a new variation in <em>Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, </em>558 F.2d 186 (1977), rehearing en banc granted June 30, 1977 and heard on October 6, 1977. Apparently recognizing the tension between the <em>Murray </em>credit and the stevedore\u2019s compensation lien, see footnote 5, the majority announced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>a rule whereby the plaintiff would recover from the non-employer tortfeasor an amount determined by multiplying the amount of the judgment by the latter\u2019s percentage of fault and adding the compensation payments refundable to the employer. Here the trial judge declined to adopt the <em>Edmonds </em>rule, largely on the basis of Judge Van Dusen\u2019s prediction of our attitude in <em>Mar ant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\"> Although, for a reason hereafter stated, Bucyrus\u2019 claims are not properly before us, we think that <em>Landon v. Leif Hoegh </em>does commit us, see footnote 5, against any \u201ccredit\u201d that by considerably reducing the longshoreman\u2019s award from a negligent non-employer might impair the right of even a negligent employer fully to recoup his compensation payments out of that award. Indeed we do not see how any other conclusion is possible under <em>Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, </em>346 U.S. 406, 412, 74 5. Ct. 202, 98 L.Ed. 143 (1953), which condemned impairment of the stevedore\u2019s right of recoupment. <em>Edmonds </em>avoids such impairment, although one is still left to wonder why the longshoreman injured by the negligence of a third party should recover less when his employer has also been negligent than when the employer has been without fault. However, we cannot decide on this appeal whether or not to follow <em>Edmonds. </em>Application of <em>Edmonds </em>in this case would reduce the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery from the amounts awarded by the jury to 50% of these amounts plus the compensation repayable to ACL. Unless the latter equals 50% of the judgment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the plaintiffs would receive less under <em>Edmonds </em>than the jury awarded; if the repayable compensation does equal 50%, Bucyrus would not benefit from application of <em>Edmonds. </em>But Bucyrus took no cross-appeal from the judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and the latter have consequently not been heard. The rule that a party may support a judgment on a basis not decided or even rejected by the lower court does not go so far as to enable Bucyrus to raise on ACL\u2019s appeal from the grant of partial indemnity a claim that the plaintiffs\u2019 unappealed judgments against it should be reduced. Compare <em>United States v. American Railway Express Co., </em>265 U.S. 425, 435-36, 44 S.Ct. 560, 68 L.Ed. 1087 (1924); <em>Langnes v. Green, </em>282 U.S. 531, 535-39, 51 S.Ct. 243, 75 L.Ed. 520 (1931); 9 Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 204.-11[3], at 932-33, with <em>Whitehead v. American Security &amp; Trust Co., </em>109 U.S.App.D.C. 202, 285 F.2d 282 (1960); <em>United States v. Bertman, </em>Doc. No. 28784 (2 Cir. Jan. 31, 1964) (unreported), <em>cert. denied sub nom.

Maryland Casualty Co., </em>300 U.S. 185, 57 S.Ct. 325, 81 L.Ed. 593 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">We do not pretend to complete satisfaction with the result we have been compelled to reach. Bucyrus will now be obliged to pay the entire damages although the jury found it only 50% responsible and the employer will recover part or, more likely, all of his compensation payments despite his own 50% responsibility.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A court may well feel tempted to cut the Gordian knot and simply apportion liability according to fault on a contribution-like theory, as the New York Court of Appeals did in <em>Dole v. Dow Chemical Co., supra, </em>30 N.Y.2d 143, 331 N.Y.S.2d 382, 282 N.E.2d 288, despite a section of that state\u2019s compensation law almost identical to \u00a7 905(a) of the LHWCA. See <em>Rock v. Reed-Prentice, supra, </em>39 N.Y.2d 34, 382 N.Y.S.2d 720, 346 N.E.2d 520 (1976). The district judge was actuated by considerations of this sort. But <em>Halcyon v. Haenn </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>prevents us from following <em>Dole, </em>we cannot adopt the district court\u2019s expanded notion of indemnity, and Bucyrus\u2019 failure to cross-appeal precludes us from considering any proposals that would reduce the amount of plaintiffs\u2019 judgments even if we were otherwise persuaded to do so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">The judgment is reversed with instructions to dismiss the third-party complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-7\">. Although it is occasionally said that an \u201cactive\u201d tortfeasor incurs an implied obligation to reimburse a \u201cpassive\u201d tortfeasor, \u201cthe origin of the action is in the injury itself and the circumstances surrounding it, and the liabilities that it creates and the indemnity obligation itself spring exclusively from the comparison of the relationships of the two parties to that injury.\u201d 2A Larson, <em>supra, </em>at 293. See Leflar, <em>supra, </em>81 U.Pa.L.Rev. at 146-47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b778-8\">. In reply it might be said that Congress had not clearly manifested an intention to cut off suits for indemnity by third parties against employers; after all, it was only the employee who received a <em>quid pro quo </em>(compensation payments without the need to prove fault) as a substitute for tort recovery, while third parties (e. g., shipowners before 1972) \u201creceived absolutely nothing, and hence should not be impliedly held to have given up rights which [they] had before.\u201d See 2A Larson, <em>supra, </em>at 407. Perhaps the root of the problem was neither <em>Ryan </em>nor <em>Halcyon </em>but rather the Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Seas Shipping Co. v. Sier-acki, </em>328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946), and its progeny which allowed injured longshoremen to sue shipowners under the absolute liability \u201cunseaworthiness\u201d doctrine for accidents actually created by the longshoreman\u2019s employer, thus necessitating a decision like <em>Ryan </em>so that ultimate liability would not rest on the innocent (or relatively innocent) shipowner, as it would have if only <em>Sieracki </em>and <em>Halcyon </em>stood as law. See p. 721, <em>infra. Of </em>course, <em>Sieracki </em>itself was no doubt motivated in part by the inadequate level of compensation payments available under LHWCA prior to the 1972 amendments. See generally <em>Munoz v. Flota Merchante Grancolombiana, S.A., </em>553 F.2d 837, 839-40 (2 Cir. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b779-12\">.

The verdicts were $113,271 for Millan, and $314,197.50 for Mrs. Zapico and her children after deducting 25% for Zapico\u2019s contributory negligence as found by the jury.

A solution preferable either to <em>Dole, </em>which fails to give adequate weight to the employer\u2019s no fault liability and thus may leave him liable for an amount in excess of statutory compensation payments, or to <em>Edmonds, </em>which irrationally reduces an employee\u2019s recovery against a third party tortfeasor because of the employer\u2019s negligence, would be to allow the longshoreman to recover in full from the negligent third party but to allow the latter to recover from the negligent stevedore the amount of the judgment representing the stevedore\u2019s percentage of fault up to but not exceeding the statutory level of compensation payments. When compensation payments have been made, \u00a7 33, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933, would then operate as usual. Under this scheme the employee gets his full damages, the stevedore pays his percentage of the liability but not above the level of the compensation payments which he has bargained for in exchange for his willingness to pay without fault, and the third party is relieved of the obligation to pay the full judgment. However, such a solution seems impossible under the existing case law and statute. See <em>Halcyon Lines, supra, </em>342 U.S. 282, 72 S.Ct. 277, 96 L.Ed. 318, <em>reversing Baccile v. Halcyon Lines, </em>187 F.2d 403 (3 Cir. 1951); <em>Newport Air Park, Inc. v. United States, </em>419 F.2d 342 (1 Cir. 1969), <em>reversing </em>293 F.Supp. 809 (D.R.I.1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
