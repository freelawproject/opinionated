We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-18\">Familiarity is assumed with the published board opinion which sets forth the details of the proceedings herein. In brief outline, this opposition has proceeded under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 12(b)(6) and 56(c), made applicable to oppositions by 37 CFR 2.116. Appellee\u2019s application to register EXXELLO was published for opposition and Exxon Corporation (hereinafter Exxon) filed its notice of opposition. Without answering the notice, appellee moved under FRCP Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss it for \u201cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\u201d and the board dismissed, giving time to Exxon, however, to amend its pleading. Exxon then amended its notice by adding four paragraphs to it. Ap-pellee responded by renewing its motion to dismiss, supporting it by an affidavit of its president and exhibits showing numerous relevant facts. Exxon countered with an affidavit by Julius R. Lunsford, Jr., one of its counsel, partly factual and partly argumentative, and appellee responded to it by another affidavit of its president. In this posture of the case, the board treated the motion as one for summary judgment under FRCP Rule 56(c), as is provided in the last sentence of Rule 12(b), granted the motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the opposition \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-19\">Essentially, the question before us is whether summary judgment was proper under the circumstances of this case. Stated otherwise, have the rights of Exxon been prejudiced by depriving it of the opportunity to take testimony, have discovery, and indulge in cross-examination and the other attributes of a full trial? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>The basic purpose of summary judgment procedure is one of judicial economy \u2014 to save the time and expense of a full trial when it is unnecessary because the essential facts necessary to decision of the issue can be adequately developed by less costly procedures, as contemplated by the FRCP rules here involved, with a net benefit to society. We recognize that summary judgment is to be granted cautiously in order to preserve substantive rights; nonetheless, it is entirely proper where, after following the FRCP procedures, no genuine issue of material fact remains. As we said in <em>U. S. Steel Corp. v. Vasco Metals Corp., </em>394 F.2d 1009, 55 CCPA 1141, 157 USPQ 627 (1968), citing 6 J. Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 56.15[3] (2d ed. 1966), \u201cIt is well settled that the function of summary judgment is to avoid a useless trial.\u201d \u201cUseless\u201d in the context of this case means that more evidence than is already available in connection with this motion could not be reasonably expected to change the result herein. We turn, now, to discussion of the issue, the evidence already adduced thereon, the decision of the board, its apparent correctness, and whether more evidence might change that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">Exxon opposes registration of EXXELLO for ICE CREAM MANUFACTURING MACHINE^] on very broad grounds, asserting, as statutory bases, section 2(a) and 2(d) of the Trademark Act of 1946, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(a), (d). It alleges that more than a year prior to appellee\u2019s stated first use of EXXELLO it was using EXXON \u201cas a trade name and house mark.\u201d Paragraph 2 of both its original and amended notice of opposition reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-5\">In actual use, Applicant\u2019s mark and Opposcr\u2019s trade name and mark are displayed in the following Manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-6\">Applicant Opposcr</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-7\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"100\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" width=\"664\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">Its arguments rely heavily on this visual representation, which speaks loudly for itself. In fact, the essence of Exxon\u2019s case appears to us to reside in this passage from its brief, which is, after all, a matter of opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-10\">It hardly can be disputed that the visual comparison appearing in the second paragraph of the pleadings fulfills the ultimate objective of preciseness by presentation of a picture which is worth a thousand words to establish the visual similarity that immediately suggest [sic] a connection between the opposed mark and EXXON trade name and house mark.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agxa\">Oddly, no mention is ever specifically made of the double X\u2019s in the two marks, but we cannot escape the impression gleaned from the argument, that they are the crux of the matter. Exxon\u2019s amended notice asserts, for example, that EXXELLO is a \u201ccolorable imitation\u201d of EXXON and its brief says it \u201cvisually simulates the inherently distinctive origin-indicating presentation of the EXXON name and house mark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-11\">The statute relied on reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-12\">\n<em>Sec. 2. Trademarks registrable on the principal register</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-13\">No trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-14\">(a) Consists of or comprises * * * deceptive * * * matter; or matter which may * * * falsely suggest a connection with persons * * * ; ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-18\">(d) Consists of or comprises a mark which so resembles a mark registered in the Patent and Trademark Office or a mark or trade name previously used in the United States by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1304-19\">Exxon\u2019s case under \u00a7 2(a) is that appel-lee\u2019s use of EXXELLO on ICE CREAM MANUFACTURING MACHINE[S] \u2014 assuming, as we shall do, and as the board probably did, use of the mark in the format depicted above \u2014 would falsely suggest a connection with Exxon. Exxon\u2019s position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>under \u00a7 2(a) is succinctly presented in its statement of the first issue<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atpq\">Does Applicant\u2019s mark, when used [as depicted above), consist of or comprise deceptive matter or matter which <em>may </em>falsely suggest a connection with the EXXON trade name and/or house mark apart from any particular product line?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASmU\">Because of its position that no \u201cproduct line\u201d should be involved in consideration of this question, Exxon has not mentioned one in its pleadings. In fact, the notice of opposition so concentrates on the trade name and/or house mark basis of the opposition that it mentions no product or service of any kind and does not even disclose what line of business Exxon is engaged in. While it makes a single reference to its \u201cregistered house mark,\u201d no registration (state, Federal, or other) is mentioned. Not until one reaches the Lunsford affidavit does the record contain even a suggestion that Exxon <em>may </em>be one of the \u201cmajor brand oil companies\u201d which he mentions. He does not say it is. The only record evidence of Exxon\u2019s business is in the second affidavit of appellee\u2019s president wherein he states: \u201cI am aware of the fact that the Exxon Corporation is one of the world\u2019s largest corporations, and that it deals in petroleum products. In my business travels in some parts of the United States, I have observed in a limited number of states, retail gasoline filling stations bearing Opposer\u2019s house mark EXXON * * *In contrast, Exxon stands silent in its pleading and brief about its business, its products, and its services while implying, without proof, that EXXON is a famous name and celebrated house mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">Exxon\u2019s position under \u00a7 2(d) is similar to its position under \u00a7 2(a), referring to the likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception as to the origin of appellees goods because of the similarity of EXXELLO to the <em>trade name </em>EXXON, there being, of course, no reference to any product or service of Exxon nor to any trademark or service mark, or a registration of either, used or owned by Exxon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-7\">Appellee\u2019s side of the factual situation is simple. Its application is to register EXX-ELLO for a single product, an ice cream manufacturing machine, supported by specimens of the mark as used in the form of prints of a photograph of a machine of the type which makes and delivers \u201csoft ice cream,\u201d the machine having an oval label at the top of modest proportion on which EXXELLO appears in the type form we have depicted. The drawing of the application sets forth the mark in ordinary block letters so that registration, if issued, would not be restricted to any particular form or type. We agree with Exxon, of course, that it would <em>include </em>the type form in which used. Appellee\u2019s president\u2019s affidavits supply additional relevant facts, as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-8\">Appellee\u2019s principal business is the manufacture of fast-food equipment and related products including soft ice cream freezers, machines which make a product identified by such apparently well known names as \u201cDairy Queen,\u201d \u201cTastee Freeze,\u201d \u201cDairy Freez,\u201d \u201cFoster Freeze,\u201d \u201cFrogurt,\u201d \u201cMari-Yo,\u201d etc. Some eight different models of soft ice cream manufacturing machines of \u201cadvanced design\u201d bear the name EXXEL-LO and they sell at retail to ice cream manufacturers, not the general public, at prices ranging from about $3,500 to $11,000 each. In making soft ice cream, a liquid mix is injected into the machine together with air from the environment of the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>chine to produce the product. Consequently, the air must be free of odorous fumes such as gasoline fumes, making use of such machines in or near gasoline service stations undesirable. Moreover, state laws and regulations relating to ice cream manufacture and the handling of dairy products may prevent their use in such places. Ap-pellee is not in the dairy business and does not make or sell dairy products, frozen or otherwise. Its president testified that he knows of no instance in which ice cream is sold under the same name or mark as that applied to the freezer from which it is dispensed, his affidavit making reference, in this connection, to the six principal freezer manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">Pertinent provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-5\"><em>Rule 12. * * </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-7\">(b) * * * Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in any pleading * * * shall be asserted in'the responsive pleading thereto if one is required, except that the following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion * * * (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted * * * If, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (6) to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-13\">Rule 56. SUMMARY JUDGMENT * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-14\">(e) <em>Form of Affidavits; Further Testimony; Defense Required. </em>Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the af-fiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein * * *. When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, <em>an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, </em>by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, <em>must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him. </em>[Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1306-17\">The only response made by Exxon to appellee\u2019s motion is the affidavit of Luns-ford. Insofar as it states facts rather than opinions or arguments, it says that Mr. and Mrs. Lunsford visited four gas stations in the vicinity of Atlanta, Georgia, on a Saturday afternoon. The gist of it is that those stations sold packages of ice cream and some other food products. None was an Exxon station. Nothing is said about any of them having ice cream manufacturing machines on the premises. Mr. Lunsford also said he talked to Exxon executives in Atlanta and apparently intended to say that they said Exxon sells ice cream at \u201cstations on Interstate 75 south of Atlanta,\u201d though the sentence is incomplete. Mr. Lunsford said he knew personally that all major brand oil companies sell ice cream at their stations on certain highways. The rest of his affidavit is lawyer\u2019s argument rather than factual, asking \u201cwhat would happen if \u2018Exxello\u2019 ice cream were offered for sale in \u2018Exxon\u2019 stations \u2014 which is likely, and more importantly confusion as to source of the product would be rampant.\u201d And so on. There being no evidence that there is any \u201cExxello\u201d <em>ice cream, </em>we disregard this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-18\">Appellee\u2019s president filed a rebuttal affidavit stating that he and two others visited the same four gas stations reported on by Mr. Lunsford and at each location found what is commonly referred to as \u201cconvenience stores\u201d with gas pumps. At each location was a <em>storage </em>freezer where ice cream products were kept for sale, none of the stores manufacturing ice cream on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>On this record, the board found that purchasers familiar with the trade name or house mark EXXON would not, upon encountering the mark EXXELLO on an ice cream manufacturing machine, believe that it was made by, sponsored by, or in some way connected with Exxon. It also found \u201cno genuine issue of any material fact,\u201d relevant to the issues before it, and therefore granted summary judgment of dismissal of the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">We find no error in the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">On the record as presented, we cannot see that the mark EXXELLO on an ice cream manufacturing machine, selling for from $3,500 to $11,000 to a manufacturer of ice cream, is going to falsely suggest to him some connection with a company whose trade name or house mark is EXXON or that EXXELLO contains any deceptive matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-7\">After its initial dismissal, the board was most solicitous of Exxon\u2019s rights and gave it an opportunity to amend its pleading. Exxon then asserted that EXXELLO is a \u201ccolorable imitation\u201d of EXXON. We do not agree that it is, considering standard definitions of \u201ccolorable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-8\">Appellee has clearly explained on the record by affidavit evidence the nature of the product on which it uses EXXELLO, the nature of its business, and the channels of trade in which its EXXELLO product moves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-9\">Whatever the business of Exxon may be \u2014 and it has not seen fit to plead or show what it is \u2014 it has done nothing under well-established procedures available to it under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to show why concurrent use of EXXELLO and EXXON would falsely suggest a connection under \u00a7 2(a), or cause confusion, mistake, or deception under \u00a7 2(d). It has not shown, as required by FRCP Rule 56(c), what issue of material fact remains to be proved which could possibly establish that the board\u2019s decision under either \u00a7 2(a) or \u00a7 2(d) was in error. Having carefully studied Exxon\u2019s brief and all of the suggestions of matters it might prove, we see none that would lead us to a different conclusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are mindful of Exxon\u2019s suggestion that, given the opportunity by reversal of the summary judgment, it might like to present evidence to show \u201cthe enormous goodwill associated with Exxon, the unique nature, strength and fame of Exxon as a trade name and house mark, awareness of the Exxon name and house mark when the opposed mark was adopted, use of Exxon as a fanciful uniform identification for various diversified businesses and numerous unrelated collateral products * * *In considering, under the \u00a7 2(a) and (d) issues, questions of <em>\u00a1aw </em>which Exxon also includes in its list, namely, \u201clikelihood of mistake, deception, or injury to the reputation of Exxon, confusion of source, confusion of identity, confusion of connection and confusion of sponsorship,\u201d we have, of necessity, given the benefit of the doubt to Exxon as the prior user and have assumed those matters about its mark which it would like to prove, wherefore they are not \u201cissues.\u201d As to appellee\u2019s awareness of EXXON when adopting EXX-ELLO, we regard it as irrelevant in this opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-15\">The decision of the board is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"abu-dedup-0\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1305-9\">. Two other \u201cissues\u201d are stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-10\">2. If the mark being used by the Applicant falsely suggests a connection with Exxon apart from any particular product line, is it registrable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-11\">3. Was it error to dismiss the present opposition for failure to plead the use of Exxon as a trade name in connection with any goods?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1305-12\">We do not regard \u201c2\u201d as an issue. It is a self-evident proposition which answers itself in the negative. We do not regard \u201c3\u201d as an issue present in this case because the opposition was not dismissed for any such \u201cfailure to plead.\u201d As we read the board\u2019s opinion, it dismissed the opposition because, on the evidence in the case, it was persuaded that the registration of EXXELLO would be in violation of neither \u00a7 2(a) nor \u00a7 2(d) and because no issue of material fact remains.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1307-10\">. One aspect of Exxon\u2019s brief merits comment for the guidance of the bar. Rule 5.9 of the rules of this court prescribes the content of briefs. Section (b)(5) of that rule reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-11\">ARGUMENT. The argument should be opened with a concise summary of argument which states clearly and succinctly the points made in the brief. The points stated should then be used as headings in the body of the argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-12\">The argument in Exxon\u2019s brief comprises sixteen pages under five one- or two-line headings, A, B, C, D, and E. There are no concise points used as headings, merely titles. Preceding the body of the argument, under the heading \u201cSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT,\u201d and extending for over five pages, are some <em>sixty-two </em>brief statements or contentions, arranged under the same headings A, B, C, D, and E, each being from one to five lines long except for one of twelve lines. Five pages of minutiae expressing every thought the brief writer has set down is not what our rule means by either \u201cconcise summary\u201d or succinct statement of \u201cpoints\u201d; sixteen pages of argument cannot have sixty-two point headings. The court has not found this presentation helpful or in compliance with the above rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>MILLER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ADO6\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">The board correctly concluded that\u2014 since opposer in its affidavit has not attested to the use of the term \u201cEXXON\u201d as a trade name or house mark to identify any product or service of opposer, we conclude that opposer has not overcome the facts set forth and attested to in applicant\u2019s exhibits and affidavit .</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-7\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) places an affirmative duty on a party opposing a motion for summary judgment to \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Exxon has failed even to allege such facts and, on that basis, summary judgment was correctly awarded against it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
