The building and some personal property in the building were mortgaged and were covered by insurance. This is a dispute over a portion of the insurance fund relating to personal property. The United States claims the fund by virtue of a tax lien filed against the mortgagor, while the mortgagee claims, first, that the tax lien cannot attach to the fund because the fund is not property belonging to the mortgagor and, second, that even if the tax lien can attach to the fund, he has a security interest in the fund that is valid against the tax lien. The district court held in favor of the mortgagee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-22\">I. Is the fund property or a right to property belonging to the mortgagor?</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-24\">The government\u2019s claim rests on the federal tax lien statute, which provides, \u201cIf any person liable to pay tax neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount . . . shall be a lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321. The threshold question is whether the disputed insurance fund constitutes property or a right to property belonging to the mortgagor, who is the taxpayer in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>A. The mortgagee\u2019s rights under the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">The insurance policy has a loss payable clause in favor of the mortgagee\u2019s predecessor in interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The clause is a standard mortgage clause, also known as a New York or union mortgage clause. 5A J: Ap-pleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 3401, at 282. It is customarily used with real property insurance and is regarded as a separate contract between mortgagee and insurer. <em>Id. </em>at 286-88. <em>Glens Falls Ins. Co. v. Porter, </em>44 Fla. 568, 33 So. 473, 478 (1902).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">Because the mortgagee has a contractual right to money payable under the loss payable clause, the mortgagor has no right to that money. Thus the money or right to receive the money is not property or a right to property belonging to the mortgagor. The loss payable clause, however, is expressly limited \u201cto buildings only.\u201d The policy defines \u201cbuildings\u201d to exclude most personal property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus the mortgagee does not have a contractual right to the portion of the insurance fund relating to the excluded personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">The mortgagee argues that the limitation \u201cto buildings only\u201d is inconsistent with the provision that the loss shall be payable to the mortgagee \u201cas interest may appear under all present and future mortgages\u201d because his interest under the mortgage extends to personal property. We see no inconsistency. The quoted language is simply language of limitation, which recognizes that the mortgagee can have no greater interest in the insurance fund than in the insured collateral. 5A J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, \u00a7 3404, at 305 \u2014 06. The language does not operate to expand the clause beyond its express limitation \u201cto buildings only.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-15\">B. The mortgagee\u2019s equitable rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-16\">The mortgagee does have, however, an equitable right to the disputed insurance fund. The mortgagor agreed to \u201ckeep the building and all equipment and personal property now or hereafter on said premises\u201d covered by insurance against loss by fire or other casualty in an amount sufficient to protect the mortgagee\u2019s interest. The mortgagor procured the insurance policy pursuant to this agreement. Florida law provides that when a mortgagor has procured an insurance policy pursuant to such an agreement the mortgagee has an equitable lien on the insurance fund. <em>Atwell v. Western Fire Insurance Co., </em>120 Fla. 694, 163 So. 27 (1935). Although Florida case law has characterized the mortgagee\u2019s rights as being fixed at the time of loss,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>the mortgagee must act to protect his rights by giving notice of his claim to the insurer. If he does so, the insurer cannot pay a claim under the policy until the rights of the mortgagor and mortgagee are adjusted. <em>See also </em>Annot., 92 A.L.R. 559 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">We hold that the portion of the insurance fund that is not payable to the mortgagee under the loss payable clause is property or a right to property belonging to the mortgagor. The mortgagor has a contractual or legal right to this fund. The mortgagee on the other hand has only an equitable right, specifically an equitable lien. The mortgagee cannot obtain the fund by proceeding directly against the insurer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather he will not have a legal right to the fund until his rights and the mortgagor\u2019s have been adjusted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus we conclude that the disputed insurance fund is, at least initially, property belonging to the mortgagor.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">II. Does the mortgagee have a security interest in the insurance fund?</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">Even though the disputed insurance fund is property belonging to the mortgagor, we conclude that the mortgagee is entitled to the fund because he has a security interest in the fund that is valid against the federal tax lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">A. The mortgagee\u2019s security interest in proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">The federal tax lien statute provides that the federal tax lien shall not be valid against a security interest existing before the tax lien filing. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323(a). \u201cSecurity interest\u201d is defined to mean \u201cany interest in property acquired by contract for the purpose of securing payment or performance of an obligation or indemnifying against loss or liability.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323(h)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-13\">The mortgagee had a U.C.C. security interest in the building and personal property. The government does not contest on appeal that this security interest was perfected. The mortgagee also had a U.C.C. security interest in proceeds. We believe the Florida Supreme Court would hold that the disputed insurance fund constituted proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-14\">Florida has enacted the 1966 version of U.C.C. \u00a7 9-306(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>\u201cProceeds\u201d includes whatever is received when collateral or proceeds is sold, exchanged, collected or otherwise disposed of. The term also includes the account arising when the right to payment is earned under a contract right. Money, checks and the like are \u201ccash proceeds.\u201d All other proceeds are \u201cnon-cash proceeds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">19C Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 679.9-306(1). Florida has not enacted the 1972 version of U.C.C. \u00a7 9-306(1), which added another sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATeR\">Insurance payable by reason of loss or damage to the collateral is proceeds, except to the extent that it is payable to a person other than a party to the security agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Of this additional language the Official Comment says, \u201cIt makes clear that insurance proceeds from casualty loss of collateral are proceeds within the meaning of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">There is a split of authority whether the 1966 version of U.C.C. \u00a7 9-306(1) should be construed to include insurance payable by reason of loss or damage to collateral. Many courts have held that such an insurance fund cannot constitute proceeds under the 1966 version,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but their arguments have been soundly rebutted by the Second Circuit in <em>PPG Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Insurance Co., </em>531 F.2d 58 (CA2, 1976) (construing New York law).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Bo-roff, <em>Insurance Proceeds Under Section 9\u2014 306: Before and After, </em>1974 Commercial L.J. 442; Henson, <em>Insurance Proceeds as \u201cProceeds\u201d Under Article 9, </em>18 Catholic U.L.Rev. 453 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">Two principal arguments have been advanced against construing \u00a7 9-306(1) to include insurance payable by reason of loss or damage to collateral.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> First, \u00a7 9-104(g) provides that the U.C.C. does not apply \u201cto a transfer of an interest or claim in or under any policy of insurance.\u201d Section 9 \u2014 104(g), however, is directed not at the insurance of collateral but the creation of a security interest in an insurance policy by making the policy itself the collateral. <em>See </em>Comment 7 to \u00a7 9-104. Second, the scope of \u00a7 9-306(1) is ambiguous and can be read as limited to voluntary disposition of the collateral. The section speaks of collateral being \u201csold, exchanged, collected or otherwise disposed of.\u201d The verb \u201cdisposed of\u201d connotes an action, and all of the examples specifically given concern voluntary disposition. The 1966 version of \u00a7 9-306(2) supports this reading by its reference to the debtor\u2019s \u201cactions.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But the ambiguity of \u00a7 9-306 can just as easily be resolved to favor the secured party. Despite the examples, the section is not expressly limited to voluntary dispositions, and the inference from \u00a7 9-306(2) is hardly compelling. Section 9-306(2) basically says that a security interest does not continue in collateral when the secured party authorizes its disposition. It is hard to imagine a secured party authorizing an involuntary disposition. Thus the subsection on authorized dispositions may logically refer only to voluntary dispositions even though the general section on proceeds has a broader scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>Because \u00a7 9-306(1) can reasonably be construed to include insurance payable by reason of loss or damage to the collateral, we agree with the Second Circuit that the amendment to \u00a7 9-306 incorporated in the 1972 version of the U.C.C. \u201cis a persuasive indication of the effect which \u00a7 9-306 was originally intended to have.\u201d <em>PPG Industries, supra, </em>531 F.2d at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">B. The property-in-existence requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">It is not enough, however, that the mortgagee has a U.C.C. security interest in the disputed insurance fund. The federal tax lien statute defines \u201csecurity interest\u201d to require that the security property be in existence when the federal tax lien is filed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-6\">A security interest exists at any time (A) if, at such time, the property is in existence and the interest has become protected under local law against a subsequent judgment lien arising out of an unsecured obligation, and (B) to the extent that, at such time, the holder has parted with money or money\u2019s worth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323(h)(1). In this case the property, the disputed insurance fund, arguably did not come into existence until the time of loss or perhaps not until the insurance company admitted its liability under the policy. However, we agree with the Second Circuit in <em>PPG Industries, supra, </em>531 F.2d at 62, that the insurance fund is merely the collateral in another form. Accordingly, we regard the insurance fund and the original collateral as one and the same property for the purpose of determining when the property came into existence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">Thus although the federal tax lien can attach to the disputed insurance fund because the fund is property belonging to the mortgagor, the mortgagee has a security interest in the fund that is valid against the federal tax lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1008-14\">. The district court\u2019s opinion is reported at 38 A.F.T.R.2d 76-5008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1008-26\">.

Sykes, </em>66 S.W.2d 382, 383 (Tex.Civ.App. 1933).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1009-19\">. <em>Compare J. B. Kramer Grocery Co. v. Glens Falls Ins. Co., </em>497 F.2d 709 (CA8, 1974), where the court regarded an express limitation to buildings only as repugnant to the policy because the loss payee had a security interest in only personal property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1009-20\">. In Sea <em>Isle Operating Corp. v. Hochberg, </em>198 So.2d 336 (Fla.App. 1967), a Florida court said that the mortgagee\u2019s right to receive the insurance fund is fixed at the time of the loss but what the court meant was that foreclosure by the mortgagee subsequent to the casualty loss does not extinguish his equitable right to the insurance fund.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">. When a mortgagor filed a bill in equity against the insurer in <em>Atwell, </em>the Florida Supreme Court held that the insurer\u2019s motion for interpleader should be granted, essentially regarding the action as one against the mortgagor. <em>Sumlin v. Colonial Fire Underwriters, </em>158 Fla. 95, 27 So.2d 730, 731 (1946), also states that the mortgagee\u2019s remedy is against the mortgagor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">. Compare <em>U. S. v. Durham, </em>363 U.S. 522, 80 S.Ct. 1282, 4 L.Ed.2d 1371 (1960), where the Third Circuit had characterized payments contractually owing from an owner to a general contractor as not being property belonging to the general contractor because state law provided subcontractors a <em>\u201cdirect, independent cause of action against the owner </em>to the extent of any amount due under the general construction contract.\u201d 363 U.S. at 525, 80 S.Ct. at 1283, 4 L.Ed.2d at 1373 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court affirmed, saying this characterization was not clearly erroneous or unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">. The few courts that have considered cases with similar facts have either explicitly or implicitly concluded that funds payable under the terms of the policy to the mortgagor when the policy was procured for the benefit of the mortgagee are property of the mortgagor for the purposes of the federal tax lien statute. <em>Corrigan v. United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>427 F.Supp. 940 (S.D.N.Y.1977) (semble); <em>Ray E. Nelson Transp. Co. v. Tri-State Ins. Co., </em>231 F.Supp. 492, 495 (D.Neb.1964) (dictum); <em>see Andrelio v. Nationwide </em>Mut. Ins. <em>Co., </em>29 A.D.2d 489, 289 N.Y.S.2d 293 (Sup.Ct.1968) (assumed to be property belonging to mortgagor); <em>cf. PPG Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins.

In <em>Home Ins. Co. v. B. B. Rider, </em>212 F.Supp. 457 (D.N.J.1963), the mortgagee was named in a loss-payable clause, but in the absence of evidence whether the policy contained a mortgagee clause the court regarded the insurance funds \u201cas vesting, at least momentarily,\u201d in the mortgagor. <em>But cf.
