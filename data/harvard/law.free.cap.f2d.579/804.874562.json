The significant number of bankruptcies of northeastern and midwest-ern railroads has prompted the public and the Congress \u2014 and, increasingly, the courts \u2014 to respond actively to the threat to the national welfare presented by the crisis of the railroads.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">In this setting, highly ramified questions have been tendered to courts overseeing the progress of railroad reorganizations. Three such issues are present in this appeal, which has arisen from the reorganization of the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ). First, we are called upon to decide whether the reorganization court correctly held that certain administration expenses may not be paid with the securities of the Consolidated Rail Corp. (Conrail), securities which are to be received by the estate in consideration for rail assets transferred to Conrail. Second, we must resolve whether the reorganization court appropriately determined that Conrail was liable for vacation benefits to which CNJ\u2019s former employees had made claims, whereas CNJ was liable for <em>wage </em>claims asserted by its former employees. Finally, we must ascertain whether the reorganization court properly ruled that Conrail was not entitled to the payment of interest on wage claims it had satisfied on behalf of CNJ\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">CNJ filed a petition for reorganization in March of 1967 pursuant to \u00a7 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 205 <em>et seq. </em>By 1971, CNJ had embarked on a program of reorganizing its operations and structure that included, among many other things, the issuance of trustee certificates. Those certificates were issued directly by the bankrupt\u2019s trustee and were guaranteed by the Secretary of Transportation under the Emergency Rail Services Act of 1970, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 661 <em>et seq. </em>Some $2.4 million worth of such certificates were issued and guaranteed, and CNJ\u2019s trustee ultimately defaulted on their payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">By 1973, seven carriers, including CNJ, were in bankruptcy proceedings. In response to this situation, Congress passed the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 <em>et seq., </em>which was amended by the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <em>et seq. </em>(together referred to hereinafter as the \u201cRail Act\u201d). The Rail Act contemplated the unification of the various rail facilities of the bankrupt companies into a single, viable system, and the conveyance of the estates\u2019 rail properties to Conrail, a newly-created private corporation. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 741. For about two years prior to the conveyance of the rail assets to Conrail, and while the United States Railway Association (USRA) was devising the Final System Plan for the railroads, CNJ and other railroads continued operations, as they were compelled to do under the Rail Act. On April 1, 1976, the rail properties were finally conveyed to Conrail, and after that date the obligation of the bankrupt railroads to maintain rail services ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">In exchange for the rail properties, CNJ and the other bankrupt railroads are to receive two types of Conrail securities, Series B preferred stock and common stock. To insure the payment of at least the net liquidation value of the conveyed properties, CNJ and other transferors are to obtain Certificates of Value, obligations of the United States government. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 746.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Certificates of Value are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>guarantee that if Conrail securities ultimately have a value less than the net liquidation value of the properties conveyed to Conrail, the estates nevertheless would receive consideration equal to the assets\u2019 net liquidation value.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">At the time of conveyance, certain obligations that had been incurred by CNJ as a result of pre-conveyance rail operations remained unpaid. Section 211(h), one of the 1976 amendments to the Rail Act, provided the financial means by which such obligations could be satisfied \u201cin order to avoid disruptions in ordinary business relationships.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 721(h)(1)(A). It contemplated that outstanding obligations such as to other railroads, shippers, suppliers and labor sources could be paid by Conrail with \u201ccash or other current assets\u201d of the estate or, in the event that \u201ccash or other current assets\u201d were insufficient, with loan funds from USRA authorized under \u00a7 211(h). The statutory arrangement called for payment to the creditors of CNJ by Conrail. Conrail was then to seek reimbursement from the estate on a priority basis and, after being reimbursed by the estate, Conrail was to repay USRA. However, in the event that Conrail could not recover from the estate, USRA would, with only narrow exceptions, forgive the loan to Conrail and itself succeed to Conrail\u2019s claim for reimbursement. Payments on behalf of CNJ were made by Conrail pursuant to the authority granted in \u00a7 211(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">During the period of CNJ\u2019s reorganization, the estate was assessed for taxes by the State of New Jersey and local governmental entities. The payment of these obligations was deferred pursuant to court order on the ground that \u201cthe public interest in the continued operation of the railroad [was] paramount over the payment of taxes,\u201d and that \u00a7 77 of the Bankruptcy Act authorized the district court to permit such deferral. <em>In re Penn Central Transportation Co., </em>325 F.Supp. 294, 300 (E.D.Pa.1970), <em>aff\u2019d </em>452 F.2d 1107 (3d Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied </em>406 U.S. 944, 92 S.Ct. 2040, 32 L.Ed.2d 331 (1972). As a result, New Jersey and its local authorities now have claims for unpaid principal and interest on taxes accruing since 1966 in the approximate amount of $22 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">CNJ, on June 1,1976, submitted a Plan of Reorganization to the reorganization court, as to which two preliminary questions were framed for resolution. The first dealt with the legality of the proposed use of Conrail securities by the estate to satisfy the claims (a) of the United States and the State of New Jersey under certain trustee certificates, (b) of Conrail and USRA for the reimbursement of monies paid under \u00a7 211(h)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (c) of state and local authorities in New Jersey for deferred taxes. The second issue presented to the reorganization court concerned \u201cthe propriety of the trustee\u2019s position that Conrail has primary responsibility for employee-related claims,\u201d in particular those for vacations and wages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>In an opinion dated November 30, 1976, the reorganization court ruled that the proposed utilization of Conrail securities in satisfaction of the administration claims of the United States, Conrail, USRA and the New Jersey taxing authorities did not comply with the governing statute. <em>See </em>425 F.Supp. 1055, 1060-65 (D.N.J.1976). In reaching its decision, the reorganization court relied primarily upon \u00a7 77(e)(3) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 205(e)(3), which it interpreted as requiring the payment of administration expenses in cash unless the claimants consent to an alternative form of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">The reorganization court reasoned that it would be extraordinarily difficult, if not practically impossible, for it to value the Conrail securities, as that corporation\u2019s shares do not have a clear present worth or a currently ascertainable future value. As a result of this, the reorganization court concluded that \u201cno factual finding could be made\u201d that would enable it \u201cto be sure that the governmental parties would receive the compensation which the absolute priority rule mandates they receive.\u201d 425 F.Supp. at 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">In deciding the question of liability for vacation benefits, the reorganization court turned to \u00a7 504(a) of the Rail Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 774(a). That statute, in the reorganization court\u2019s view, directs Conrail to \u201cassume\u201d \u2014 and thus to be responsible for \u2014 obligations such as vacation benefits arising under the collective bargaining agreements covering employees of a bankrupt railroad.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition to resting its determination on the statutory language, the reorganization court cited the \u201cpractical consideration\u201d that \u00a7 211(h) funds would not have been adequate to satisfy all the outstanding vacation obligations of the railroads. Given this, the court concluded that Congress should not be said to have intended that vacations remained the obligations of the estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">On May 13, 1977, the reorganization court, in a letter opinion, concluded that it was not inclined to treat wages due CNJ\u2019s employees for work during the final weeks of the railroad\u2019s pre-conveyance operation in the same manner as vacation pay. The chief reason provided for differentiating the two obligations was that \u201c[a]ll of the benefit derived from the work for which the wages are owed went to the Central Railroad Co. of New Jersey\u201d, whereas \u201cthe benefit\u201d from vacations taken by employees would not similarly flow to the railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">Further, the reorganization court refused to grant Conrail\u2019s request for interest on the wage claims. This conclusion was justified on the ground that Conrail had continued CNJ\u2019s practice of paying its employees with a two-week lapse. Thus, the court deduced, it would be \u201cinequitable\u201d to charge CNJ interest on wages for the two-week period prior to conveyance at a time when Conrail still does not pay its employees on a current basis. Should Conrail decide to compensate its employees in a current manner, the court indicated, but did not actually say, that a different result would likely obtain.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">An order was entered by the reorganization court on May 31,1977. It held that the proposed use of Conrail securities in satisfaction of the administration claims in question did not comport with \u00a7 77(e)(3) of the Bankruptcy Act. It concluded that Conrail was liable for vacation benefits but that CNJ remained responsible for pre-conveyance wage obligations, and it determined that no interest would accrue on the funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>borrowed by Conrail to pay sums owed as wages, at least \u201cuntil such time as Conrail shall begin paying such employees on a current basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The present appeals have been taken from the May 31st order. Specifically, CNJ has challenged the rulings relating to the use of Conrail securities and the wage claims; Penn Central has urged this Court not to affirm the determination of the reorganization court regarding the proposed use of Conrail securities;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Conrail has appealed from the reorganization court's holding regarding vacation pay; and both the United States and USRA have appealed the decision not to award interest on the pre-con-veyance wage obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Because the three issues in the present appeal implicate discrete aspects of the law governing railroad reorganizations, we shall discuss them <em>seriatum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">A. THE PROPOSED USE OF CONRAIL SECURITIES</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">According to CNJ, the proposed use of Conrail securities is not precluded by \u00a7 77(e)(3) of the Bankruptcy Act and, indeed, is affirmatively authorized by \u00a7 601(b)(4) of the Rail Act. Also, the trustee argues that the proposed use of Conrail securities does not violate the absolute priority rule arising under \u00a7 77(e)(1) of the Bankruptcy Act. In response, it is urged that the various claims, for purposes of the Rail Act and the Bankruptcy Act, are administration claims, and as such are entitled to first priority and payment in cash. Ap-pellees also insist that even if \u00a7 77(e)(3) of the Bankruptcy Act is not dispositive of the matter, the absolute priority rule forecloses the proposed use of. Conrail securities. They further dispute CNJ\u2019s contention that the grant of discretion to a reorganization court under \u00a7 601(b)(4) of the Rail Act permits the conclusion that the use of Conrail securities is acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">The reorganization court did not confine its reasoning to the propriety of the use of Conrail securities, but reached more broadly in concluding that under \u00a7 77(e)(3) of the Bankruptcy Act, <em>all </em>administration expenses such as those here must be paid <em>in cash. </em>We decline to follow the lead of the reorganization court in ruling on the legality of a form of payment of all of the obligations of concern here \u2014 specifically, cash \u2014 that is not contemplated in the Plan of Reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">As a general matter, it is not advisable to resolve questions, particularly ones with wide-ranging implications, that are not immediately presented in a case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The issue in this appeal is not whether cash payment is required, but rather, whether the proposed use of Conrail securities is legal. Thus, the question that must be addressed is narrower than that which occupied the reorganization court, specifically, it is whether the proposed method of payment \u2014 the use of Conrail securities \u2014 is allowable under controlling statutory precepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">To put the precise issue at hand into a broader perspective, it is necessary to understand the priority of the estate\u2019s claimants and creditors under the Plan of Reorganization. As described by the reorganization court, the Plan basically contemplated a tenfold division of the estate\u2019s obligations. The reorganization court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-15\">The Plan divides the estate\u2019s creditors into ten classes listed in descending order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>of priority. Class A consists of such costs of the reorganization proceedings and the Plan\u2019s implementation as this Court shall allow. Non-employee personal injury claims are also included in this class. Class B contains the claims of the United States and the State of New Jersey under certain trustee certificates. Class C covers the \u00a7 211(h) claims to reimbursement by ConRail and/or USRA. Class D consists of such state and local tax claims as shall be allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-4\">The interline railroad\u2019s claims for thirty-five monthly cash payments under the pre-petition interlines settlement comprise Class E. Class F includes all other administration claims. Class G consists of the mortgage bondholders. Class H comprises the claims of the United States under certain trust notes. All other pre-petition claims are contained in Class I. Finally, the interest of the stockholder is denominated Class J.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIkk\">In this hierarchy of claims, it should be noted, the claimants to receive Conrail securities are Classes B, C and D.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, Class E claims are to be paid in thirty-five monthly cash installments; Class F creditors are to \u201creceive certain installment notes to be issued by the reorganized company\u201d; the bondholders, Class G creditors, are to receive the common stock of the reorganized company; and Class H debts are to be satisfied \u201cby the release of the securities of certain of CNJ\u2019s subsidiaries\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As we see it, the central inquiry is whether such an apportionment of resources conforms with the absolute priority rule deriving from the Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Section 77(e)(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 205(e)(1), is the source of the absolute priority principle. That section provides that a judge shall approve a plan of reorganization \u201cif satisfied that\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-11\">It complies with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, is fair and equitable, affords due recognition to the rights of each class of creditors and stockholders, does not discriminate unfairly in favor of any class of creditors or stockholders, and will conform to the requirements of the law of the land regarding the participation of the various classes of creditors and stockholders .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">The term \u201cfair and equitable\u201d in the statutory language has a long history reaching back at least to <em>Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. </em>Boyd, 228 U.S. 482, 33 S.Ct. 554, 57 L.Ed. 931 (1913) and <em>Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v. Central Union Trust Co., </em>271 U.S. 445, 46 S.Ct. 549, 70 L.Ed. 1028 (1926). As the Supreme Court put it in <em>Baker v. Gold Seal Liquors, </em>417 U.S. 467, 473, 94 S.Ct. 2504, 2508, 41 L.Ed.2d 243 (1974), the \u201cfixed principle\u201d of the earlier cases \u201chas been carried over into \u00a7 77e by our decisions.\u201d <em>See also Ecker v. Western Pacific Ry. Corp., </em>318 U.S. 448, 477-83, 63 S.Ct. 692, 87 L.Ed. 892 (1943); <em>Group of Institutional Investors v. Milwaukee Ry. Co., </em>318 U.S. 523, 539-41, 63 S.Ct. 727, 87 L.Ed. 959 (1943); <em>RFC v. Denver &amp; R.G.W. Ry. Co., </em>328 U.S. 495, 615-20, 66 S.Ct. 1282, 90 L.Ed. 1400 (1946). The priority standard requires that claimants and creditors of a bankrupt estate of the same class receive the full value of their debts from the property of the debtor before junior creditors and shareholders are paid. <em>See Baker v. Gold Seal Liquors, supra, </em>417 U.S. at 473-74, 94 S.Ct. 2504; <em>Consolidated Rock Products Co. v. Du Bois, </em>312 U.S. 510, 528-29, 61 S.Ct. 675, 85 L.Ed. 982 (1941).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">The clearest application of the absolute priority rule has occurred when a plan of reorganization proposes to treat sharehold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>ers more beneficially than, and thus prior to, creditors. In <em>Louisville Trust Co. v. Louisville, N.A. &amp; C. Ry. Co., </em>174 U.S. 674, 684, 19 S.Ct. 827, 830, 43 L.Ed. 1130 (1899), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the \u201cfamiliar rule\u201d that \u201cthe stockholder\u2019s interest in the property is subordinate to the rights of creditors; first, of secured and then of unsecured, creditors.\u201d It proceeded to announce that \u201cany arrangement of the parties by which the subordinate rights and interests of the stockholders are attempted to be secured at the expense of the prior rights of either class of creditors comes within judicial denunciation.\u201d Also, in <em>Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v. Central Union Trust Co., supra, </em>271 U.S. at 455, 46 S.Ct. at 551, it was written that \u201cto the extent of their debts creditors are entitled to priority over stockholders against all the property of an insolvent corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Yet the absolute priority standard has not been confined to maintaining a strict gradation between creditors and shareholders; it also has been seen to apply to the situation of differing priorities among creditors or claimants themselves. In <em>United States v. Key, </em>397 U.S. 322, 90 S.Ct. 1049, 25 L.Ed.2d 340 (1970), the Supreme Court held \u2014 in the context of a Chapter X proceeding \u2014 that the United States is entitled to priority payment of its tax claim under a plan of reorganization. In a concurring opinion, Justice Douglas noted that the terms \u201cfair and equitable\u201d under Chapter X are \u201cwords of art\u201d which, as the Court has made clear, establish \u201cunmistakably . that compromising the rights of senior creditors to protect junior creditors\u201d is unacceptable. 397 U.S. at 333, 90 S.Ct. at 1056. <em>Cf. Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Co., </em>308 U.S. 106, 115-16, 60 S.Ct. 1, 84 L.Ed. 110 (1939). Justice Douglas wrote in <em>Key:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAoy\">The present plan is likewise infirm because it provides junior creditors with immediate, partial payment, while making the United States with a prior claim accept delayed and therefore discounted payment of its claim with all the attendant risks.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">We discern no basis for distinguishing the priority principle as applicable under Chapter X bankruptcies from the same standard as applied under \u00a7 77(e) of the Bankruptcy Act, and neither has the Supreme Court. <em>See Baker v. Gold Seal Liquors, supra, </em>417 U.S. at 473 n. 11, 94 S.Ct. 2504.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">Accordingly, the absolute priority principle mandates a schedule of payment that accords with the ranking of the various claimants of an estate. It does not \u201crequire the impossible and make it necessary to pay an unsecured creditor in cash as a condition of stockholders retaining an interest in the reorganized company. His interest can be preserved by the issuance, on equitable terms, of income bonds or preferred stock.\u201d <em>Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Boyd, supra, </em>228 U.S. at 508, 33 S.Ct. at 561.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On the other hand, the rule does demand, once a fixed scale of interests is established, that each class receive satisfaction before the next lower class participates. <em>See </em>Friendly &amp; Tondel, <em>The Relative Treatment of Securities in Railroad Reorganization Under Section 77, 7 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs., </em>420, 423 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">The three types of obligations of concern here \u2014 those arising from default of trustee certificates, from payment of creditors under \u00a7 211(h) of the Rail Act, and from the deferral of taxes \u2014 are claims of administration entitled to first priority.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Section 3(c) of the Emergency Rail Services Act of 1970, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 662(c), requires that trustee certificates be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"af3-dedup-0\">. <em>treated as an expense of administration </em>and receive the highest lien on the railroad\u2019s property and priority in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>payment under the Bankruptcy Act. (emphasis added)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJZ\">The Rail Act also stipulates that claims arising under \u00a7 211(h), whether advanced by Conrail or by USRA, are administration expenses. As \u00a7 211(h)(4)(C) of the Rail Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 721(h)(4)(C), provides with regard to such claims pressed by Conrail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aed-dedup-1\">The Corporation . . . shall have a direct claim, as a <em>current expense of administration, </em>for reimbursement from the estate of a railroad in reorganization in the region for all obligations of such estate . . . which are paid by the Corporation . . . (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">And with respect to direct claims of USRA for the reimbursement of \u00a7 211(h) funds, the statute declares that they \u201cshall be <em>pri- or to all other administrative claims of the estate of a railroad in reorganization, except claims arising under trustee\u2019s certificates </em>or from default on the payment of such certificates.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 721(h)(5)(B) (emphasis added). In addition, tax claims such as those pressed by the authorities in New Jersey constitute administration claims, though they are not of the very first priority as, for instance, are trustee certificates. <em>See Nicholas v. United States, </em>384 U.S. 678, 687-88, 86 S.Ct. 1674, 16 L.Ed.2d 853 (1966); <em>cf. </em>3A <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00a7 62.14(3); 6 <em>Remington on Bankruptcy </em>\u00a7 2823 (5th ed. 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Given their priority status, the claims in question must be paid before non-administration and lower priority claims. However, the Plan of Reorganization contemplates the distribution to bondholders, for example, of the common stock of the reorganized company. It appears from the record that common shares would likely, or at least possibly, be more valuable in the foreseeable future than Conrail\u2019s shares. No dividends are to be paid on the Series B preferred stock of Conrail until 1985, and dividends on Conrail\u2019s common stock would not be paid earlier than those on the Series B preferred shares. However, it is at least possible that the reorganized company may start to operate at a profit, and thus to make distributions' to its shareholders, at an earlier date. In any event, and more crucially, there is no evidence that Conrail shares are more valuable than shares of the reorganized company. Furthermore, the Plan of Reorganization contemplates a distribution of cash to administration claimants with a lower priority than the three types of administration claimants involved in this set of appeals.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Consequently, the Plan\u2019s proposed use of Conrail securities does not adhere to the strictures of the absolute priority rule, and cannot be sustained.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-13\">The reorganization court made another observation, based on what it referred to as the <em>\u201cindirect </em>absolute priority rule\u201d (emphasis added), that undermines the validity of the proposed use of Conrail securities. The court noted that it would be extremely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>difficult, if not impossible, for it at this time to value the Conrail securities so as to determine the exact amount of compensation to be received by the administration claimants. Judge Whipple wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-5\"><em>The Court can not but conclude that no factual finding could be made which would enable it to be sure that the governmental parties would receive the compensation which the absolute priority rule mandates they receive. </em>Had the Plan provided for the participation of the governmental parties in the assurances provided by the Certificates of Value, the indirect absolute priority rule argument might not have been a factor in the decision which the Court has reached, (emphasis added)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The proposed transfer of Conrail securities without Certificates of Value guaranteeing that they are worth at least the net liquidation value of the assets transferred to Conrail would thus appear to give the recipients no assurance of any minimal worth of the shares. It therefore is not certain that the claimants receiving Conrail shares would receive full satisfaction of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">In response, CNJ contends that \u00a7 601(b)(4) of the Rail Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 791(b)(4), operates to free the reorganization court from the constraints of the absolute rule. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-8\">The powers and duties of the Commission (ICC) under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, with respect to a railroad in reorganization in the region which conveys all or substantially all of its designated rail properties to the Corporation shall cease upon the date of such conveyance. The powers and duties of the Commission under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act shall also so terminate, as of the date of enactment of this paragraph, with respect to any railroad reorganization under section 77 but not subject to this Act Thereafter, <em>such powers and duties of the Commission shall be vested in the district court of the United States which has jurisdiction of the estate . Such court shall proceed to reorganize or liquidate such railroad in reorganization pursuant to such section </em>77 <em>on such terms as the court deems just and reasonable, or pursuant to any other provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, if the court finds that such action would be in the best interests of such estate . . . </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-13\">We do not see in that section any legislative purpose other than an intent to lodge in the reorganization court the responsibilities traditionally executed by the ICC. To say that the section\u2019s use of language calling for \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d terms in a plan of reorganization is a method of repealing the \u201cfair and equitable\u201d standard of \u00a7 77 of the Bankruptcy Act is untenable. As Conrail points out, the Rail Act in general has been viewed by the Supreme Court as basically supplementing, and not displacing, the Bankruptcy Act. <em>Cf. Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, </em>419 U.S. 102,109, 95 S.Ct. 335, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974). Moreover, the trustee has identified no legislative history persuasively demonstrating the aim of Congress, in enacting \u00a7 601(b)(4) of the Rail Act, dramatically to alter the scope of the venerable rule of absolute priority. In the absence of an affirmative indication of such Congressional design, it would be inappropriate to infer an intent to repeal the established doctrine.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-14\">The trustee further maintains that the appellees should be precluded from urging that Conrail securities constitute legally inadequate consideration for the outstanding claims. As CNJ frames the argument, having \u201cengineered the transfer of the bulk of CNJ\u2019s assets in return for the ConRail securities,\u201d and having \u201cconsistently argued that such securities were an adequate form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>of compensation for CNJ\u2019s assets,\u201d they should now be prevented from taking the position that Conrail securities are legally unacceptable as payment <em>to them. </em>However, it does not appear that the notion of preclusion is relevant here, at least not in the manner it is sought to be applied by the trustee. Although there may be an occasion to prohibit a party from taking inconsistent positions in successive proceedings as to the same matter, that occasion has not arisen because the subject of the proceedings involved in this appeal is not the same as in the valuation case relied on by the trustee as the alleged basis for preclusion. We must be guided ultimately by the dictates of the governing statutory principles bearing on the priority of claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">There remains the question whether any one of the three types of administration claims present in this appeal has a unique status, entitling it to more specific protection than that afforded by the absolute priority rule. For all that we have thus far concluded is that, under the facts of this case, the proposed use of Conrail securities as payment of the administration expenses is unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The trustee certificates, in our view must be given special consideration. Under Section 3(c) of the Emergency Rail Services Act of 1970, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 662(c), trustee certificates are to be treated \u201cas an expense of administration\u201d and as \u201cthe highest lien on the railroad\u2019s property and priority in payment under the Bankruptcy Act.\u201d The particular importance of such certificates to a bankrupt railroad is manifest, as they provide a necessary means of raising capital at a critical time. A railroad in reorganization must often have the power to borrow funds at reasonable rates of interest \u201cif it is to remain a viable railroad.\u201d <em>In re New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Ry. Co., </em>304 F.Supp. 1121, 1125 (D.Conn.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">On the second page of the. trustee certificates, the record indicates, it is provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-12\"><em>The principal will be paid in Federal funds upon surrender of this certificate on or after maturity </em>at the Bank. . The interest will be paid by check. The final installment of interest will be paid with the principal, (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-14\">The terms of the trustee certificates, which call for payment of their principal in federal funds, should be respected and not unilaterally modified under the Plan of Reorganization, for an essential element in the marketing of trustee certificates is to insure purchasers that they will receive what they bargained for. Thus, the certificates\u2019 terms should be \u201cmeticulously observed, <em>unless </em>the obligor and obligee mutually agree upon other terms.\u201d <em>In re New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Ry. Co., supra </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-15\"> We hold, in sum, that under the rule of absolute priority, the proposed use of Conrail securities in satisfaction of the administration claims in question is unacceptable. After deciding the issue in light of the absolute priority rule, it is neither essential nor, in our judgment, fitting to reach the broader question regarding the allowability of the use of securities generally under \u00a7 77(e)(3) of the Bankruptcy Act. Furthermore, we hold that the trustee certificates must be paid in the manner provided by their terms, unless the parties consent to an alternative form of payment.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-16\">B. EMPLOYEE-RELATED CLAIMS: VACATIONS AND WAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b872-17\">The reorganization court relied upon \u00a7 504(a) of the Rail Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 774(a), in requiring Conrail to be responsible for vacation benefits owed CNJ\u2019s former employees. That section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-18\">(a) Interim Application. \u2014 Until completion of the agreements provided for under subsection (d) of this section, the Corporation shall, as though an original par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>ty thereto, assume and apply on the particular lines, properties, or facilities acquired all obligations under existing collective-bargaining agreements covering all crafts and classes of employees thereon . . During this period, employees of a railroad in reorganization who have seniority on the lines, properties, or facilities acquired by the Corporation pursuant to this Act shall have prior seniority roster rights on such acquired lines, properties, or facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">According to the reorganization court, the import of that statutory language, which was said to be \u201cclear and unambiguous,\u201d is that Conrail must take upon itself the estate\u2019s obligation regarding vacations by employees. The court declined to credit Conrail\u2019s argument that the statutory provisions are clearly interim in their operation and therefore that no final liability falls upon it. Moreover, the court stressed that nothing in the statute as a whole indicates that even if the obligation to pay for vacations is Conrail\u2019s in the first instance, it shifts back to the estate when a new collective bargaining agreement comes into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">One policy apparently underlying the court\u2019s analysis was the desire to effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent to protect employees from disruption of their interests under the collective bargaining agreements after the conveyance of assets to Conrail. <em>See 425 </em>F.Supp. at 1070. The court construed \u00a7 504(a) as an \u201cexception to the general legislative scheme\u201d of the Rail Act, which, it tacitly recognized, tended to leave pre-conveyance obligations with the estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">By thus concluding that all vacation benefits in question are the responsibility of Conrail and not CNJ, the reorganization court found it unnecessary to differentiate between various categories of vacation claimants. However, some of the claims for vacation benefits are for the vindication of vested rights, and others are not. Thus, certain employees had earned vacation benefits during <em>1975 </em>\u2014 the calendar year prior to conveyance on April 1,1976 \u2014 but had not taken their vacations before conveyance. Such rights would seem clearly to have vested. Other employees had accumulated enough working time from January 1,1976, to March 31, 1976, to vest their <em>1976 </em>vacation benefits, which they were to receive in 1977. A third group of employees had accumulated only some but not all of the time required to vest their <em>1976 </em>vacation benefits prior to conveyance. Considering the contrasting positions of these three sets of employees, the blanket approach of the reorganization court would appear to be too undiscriminating <em>unless </em>it was correct in holding that <em>all </em>vacations are the obligation of Conrail.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">We cannot agree with the reorganization court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. The statute that it relied upon does not, in our view, suggest that Congress intended Conrail to bear final liability for all vacation obligations arising in the pre-conveyance period. Rather, Congress basically evinced a concern about preventing confusion and unfairness in the relations between the employees and their new post-conveyance employer, namely, Conrail. By virtue of that concern, \u00a7 504(a) was passed, with an explicitly \u201cinterim\u201d orientation, to define the employment relations that would obtain until a new collective bargaining agreement came into operation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In particular, during this interim period, Conrail was directed to \u201cassume and apply\u201d \u2014 that is, to adhere to\u2014 obligations arising under existing collective bargaining agreements. <em>Cf. Carle v. Conrail, </em>426 F.Supp. 1045, 1046 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. 1977). Section 504(d), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 774(d), required Conrail and the unions representing the employees to begin to negotiate new labor contracts within sixty days of conveyance. In focusing on the language of \u00a7\u00a7 504(a) and (d), then, we are led to the interpretation that Congress primarily determined to provide a stable framework for labor-management relations, and not to fix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>on Conrail pre-conveyance obligations for vacation pay formerly borne by the estate.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Conrail argues that the language of \u00a7 504(e), and the legislative materials elucidating its 1976 amendments, affirmatively support the proposition that obligations for vacation pay are properly reposed with CNJ. Section 504(e) in pertinent part is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-5\">Liability for employee claims. \u2014 In all cases of claims by employees, arising under the collective bargaining agreements of the railroads in reorganization in the region, and subject to section 153 of this title [section 3 of the. Rail way Labor Act], <em>the Corporation . . . </em>shall assume responsibility for the processing of any such claims, and payment of those which are sustained or settled on or subsequent to the date of conveyance, under section 743(b)(1) of this title, and <em>shall be entitled to direct reimbursement from the Association pursuant to section 721(h) of this title, to the extent that such claims are determined by the Association to be the obligation of a railroad in reorganization in the region. Any liability of an estate of a railroad in reorganization to its employees which is assumed, processed, and paid, pursuant to this subsection, by the Corporation . . . shall remain the preconveyance obligation of the estate of such railroad for purposes of section 721(h)(1) of this title. The Corporation shall be entitled to a direct claim as a current expense of administration . . . for reimbursement (including costs and expenses of processing such claims) from the estate of the railroad in reorganization on whose behalf such obligations are discharged or paid. . </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">Conrail stresses in particular the language that a liability assumed by it, pursuant to the above subsection, \u201cshall remain the pre-conveyance obligation of the estate . . \u201d, and that Conrail shall be \u201centitled to a direct claim as a current expense of administration\u201d for \u201creimbursement from the estate . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">The reorganization court, in rejecting Conrail\u2019s suggestion, concluded that \u00a7 504(e) does not apply to vacation claims that are not subject to \u00a7 3 of the Railway Labor Act, which deals with \u201cdisputes between an employee or group of employees and a carrier . . . growing out of grievances or . the interpretation or application of the agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions . . . \u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(i). Since the controversy here is between the estate and Conrail, not between the carrier and employees, the reorganization court deemed that \u00a7 504(e) did not cover the matter in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-17\">As we see it, the interpretation by the reorganization court does not rest upon a straight-forward reading of the statutory language. Section 504(e) applies to all \u201ccases of claims by employees, arising under the collective bargaining agreements . and subject to section 153 of this title [section 3 of the Railway Labor Act].\u201d The \u201csubject to\u201d clause does not indicate that the provisions of Section 3 of the Railway Labor Act have to be in actual operation with respect to the claim in question. It would appear more reasonable to construe-it to mean that <em>if </em>a dispute between an employer and employee exists, then the provisions of \u00a7 3 of the Railway Labor Act will be brought to bear upon it, for in any event the claims are \u201csubject to\u201d the terms of that Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-18\">Moreover, as Conrail properly points out, the reorganization court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 504(e) would lead logically to the conclusion that the estate has no liability for claims that it . does not dispute, but it does have liability for claims it chooses to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>test. No statutory policy would appear to be served by distinguishing between situations of liability and no liability solely on the basis of the estate\u2019s decision to question its own obligation. It thus seems that the language of the section should be read to cover the present case.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">The trustee counters by noting that \u00a7 504(e) pertains only to claims \u201csustained or settled on or subsequent to the date of conveyance,\u201d and by asserting that such language <em>implies </em>that the claims are expected to concern contested matters. Such an implication is, however, a remote one. Moreover, the trustee\u2019s argument is not sufficiently specific to compel the result it seeks, for it does not show that the statute \u2014 even assuming that it contemplates an actual, realized dispute \u2014 requires a contest between the employer and the employees, as opposed to one between Conrail and the trustee. In any event, the argument does not impel rejection of the conclusion that has been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Further, the trustee maintains that even if it is liable for the vacations of employees whose benefits vested in 1975 or in 1976 prior to conveyance, it does not, and never did, have an obligation to pay vacation benefits to that group of employees who did not work long enough in 1976 before conveyance to be entitled to vacations. This position rests on the premise that the estate is not liable for vacations unless an employee has accumulated all of the time credits needed to vest the entitlement prior to the conveyance. The estate buttresses this argument by saying that the employees who before conveyance had no entitlement to vacations \u201chad not met the conditions of their agreement with CNJ with respect to vacation benefits.\u201d For this reason, says the estate, the claims for vacation that had not vested at the time of conveyance do not constitute a \u201cliability of an estate of a railroad\u201d under the Rail Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">Conrail in response points to the estate\u2019s accrual method of accounting, under which an entry was shown on the railroad\u2019s books for vacation benefits in the period in which income from railroad operations was generated, regardless of whether or not cash was eventually to be spent to satisfy the employees\u2019 claims for vacations. Thus, as framed by Conrail, the issue is who must bear the ultimate liability for vacation benefits listed on CNJ\u2019s books, but of course not paid before conveyance. On this reasoning, the claims of both the small group of employees who, prior to conveyance, accumulated enough time credits in 1976 to vest their vacation benefits and of the larger group of employees who, prior to conveyance, earned only a portion of the credits needed to vest their vacation benefits would be obligations of the estate at the time of conveyance. As to both classes, Conrail proposes that we direct a process of apportionment of the ultimate responsibility between CNJ and Conrail, by a method to be determined by the reorganization court.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">We cannot say that failing to apportion liability for vacation benefits entered on the books in 1976 but not vested prior to conveyance amounted to an abuse of discretion on the part of the reorganization court. We are simply not convinced that the method of accounting \u00fatilized by the estate is the appropriate basis, at least in this case, for determining whether employee vacations constituted a \u201cliability of an estate of a railroad\u201d under the Rail Act. Rather, the existence of a firm <em>contractual </em>obligation, which arises when the benefits vest, would appear to be a more appropriate benchmark of the railroad\u2019s liability for vacation benefits at the moment of conveyance.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Using this guide, we hold that CNJ is responsible for those vacation benefits that had vested prior to conveyance, and Conrail is liable for the vacation benefits that vested after conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">The next question, regarding liability for wages, raises the issue whether wages and vacations should be treated as analytically separable, as the reorganization court considered them to be. It sought to distinguish the two matters on the ground that the gain from the award of vacations \u2014 presumably involving employee good will toward the company \u2014 flowed mainly to Conrail, although such gain from payment of wages in the pre-conveyance period accrued chiefly to CNJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">However, the problem with the reorganization court\u2019s reasoning is that it fails to take adequate account of the governing statute, which does not make the kind of distinction advanced by the court. For the very reasons that CNJ is liable for vested vacation benefits arising in the pre-conveyance period, it likewise is liable for pre-con-veyance wages as they are earned. Indeed, as the trustee itself suggests, there is no rational basis in the statute for treating differently the liabilities for each of the two subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">We thus conclude that the reorganization court correctly ascertained that the wages earned in the pre-conveyance period constitute an obligation of CNJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">C. INTEREST ON THE WAGE CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">In support of the determination by the reorganization court that interest should not be paid to Conrail on the wage claims in question, CNJ argues that the court\u2019s conclusion resulted from an exercise of the general equitable powers conferred upon it by the Bankruptcy Act. Such powers, the trustee urges, \u201cclearly include that of the allowance or disallowance of any claim . on equitable grounds.\u201d Further, CNJ suggests that \u00a7 601 of the Rail Act reveals no limitations on the reorganization court\u2019s equitable authority bearing on the ruling about interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">Yet, in our consideration, the requirement to pay interest on the wage claims contested here is a product of the funding scheme established by \u00a7 211(h). In order to amass the monies used to make loans under \u00a7 211(h), USRA is empowered under the Rail Act to issue obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the Secretary of Transportation. The inability of Conrail or USRA to obtain interest from CNJ on the claims for administration expenses resulting from the payment of wages on behalf of CNJ would predictably lead to difficulties on the part of USRA in redeeming the obligations. Inevitably, the government would have to satisfy the deficiency. In view of this difficulty, and in order to allow no interest to be paid, it would appear necessary to find a statutory authorization to that effect. But upon review, it seems that the statute generates exactly the opposite result, namely, that payment of interest <em>is </em>contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">Section 211(h)(4)(C) of the Rail Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 721(h)(4)(C), states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-14\">The corporation . . . shall have a direct claim, as a current expense of administration, for reimbursement from the estate of a railroad in reorganization in the region for all obligations of such estate <em>(plus interest thereon) </em>which are paid the Corporation . . . . The right of the Corporation ... to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>receive reimbursement under this subpar-agraph from the estate of a railroad in reorganization in the region shall be reduced by the amount, if any, of loans, plus interest forgiven under paragraph (5) of this subsection, (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARX3\">The pertinent part of paragraph 5 of the subsection, \u00a7 211(h)(5), provides that upon the succession of USRA to Conrail\u2019s claim for reimbursement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-5\">The Association shall have a direct claim, as a current expense of administration of the estate of such railroad in reorganization, equal to the amount by which loans of the Corporation or of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, <em>plus interest, </em>have been forgiven . (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Conrail is thus to be allowed interest on its claim against the estate for the monies expended under \u00a7 211(h). And it appears reasonable to read these provisions as establishing that the interest pertains to the \u00a7 211(h) loan from USRA to Conrail.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">As the United States has pointed out, the fact that Conrail continues to defer payment of its employees\u2019 wages is primarily a matter between it and its employees, not between it and CNJ. It does not basically affect the discrete statutory question whether the estate or Conrail has the responsibility for payment of wages for the two weeks prior to conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that the reorganization court exceeded its discretion by refusing to grant interest on the wage claims except upon execution of a condition not contemplated by the statute, and that interest should be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">To summarize, (1) the proposed use of Conrail securities to pay the high-priority administration claims in question contravenes the absolute priority rule and thus cannot be sustained; (2) the trustee certificates must be paid in accordance with their terms; (3) vacation benefits that had vested at conveyance are the obligation of CNJ, and vacation benefits that had not so vested are the obligation of Conrail; (4) wages earned for work performed in the pre-con-veyance period are the responsibility of CNJ; and (5) interest on the sums advanced on behalf of CNJ for wage claims should be paid by CNJ to Conrail.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">The order of the reorganization court will be vacated, and the case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-9\">. The record indicates that the Conrail securities and the Certificates of Value are held by voting trustees, and will not be received by CNJ until distribution is ordered by the Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Court. <em>See </em>Section 301(g) of the Rail Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 741(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b865-7\">. In addition, should the consideration received by the estate under the Rail Act prove inadequate to avert the possibility of an unconstitutional taking, the recipients of the Conrail shares would have the option of pursuing a Tucker Act remedy in the Court of Claims. <em>Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, </em>419 U.S. 102, 148-56, 95 S.Ct. 335, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b865-8\">. Conrail also has a claim based upon its direct payment with its own funds of certain financial obligations involving railroad rolling stock, which are said to be attributable to the precon-veyance period. Conrail stresses that the Plan of Reorganization does not provide for this claim in any way, and that it has objected to the Plan\u2019s failure to make such provision for the claim. Since we are not called upon in this case to review a determination respecting the validity of that claim by Conrail, it would seem inappropriate to make an independent legal determination with respect to it. Yet it should be noted that the broad principles adduced in this opinion regarding the proper schedule for paying administration claims pertains to other such claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b865-13\">.

As the reorganization court wrote, 425 F.Supp. at 1068:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-8\">ConRail is to \u2018assume and apply\u2019 \u2018all obligations under existing collective bargaining agreements\u2019 \u2018as though an original party thereto.\u2019 Conrail steps into the shoes of the transferor estates. This subsection contains no subsequent indication that the word \u2018assume\u2019 is not to be given the interpretation which the trustee sought to give it in subsections (e) and (g). Here, there is no indication that \u2018assume\u2019 does not mean \u2018to take upon oneself the obligations of another.\u2019</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b866-14\">.

Penn Central trustees assert claims against CNJ for interline freight balances and billings related to rail services, and have participated in the reorganization proceedings involving CNJ.

The determination that the claims are administrative in nature for purposes of the absolute priority rule is, of course, distinct from the question whether they are \u201ccosts of administration\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 77(e)(3). We do not reach the latter question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b870-9\">.

It does not matter for purposes of our inquiry that eventually Conrail is expected to succeed financially. That Conrail\u2019s current value is speculative and uncertain is enough to indicate that cash is plainly a superior consideration which, if it is to be distributed, must be distributed to claimants with the highest priorities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b870-11\">. This conclusion is to be sharply distinguished from saying that the Plan violated \u00a7 77(e)(3) because it does not provide for payment of the claims in cash. Since we do not consider forms of payment other than the one proposed in the Plan, once again, we do not reach the broader question posed by the reorganization court. That not only is not necessary, given our determination regarding the application of the absolute priority rule in this case, but also it comports with the principle that flexibility must be the hallmark of railroad reorganizations. Thus, while we have concluded that the use of Conrail securities is violative of the absolute priority rule, we have designedly not addressed the issue of the legality of alternative forms of payment, such as installment notes, securities of the reorganized company, or even Conrail securities with certificates of value. Moreover, our conclusion should not prejudice the Penn Central\u2019s Plan of Reorganization, which, as we understand it, does not contemplate the use of Conrail securities as a means of paying administration claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b871-9\">. 425 F.Supp. at 1064.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b871-10\">. We also find no basis in the record for accepting the trustee\u2019s argument relating to the doctrine of equitable subordination. Further, we cannot accept the suggestion that the standard under the Fifth Amendment in determining whether the transfer of rail assets to Conrail amounted to an unconstitutional taking of property is the same as the absolute priority rule, for the two inquiries are directed at different objects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\">. The term \u201cfederal funds\u201d has a specific meaning in the parlance of the Federal Reserve system, dealing with the need for funds to cover momentary shortages in a given bank in the system, which is not relevant here.

In addition, Conrail points out that when Congress evidenced approval of the Final System Plan, <em>see </em>\u00a7 208(d)(1), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 718(d)(1), it was undoubtedly aware of the fact that USRA had indicated a \u201czero\u201d balance sheet liability for vacation pay for Conrail.
