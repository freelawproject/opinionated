Huntley, Jr. appeals from a grant of nominal damages in the amount of $100 by Judge Weinstein of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York following a jury trial on the issue of Huntley\u2019s entitlement to damages for infringement of his Fourteenth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-16\">This action, now before us for the second time, began in November 1973 following Huntley\u2019s termination as acting principal of Intermediate School 33 in Brooklyn, New York. The district court dismissed Huntley\u2019s complaint in February 1975 after a three-day bench trial. The facts underlying the litigation are summarized in <em>Huntley v. Community School Board, </em>543 F.2d 979, 980-83 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 929, 97 S.Ct. 1547, 51 L.Ed.2d 773 (1977) <em>(Huntley I). </em>In <em>Huntley I, </em>we rejected appellant\u2019s claim of racial discrimination but concluded that the procedures used in terminating appellant\u2019s employment insufficiently respected his interest in his professional reputation, giving rise to a viable claim of deprivation of due process. We held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-17\">that Huntley was entitled to a fair hearing prior to the [Community School] Board\u2019s public announcement of charges which might impair his chances of future employment as a school supervisor and which might damage his professional reputation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-18\">Id. at 986. The case was remanded \u201cfor determination of appropriate relief\u201d \u201cincluding what damages, if any, Huntley may be able to prove that he sustained.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-19\">There followed a jury trial before Judge Weinstein in which, while not disputing that his termination was justified, Huntley attempted to prove that the Community School Board\u2019s inadequate procedures had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>subjected him to unnecessary stigma, causing him emotional distress and eroding his subsequent employment opportunities. The jury nonetheless returned a verdict of no damages; the forelady appended to her announcement of this result the gratuitous observation that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-4\">We find that . . . the plaintiffs Constitutional rights were not violated due to the fact that he was dismissed . . . and [we] therefore feel that no compensation is due to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Since these remarks manifested confusion regarding the court\u2019s instructions, which had required that the violation be presumed and left only the amount of damages for consideration by the jurors, Judge Wein-stein refused to accept the verdict. Huntley\u2019s counsel volunteered the recommendation that the jury be reminded \u201cthat there is a Constitutional violation, and that it is not an issue for them to consider, and then they [are to] decide how much damages, if any.\u201d The court accepted this suggestion and supplemented the jury\u2019s instructions accordingly. Some three minutes after retiring to reconsider the case, the jury once again declined to award any damages. Judge Weinstein denied a motion by Huntley for a voir dire of the jurors, but indicated his intention to grant a new trial unless defendants agreed to an additur of $100, which they ultimately did. Appellant\u2019s urgings that the additur be increased were rejected, although Judge Weinstein observed that had he been sitting as a juror \u201cI would have found at least $1,000 . . . I think if a man\u2019s constitutional rights were violated, it\u2019s worth more than $100.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Prior to oral argument before us in this case, the Supreme Court decided Carey v. <em>Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978). <em>Carey </em>is dispositive on the question whether \u201csubstantial nonpunitive damages\u201d may be awarded to civil rights plaintiffs who, like Huntley, \u201cdo not prove that any . . . actual injury was caused by the denial of procedural due process.\u201d Id. at 248, 98 S.Ct. at 1044. The Court held that where (as here) no actual injury has been made out, plaintiffs demonstrating that they have been denied procedural due process rights should receive nominal damages. Id. at 247, 98 S.Ct. 1042. Appellant purports to take comfort from this holding, but fails to note the actual award set by the Court, which was \u201cnot to exceed one dollar\u201d if on remand the district court found that respondents\u2019 injuries did not exceed exposure to procedural abuses. Id. In the instant case, the award of nominal damages was substantially greater than one dollar, and given <em>Carey </em>we cannot characterize the amount as inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">Appellant argues that he is entitled to a new trial due to the evident confusion underlying the jury\u2019s initial verdict. Yet when that verdict was rendered, appellant did not move for a mistrial, but instead suggested a curative instruction, which the trial court proceeded to give. Appellant may not now complain that the verdict subsequently rendered was not to his liking. True, the second verdict followed close on the heels of the first and was identical to it in substance if not in form, but on the record presented a finding of no actual damages was not unreasonable. The most plausible interpretation of the jury\u2019s precipitate return is that a consensus had been reached prior to the first vote on the inadequacy of the proof of damages, and not \u2014 as appellant maintains \u2014 that the jury ignored the district court\u2019s admonition that infringement of appellant\u2019s constitutional rights must be presumed. Certainly there were no adequate grounds for overriding \u201c[t]he strong policy against any post-verdict inquiry into a juror\u2019s state of mind.\u201d <em>United States v. Dioguardi, </em>492 F.2d 70, 79 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 134, 42 L.Ed.2d 112 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-13\">Appellant contends that the district court\u2019s imposition of an additur reflected the fact that the verdict of no damages was palpably insufficient, and concludes that the proper remedy under the circumstances was a new trial. But Judge Weinstein unambiguously stated that the $100 additur constituted \u201cnominal damages for violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>of plaintiff\u2019s constitutional right\u201d; it was not intended as a substitute for compensatory damages that should, in the court\u2019s view, have been awarded. After Carey it is unclear that nominal damages of even the $100 Judge Weinstein awarded could survive a challenge by the designated payor;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> if Huntley is suggesting that he might have received more nominal damages from a jury in a new trial, the short answer is that under <em>Carey </em>he would not have been permitted to retain them. <em>Cf. Magnett v. Pel-letier, </em>488 F.2d 33, 35 (1st Cir. 1973) (refusing to permit an award of nominal damages in excess of one dollar in civil rights action although trial court had awarded $500); McCormick on Damages \u00a7 21, at p. 87 (1935) (\u201cgenerally accepted practice . . would consider as \u2018nominal\u2019 only an amount such as a few cents or a few dollars, say not more than $10\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Appellant also urges that even absent proof of actual injury he was entitled to a jury finding on punitive damages. Judge Weinstein admonished the jurors that \u201c[n]o punitive damages can be awarded.\u201d Carey left open the question whether \u201cexemplary or punitive damages might not be awarded in a proper case under \u00a7 1983 with the specific purpose of deterring or punishing violations of constitutional rights.\u201d 435 U.S. at 257 n. 11, 98 S.Ct. at 1049. <em>Cf. Zarcone v. Perry, </em>572 F.2d 52 (2d Cir. 1978) (upholding $60,000 punitive damages award based on civil rights violation resulting from \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cintolerable\u201d abuse of official power).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Here, as in Carey, however, there was no proof that appellees acted \u201cwith [a] malicious intention to deprive respondents of their rights or to do them other injury . . . 435 U.S. at 257, n. 11, 98 S.Ct. at 1049. It bears recalling that the procedural violation at issue here, as defined by the <em>Huntley I </em>court, lay in the public announcement of charges against Huntley pri- or to the holding of a \u201cfair hearing.\u201d 543 F.2d at 986. The \u201cpublic announcement\u201d was made pursuant to an order by the Acting Chancellor of New York City\u2019s Board of Education, who stated in a letter to the Community Board that the Huntley termination must be \u201cadopted or ratified at a duly noticed public meeting.\u201d Although one of Huntley\u2019s witnesses said that other probationary employee terminations had been \u201cratified\u201d at public meetings without mention of the name of the individual involved, the defense countered with uncon-tradicted testimony that the anonymous ratification procedure \u2014 an out-growth of contractual and Board of Education by-laws provisions \u2014 was limited in applicability to probationary <em>teachers, </em>and that \u201c[tjhere is no such procedure for terminating an acting principal in the by-laws of the Board of Education, nor in any contractual procedure.\u201d Of course, in hindsight the matter could and should have been handled more delicately, but the Board members were not flouting any guidelines known by them to be binding when they released the charges against Huntley. Their failure to anticipate the <em>Huntley I </em>holding would not support a punitive award. Cf. <em>Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 322, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 314 (1975). Finally, as we noted in <em>Huntley </em>I \u2014 and as was reiterated in testimony below \u2014 \u201cfive of the Board members who voted to terminate Huntley had resisted attempts three years earlier to have Huntley\u2019s original appointment set aside in the state courts as illegal.\u201d 543 F.2d at 984. Assuming arguendo that punitive damages can be grounded upon reckless indifference to the rights of others as well as upon malice, <em>Silver v. Cormier, </em>529 F.2d 161, 163 (10th Cir. 1976), and that punitive damages may be recovered in actions premised upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>civil rights violations even in the absence of actual loss to the plaintiff, <em>Stolberg v. Members of Board of Trustees, </em>474 F.2d 485, 489 (2d Cir. 1973), we are nonetheless convinced that no reasonable juror could have inferred the requisite bad faith from the trial record. Cf. <em>Askew v. Bloemker, </em>548 F.2d 673, 679 (7th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Exception is taken to the admission of evidence at trial regarding the reasons for Huntley\u2019s discharge. Appellant complains that he \u201cwas willing to and, in fact, did concede the justification for his termination,\u201d alleging that this evidence was therefore irrelevant to the issues being tried. But appellees plausibly respond that since Huntley\u2019s effort to win compensatory damages hinged in part on proof of mental distress, they were entitled to demonstrate the existence of alternative sources for that distress: namely, the justified dismissal of Huntley and the chaotic conditions that led to it. Moreover, the defense\u2019s recapitulation of the protracted interval of friction between Huntley and his superiors cut against appellant\u2019s claim that his injuries were compounded by shock at an unexpected loss of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Finally, appellant contests the trial court\u2019s refusal to award attorneys fees, as it was empowered to do under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. We find no abuse of discretion in Judge Weinstein\u2019s conclusion that appellant at most had won a \u201cmoral victory\u201d of insufficient magnitude to warrant an award under \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\">. Appellees have not presented any such challenge, so we need not reach the issue here. Nor do we pass upon whether the district court\u2019s use of additur, a procedure generally unavailable in the federal courts, was proper. Cf. 6A J. Moore, Federal Practice \u2019 59.05[4]; Note, Remittitur Practice in the Federal Courts, 76 Colum.L.Rev. 299 n. 2 (1976). Appellees have not contested the court\u2019s power to employ the device, and appellant does so only insofar as the additur supplanted what for him would have been the preferred course of holding a new trial. As already noted, retrial of this case would have been neither necessary nor appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
