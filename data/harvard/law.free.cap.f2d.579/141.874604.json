Coffrin, <em>Judge, </em>of a writ of habeas corpus is whether the retrial of petitioner-appellant, following a state trial judge\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>declaration of a mistrial over petitioner\u2019s objection would violate his Fifth Amendment right to be protected against double jeopardy. We hold that it would and reverse the denial of appellant\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-21\">The facts are simple and straightforward. On October 13, 1976, the trial of appellant for the first-degree murder of his stepfather began in the Orleans Superior Court, Vermont, before Judge Silvio Valente and a sequestered jury. It was undisputed that appellant had on April 6, 1976, shot and killed his stepfather. The defense was insanity or, in the alternative, diminished capacity arising out of family stress, appellant\u2019s pathological dependence on his mother and other causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>During the first two days of trial the jury heard three witnesses, the most important of whom was appellant\u2019s mother, Sandra Downer. She first described the immediate circumstances of the shooting, which occurred in an isolated trailer-home in northern Vermont where three poverty-stricken unemployed people (mother, son and stepfather) lived during the winter in a state of semi-confinement and tension, with the stepfather evidencing a dislike for the stepson. On direct and cross-examination Mrs. Downer gave in detail a lengthy and sympathetic account of appellant\u2019s background, beginning with his harrowing experiences as a child. According to his mother, appellant had frequently been brutally beaten and mistreated as a child by his real father, an alcoholic, with the result that appellant often suffered bleeding from the ears and hardness of hearing. She testified that her son had been withdrawn as a child, isolating himself from contact with other children. He had a chronic stutter, and had to be fed occasionally by his mother until he was nearly 12 years old. This situation did not improve with the mother\u2019s second marriage, this time to another alcoholic, which resulted in a second divorce. In the meantime appellant got into trouble in his early teens, and was confined in state reformatories twice for a total of nearly two years. His mother married for a third time, but this marriage also proved to be an unhappy one, resulting in beating of the mother by her third husband, the eventual victim of the homicide, for which appellant was indicted and brought to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The mother further testified that at her invitation and with her husband\u2019s consent appellant moved in with the mother and stepfather. Fights between appellant and stepfather developed and on occasion appellant would evince peculiar expressions or mannerisms. The son, according to his mother\u2019s testimony, suffered from \u201cdreams and fantasies\u201d and on the night of the homicide \u201cdidn't know what he was doing.\u201d Shortly prior to the homicide the mother and stepfather had an argument in the trailer in appellant\u2019s presence about allowing the mother to telephone her daughter, which ended with the mother stating that she and her son should go somewhere else where no one would tell her what to do. Shortly thereafter, the stepfather telephoned the police, reporting that he wanted appellant \u201cout of the house.\u201d The shooting occurred a few moments later.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">On the morning of the third day of trial appellant was hospitalized with a 15% collapsed lung. Three doctors, including one appointed by the court, concurred in the view that hospitalization would be required for a period of from <em>7 </em>to 10 days, a prognosis that turned out to be correct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Confronted with this development, the trial judge asked for the views of counsel as to whether a mistrial should be declared. Appellant\u2019s attorney strongly opposed a mistrial on the grounds that the delay and second trial would be an \u201cenormous psychological hardship\u201d on Dunkerley and his mother, and would subject him to double jeopardy. It was later disclosed that appellant was satisfied with the testimony that had been given by the mother and that \u201cin the opinion of the defense the trial was going particularly well for the defendant.\u201d Defense counsel suggested that in lieu of being subjected to repetition of the trauma already experienced his client would be prepared to waive presence at the trial during the period of hospitalization pursuant to Rule 43(b), Vt.Rules of Crim.Procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>The defendant\u2019s suggestion was vigorously opposed by the prosecutor who stated that \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d would the State proceed without the defendant being present and suggested that the defendant\u2019s absence in the hospital could not be treated as \u201cvoluntary\u201d within the meaning of Rule 43(b)(1), Vt.Rules of Crim.Procedure, so that the trial could not proceed without him. Thereupon defendant\u2019s counsel suggested as an alternative that the jury, with his client\u2019s consent, be de-sequestered, which would permit it to go home, and that trial be suspended for the 7 to 10-day period during which the defendant would be confined to the hospital, following which trial could be resumed or the situation reviewed to determine whether a mistrial would be appropriate. The prosecutor, although refusing to move for a mistrial, took no position with respect to this proposal but suggested that the trial judge might declare a mistrial because \u201cJeopardy is not effected [sic] by the Court on its own motion declaring a mistrial.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defense, on the other hand, stated that \u201cif he [Dunkerley] is able to come back 7 to 10 days that would not be an undue delay and our position is that he has been placed in jeopardy here and that any subsequent trial would be double jeopardy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The trial judge, after a 10-minute recess, announced that \u201cthe Court of its own motion is going to declare a mistrial,\u201d to which the defendant\u2019s attorney objected. The jury was called in, advised of the court\u2019s action and discharged. The only reason given by the court for its action was a general statement that \u201cin order to insure a fair trial for the defendant here, . the Court felt in the interest of justice that a mistrial should be declared.\u201d Judge Va-lente also stated that he had taken into consideration the fact that it would not be a very lengthy trial and advised the jury \u201cI don\u2019t think I have any alternative to fairness to both the respondent and the State. I have to declare a mistrial.\u201d No mention was made by the Court of the alternative of a continuance, which had been proposed by appellant\u2019s counsel and not objected to by the prosecutor. Nor was any reason given for rejecting that alternative.'</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Dunkerley next moved to dismiss the indictment against him on double jeopardy grounds, which was denied. When the Vermont Supreme Court denied him leave to file an interlocutory appeal, he filed a petition for habeas corpus in the Chittenden Superior Court, which was denied, then he appealed that decision to the Vermont Supreme Court, which affirmed the denial of the writ in an opinion dated June 7, 1977. <em>In re Dunkerley, </em>376 A.2d 43 (Vt.S.Ct.1977). The Vermont Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s absence from trial was not voluntary and that the trial court could not exercise its power under Vt.Rules Crim.Pro-cedure 43(b) to conduct the trial during his absence, but that, assuming the defendant could waive his constitutional right to be present, the trial court had acted within its discretion in refusing to continue without Dunkerley since the defense was insanity and \u201cthe jury\u2019s observation and evaluation of him with respect to his mental condition\u201d was a factor that might be taken into account by the jury. The court did not discuss the question of whether, in lieu of a mistrial, Judge Valente should have suspended trial for 7 to 10 days until Dunker-ley was released from the hospital and could be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Having exhausted his state remedies, Dunkerley then petitioned the federal district court for the District of Vermont for habeas corpus. On October 13, 1977, Judge Coffrin, dismissing the petition, concluded that since the trial judge had been made aware of all the circumstances, including the alternatives to a mistrial, and neither the prosecution nor a government witness was the chief cause of the interruption of the trial, the declaration of a mistrial was' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>not clearly erroneous or an abuse of discretion. He further held that Vt.R.Cr.P. 43(b)(1) merely allowed the court to continue with a trial in the defendant\u2019s absence under certain circumstances and \u201cdoes not give a defendant the right to have his trial proceed without him.\u201d Finally, Judge Coff-rin concluded that the defendant\u2019s right to waive confrontation of witnesses did not carry with it the right to insist on the trial proceeding without him. From this dismissal Dunkerley appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The general principles by which we are governed, in determining whether retrial following declaration of a mistrial over a defendant\u2019s objection would violate his Fifth Amendment right<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to be protected against double jeopardy, are well settled. Once jeopardy has attached, the defendant has a \u201cvalued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal,\u201d Wade <em>v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 689, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974 (1949) (quoted with approval by the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 484, 91 S.Ct. 547, 557, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971), <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 466, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973), and <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 503, 98 S.Ct. 824, 829, 54 L. Ed.2d 717 (1978)). The purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is not merely to insure against harassment of an accused through repeated efforts by the Government to obtain a conviction after an acquittal, but also to protect the defendant against continued exposure to anxiety, embarrassment, expense and restrictions on his liberty that might be caused by aborting one trial to commence another.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">\u201cEven if the first trial is not completed, a second prosecution may be grossly unfair. It increases the financial and emotional burden on the accused, prolongs the period in which he is stigmatized by an unresolved accusation of wrongdoing, and may even enhance the risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted. The danger of such unfairness to the defendant exists whenever a trial is aborted before it is completed. Consequently, as a general rule, the prosecutor is entitled to one, and only one, opportunity to require an accused to stand trial.\u201d (Footnotes omitted). <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 503, 98 S.Ct. at 829 (1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Against the defendant\u2019s right to have his trial completed before a particular tribunal there must be balanced the public interest in insuring that the prosecutor be accorded one full opportunity to present his case against the accused and that both sides receive a fundamentally fair trial. Recognizing this, the Supreme Court, in an early landmark decision by Mr. Justice Story, held that a trial court may discharge a jury without precluding a new trial when, after \u201ctaking all of the circumstances into consideration\u201d and exercising \u201csound discretion\u201d, it determines \u201cthat there is a manifest necessity for the act [declaration of mistrial], or the ends of justice would otherwise be defeated.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>9 Wheat. (22 U.S.) 579, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">The types of situation that might constitute \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d or defeat \u201cthe ends of justice\u201d unless a mistrial is declared are obviously too many and varied to be catalogued or to permit establishment of precise formulas or rigid rules of thumb. A great deal of discretion must therefore be vested in the trial judge, who is usually best situated to determine the degree of necessity for the declaration of a mistrial when an unexpected event occurs during a trial. For these reasons \u201cwe accord the highest degree of respect to the trial judge\u2019s evaluation,\u201d <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>98 S.Ct. at 833 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">On the other hand, from the outset the Supreme Court has cautioned that \u201cthe power [to declare a mistrial] ought to be used with the greatest caution under ur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>gent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes,\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>9 Wheat. (22 U.S.) at 579. More recently, the Court has construed \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d as meaning a \u201chigh degree\u201d of necessity \u201cbefore concluding that a mistrial is appropriate,\u201d <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 506, 98 S.Ct. at 831 (1978), and has warned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">\u201c[I]n view of the importance of the right [to have the trial concluded by a particular tribunal] and the fact that it is frustrated by any mistrial, the prosecutor must shoulder the burden of justifying the mistrial if he is to avoid the double jeopardy bar. His burden is a heavy one. The prosecutor must demonstrate \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 for any mistrial declared over the objection of the defendant.\u201d (Footnote omitted). 98 S.Ct. at 830.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"As_m\">Although findings of fact or a statement of the trial court\u2019s reasons for the declaration of a mistrial are not constitutionally mandated, the failure of the record to provide adequate support for the trial judge\u2019s action may bar a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">It is not enough that plausible reasons might conceivably exist for the trial judge\u2019s action. If we are to review his exercise of discretion, to which deference should ordinarily be accorded, we must know the basis for that decision as \u201cdisclosed by the record,\u201d including \u201cargument of counsel prior to the judge\u2019s ruling.\u201d <em>Id., </em>98 S.Ct. at 836.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For instance, a retrial has been barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause where the record revealed that a mistrial was declared (1) to permit the Government to make further efforts to secure the presence of a key witness who had not been subpoenaed prior to commencement of trial, <em>Downum v. United States, </em>372 U.S. 734, 83 S.Ct. 1033, 10 L.Ed.2d 100 (1963); (2) because the trial judge believed that government witnesses had not been adequately warned of their Fifth Amendment rights, <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971); or (3) on the ground that there had been an implicit acquittal by a verdict rendered by the first jury on a related charge, <em>Green v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957). On the other hand, the discretion of the trial court to declare a mistrial has been upheld where the record showed that (1) the first jury could not agree, <em>United States v. Perez, supra; Logan v. United States, </em>144 U.S. 263, 12 S.Ct. 617, 36 L.Ed. 429 (1892); <em>Keerl v. Montana, </em>213 U.S. 135, 29 S.Ct. 469, 53 L.Ed. 734 (1909); (2) one of the jurors was found to be biased against a party after the commencement of trial, <em>Wade v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 689, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974 (1949); (3) there was misconduct or anticipated misconduct by the prosecutor at the first trial, <em>Gori v. United States, </em>367 U.S. 364, 81 S.Ct. 1523, 6 L.Ed.2d 901 (1961), or by defense counsel, <em>Arizona v. Washington, supra, </em>which would render the first trial unfair; or (4) a fatal defect in the indictment would in any event require that a conviction be set aside, <em>Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Turning to the present case, our task as a reviewing court is to determine first, whether the basis for the trial judge\u2019s mistrial order in this case, which includes no explicit finding of manifest necessity, is adequately disclosed by the record; and secondly, we must determine whether the trial judge\u2019s exercise of his discretion was sound. It is undisputed that jeopardy had attached once the jury was sworn and testimony was taken. Although a short trial was anticipated, a key witness, Mrs. Downturn is not subject to attack . . simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>er, had testified at length under both direct and cross-examination. It is further beyond question that the defendant objected vigorously and repeatedly to the declaration of a mistrial, both before and after it was declared, expressly asserting his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause and offering to waive his presence or to consent to a 7 to 10-day continuance until his anticipated return from hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Neither the record nor the parties suggest any reason why the continuance proposal, with the jurors free to return home until resumption of trial, would not have been a feasible and practical solution to the problem. There is no evidence that the jury would thereby have been exposed to prejudicial publicity. Indeed, the record is silent as to whether the case received any publicity at all. The unlikelihood of prejudicial publicity would not be surprising, since Dunkerley conceded that he had killed his stepfather, and none of the persons or witnesses involved appear to have been public figures. The sole issue remaining to be tried was a narrow one, whether Dunk-erley possessed at the time of the homicide the requisite mental capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Unlike the situation in <em>Arizona v. Washington, supra, </em>where the prosecutor repeatedly moved for and vigorously urged a mistrial based on defense counsel\u2019s prejudicial statements to the jury, the State here did not object to a 7 to 10-day continuance and did not seek a mistrial. Nor did it, faced with the burden of proving \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d in view of Dunkerley\u2019s objections, offer evidence of any other factors militating against the continuance proposal, such as Vermont legal prohibitions, or proof that because of other commitments a 7 to 10-day continuance would work an undue hardship upon court, jury, counsel or the prosecutor. Indeed, the practice of granting such continuances because of unexpected developments during the course of a jury trial is commonplace in many jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">Nor did the trial judge, in declaring a mistrial, suggest that the alternative of a short continuance would be unfeasible, unfair to the parties, violative of any state law or practice, or unreasonable under the circumstances.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Judge Valente merely stated, after taking a short period to consider the alternatives proposed by the parties, that he was declaring a mistrial in fairness to the defendant. We recognize that where the record discloses plausible reasons supporting the declaration of a mistrial the trial judge may not be required to state his reasons. <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 512, 98 S.Ct. at 834. However, we \u201chave an obligation to satisfy [ourselves] that, in the words of Mr. Justice Story, the trial judge exercised \u2018sound discretion\u2019 in declaring a mistrial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">We do not suggest that the trial judge in this case acted impetuously. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 458, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1973). When the problem of petitioner\u2019s illness arose, he con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ferred with counsel and gave each a fair opportunity to explain his situation with regard to how the trial should proceed. But the apparent availability of at least one alternative to a mistrial \u2014 adjourning the trial for 7 to 10 days \u2014 leads us to conclude that a mistrial was not a \u201cmanifest necessity.\u201d In the absence of any record evidence or statement by the court indicating why a short continuance would have been unreasonable, unfair, or impractical, we decline to speculate as to factors that the trial judge might possibly have considered, such as the \u201cfreshness\u201d of the evidence. On this record the declaration of a mistrial cannot properly be sustained, over appellant\u2019s objection, as having been required by a \u201chigh degree\u201d of necessity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">We reverse and direct that the writ issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-6\">, Appellant was returned to prison after 10 days of hospitalization.

This statement was clearly erroneous. Upon the improper <em>sua sponte </em>declaration of a mistrial by the trial judge, retrial is precluded by the Double Jeopardy Clause, <em>United States v. </em>Jora, 400 U.S. 470, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\">. The double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment, which provides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb\u201d applies to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b204-6\">. In <em>United States v. Grasso, </em>552 F.2d 46 (2d Cir. 1977), we held that \u201cbefore a trial judge declares a mistrial, he must make explicit findings, preferably after a hearing, that there are no reasonable alternatives to mistrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Arizona v. </em>Washington, 434 U.S. 497, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978), indicates that at least with respect to a state defendant seeking federal habeas, a \u201cstate trial judge\u2019s mistrial declara-because he failed to find \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 in those words or to articulate on the record all the factors which informed the deliberate exercise of his discretion.\u201d <em>Id., </em>98 S.Ct. at 836 (footnote omitted). Where \u201cthe record provides sufficient justification for the state court ruling, the failure to explain that ruling more completely does not render it constitutionally defective.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\">. Judge Moore\u2019s dissent speculates that the trial judge may have opted for a mistrial rather than a continuance (which would have entailed de-sequestration of the jury) because sequestration is \u201cgenerally favored in <em>all </em>serious criminal cases\u201d in Vermont. <em>Infra, </em>p. 149. However, no Vermont statute or rule of practice prevented the trial judge in this case from de-sequestering the jury. Nor did the Vermont Supreme Court, possessed as it is of expertise in Vermont law, suggest that the trial judge\u2019s action could be justified on such a basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">On the contrary, it has stated that the \u201cpropriety of separation of juries in any given situation is not a matter specifically dealt with by our statutes. The governing rules have derived from practices developed by our courts over their long history.\u201d <em>State v. Brisson, </em>124 Vt. 211, 201 A.2d 881, 882 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">The \u201cgoverning rule\u201d in a noncapital case such as this one would have prevented de-se-questration of the jury only if the defendant objected. <em>State v. Anderson, </em>119 Vt. 355, 125 A.2d 827, 831 (1956), cited with approval in <em>State v. Brisson, supra, </em>201 A.2d at 883. The record clearly shows that Dunkerley's counsel actually opposed sequestration of the jury from the outset of the trial. (Joint App. 7-9). The record also shows that neither party, nor the court, considered that any legal prohibition stood in the way of de-sequestration when that alternative was proposed by the defense. Therefore, de-sequestration was a course of action entirely available to the trial judge, and not an alternative that was either disfavored, or of questionable validity, because of Vermont law or practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b206-7\">. We disagree with our dissenting colleague\u2019s characterization of the holding of this case. We do not decide that it is an abuse of discretion for a trial judge to declare a mistrial when a defendant\u2019s \u201csudden illness require[s] a lengthy period of hospitalization.\u201d No such lengthy period of hospitalization is at issue here. According to the record, the defendant was estimated to be absent for 7-10 days. This prognosis turned out to be correct. What we hold today is that we cannot approve the declaration of a mistrial when the record does not indicate that the mistrial was manifestly necessary, in light of the relatively brief interruption in the trial caused by the defendant\u2019s illness, and the availability of another alternative to the mistrial declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Although we do not reach the question of whether or under what circumstances it would be proper for a trial judge to declare a mistrial because of a defendant\u2019s <em>lengthy </em>absence, the cases cited by Judge Moore in his dissent indicate some of the circumstances involving a defendant\u2019s or juror\u2019s incapacity that have necessitated a mistrial. See <em>United States v. Potash, </em>118 F.2d 54 (2d Cir. 1941) (mistrial declared when juror became incapacitated after deliberations had begun); <em>Gardes v. United States, </em>87 F. 172 (5th Cir. 1898) (mistrial declared after juror had become totally and permanently disabled); <em>Featherston v. Mitchell, </em>418 F.2d 582 (5th Cir. 1969) (mistrial declared when trial court became aware that defendant might not be competent to stand trial, and ordered extended hospitalization and psychiatric observation); <em>United States v. Stein, </em>140 F.Supp. 761 (S.D.N.Y.1956) (one defendant severed from trial when she required \u201cmajor\u201d operation and 3-4 month convalescence).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">In all of these cases, the declaration of a mistrial was approved because circumstances occurred that rendered continuation of the trial infeasible, i. e., a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d justified aborting the trial. We consider our decision today to be consistent with these cases, as well as the other well-settled precedents applicable to cases of this kind. See pp. 145-147, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b206-5\">MOORE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A6xv\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The majority today holds that a state trial judge abused his discretion when he halted the trial of a murder defendant whose sudden illness required a lengthy period of hospitalization. I believe that the situation could properly have been found to constitute such \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d as is required by the Constitution to permit a retrial, and I accordingly dissent from my colleagues\u2019 substitution of their after-the-fact judgment for that which was responsibly exercised by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">In reaching my conclusion that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a retrial in this case, I start with the proposition that has remained basic to this area for over 150 years, ever since it was first applied in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez, 22 </em>U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">\u201c[I]n all cases of this nature, the law has invested Courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. They are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject; and it is impossible to define all the circumstances, which would render it proper to interfere. To be sure, the power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes; and, in capital cases especially, Courts should be extremely careful how they interfere with any of the chances of life, in favour of the prisoner. But, after all, they have the right to order the discharge; and the security which the public have for the faithful, sound, and conscientious exercise of this discretion, rests, in this, as in other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>cases, upon the responsibility of the Judges, under their oaths of office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">This \u201cdiscretionary\u201d standard has remained the governing standard to this day, as is evident from the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 512, 98 S.Ct. 824, 834, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978), which emphasized that a trial judge\u2019s determination to grant a mistrial \u201cis entitled to special respect\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 510, 98 S.Ct. 833, and to which the majority paid no heed in deciding as it did. In <em>Washington, </em>a mistrial had been declared without a statement of reasons and over the defendants\u2019 objections because defense counsel had interjected improper comment in his opening address. The Supreme Court held that a retrial should be permitted despite the fact that \u201csome trial judges might have proceeded with the trial after giving the jury appropriate cautionary instructions\u201d instead of having halted the trial. <em>Id. </em>The Court quite candidly acknowledged that \u201c[i]n a strict, literal sense, the mistrial was not \u2018necessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Yet, the majority could not say that the trial judge\u2019s decision to abort the trial constituted such an unsound exercise of discretion as to preclude a new trial and, indeed, the Court suggested, see <em>id., </em>that the application of something less than the \u201cstrictest\u201d of \u201cscrutiny\u201d was appropriate in a case where the mistrial ruling was predicated neither on the state\u2019s misconduct nor any charge of careless preparation on its part \u2014 when the potential for harassment, the major consideration underlying the double jeopardy protection, <em>see Green v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 187-88, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957), is simply not involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The same standard of deference applied in <em>Washington </em>is appropriate in this case. No one has even suggested an improper motive on the part of the prosecutor in this case. Rather, the precipitating disruptive factor necessitating a mistrial was the defendant\u2019s illness which, unfortunate as it was, was in no way chargeable to the state. Nowhere was the state\u2019s preparedness challenged; yet, its interest in having \u201cone complete opportunity to convict\u201d, <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>98 S.Ct. at 832, has now been compromised by my colleagues in the majority, only because of their disagreement with the alternative chosen by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Nor was the trial judge\u2019s conduct in this . case \u201cerratic\u201d or precipitous \u2014 the factor tipping the scales in <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470,91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1970), as was emphasized in both <em>Illinois v. Somer-ville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 469, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973), and, more recently, in the <em>Washington </em>case itself, 98 S.Ct. at 835. Rather, in this case, the trial judge solicited alternatives, considered them, and rejected them as inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">The majority rules, however, that because the record is silent as to prejudicial publicity, and because no statement of reasons was given for rejecting the proposal for a continuance pending the defendant\u2019s hospitalization (with the concomitant de-seques-tration of the jury during the hiatus), the judge committed error in failing to adopt that alternative in this case. As to the lack of a statement of reasons, the majority concedes (see majority opinion, <em>ante </em>at page 147) that <em>Washington </em>has made it clear that no reasons need be stated on the record, 98 S.Ct. at 835, as long as plausible reasons exist in support of the mistrial ruling. I am satisfied that the judge acted well within proper bounds in ruling as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">First, his decision rejecting de-sequestration as an alternative was entirely consistent with Vermont practice, under which sequestration is generally favored in <em>all </em>serious criminal cases. <em>See State v. Anderson, </em>119 Vt. 355, 125 A.2d 827, 830-31 (1956); <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>129 Vt. 220, 223, 274 A.2d 690, 694 (1971). In a state which favors sequestration, such procedure would seem to be an appropriate prophylactic safeguard to prevent extra-evidentiary information from prejudicing the verdict. It is no answer to the trial judge in <em>this </em>case that in fact there was no likelihood of publicity, for the seriousness of the crime itself suggested that precautions must be taken. Therefore, I vigorously dissent from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>majority which holds that the action of the trial judge, in adherence to the common understandings of criminal practice in his state, was \u201cabusive\u201d as a matter of federal constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Even if, in an exercise of prescience, the trial judge should have foreseen that de-se-questration would pose no problems because, as the majority points out, publicity was not \u201clikely\u201d, nonetheless the judge\u2019s rejection of the continuance alternative was sound and justifiable. In fact, Judge Va-lente\u2019s concerns in rejecting the proposal were quite adequately indicated on the record. After the judge solicited suggestions from counsel and ascertained defendant\u2019s condition, he reported to counsel that the defendant\u2019s treating physician had confirmed the prognosis that Dunkerley \u201cshould be confined 7 to 10 days. If he gets worse of course he will be there a lot longer.\u201d The judge then explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">\u201cI want to state upon the record that although the Court realizes this is a very serious case ... it will not be a very lengthy case when it is ultimately tried so that is one of the considerations that the Court had in mind in declaring a mistrial. That in order to insure a fair trial for the defendant here, that the Court felt in the interest of justice that a mistrial should be declared. The Court further finds of course that it wasn\u2019t any voluntary absence here.\u201d (Joint Appendix at 20).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">While the majority does not seriously dispute the \u201cvoluntary absence\u201d issue, a matter essentially requiring interpretation of Vermont law, it finds nothing in the judge\u2019s statement, nor on the record as a whole, to support the judge\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance. However, the judge\u2019s concerns were voiced only after defense counsel had argued that no prejudice would result as a consequence of the probable 7 to 10 day hiatus \u201cbetween the taking of evidence\u201d. (Joint Appendix at 19). It seems to me quite obvious that it could create no small concern that, at a minimum, a 7 to 10 day hiatus would intervene between the \u201ctaking of evidence\u201d in a murder case such as this. Potentially, each juror could be required to wait even longer than 10 days before being permitted to consider the evidence already given by defendant\u2019s main witness and to weigh it against the fresher evidence to be offered by experts, as well as by the defendant himself, after his return. <em>Any </em>continuance would raise a potential that the jurors\u2019 reactions to the earlier evidence would be tempered by other, extra-eviden-tiary considerations; in a serious murder case such as this, where the length of the hiatus exceeds the length of the trial, the trial judge, who is in the best position to evaluate the abilities of the particular jurors to pay heed to the evidence alone, should be permitted to exercise all the procedural control he thinks necessary to promote a just judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">In concluding that the trial judge\u2019s conduct of this case was unsupportable under the law of double jeopardy, the majority has effectively created a constitutionally mandated rule that a state trial judge <em>must </em>grant a continuance if requested by a stricken defendant because his right to proceed with the jury of his choice is paramount. I am mindful of the importance to a defendant of his right to proceed with the jury he has preferred, but it is a right that has never been thought absolute. Indeed, it has been held no bar to retrial in cases, including one in our own circuit, where a mistrial had been declared due to the mid-trial illness or incapacity of a juror in the case. The judge may discharge the jury even if the defendant desires to proceed with only the eleven remaining jurors from his chosen panel, and even if the state consents. <em>See Parker v. United States, </em>507 F.2d 587 (8th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 916, 95 S.Ct. 1576, 43 L.Ed.2d 782 (1975); <em>United States v. Potash, </em>118 F.2d 54, 56 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>313 U.S. 584, 61 S.Ct. 1103, 85 L.Ed. 1540 (1941) (trial judge has discretion under <em>Perez); Gardes v. United States, </em>87 F. 172,177 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>171 U.S. 689, 19 S.Ct. 884, 43 L.Ed. 1179 (1898). The <em>Perez </em>discretionary standard was invoked in support of all these trial decisions to discharge the panel and begin anew, as it was cited to support re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>trial in cases where the defendant had become incapacitated or ill, as in this case. <em>Featherston v. Mitchell, </em>418 F.2d 582 (5th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 937, 90 S.Ct. 945, 25 L.Ed.2d 117 (1970); <em>United States v. Stein, </em>140 F.Supp. 761 (S.D.N.Y. 1956) <em>(Perez </em>and <em>Potash </em>cited). <em>See also, </em>Annot., 159 A.L.R. 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The majority\u2019s new \u201crule\u201d, though, would seemingly require that a continuance be granted for any illness, even if the trial judge himself were. to fall ill, since the defendant would be deprived of his right to proceed with the first jury were a new trial to be ordered. However, the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure' themselves suggest that the sudden disability of a judge would create a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for a mistrial ruling. The Reporter\u2019s Notes to Rule 25 explain that no provision has been made for substituting another judge in the event of disability during a criminal trial because under Vermont practice it is unlikely that there will be many trials of sufficient length to require such provision. The Reporter then suggests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">\u201cA mistrial is the proper remedy for disability occurring during trial. Presumably, a mistrial in such circumstances does not bar reprosecution because the \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 recognized as permitting retrial after jeopardy has attached would be found. See <em>United States v. Perez, </em>.; <em>Illinois v. Somerville . . </em>.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"avu-dedup-0\">(V.R.Cr.P. 25, Vt.Stat.Ann. (1974)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AND\">Whether it is the judge, a juror, or the defendant himself who suddenly falls ill, the trial has been disrupted severely, and itself has been jeopardized, much the same as if prejudicial comment has been injected into the proceedings. A judge must then pick up the pieces of the proceedings, and must choose the most appropriate course to assure fair proceedings; he is in a unique situation \u2014 a situation not shared by my colleagues who face only a cold written record. I think it well within a trial judge\u2019s sound discretion to decide to begin anew under such circumstances; his decision must be upheld as long as it rests on sound rules of state practice and conscientious deliberation. As the Court said in <em>Illinois v. Somer-ville, </em>410 U.S. at 468, 93 S.Ct. at 1072:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">\u201cWe believe that in light of the State\u2019s established rules of criminal procedure, the trial judge\u2019s declaration of a mistrial was not an abuse of discretion. Since this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Benton v. Maryland, . </em>federal courts will be confronted with such claims that arise in large measure from the often diverse procedural rules existing in the 50 States. Federal courts should not be quick to conclude that simply because a state procedure does not conform to the . federal . rule, it does not serve a legitimate state policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">In <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>the Supreme Court declared that the \u201coverriding interest in the evenhanded administration of justice requires that we accord the highest degree of respect to the trial judge\u2019s evaluation\u201d of the particular problem which threatens the proceedings, and that we refrain from second-guessing a trial ruling made after rational consideration of the alternatives. <em>Washington </em>itself permitted retrial even though the Court acknowledged that a different trial judge may have chosen a different course, perhaps to \u201ccure\u201d the prejudicial statements by cautionary instructions. Deference, however, was paid to the trial judge\u2019s ability to assess the jurors\u2019 reactions to the proceedings and his responsible conduct in acting as he did. Though in a \u201cstrict . . . sense, the mistrial was not \u2018necessary\u2019 \u201d in <em>Washington, </em>98 S.Ct. at 834, the necessity was sufficiently manifested so that the Constitution would not be offended were a retrial to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">The situation is not different in this case. The serious illness of the defendant caused an emergency situation requiring a sound decision as to the proper course to pursue. The trial judge acted with the motivation to ensure that the defendant and the state would have a fair trial, and his rulings conformed with standards of practice long established in his state. To hold that such conduct is an abuse of discretion is not only to ignore the teachings of the <em>Perez </em>case, which has been the governing standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>since 1824, and which has formed the basis for many holdings supporting discretionary mistrials in this circuit and elsewhere, but it is also contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s latest holding in <em>Washington </em>\u2014that discretion, especially that of judges of the various states, is to be respected when honestly and soundly exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">By their decision the majority creates a federal-appellate-judge-made-rule of trial procedure having little regard for the exigencies of the trial. The majority\u2019s position in my opinion is at odds with the law and a usurpation of the powers vested in the trial judges of the various states. I therefore dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
