In our decision reported at 552 F.2d 159 (1977), we held that the Debtor, Ike Slodov, was personally liable under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672 for a tax liability of corporations which he controlled for unpaid taxes withheld from wages prior to his assumption of control. The Supreme Court granted the certiorari, 434 U.S. 817, 98 S.Ct. 54, 54 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977), and thereafter reversed that portion of the judgment of this court which held the Debtor liable for wage withholding and FICA taxes required to be collected from employees\u2019 wages prior to January 31, 1969. <em>Slodov, Petitioner v.
