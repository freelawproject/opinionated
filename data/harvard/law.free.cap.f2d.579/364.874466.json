Barnes contends that counsel\u2019s misrepresentations to him induced him to plead guilty with the understanding that he would receive a single four-year prison sentence rather than the two consecutive four-year terms actually imposed by the district court. On appeal, Barnes challenges the adequacy of the hearing he received on his motion in the district court. Finding that Barnes has failed to meet the burden of showing his entitlement to Section 2255 relief, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Barnes pled guilty to one count of a two count indictment for interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2313 and one count of a three count indictment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for conspiracy to possess stolen goods moving in interstate commerce, a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 659. Barnes contends that the agreement contained a promise that he would serve only four years in prison. The district judge imposed consecutive four-year sentences on each count for a sentence totaling eight years. Paul Cobb, Barnes\u2019 original attorney, could not be in court when Barnes pled. David Bohannon, an attorney practicing with Cobb, went in his stead. Barnes contends that Bohannon told him that the government had agreed that he would receive a prison term of only four years in return for a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The district court ordered an evidentiary hearing before a magistrate on Barnes\u2019 Section 2255 motion. Prior to the hearing, the district court required Barnes, as a condition for further proceedings on his motion, to submit his written statement of the facts surrounding his plea under penalty of perjury. Retained counsel represented Barnes at the hearing, but Barnes himself did not appear. The transcript of the plea-taking proceedings on its face supported the government\u2019s contention that a four-year term never was part of the plea bargain. Roy C. Etheridge, Barnes\u2019 former employer, testified, to the contrary, that, prior to Barnes\u2019 entering a plea, he overheard a conversation between Barnes and Bohannon in the hallway of the courthouse in which Bohannon told Barnes that he would get only a four-year sentence if he would plead guilty. Both Bohannon and Cobb testified for the government. According to Bohan-non, his conversation with Barnes about the guilty plea did not take place in the hallway as Etheridge testified, but rather in a vacant courtroom where no one was present except Barnes and himself. Both Cobb and Bohannon testified that they never had told Barnes that the prosecutor had agreed to a sentence limited to four years as part of the plea bargain. In his pleadings, Barnes stated that his wife and a friend of his had also overheard the hallway conversation. Barnes\u2019 retained counsel represented at trial that these witnesses could not be located.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Liberally construing Barnes\u2019 <em>pro se </em>briefs, we understand him to contend that the district court did not give him a hearing adequate to bring forth the facts that would show his entitlement to relief. First, Barnes challenges his hearing because he was not himself present. A defendant need not be present in the courtroom for a district court to hold a hearing and rule on a Section 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. Even when the district judge denies a petitioner\u2019s request to be present, we review his decision only to determine abuse of discretion. In the case at bar, however, the record does not show that the defendant ever asked to testify personally. The transcript of the hearing before the magistrate indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>cates that Barnes\u2019 retained counsel sought the government\u2019s agreement to stipulate that Barnes, if called, would testify to the facts set forth in his pleadings. In fact, it was the government\u2019s attorney, and not Barnes\u2019 retained counsel, who was initially unwilling to allow the hearing to proceed unless Barnes were present to submit to questioning. Under these circumstances, we find no error in Barnes\u2019 absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Second, Barnes challenges the adequacy of the hearing because his wife and a friend of his, both of whom Barnes contended had overheard his alleged hallway conversation with Bohannon, were not present as witnesses. At hearing, Barnes\u2019 retained counsel told the magistrate that these witnesses could not be located. Under Section 2255, Barnes had the burden of showing that he was entitled to relief. <em>Coon v. United States, </em>441 F.2d 279 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 860, 92 S.Ct. 160, 30 L.Ed.2d 103 (1971), and he cannot charge as error his own failure to produce the witnesses necessary to support his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Nothing on the face of the record of the plea-taking proceeding produced pursuant to Rule 11, Fed.R.Crim.P., suggests the existence of the separate bargain alleged by Barnes. Where, from the transcript, the plea-taking proceedings are clear and regular on their face, a petitioner asserting the existence of a bargain outside the record and contrary to his own statements under oath bears a heavy burden. <em>Bryan v. United States, </em>492 F.2d 775, 780 (5th Cir.) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1079, 95 S.Ct. 668, 42 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974); <em>cf. Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977). Petitioner has not met that burden in the case at bar. Accordingly the judgment of the district court denying Barnes\u2019 Section 2255 motion to vacate sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\">. At the plea-taking proceedings, both Barnes\u2019 attorney and the prosecutor referred to this latter indictment as a four count indictment. The indictment in the record bearing the same reference number contains only three counts. The colloquy between the attorneys indicates that they were referring to this indictment. Neither party discusses this discrepancy and we cannot see that it has any relevance to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
