This is so, at least in part, because a broadly-formulated legal principle is by its very nature applicable to a wide range of situations. In any particular ease, advocacy impels each party to claim the benefit of a potentially applicable doctrine, and in the absence of countervailing principles, consistency leads courts to decide in accordance with the suggested rule. But as a doctrine travels beyond the circumstances which generated it, the reasons which gave rise to that doctrine grow more attenuated, and the court is progressively more likely to encounter offsetting policies not present in the original application.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">The abstention doctrine of <em>Younger v. Harris </em>has undergone such an expansion in recent years, as its equitable barrier to federal intrusion upon pending state prosecutions has been broadened to encompass a variety of other proceedings. In the present case, where we are called upon to review the application of <em>Younger </em>to a civil proceeding in which the state is a defendant, we must determine whether, in this new setting the policies undergirding <em>Younger </em>are sufficiently applicable to warrant further extension of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-13\">A. THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b823-14\">On September 15, 1976, the New Jersey State Board of Education amended regulations governing the qualifications of teachers in bilingual/bicultural education programs so as to require that all teachers\u2014 whether or not they held tenure \u2014 attain fluency in English, even if their teaching is conducted in Spanish. A month later, a statutory appeal from those regulations was filed in the New Jersey Superior Court on behalf of a class consisting of all bilingual/bicultural education teachers in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">Upon being assured that no teacher would be terminated as a result of a denial of interlocutory relief, the Superior Court, without prejudice, denied a motion \u201cfor Emergency Ad Interim Stay of Enforcement\u201d. On November 17, 1976, the Superi- or Court again denied a motion for interim relief without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-16\">The class thereupon, on November 22, 1976, filed an action in the New Jersey District Court. The federal action challenged the regulations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on a number of constitutional grounds, and requested injunctive relief and declaratory judgment. After a hearing held on April 22, 1977, Judge George Barlow dismissed the complaint, on the ground that <em>Younger v. </em>Harris<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> interdicted injunc-tive relief, despite the teachers\u2019 offer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>dismiss their state court action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An appeal from that dismissal was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">In the interval between Judge Barlow\u2019s order and the oral argument before us, there were several relevant developments in the state courts. Thus, on April 25,1977, the New Jersey Superior Court granted a stay against the operation of the challenged regulation. However, on July 12, 1977, the Superior Court sustained the regulations in a three-page per curiam opinion. That opinion, in addition to rejecting a number of purely state law challenges, held that the regulations were not \u201carbitrary or unreasonable\u201d and went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-5\">To the extent appellants are concerned with that which they describe as an \u201cirrefutable presumption,\u201d disfavored in law we observe that the result in <em>Berger v. Board of Psychologist Examiners </em>[172 U.S.App.D.C. 396], 521 F.2d 1056 (D.C.Cir.1975) would unquestionably have been different had Berger there had the opportunity for individual review provided here. . . .We leave the application of the regulations to any individual to the particular record he established in such a case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">The teachers\u2019 request for certification was denied by the New Jersey Supreme Court, and no attempt was made to seek review in the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">New Jersey now contends that the appeal from the district court should be dismissed on the grounds of <em>res judicata </em>in light of the New Jersey court\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">Two issues are therefore presented in this proceeding: (1) the propriety of Judge Barlow\u2019s dismissal of the federal action on <em>Younger </em>grounds, and (2) the <em>res judicata </em>effect on the federal action of the subsequent state court determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">B. YOUNGER ABSTENTION</p>\n<p id=\"Apl7\">1. <em>The Realm of Younger</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-13\">Judge Barlow decided this case after the Supreme Court handed down <em>Juidice v. Vail.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Based on the holding in <em>Juidice that Younger </em>forbade an injunction against state contempt proceedings, even though such proceedings arose out of a dispute between private parties, Judge Barlow concluded that \u201cbecause the plaintiffs have at least some prospect of vindicating their constitutional rights in the state court, this Court will not intervene in the controversy.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-14\">Such a declaration would represent a significant extension of the <em>Younger </em>doctrine. The heart of <em>Younger </em>lay in the area of a pending criminal prosecution. The \u201ctraditional reluctance\u201d of courts of equity to enjoin on-going criminal proceedings<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was combined with the somewhat distinct interest of comity, that federal courts not interfere unnecessarily with a state\u2019s attempts to enforce its criminal law in its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>courts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The result was a bar to federal interference in on-going state prosecutions, absent extraordinary circumstances. In contrast, the requested relief in the present controversy would affect a wholly civil proceeding brought by a private litigant. This distinction in our view takes the case before us outside the ambit of <em>Younger.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\"><em>Juidice </em>is the only case in which the Supreme Court has accorded <em>Younger </em>deference to a private action in a state court. It is, moreover, one of only three cases in which <em>Younger </em>has been applied by the Supreme Court outside the domain of criminal proceedings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And the facts of <em>Juidice </em>may well make it <em>sui generis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Federal tribunals, the Court in <em>Juidice </em>decided, could not enjoin a state court\u2019s enforcement of a contempt citation. The contempt power used by the state courts to assure respect for their workings lies, as the Court in <em>Juidice </em>specifically noted, \u201cat the core of the administration of a State\u2019s judicial system.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Direct interference with a state contempt citation, even though civil in nature, is close to the type of intervention into state criminal processes condemned in <em>Younger; </em>it invades the right of the state to vindicate its authority in its own courts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To bar such an incursion carries few implications for the broad range of civil proceedings, a fact which the five-man majority in <em>Juidice </em>explicitly recognized.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">Similarly, in <em>Trainor v. </em>Hernandez,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which held <em>Younger </em>applicable to an action taken by a state \u201cin its sovereign capacity\u201d to recoup fraudulently obtained welfare benefits, Justice White, for a five-man majority, pretermitted the question whether \u201c <em>Younger </em>principles apply to all civil litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Justice Blackmun, the fifth subscriber to the majority\u2019s position in <em>Trainor, </em>wrote a separate concurrence. In it, he reaffirmed the language of Justice Black\u2019s original formulation in <em>Younger, </em>asserting that \u201cthe concept does not mean blind deference to states\u2019 rights\u201d but only the avoid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>anee of \u201cunduly interfere with the legitimate activities of the state.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Pursuing what he described as the \u201crequirement of balancing federal and state interests,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Justice Blackmun noted that except for <em>Huffman </em>and <em>Juidice, Younger </em>had previously been limited to criminal proceedings. The factual situations in <em>Huffman </em>and <em>Juidice, </em>he declared, were of special interest to the state.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Regarding the proceeding before him, Blackmun wrote:<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-5\">I, too, find significant the fact that the state was a party in its sovereign capacity to both the state suit and the federal suit. <em>Ante </em>at 444 [97 S.Ct. at 1918]. Here, I emphasize the importance of the fact that the state interest in the pending proceeding was substantial. In my view, the fact that the state had the option of proceeding either civilly or criminally to impose sanctions . . . demonstrates that the underlying state interest is of the same order of importance as the interest in <em>Younger </em>and <em>Huffman. </em>The propriety of abstention should not depend on the state\u2019s choice to vindicate its interest by a less drastic, or perhaps more lenient route.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Undertaking the type of balancing employed by Justice Blackmun, who cast the deciding vote for reversal in both <em>Juidice </em>and <em>Trainor, </em>it seems to us that the policies weighing in favor of <em>Younger </em>abstention have been significantly diluted in this case. Unlike <em>Trainor </em>and <em>Huffman, </em>the statute at issue here is unrelated to the enforcement of the state\u2019s criminal laws; indeed, citizens rather than the government initiated action in the New Jersey state court. Neither the traditional equitable aversion toward in-termeddling in criminal processes, nor the state\u2019s interest in enforcing its laws in its own forum is present.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-14\">In further contrast to <em>Juidice, </em>the adjudication of the constitutionality of administrative regulations is not a \u201ccore\u201d function of the state judiciary.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Federal equitable action addressed to administrative regulations would not ordinarily endanger the smooth functioning of the state judicial system. Moreover, the relief sought includes a declaration of rights and an injunction against state administrative agencies, rather than an injunction against state court action, a procedure which the plaintiff offered to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-15\">Thus, the result reached by Judge Barlow is not compelled by the holdings of the previous cases in the <em>Younger </em>line. And, as explicated below, other principles counsel against such an extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-16\">2. <em>Countervailing Considerations; The Values of Federal Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-17\">Judge Barlow\u2019s opinion suggests that <em>Younger </em>bars federal intervention whenever a remedy might be available in a state criminal or civil action. But such an exhaustion doctrine has been explicitly rejected by the Supreme Court in the context of \u00a7 1983 proceedings. In <em>Monroe v. Pape,</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-18\">It is no answer [to a suit under \u00a7 1983] that the state has a law which if enforced would give relief. The federal remedy is supplementary to the state remedy and the latter need not be first sought and refused before the federal one is invoked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>The rule of <em>Monroe, </em>we believe, has not been debilitated by the development of <em>Younger.</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">But even if Judge Barlow\u2019s interpretation of <em>Younger </em>were limited to erecting a rampart against federal adjudication whenever a state case is pending, it would be at odds with a basic premise of our federal judicial system. It is fundamental that where Congress has granted concurrent jurisdiction, a plaintiff is free to bring suit in both the state and federal forums for the same cause of action. As Justice Rehnquist noted this term:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-6\">The traditional notion is that <em>in personam </em>actions in federal and state court may proceed concurrently, without interference from either court . . . . We have never viewed parallel <em>in personam </em>actions as interfering with the jurisdiction of either court; as we stated in <em>Kline v. Burke Construction Co., </em>260 U.S. 226, [43 S.Ct. 79, 67 L.Ed. 226] (1922):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-12\">[A]n action brought to enforce [a personal liability] <em>does not tend to impair or defeat the jurisdiction </em>of the court in which a prior action for the same cause is pending. Each court is free to proceed in its own way and in its own time, without reference to the proceedings in the other court. Whenever a judgment is rendered in one of the courts and pleaded in the other, the effect of that judgment is to be determined by the application of the principles of <em>res adjudicata . . </em>. .\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>According to Justice Black\u2019s seminal opinion, the <em>Younger </em>doctrine finds its roots in the \u201cslogan, \u2018Our Federalism,\u2019 born in the early struggling days of our Union of States.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Since the traditional right of the plaintiff to proceed simultaneously in state and federal forums has an equally long lineage it would seem to follow that the plaintiffs\u2019 right is not alien to the counsels of <em>Younger, </em>and therefore that abstention was improper in this case.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Finally, we note that the more broadly the <em>Younger </em>doctrine is pressed, the more it encroaches upon explicit congressional grants of equitable jurisdiction. The extreme of the extension would be an assertion that <em>Younger </em>precludes federal injunctions whenever any state proceeding is pending. Such an approach would seem clearly inappropriate. Since 1793 Congress has specifically prohibited by statute \u2014 now codified as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283 \u2014 the issuance of federal injunctions to stay state court actions except in limited circumstances.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> If the principles of federalism and comity bar issuance of such injunctions in all civil cases, \u00a7 2283 would be superfluous. Moreover, such an expansion of <em>Younger </em>would be repugnant to those federal statutes which \u201cexpressly authorize\u201d injunctions to stay proceedings in a state court.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">A more moderate extension would still generate tension with Congressional policies. And while such discord may not alone preclude expansion of <em>Younger\u2019s </em>injunctive bar, frustration of Congressional policy weights heavily against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">Here, the appellants claimed a violation of their constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and invoked federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3). In <em>Mitchum </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number><em>v. Foster,</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>without dissent, the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 1983 is an expressly authorized exception to the general statutory bar to injunctions against state court proceedings. And in <em>Vendo Co. v. Lektro Vend,</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>all of the members of the Court accepted <em>Mitchum </em>as an authoritative exposition of the law regarding \u00a7 1983. The plurality, per Justice Rehnquist, restated the holding in <em>Mitchum:</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ayc-dedup-1\">We recounted in detail that statute\u2019s history which made it abundantly clear that by its enactment Congress [had] demonstrated its direct and explicit concern to make the federal courts available to protect civil rights against unconstitutional actions of state courts. We summarized our conclusion in these words:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-5\">This legislative history makes evident that Congress clearly conceived that it was altering the relationship between the States and the Nation with respect to the protection of federally created rights; it was concerned that state in-strumentalities could not protect those rights; it realized that state officers might, in fact, be antipathetic to the vindication of those rights; and it believed that these failings extended to the state courts. <em>Mitchum, </em>407 U.S. at 242, 92 S.Ct. 2151, at 2162.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">In light of the policy embodied in \u00a7 1983 and reiterated in <em>Vendo, </em>we are most reluctant to stretch the equitable doctrine of <em>Younger </em>beyond its prior boundaries to encompass a situation in which the only pending proceeding is a civil action filed by a federal plaintiff in a state court. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>England v. Board of Medical Examiners,</em><footnotemark><em>33</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cThere are fundamental objections to any conclusion that a litigant who has properly invoked the jurisdiction of a Federal District Court to consider federal constitutional claim can be compelled without his consent and through no fault of his own, to accept instead a state court\u2019s determination of those claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">3. <em>The Balance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\"><em>Younger </em>and its offspring \u201cexpress equitable principles of comity and federalism.\u201d <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The application of these principles, in turn, requires \u201csensitivity to the legitimate interests of both state and national governments\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> as well as consideration for the rights of litigants. In this case, we review a decision advancing the <em>Younger </em>doctrine well beyond the perimeter which it previously occupied. Such a salient, moreover, thrusts into an area in which both the traditions of our dual court system, and congressional efforts to protect constitutional rights favor the allowance of federal relief. Accordingly, we believe <em>Younger </em>is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">Our conclusion is strengthened by the sole Supreme Court case which we have found to be directly on point. In <em>Sweet Briar Institute v. Button,</em><footnotemark><em>36</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a college brought suit in federal court to enjoin state officials from enforcing a racially restrictive covenant contained in a bequest to the college. In view of the fact that the college\u2019s constitutional challenges had been rejected in a pending action in state court, the federal tribunal stated that policies of comity and <em>res judicata </em>precluded its entertaining the suit. Although the district court asserted that dismissal was warranted, it deferred such action to await the final resolution of the state proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed in a brief per curiam opinion,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> citing <em>England </em>and <em>Kline, </em>and remanded for consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>on the merits.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Though decided before <em>Younger, Sweet Briar </em>is a substantive adjudication and it is procedurally identical with the case before us. It is thus persuasive support for the conclusion that the dismissal by the district court here was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">C. THE IMPACT OF THE STATE COURT JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"AMvH\">The determination that <em>Younger </em>did not bar adjudication by the district court, however, carries us only part of the distance toward resolving the issues of this case. If Judge Barlow improperly dismissed on <em>Younger </em>grounds \u2014 -as we hold he did \u2014 -we must deal with the question of the proper effect to be given to the state court ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">1. <em>The Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\"><em>Younger, </em>itself, erects a barrier against federal action in the face of a pending state prosecution. But <em>Younger\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cpending\u201d prosecution has also manifested a proclivity to cast its shadow broadly. Language in <em>Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd.,</em><footnotemark><em>39</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where federal action was foreclosed by a state tribunal\u2019s ruling which the federal plaintiff declined to appeal, may be read to imply that the principles underlying <em>Younger </em>require a federal court to give broad preclusive effect to unappealed state court judgments. Such an intimation, however, is substantially weakened by later cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">In <em>Ellis v. Dyson,</em><footnotemark><em>40</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the plaintiff had been convicted in a municipal court proceeding of the crime of loitering. Rather than appeal his conviction and commence a trial <em>de novo, </em>the plaintiff brought a declaratory judgment action in federal court challenging the statute under which he had been prosecuted. On appeal the Supreme Court declined to dismiss on <em>Younger </em>grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">More recently, in <em>Wooley v. Maynard,</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a plaintiff challenged a New Hampshire ordinance forbidding the defacing of the motto \u201clive free or die\u201d on license plates. Although he had three times pleaded not guilty on the ground that displaying the motto violated his religious convictions, the plaintiff had thrice been found guilty of misdemeanors for covering the motto, and had declined to appeal his convictions. Rather, he brought an action for an injunction in federal court. The Supreme Court upheld the issuance of an injunction against further enforcement of the statute, commenting that the <em>Huffman </em>result arose out of the fact that the suit there attempted to enjoin the enforcement of a state court decree that ordered the plaintiff\u2019s theater closed as a public nuisance. Thus, not only was <em>Younger </em>held to be inapposite, but an unappealed judgment resulting from a previous suit raising identical issues was apparently not given binding effect.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">Although <em>Huffman </em>is not controlling, the question here should still be resolved on the basis of principles which take into account the nature of our federal court system and the constitutional imperatives which it protects. Rather than <em>Huffman, </em>the applicable precedent is <em>England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners.</em><footnotemark><em>43</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>England, </em>the plaintiffs had been remitted under <em>Pullman </em>abstention to a Louisiana state court. After the plaintiffs\u2019 return to federal court following state litigation, the United States Supreme Court refused to grant preclusive effect on a federal constitutional issue to the judgment of the Louisiana Supreme Court. The United States Supreme Court stressed the importance of the \u201cright to litigate his federal claims fully in the federal courts,\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and the potentially decisive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>importance of federal fact-finding, deprive a litigant of a federal forum against his will, the Court declared, would \u201cbe at war with the unqualified terms in which Congress, pursuant to constitutional authorization, has conferred specific categories of jurisdiction . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Instead, it held, \u201cthe litigant is in no event to be denied his right to return to the District Court unless it clearly appears that he voluntarily . . . [and] fully litigated his federal claims in state courts.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> To</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\"><em>England </em>implies that the state court determination in this case should not govern the issues here unless the plaintiffs could be said to have waived their rights to litigate in federal court by fully and unreservedly litigating their claims in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The preclusive effect of prior state court judgments on \u00a7 1983 suits has, however, evoked a spectrum of overlapping and inconsistent precedent and commentary.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> One relatively clear line of cases, looking to the principles of res <em>judicata </em>which govern the effect of prior judgments generally holds that where \u201ca federal constitutional claim is based on the same asserted wrong [which] was the subject of a [prior] state action, and where the parties are the same, <em>res judicata </em>will bar the federal constitutional claim, whether it was asserted in state court or not.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">Such an interpretation is not compelled by the terms of the <em>England </em>decision. Indeed, <em>England\u2019s </em>broad discussion of the right to a federal forum and the necessity of \u201cunreserved litigation\u201d to waive that right would seem to point to an equally broad right to reserve federal constitutional claims.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> And while a policy of discourag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>ing vexatious litigation and conserving judicial resources can apply to the interaction between state and federal decisions as well as to the binding effect of a judgment rendered by the same judicial system, a restrictive concept to the right to a federal forum has significant disadvantages. To hold that state court litigation bars a federal forum from deciding any claims which might have been raised before the state court would turn the state court into quicksand. It would not only serve as a trap for unwary plaintiffs who desire a federal tribunal, but encourage competently represented litigants to forego any venture into state jurisdiction to exhaust state administrative and judicial procedures on pain of losing their right to a federal hearing. Such results are hardly salutary.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">In our view, at least where a federal suit is commenced before a final decision by the state court, the proper rule is that enun-dated by the Second and Seventh Circuits: a state court judgment forecloses a \u00a7 1983 litigant from raising grievances in federal court only if such claims have been pressed before, and decided by, a state tribunal.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Such a rule avoids the tendency of the \u201ccould-have-litigated\u201d test to discourage the use of state forums to determine matters of state law, while at the same time giving due regard to matters actually decided by the state tribunals. Further, it responds to the particular concern for assuring the right to a federal forum in which to assert constitutional claims. And finally, it captures the substance of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-10\">If a party freely and without reservation submits his federal claims for decision by the state courts, litigates them there <em>and has them decided there </em>... he has elected to forego his right to return to the District Court.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>2. <em>The Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The question with regard to the New Jersey judgment thus is whether the plaintiffs in this case \u201cfreely and without reservation\u201d litigated their grievances in state court. We conclude that such litigation could be said to have occurred only with respect to a portion of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">As noted above, the filing of a federal declaratory and injunctive action here occurred before any determination by the state court other than denial of preliminary relief without prejudice. In addition, the plaintiffs offered to dismiss the state court action. But this offer was rejected, and the plaintiffs were remitted to their state court suit on twin <em>Younger/Pullman </em>grounds. The situation is therefore analogous to the <em>England </em>paradigm, in that the federal action, when filed, impinged upon no final state judgments. Accordingly, insofar as plaintiffs did not \u201cfully litigate\u201d the issues in state court, they should be permitted to return to the federal forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">There is no evidence that the contentions regarding <em>ex post facto </em>violations, unconstitutional impairment of the obligation of contracts and uncompensated taking of private property were pressed in the state proceedings. Indeed, this is admitted by the defendants in their brief in support of their motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> With respect to these claims, the rule we adopt mandates federal consideration on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 due process and equal protection challenges present a more difficult problem. In their brief before the New Jersey Superior Court, the plaintiffs pressed these contentions in terms quite similar to those asserted before us.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The New Jersey Court apparently resolved these issues against the plaintiffs on the merits.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">The conditions for an <em>England </em>waiver consequently may well be met on these points, and a federal court may be barred from allowing relitigation of the equal protection and due process challenges.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> However, <em>res judicata </em>is an affirmative defense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>dependent here on the factual issue of what submissions were actually made to the state court. Since we do not have before us a full record, it is appropriate to remand the case to the district court to allow such factual issue to be litigated there in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">D. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The district court erred in abstaining on <em>Younger </em>grounds. However, the explicit holdings of the New Jersey courts on plaintiffs\u2019 due process and equal protection challenges may be <em>res judicata, </em>and the dismissal of these claims will be reversed and remanded for the purpose of ascertaining whether such contentions were fully and freely litigated in the state courts. Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims will be remanded to the district court for proceedings on the merits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-11\">.

Judge Barlow also concluded that it was appropriate for him to abstain from deciding this case under the doctrine of <em>Railroad Commn. of Texas v.

Since questions were raised as to the proper effect to be given to the challenged regulation (e. <em>g. </em>availability of waivers) and the propriety of the regulation on state law grounds, it would seem that <em>Pullman </em>abstention was not inappropriate as a means of avoiding unnecessary decision of constitutional issues. However, <em>Pullman </em>does not authorize dismissal. <em>See American Trial Lawyers v.

Jones, </em>484 F.2d 96, 100-01 (1973), contains <em>dicta </em>to the contrary, it should be noted that such statements were issued in the context of an attempt to relitigate issues presented to a state court after the final judgment of the state supreme court. <em>Cf.

If federal forums refuse to hear claims not barred in state courts, the purpose of repose would not be served by the federal doctrine, since the litigants could return to the state court to pursue their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">The general rule in New Jersey is that subsequent suits on the same cause of action are barred by <em>res judicata, </em>and a new theory of the case does not remove such bar. However, from our research it is not at all clear that New Jersey courts would consider a \u00a7 1983 suit to constitute the \u201csame cause of action\u201d as a suit in Superior Court to review the administrative promulgation of a regulation. <em>See, e. g., Brick Twp. v. Vannell, </em>55 N.J.Super. 583, 151 A.2d 404 (1959) (suit for possession of land, involving same parties and same issues was not same cause of action as prior declaratory judgment action). There is thus considerable doubt in this case whether New Jersey courts would deem a prior judgment an adjudication of claims which <em>could </em>have been, but were not raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b833-14\">.

The Superior Court explicitly rejected the contention that the challenged action denied due process through the medium of an illegal \u201cirrebuttable presumption.\u201d It also held that the regulations were \u201creasonable\u201d rather than arbitrary and capricious, and \u201creasonably related to the felt public need.\u201d In light of the Superior Court\u2019s citation of <em>New Jersey Chapt. Am. Inst. of Planners v. New Jersey State Bd. of Prof. Planners, </em>48 N.J. 581, 227 A.2d 313 (1967), and equal protection case, this appears to be a rejection of the equal protection challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b833-17\">. That the plaintiffs offered to dismiss the state suit does not weaken such conclusion. This is so inasmuch as the offer fell short of the explicit or implicit reservation required by <em>England, </em>for after the offer was rejected, plaintiffs fully litigated the equal protection and due process questions without informing the state court of any hesitancy, equivocation or reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>We are not unsympathetic to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that their litigation in state court was ineffective to waive their right to a federal forum on the ground that it was undertaken in response to an improper ruling that the federal forum was unavailable. <em>Cf. England, supra, </em>375 U.S. at 422, 84 S.Ct. 461 (refusing to bind plaintiffs to a state court judgment where submission of claims to state court resulted from unclear federal precedent). Nonetheless, the plaintiffs had before them the fully articulated directions of <em>England. </em>Consequently, they could have explicitly reserved their federal claims before the state forum as they pursued their appeal in the federal courts. Instead, they chose to pursue the state court route in hopes of success on their constitutional claims before that tribunal. As a matter of litigation strategy this is understandable, for they did not know whether the present appeal would succeed. But it would seem unfair to the state, in the context here, to permit the plaintiffs now to retrace their steps.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
