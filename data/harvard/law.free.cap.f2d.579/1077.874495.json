Reiter, commenced this class action for treble damages on May 2,1975, against defendants-appellants, hearing aid manufacturers, under section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 (1976). In her complaint, she alleged that these manufacturers by combining and conspiring to violate the antitrust laws had controlled their dealers\u2019 sales practices, particularly the price at which hearing aids ultimately would be sold to consumers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reiter brought the action for relief under the antitrust laws on behalf of herself and \u201call persons in the United States or any sub part thereof who directly or indirectly purchased * * * hearing aids [at the allegedly unlawful prices].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-21\">The manufacturers moved for dismissal or, alternatively, for summary judgment arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that as noncommercial consumers Kathleen Reiter and the class she sought to represent had not been injured in their \u201cbusiness or property\u201d under section 4 of the Clayton Act. The district court, in a comprehensive memorandum opinion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> denied the manufacturers\u2019 motions but certified the issue of consumer standing as appropriate for interlocutory review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (1970); we authorized the interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-22\">In this appeal, we are presented the narrow question whether a consumer who purchases a hearing aid for personal use at a higher price because of a manufacturer\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive activity suffers injury to business or property under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>4 of the Clayton Act. Section 4 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-5\">Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States * * * and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 (1976).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">We hold that such consumers are not injured in their \u201cbusiness or property\u201d for purposes of section 4 and reverse the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1137-7\">I. <em>Legislative History.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1137-8\">Section 4 of the Clayton Act was first codified in section 2 of the Sherman Act. The Sherman Act, promulgated in 1890, was a congressional reaction to the concentrations of economic power that emerged from the industrialism of the mid-nineteenth century. See Note, <em>Standing to Sue for Treble Damages Under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, </em>64 Colum.L.Rev. 570, 570 (1964). Declaring monopolies and restraints of trade illegal, Congress sought \u201cto free competition in business and commercial transactions * * <em>Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, </em>310 U.S. 469, 493, 60 S.Ct. 982, 992, 84 L.Ed. 1311 (1939). The history of the Sherman Act, as evidenced in the legislative proceedings,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> emphatically supports the conclusion that the Act was designed to prevent restraints of trade significantly affecting business competition. <em>Id. </em>at 493 n. 15, 60 S.Ct. 982.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1137-17\">The legislative history underlying the provision permitting private damage actions, while voluminous and in parts illuminating, is less explicit. Courts and commentators have been unable to agree on the precise congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-18\">As originally introduced by Senator Sherman in the Senate Finance Committee, the bill in section 2 broadly authorized damage actions by \u201cany person or corporation injured or damnified by [an unlawful] arrangement, contract, agreement, trust, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>combination * * S.l, 51st Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7 2 (1889). This original language was, however, completely revised by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The amended language, which became section 7, limited treble damages to any person injured in his business or property by an antitrust violation. 21 Cong.Rec. 2901 (1890).</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">Congress failed to indicate explicitly the rationale for limiting the injuries for which treble damage actions could be maintained. Senator Morgan, however, recognized the need to limit the breadth and scope of private actions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-5\">This bill ought not to be a breeder of lawsuits. If there is any one duty we have got higher than another in respect of the general judiciary of the United States, it is to suppress litigation and have justice done without litigation as far as we can. [21 Cong.Rec. 3149 (1890) (remarks of Sen. Morgan).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">The Supreme Court has noted that the legislative history is not very instructive in explaining the purpose for limiting recovery to business or property injuries. <em>See Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., </em>405 U.S. 251, 261, 92 S.Ct. 885, 31 L.Ed.2d 184 (1972). <em>See also </em>Comment, <em>Mangano and Ultimate Consumer Standing: The Misuse of the Hanover Doctrine, </em>72 Colum.L.Rev. 394, 396 n. 15 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-7\">Despite its somewhat inconclusive explanation, however, we cannot ignore Congress\u2019 explicit rejection of the original Sherman bill\u2019s broad language in favor of the statute as enacted. While ordinary consumers arguably would have been included in if not encouraged by the bill as originally introduced, we think the statute as enacted was intended to limit the class of persons able to bring a private damage action. <em>See </em>21 Cong.Rec. 3149 (1890) (remarks of Sen. Morgan).</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-8\">Some members of Congress argued that the enacted provision containing the limiting language would be of little use to the average consumer. In fact, Senator George, recognizing that consumers would be virtually remediless with the statute as written, urged without success more effective remedies for consumers.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-11\">[T]he poor man, the consumer, the laborer, the farmer, the mechanic, the country merchant, all that large class of American citizens who constitute 90 per cent of our population and who are the real sufferers will have no opportunity of redress, and the bill, so far as they are concerned, will be a snare and a mere delusion. [21 Cong.Rec. 3150 (1890) (remarks of Sen. George).]<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxaT\"><em>See id. </em>at 3147-18, 1767-68; <em>id. </em>at 2571 (remarks of Rep. Hiscock); <em>id. </em>at 2564 (remarks of Sen. Reagan). We note this congressional concern with the statute\u2019s inability to aid the consumer. We cannot, however, amend the Act to include that which Congress neglected or intentionally excluded. <em>Cf. Pfizer, Inc. v. Government of India, </em>434 U.S. 308, 98 S.Ct. 584, 587, 54 L.Ed.2d 563 (1978) (resolution of section 4\u2019s meaning \u201cturns on the interpretation of the statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-12\">In 1914, Congress enacted the Clayton Act. Section 7 of the Sherman Act became section 4 of the new statute and retained the \u201cbusiness or property\u201d limitation. The Senate Report accompanying the Clayton Act indicates that Congress, by its enactment, did not intend to amend the Sherman Act. The report comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-13\">This section, which gives any person injured by a violation of the antitrust acts the right to sue in the Federal courts for threefold the damages by him sustained * * * is not proposed to be amended in any particular. [S.Rep.No. 698, 63rd Cong., 2d Sess. 45 (1914).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1138-15\">Congress\u2019 principal concern in enacting the Clayton Act, as articulated in its comments accompanying the statute, was to provide a remedy to persons suffering a business injury as a result of combinations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>operating in restraint of trade. <em>See </em>51 Cong.Rec. 9270 (1914) (remarks of Rep. Carlin). During the House debates, Representative Webb, a member of the Judiciary Committee, who explained the various statutory provisions, described section 4 (then section 5) as providing a treble damage cause of action to \u201cany person * * * injured in his <em>business, </em>by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws * 51 Cong.Rec. 9073 (1914) (remarks of Rep. Webb) (emphasis supplied). <em>See also </em>51 Cong.Rec. 16,274 (1914) (remarks by Rep. Webb) (section 4 authorizes suits by a <em>business </em>man).</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">Representative Taggart, a member of the House Finance Committee, emphasized the commercial nature of the injury for which Congress intended to provide relief.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-8\">A great many suits have been brought against trusts [that] have been dissolved. Some few have been punished, but the people whose business they destroyed have been practically without a remedy. When this bill becomes a law, the person who willfully destroys another person\u2019s business will do so at his peril.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-9\">The bill is framed for the purpose of liberating <em>business </em>and not for the purpose of injuring or destroying any <em>business. Its great purpose is to protect small business from big business, </em>and to compel all business to be conducted honestly. [51 Cong.Rec. 9198 (1914) (remarks of Rep. Taggart) (emphasis supplied).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1139-13\">Senator Reed similarly identified business as the primary interest protected by the statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-14\">It follows that the Argus eyes of thousands of business men now being injured will be upon the powerful concerns, and the thousand arms of the courts will be employed to prevent their evil practices. [51 Cong.Rec. 12,939 (1914) (remarks of Sen. Reed).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1139-15\">Moreover, in section 16 the Clayton Act permits injunctive relief to \u201c[a]ny person * * * threatened [with] loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws * *.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 26 (1976). This rather broad provision does not contain section 4\u2019s business or property limitation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We think Congress, in considering this carefully drafted statute, contemplated the modes of relief that, consistent with the Act\u2019s purposes, would most effectively protect the various interests in the economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-18\">In sum, the legislative history indicates a congressional awareness that the antitrust laws would benefit the small business owner but would be of little value to the ordinary consumer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-19\">II. <em>Judicial Decisions </em>\u2014 \u201cBusiness <em>or Property</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-20\">The meaning and scope of \u201cbusiness or property\u201d in section 4 have generally been discussed by the courts in contexts other than consumer standing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>some recognition that an injury to property is different and, perhaps, broader than a business injury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See generally </em>Note, <em>Standing to Sue for Treble Damages Under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, </em>64 Colum.L. Rev. 570, 577-78 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">In <em>Chattanooga Foundry and Pipe Works </em>v. <em>City of Atlanta, </em>203 U.S. 390, 396, 399, 27 S.Ct. 65, 66, 67, 51 L.Ed. 241 (1906), the Court, through Mr. Justice Holmes, discussed \u201cbusiness or property.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1140-5\">The facts gave rise to a cause of action under the Act of Congress. * * * [The City] was injured in its property, at least, if not in its business of furnishing water, by being led to pay more than the worth of the pipe. A person whose property is diminished by a payment of money wrongfully induced is injured in his property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1140-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1140-10\">A man is injured in his property when his property is diminished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1140-11\">On its face, the Court\u2019s language suggests that consumers forced to pay more for a product by virtue of anticompetitive activity suffer injury to their property. The City of Atlanta, however, had commenced the action against two companies that allegedly had combined to keep the price of iron water pipe artificially high. As a result, the cost to the city of supplying water to its residents was increased. Thus, the city\u2019s claim arguably sought recovery for a business injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-12\">Neither the Supreme Court nor a federal appellate court has specifically addressed whether ordinary consumers who purchase a product for personal use at a higher price because of anticompetitive activity suffer an injury to property under section 4 of the Clayton Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has intimated that such injury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>in order to be legally cognizable, must be of a commercial nature.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-5\">Like the lower courts that have considered the meaning of the words \u201cbusiness or property,\u201d we conclude that they refer to commercial interests or enterprises. <em>[Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., supra, </em>405 U.S. at 264, 92 S.Ct. at 892 (1972).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">In <em>Hawaii, </em>the state had brought a <em>parens patriae </em>action on behalf of its citizens as the representative of a class of all purchasers in the state. The Court denied standing to the state to sue for injuries to the general economy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-9\">When the State seeks damages for injuries to its <em>commercial interests, </em>it may sue under \u00a7 4. But where, as here, the State seeks damages for other injuries, it is not properly within the Clayton Act. <em>[Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).]<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1141-10\">This circuit has approved language suggesting that, in order to be recoverable, the injury to \u201cbusiness or property\u201d must be a competitive one. <em>See Ragar v. T. J. Raney &amp; Sons, </em>388 F.Supp. 1184, 1187 (E.D.Ark.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>521 F.2d 795 (8th Cir. 1975) <em>(per cu-riam ). Ragar </em>involved an antitrust action by property owners against investment banking firms who had conspired to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>interest rates on municipal bonds higher than they otherwise would have been. The district court, finding that plaintiff\u2019s injury was remotely related to the alleged violation, held that plaintiffs lacked standing to sue. Alternatively, the court said the plaintiffs had not been injured in their \u201cbusiness or property\u201d because that phrase requires a competitive injury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-4\">Since the purpose of the antitrust laws is the \u201cprevention of restraints to free competition in business and commercial transactions,\u201d * * * it follows that only those persons injured in their competitive positions in a business in which they are engaged should be permitted standing to sue under the Clayton Act. [388 F.Supp. at 1187.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">Other circuits have similarly suggested that section 4 requires a competitive or commercial injury. In <em>GAF Corp. </em>v. <em>Circle Floor Co., </em>463 F.2d 752 (2d Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>413 U.S. 901, 93 S.Ct 3058, 37 L.Ed.2d 1045 (1973), one company alleged that another company was attempting a takeover in order to monopolize the industry. The court, concluding that the policy favored by the Act is competition, sustained the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-6\">The Supreme Court has consistently reiterated that \u201c[t]he Sherman Act was * * * aimed at preserving free and unfettered <em>competition </em>as the rule of trade,\u201d and that \u201cthe policy unequivocally laid down by the Act is competition.\u201d * * * The courts, in interpreting \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act and its predecessor, have endeavored, although with some inconsistency and conflict, to promote the policy of competition established by the Sherman and Clayton Acts by interpreting \u00a7 4 as allowing treble damages only to those who have suffered some diminution of their ability to compete. Whether viewed in terms of \u201clack of standing\u201d or the absence of <em>antitrust </em>damages, the courts, in denying recovery to various kinds of plaintiffs, have sought to confine recovery to those who have been injured by restraints on competitive forces in the economy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-13\">Not all persons who may be able to trace an economic loss to a violation of the antitrust laws can recover under those laws. The Supreme Court has stated that, in determining who may sue under \u00a7 4, the central question is one of <em>competitive </em>injury. <em>[Id. </em>at 757-58 (emphasis in original).]<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-14\">In <em>In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution M. D. L. No. 31, </em>481 F.2d 122 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1045, 94 S.Ct. 551, 38 L.Ed.2d 336 (1973), the Ninth Circuit, citing <em>Hawaii </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Go., supra, </em>also expressed the view that the phrase \u201cbusiness or property\u201d limits standing to those engaged in commercial ventures and enterprises. 481 F.2d at 131. <em>See also Tugboat, Inc. v. Mobile Towing Co., </em>534 F.2d 1172, 1175 (5th Cir. 1976) (in order to be cognizable under section 4, the injury must be to commercial interests or enterprises); <em>cf. Reibert v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>471 F.2d 727, 730 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 938, 93 S.Ct. 1900, 36 L.Ed.2d 399 (1973) (in order to satisfy section 4\u2019s business or property prerequisite, fired worker must demonstrate that \u201chis job [was] a commercial venture or enterprise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-15\">Our review of the cases convinces us that the few courts specifically addressing the question have recognized that section 4 requires a commercial or competitive injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>III. <em>Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">In 1976, Congress enacted the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The new statute permits \u201cState attorneys general to recovery monetary damages on behalf of State residents injured by violations of the antitrust laws.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.94-499, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 3, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News p. 2572.

Congress did comment on the inappropriateness of the class action as a means of redressing consumers who pay higher prices because of anticompetitive activity. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep.No.94-499, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 7, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 2572, 2576-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>The goals and purposes of the antitrust laws may not be enhanced by permitting gigantic consumer class actions, many of which are never tried. In Handler &amp; Blech-man, <em>Antitrust and the Consumer Interest: The Fallacy of Parens Patriae and A Suggested New Approach, </em>85 Yale L.J. 626, 627-30 (1976), the authors point out the failure, to date, of the class action vehicle to compensate aggrieved consumers. Judge Medina, of the Second Circuit, has noted: \u201cnot a single one of these class actions including millions of indiscriminate and unidentifiable members has ever been brought to trial and decided on the merits.\u201d <em>Eisen v.

The result of such settlements will inevitably be counterproductive when the costs to the defendant of defense and settlement are passed on to present and future consumers. Moreover, big firms are better able than small or medium-sized businesses to defend or settle such claims under similar circumstances. The ultimate result might be to preserve an oligopolistic economic climate. The deterrent impact of such suits, in our view, does not outweigh their potentially ruinous effect on American business. Deterrence exists in other antitrust remedies<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> as well as in the 1976 Act, which places responsibility for consumer actions upon state attorneys general. We agree with Congress that the new statute will effectively protect the interests of consumers without imposing upon the courts and the economy the risk and burden of nonmeritorious class actions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">IV. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">In sum, the broad purposes of the Sherman and Clayton Acts were to provide an appropriate and <em>effective </em>remedy and to assure and protect competitive enterprise. The statutes primarily emphasized enforcement by businesses, particularly small businesses, against predators. We cannot ignore Congress\u2019 rejection of the broad language in the original Sherman Act in favor of the \u201cbusiness or property\u201d limitation of the statute as enacted. We are also mindful of the congressional concern that consumers would be virtually without a remedy. We believe, in light of the statutory history, that Congress did not legislate in a vacuum. While the Act neither defines nor explains business or property, we think the overall purpose of the antitrust laws, to enhance competition, <em>see Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., supra, </em>405 U.S. at 262, 92 S.Ct. 885; <em>Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, </em>370 U.S. 294, 344, 82 S.Ct. 1502, 8 L.Ed.2d 510 (1962); <em>Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, supra, </em>310 U.S. at 493, 60 S.Ct. 982, will best be served by requiring a commercial injury before a person may invoke the treble damage provisions of section 4.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>For the foregoing reasons we think it sensible as a matter of policy and compelled as a matter of law that consumers alleging no injury of a commercial or competitive nature are not injured in their property under section 4 of the Clayton Act.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1136-25\">.

Appellees did not purchase their hearing aids directly from the manufacturers. In <em>Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 720, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977), the Supreme Court held that only direct purchasers may sue for treble damages under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act. The Court recognized, however, that indirect purchasers may maintain actions involving cost-plus contracts as well as those \u201cin which market forces have been superseded [as when] the direct purchaser is owned or controlled by its customer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736 &amp; n. 16, 97 S.Ct. at 2070.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-10\">Appellees contend that the manufacturers in this case engaged in various prohibited vertical restraints including resale price maintenance. In view of our holding that ordinary consumers may not maintain treble damage actions, we need not decide whether appellants\u2019 alleged violations constitute an exception to <em>Illinois Brick.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1137-11\"><em>. </em>For an exhaustive analysis of the Sherman Act\u2019s legislative history, see M.

An early resolution introduced on July 10, 1888, by Senator Sherman and passed without discussion directed the Senate Finance Committee to study the efficacy of curtailing \u201ctrusts or combinations * * * made with a view * * * to prevent <em>free and full competition </em>* * * with such penalties and provisions * * * as will tend to preserve freedom of trade and production [and] the natural competition of increasing production * * 19 Cong.Rec. 6041 (1888) (remarks of Sen. Sherman) (emphasis supplied). This resolution, which gave rise to the congressional debates and ultimately the Sherman Act, explicitly articulated the economic philosophy of the bill\u2019s proponents. The bills introduced between 1888 and 1890 are consistent with this approach. <em>See, e. g., </em>S.3445, S.3510, and H.R.Rep.11339, 50th Cong., 1st Sess. (1888) (arrangements that tend to prevent full and free competition in the production, manufacture, or sale of articles are void), <em>cited in Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, </em>310 U.S. 469, 493-94 n. 15, 60 S.Ct. 982, 84 L.Ed. 1311 (1939). The debates accompanying the final bill also stressed the importance of preserving competition and the need to proscribe those agreements, combinations, and trusts whose purpose was to destroy competition. <em>See generally </em>21 Cong.Rec. 2457-2461 (1890) (remarks of Sen. Sherman); <em>id. </em>at 2558 (remarks of Sen. Pugh); <em>id. </em>at 2729 (remarks of Sen. Platt); <em>id, </em>at 3147 (remarks of Sen. George); <em>id. </em>at 4089 (remarks of Rep. Culber-son).</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-21\">The Supreme Court has noted this virtual unanimity of Congress in seeking to protect and preserve a free competitive environment. <em>See Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, supra, </em>310 U.S. at 493-95 n. 15, 60 S.Ct. 982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1138-9\">.

Independent of the consumer standing issue, the United States appellate courts have narrowed the class of persons able to seek treble damages for antitrust violations by employing a causation analysis similar to the proximate cause limitation contained in tort law.

The right to recover in the Ninth, Fifth, Fourth, and Second Circuits is limited to those in the \u201ctarget area\u201d of the alleged violative activity. <em>See, e. g., Commerce Tankers Corp. v.

British Petroleum Co., </em>231 F.Supp. 72 (S.D.N.Y.1964), the court noted the distinction between business and property. The plaintiff in that case had entered into a contract that would have given him oil importation rights. He was alleging that an illegal conspiracy prevented his importation of the oil. Because his enterprise was only potential, the court found that no \u201cbusiness\u201d within the meaning of the Act existed. The court went on to decide, however, that the statute uses the two terms in the disjunctive; \u00a7 4 as it is written is broader than just business, \u201cThe word 'property' has wider scope and is more extensive than the word \u2018business.\u2019 Less is required to prove \u2018property\u2019 than to prove \u2018business.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86. Under this conception, property is any legally protected interest. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-14\">This distinction was also noted in <em>Hamman v. United States, </em>267 F.Supp. 420 (D.Mont.1967), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>399 F.2d 673 (9th Cir. 1968), cited with approval in <em>Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., supra, </em>405 U.S. at 264, 92 S.Ct. 885. There, damages were sought for the death of a workman who had been killed during the construction of a dam. In one count, plaintiff alleged that: (1) an illegal conspiracy in restraint of trade had prevented other, more careful construction companies from bidding on the job; (2) defendant\u2019s failure to exercise reasonable care had caused decedent\u2019s death; thus, (3) plaintiff who had suffered loss of consortium, a recognized property interest under state law, had been injured in her property under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act. The court, citing <em>Waldron, supra, </em>stated that \u201cproperty\u201d in \u00a7 4, is broader than business, but that an injury to business or property requires \u201ca commercial venture or enterprise.\u201d 267 F.Supp. at 432. The court dismissed the count on the ground that, while plaintiff had suffered an injury to property under state law, she had not suffered an injury to the types of property \u201cprotected * * * by the antitrust laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court also stressed the absence of proximate cause between the injury and the alleged wrongful conduct. <em>See </em>n. 9 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1140-15\">. A trilogy of cases recently decided by Judge Williams in the Northern District of California has been consolidated and is currently before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>the Ninth Circuit. In all three cases, Judge Williams held that consumers purchasing products for personal use suffer no injury to business or property under \u00a7 4 and may not bring treble damage actions for relief. See <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>Federated Department Stores, </em>426 F.Supp. 880 (N.D.Cal.1977); <em>Gutierrez v. E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery Co., </em>425 F.Supp. 1221 (N.D.Cal.1977); <em>Smith v. Toyota Motor Sales U. S. A., Inc., </em>No. 75-0727 (N.D.Cal. Jan. 11, 1977), <em>appeals docketed, </em>Nos. 77-1845, 77-1724, 77-1725, 77-1850, 77-1851, 77-1852 (9th Cir. 1977). Judge Williams analyzed the legislative history of the statute, relying upon the change in the section\u2019s language, the fear of a proliferation of lawsuits, and statements in the congressional debates extolling the benefits of the Act to businessmen. He also examined language in several court decisions, including <em>Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., supra, </em>and <em>Ragar v. T. J. Raney &amp; Sons, </em>388 F.Supp. 1184 (E.D.Ark.), <em>aff'd, </em>521 F.2d 795 (8th Cir. 1975) (per <em>curiam </em>), <em>see infra, </em>and concluded that the phrase \u201cbusiness or property\u201d cannot be read in the disjunctive but \u201cis a conjunctive reference to interests of a business nature.\u201d <em>Gutierrez v. E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery Co., supra, </em>425 F.Supp. at 1225. Therefore, consumers who alleged no injury to a business enterprise were held to be without standing to sue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1141-8\">. The Court did not, however, define commercial interest and, in a footnote, distinguished an injury suffered by the state in its capacity as a \u201cconsumer in the marketplace,\u201d which is within the scope of \u00a7 4\u2019s protection, from that occurring merely to the state\u2019s general economy, which is not. <em>Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., supra, </em>405 U.S. at 262-63 n. 14, 92 S.Ct. 885. Similarly, in explaining a provision enabling the United States to sue for antitrust violations that is also limited to injuries to business or property, the Court stated the provision was not intended to cover general injuries to the national economy, \u201cbut only * * * those * * * suffered * * * as a consumer of goods and services.\u201d <em>Id. at 265, 92 </em>S.Ct. at 892. The Court also noted that a large part of any injury to the state\u2019s general economy \u201cis no more than a reflection of injuries to the \u2018business or property\u2019 of consumers, for which they may recover themselves under \u00a7 4.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264, 92 S.Ct. at 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-12\">In addition to this language by the Court in <em>Hawaii, </em>appellee cites, and we note, several judicial references, some by the Supreme Court, suggesting that \u201cconsumers in the marketplace\u201d should be permitted redress for injuries suffered through anticompetitive activity. <em>See, e. g., Pfizer, Inc. v. Government of India, </em>434 U.S. 308, 98 S.Ct. 584, 592, 594, 54 L.Ed.2d 563 (Burger, C. J., dissenting) (1978); <em>Brunswick v.

Chalk, </em>159 U.S.App.D.C. 415, 419, 488 F.2d 1315, 1319 n. 17 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 938, 94 S.Ct. 1940, 40 L.Ed.2d 289 (1974), the court, acknowledging that the phrase \u201cbusiness or property\u201d refers to commercial interests or enterprises, stated: \u201cWe have no doubt that a consumer of service who is illegally overcharged sustains a property injury no less than a consumer of goods.\u201d Relying upon <em>Chattanooga Foundry &amp; Pipe Works v. City of Atlanta, </em>203 U.S. 390, 396, 27 S.Ct. 65, 51 L.Ed. 241 (1906), the court indicated that a consumer of goods is injured in his property by violations of the antitrust laws that raise the price of goods. In <em>Bravman v. Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc., supra, </em>a suit by a sales representative of a furniture manufacturer, the court stated: \u201cThe right of consumers to challenge price fixing conspiracies is well established.\u201d 552 F.2d at 99 n. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-13\">These references, however, are not inconsistent with our construction of \u00a7 4. Consumers who suffer commercial injury to business or property may sue for treble damages. Moreover, the consumer standing question presented in this appeal was not addressed by these courts. <em>See </em>n. 18 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1142-10\">. <em>But see Pfizer, Inc. </em>v. Government of <em>India, supra, </em>98 S.Ct. at 588, <em>citing Illinois Brick Co. v.

It asserts that such suits are merit-less, yet exact unfair settlements from defendants, especially small businesses, that are unable to bear the costs of a defense. It thus concludes that any pro-competitive impact of these treble damage suits are outweighed by their entrenchment of large enterprises and their potentially ruinous effect on American small business. The panel\u2019s decision, however, reaches beyond its proffered concerns. It excludes all consumer treble damage actions brought under Section 4, not just class action suits. More importantly, it represents a policy judgment beyond the province of the judiciary. The courts are not free to interpret statutory language to support their views of wise economic policy. It is Congress\u2019 pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>icy choice which must be implemented and the panel decision frustrates rather than effectuates the Congressional will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqytj\">Brief for Government at 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">For the foregoing reasons and those succinctly stated by Judge Larson in his memorandum opinion below, we would grant the petition for rehearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1145-14\">.
