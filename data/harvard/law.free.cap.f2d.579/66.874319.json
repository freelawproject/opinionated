This proceeding is part of an ongoing investigation of appellant\u2019s books and records to determine whether there has been any violation of Title VII, Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq. (1970 and Supp. V, 1975). It is the third attempt to reach this court on appeal and a review of prior proceedings is wholly unnecessary:</p>\n<p id=\"b124-25\">The appellants request a three-judge court to declare certain provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e unconstitutional. They also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>contend that the award of attorney\u2019s fees was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In our opinion of September 5, 1975, we said: \u201c. . . the complaint at this stage must be viewed as an attempt to divert, forestall, or anticipate administrative proceedings.\u201d See also our opinion in No. 76-1625 of January 13, 1978. The subpoena duces tecum was a part of the administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s motion to alter or amend judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">In its oral opinion, the trial court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM_\">. . I am convinced that this is nothing short of harassment. You have made up your mind that you are not going to follow the law, . . . and you are going to seek every remedy everywhere you can to see that you don\u2019t expose your books . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">The enforcement of the subpoena does not constitute an unreasonable search and seizure. We have made it unmistakably clear that the administrative action must be allowed to run its course before a broad-scale constitutional attack may be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
