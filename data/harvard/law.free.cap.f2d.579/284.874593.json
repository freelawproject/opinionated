Boyer is now represented by different counsel. The district court declined to accept a United States Magistrate\u2019s recommendation that Boyer be granted the writ, finding instead that even if Boyer did not waive his rights by failing to appeal and even assuming his counsel\u2019s representation fell below the prevailing standard of adequacy, no harm resulted and Boyer was not entitled to habeas corpus relief. 436 F.Supp. 881 (E.D.Pa. 1977). Although we find merit in the district court\u2019s thoughtful analysis of these legal issues, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-23\">Appellant Boyer was tried and convicted in the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>County, Pennsylvania, in 1973. <em>Commonwealth v. Boyer, </em>No. 723, 1972 Term (C.P. Lancaster, Crim. Div.). At trial, during which Boyer pleaded a defense of insanity, the prosecution elicited the following testimony from prison guard Robert Steffy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHf\">Q. When you claimed [Boyer] at the front door did he make any statements to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">A. Not more than I asked him how he got outside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">Q. Did he make a reply to that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">A. No, he would not make a reply to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-8\"><em>Id., </em>Trial Transcript at &amp;-7. Boyer\u2019s trial counsel did not object to admission of this testimony. In his charge to the jury, the trial judge summarized the guard\u2019s testimony as follows: \u201cAs the prisoner [Boyer] was being brought in, this witness said he asked him how he got outside and he said the prisoner did not reply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32. Again, counsel did not take exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">No direct appeal was taken from the judgment of sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Boyer\u2019s subsequent petition under the Pennsylvania Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 19 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1180-1 <em>et seq., </em>was denied. During the hearing on this petition, Boyer\u2019s trial counsel agreed that the reference to Boyer\u2019s silence \u201cmight well be objectionable\u201d, and testified that he could not recall any specific reason for his failure to challenge its admission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">Q. This kind of testimony might well be objectionable, might it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">Q. Is there any reason why you did not object to that testimony at trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-18\">A. No. I guess the reasonable \u2014 the primary reason at that time at the trial, it didn\u2019t seem important enough. Hindsight is better than foresight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-19\">Q. I understand that. I was wanting to know if there was any reason you might have had to do with trial strategy which caused you not to object at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-20\">A. I don\u2019t recall any, right now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aaj-dedup-0\"><em>Commonwealth v. Boyer, supra, </em>PCHA Hearing Transcript at 23-24. The Superior Court affirmed the denial of Boyer\u2019s post-conviction petition, with a strong dissenting opinion by two judges. 237 Pa.Super. 341, 352 A.2d 431 (1975).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania denied allocatur, the petition for federal habeas corpus relief ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-21\">Three discrete issues command our attention. Did Boyer knowingly and intelligently waive his right to assert ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to take a direct appeal from his state conviction, and, if not, did the conduct of Boyer\u2019s trial counsel, in failing to object to the reference to Boyer\u2019s silence at time of arrest, deprive Boyer of the reasonably competent assistance of counsel? Finally, did the district court err in finding that no harm resulted even assuming that Boyer was deprived of the assistance of reasonably competent counsel?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-22\">\n<em>A.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b343-23\">At his hearing before the United States Magistrate in April 1977, appellant explained that he had not appealed his state conviction directly for the following reasons: his trial attorney had refused to rep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>resent him unless he paid more money; he was in an unstable mental condition when the trial judge explained the right to appeal; and he had inferred, from a previous unsuccessful attempt to obtain appellate counsel that he would be unable to secure counsel for a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><em>Fay v. Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963), established the \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d standard for state prisoners\u2019 federal habeas claims. Drawing from the seminal decision on voluntary waiver in <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938), the <em>Fay </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">If a habeas applicant, after consultation with competent counsel or otherwise, understandingly and knowingly forewent the privilege of seeking to vindicate his federal claims in the state courts, whether for strategic, tactical or any other reasons that can fairly be described as the deliberate by-passing of state procedures, then it is open to the federal court on habeas to deny him all relief if the state courts refused to entertain his federal claims on the merits \u2014 though of course only after the federal court has satisfied itself, by holding a hearing or by some other means, of the facts bearing upon the applicant\u2019s default.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">372 U.S. at 439, 83 S.Ct. at 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Utilizing these standards, the Magistrate in the present case determined that \u201cdue to [Boyer\u2019s] inexperience and confusion as to his right to appointed counsel even after conviction and sentencing, he refrained from requesting appointed counsel, and was left with no legal advisor whatsoever; and thus, it cannot be unequivocally stated that he deliberately failed to file an appeal to advance his case in another direction.\u201d Magistrate\u2019s Report, 436 F.Supp. at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Subsequent to the Magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, the Supreme Court decided <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977), in which it held that a state prisoner\u2019s failure to comply with a state rule requiring a contemporaneous objection to the introduction of an inculpatory statement precluded habeas corpus relief on a claim that the confession was involuntary, absent a showing of actual prejudice and cause for his failure to make a timely objection. No issue of ineffectiveness of counsel was raised in <em>Wainwright; </em>nor did the Court discuss whether the waiver standard under consideration was applicable to a failure to take a direct appeal. Indeed, in a concurring opinion, the Chief Justice suggested that <em>Fay\u2019s </em>deliberate bypass standard would continue to apply to failures to appeal, which involve \u201cthe exercise of volition by the defendant himself with respect to his own federal constitutional rights.\u201d 433 U.S. at 92, 97 S.Ct. at 2509.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">Recognizing that <em>Wainwright </em>did not offer direct guidance for the present situation, the district court accepted the Magistrate\u2019s conclusions regarding Boyer\u2019s failure to appeal, and held that Boyer was not precluded from seeking federal habeas relief. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">In considering the merits of Boyer\u2019s contention that he had ineffective counsel in his state trial proceedings, the district court properly drew upon our opinion in <em>Moore v. United States, </em>432 F.2d 730, 736 (3d Cir. 1970), in which we stated that \u201cthe standard of adequacy of legal services as in other professions is the exercise of the customary skill and knowledge which normally prevails at the time and place.\u201d See <em>also United States ex rel. Green v. Rundle, </em>434 F.2d 1112 (3d Cir. 1970). Whatever be the rule in other circuits, the standard of professional competence in this circuit has been settled for eight years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Whether an accused\u2019s silence at the time of arrest may be used against him at trial has been an issue generating much discussion and adjudication. It has long been recognized in the law of evidence that a <em>\u201cfailure to assert </em>a fact, when it would have been natural to assert it, amounts in effect to an assertion of the non-existence of the fact.\u201d Ill A Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1042 (Chadbourn rev. 1970). It could be contended in the present case that Boyer\u2019s silence amounted to an affirmative admission that he escaped, or that it cast doubt on his testimony that he did not intend to escape. Where silence is equivalent to an assertion, that silence becomes relevant to a witness\u2019 testimony as a prior inconsistent statement if the assumed affirmation is inconsistent with the witness\u2019 present testimony. If offered against a party to the action, that silence is relevant as an admission, regardless of that party\u2019s testimony. In a criminal prosecution, however, there is obvious tension between the logical relevance of silence as affirmation and the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971), the Supreme Court held that although an actual statement obtained in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), could not be used as substantive evidence against the defendant, it could be used for impeachment purposes as a prior inconsistent statement if the defendant testified in a manner inconsistent with that prior statement. After the decision in <em>Harris, </em>the courts of appeals divided on the question whether an affirmation by silence could be used for impeachment purposes when the defendant took the stand at his trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Supreme Court resolved this conflict in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>422 U.S. 171, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 45 L.Ed.2d 99 (1975), and <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). In <em>Hale </em>the Court held that the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence could not be used even for impeachment purposes. The Court reasoned, first, that the defendant\u2019s silence was not sufficiently probative of an inconsistency with his in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>court testimony to warrant admission of the silence as impeachment evidence. 422 U.S. at 177, 95 S.Ct. 2133. In addition, the Court believed that admitting into evidence the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence would be highly prejudicial. <em>Id. </em>at 180, 95 S.Ct. 2133. The decision in <em>Hale </em>applied only to federal prosecutions; <em>Doyle </em>extended the rule to state trials. If, as <em>Hale </em>and <em>Doyle </em>hold, a defendant\u2019s silence cannot be treated as a prior inconsistent statement for impeachment purposes, <em>a fortiori </em>it cannot be used substantively as an admission tending to prove the commission of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The district court in the present case noted that Supreme Court cases which came down <em>after </em>Boyer\u2019s state trial could have no bearing on this habeas corpus proceeding. 436 F.Supp. at 887 n.4, <em>citing Doyle </em>and <em>Hale. </em>Although we believe that a conscientious attorney would have been aware of the gestating law in this area, we agree that <em>Moore\u2019s </em>prescription of \u201cknowledge which normally prevails at the time and place\u201d does not necessarily place upon an attorney practicing in Pennsylvania in 1973 a strict duty to know what that law would become in its fruition.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We nevertheless must consider that <em>prior </em>to Boyer\u2019s trial the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in an interpretation of the Federal Constitution that was binding on the state trial court, had held: \u201cTestimonial reference to an accused\u2019s silence ... at time of arrest is a constitutionally impermissible violation of the accused\u2019s Fifth Amendment right.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Haideman, </em>449 Pa. 367, 370, 296 A.2d 765, 766 (1972). Whatever may have been the state of the law in the federal courts, admission of the prison guard\u2019s testimony at Boyer\u2019s trial was without doubt reversible error under state law. Counsel therefore should have known that the testimony was objectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">Moreover, when he was questioned at the post-conviction hearing regarding his failure to object, Boyer\u2019s trial counsel admitted that the testimony \u201cmight well be objectionable\u201d and could offer no reason for his actions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We would like to believe that competent counsel practicing in the state and federal courts of this circuit do not share this attitude that, at best, is languid and uninspired and, at worst, negligent and constitutionally deficient. And holding counsel to a higher standard under these circumstances does not require him or her to be a crystal gazer; it merely requires him or her to take an adequately interested and informed position on the client\u2019s behalf. Accordingly, we determine that in this case the trial attorney\u2019s actions fell below the requisite knowledge and skill.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">\n<em>C.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">Our analysis cannot end with finding that the actions of Boyer\u2019s counsel fell below the required standard of competency. The district court held that because no harm resulted-and the admitted testimony did not relate to an issue seriously in dispute Boyer was not deprived of effective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Crowley, </em>529 F.2d 1066, 1070 (3d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 995, 96 S.Ct. 2209, 48 L.Ed.2d 820 (1977), we noted that: \u201cthis court has held that in certain circumstances ineffective assistance of counsel can be non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>prejudicial, requiring the affirmance of a district court judgment in spite of such ineffective assistance. See <em>United States ex rel. Green v. </em>Rundle, 434 F.2d 1112,1115 (3d Cir. 1970).\u201d This case presents facts which demand the finding that Boyer was prejudiced as a matter of law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that the district court erred in concluding that Boyer was not deprived of effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">We take a moment to comment on the Commonwealth\u2019s unexplained failure to file a brief in this appeal. In this close case, the court would have been particularly assisted by information regarding the relevant standard of adequacy for attorneys in Lancaster County and adjacent counties in Pennsylvania. In failing to assist this court, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorneys, public officers ostensibly serving the people under an electoral mandate, have failed in their duty to serve their state and this court in the administration of justice. And it is ironic that this lackadaisical attitude toward vindicating the interests of their clients, the people of Pennsylvania, should manifest itself in the context of a case where relief is granted because defense counsel at trial did not properly vindicate the interest of his client. The pervasive professional listlessness in this ease has been alleviated only by the imaginative and vigorous representation of the appellant by his present, court-appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">We acknowledge that in many cases that come before us, application of the law to the facts is clear. Even in those cases, however, we are well served by briefs which elucidate both the law and the facts. Here, we received nothing from one side to the dispute. The court decisions regarding an accused\u2019s silence being what they are, and our standards for attorneys being what they are, we are compelled to interpret the absence of a Commonwealth brief as, if not a tacit agreement with, at least a disinclination seriously to contest appellant\u2019s position on the issues involved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed, and the cause remanded with instructions to enter an order granting the writ of habeas corpus unless a new trial is granted within a reasonable time.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-13\">. The trial court had informed Boyer of his right to appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASpG\">Mr. Boyer, I have to inform you of your right to take an appeal from this judgment of sentence to the Superior Court within thirty days, that is your right. And if you don\u2019t have counsel or can\u2019t afford counsel, counsel will be furnished free of charge. You understand that to be your rights?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoT\"><em>Commonwealth v. Boyer, supra, </em>Sentencing Transcript at 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AJP\">. Judges Hoffman and Spaeth asserted that where the alleged ineffectiveness of trial counsel is apparent in the trial record, a petitioner is not precluded from raising the issue in a post-conviction hearing solely because he failed to prosecute a direct appeal. 352 A.2d at 436.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"afs-dedup-1\">. In his initial habeas petition, appellant raised the additional contentions that his trial counsel had been ineffective in not adequately presenting his defense of insanity, and that the trial court had erred in placing the burden of proving insanity on him. The district court denied the petition as to these two claims on March 9, 1977. They are not raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b344-9\">. In a recent dissent sur denial of certiorari, Mr. Justice White reviewed the various standards utilized in challenges to competence of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"an6-dedup-0\">This petition presents a question of fundamental importance to the administration of criminal justice in both the state and federal courts: what minimum standard of competence must be displayed by an attorney for a criminal defendant in order to satisfy the requirement of the Sixth Amendment that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the defendant receive the effective assistance of counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANui\">Despite the clear significance of this question, the federal courts of appeals are in disarray. Three Circuits subscribe to the view that the representation of a defendant will be deemed adequate as a matter of constitutional law unless it was \u201csuch as to make a mockery, a sham or a farce of the trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Madrid Ramirez, </em>535 F.2d 125, 129 (CA1 1976); <em>Rickenbacker v. Warden, </em>550 F.2d 62, 65 (CA2 1976); <em>Gillihan v. Rodriguez, </em>551 F.2d 1182, 1187 (CA10 1977). Four Circuits require, however, that defense counsel render \u201creasonably competent\u201d assistance. <em>United States v. De Coster, </em>159 U.S.App.D.C. 326, 341, 487 F.2d 1197, 1202 (1973); <em>United States v. Fessel, </em>531 F.2d 1275, 1278 (CA5 1976) (\u201creasonably effective assistance\u201d); <em>United States v. Easter, </em>539 F.2d 663, 665-666 (CA8 1976) (\u201ccustomary skills and diligence that a reasonably competent attorney would perform under similar circumstances\u201d). The Third and Seventh Circuits have developed their own, apparently different, standards for determining whether effective assistance of counsel has been rendered to a defendant. <em>Moore v. United States, </em>432 F.2d 730, 736 (CA3 1970) (\u201cthe exercise of the customary skill and knowledge which normally prevails at the time and place\u201d); <em>United States ex rel. Williams v. Twomey, </em>510 F.2d 634, 641 (CA7 1975) (\u201cassistance which meets a minimum standard of professional representation\u201d). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is internally divided. Compare <em>Saunders v. Eyman, </em>No. 75-3485 (CA9 April 18, 1977) (\u201cfarce or a mockery of justice\u201d) with <em>Cooper v. Fitzharris, </em>551 F.2d 1162 (CA9 1977) (\u201creasonably effective assistance\u201d), rehearing en banc granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"akf-dedup-1\"><em>Maryland v. </em>Marzullo,-U.S. \u2014\u2014, 98 S.Ct. 1885, 56 L.Ed.2d 394 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"A3k\">. <em>Compare United States v.

Reduced to its essence, the test comes to this: at a minimum the court should inquire whether any normally competent lawyer would have objected to the testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9a\">Objections to the admission of evidence, objections to the court\u2019s charge, decisions on what evidence to offer, decisions to make or withhold a motion for a mistrial, are all matters which, if counsel is to function in the adversary system, must be deemed to be within his implied authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"acd-dedup-2\">This is not to say that all such decisions by counsel should be beyond review by a federal habeas court.

It is unclear whether the district court found that the counsel\u2019s representation did not fall below the average level of competence or that because no prejudice resulted Boyer\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel was not violated. <em>Compare </em>436 F.Supp. at 887, <em>with </em>436 F.Supp. at 889.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\">. The magistrate below found that this was \u201can instance of ineffectiveness which cannot be ignored.\u201d 436 F.Supp. at 890. The district court, conversely, found that because Boyer conceded that he was absent from the prison without authorization and the only adverse inference that could be drawn from Steffy\u2019s testimony as to Boyer\u2019s silence was that Boyer \u201chad gotten outside of prison in a manner not authorized by prison officials,\u201d the adverse inference related to an issue not in dispute and, therefore, was not prejudicial. <em>Id. </em>at 888. To the contrary, we find that there was an adverse inference that could be drawn which would prejudice Boyer. The trial judge\u2019s charge reflects Boyer\u2019s defense that he did not intend to escape. The jurors could have drawn an obvious incriminatory inference from Steffy\u2019s testimony because they could conclude that Boyer\u2019s silence at the moment of arrest reflected a guilty mind \u2014 that Boyer \u201cbroke\u201d out of prison and that he had intended to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
