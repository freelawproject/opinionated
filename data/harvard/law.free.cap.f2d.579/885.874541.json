Relying on <em>McMullan v. Community Acceptance Corp., </em>78 Ga.App. 616, 51 S.E.2d 575 (1949), the court held that under Georgia law, the repurchase agreements sued upon were guaranty contracts, on which liability is defeated if the holder has failed to sue the debtor after demand. The agreements in question cannot be interpreted on their face alone as guarantees. A factual question as to the contracts\u2019 interpretation thus arises, so summary judgment was inappropriate. We reverse the district court\u2019s summary judgment on the breach of contract count, and vacate the sr nmary judgment on the conversion count for reconsideration in light of our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-19\">Defendant Motorola Communications and Electronics, Inc. leased a total of 500 electronic \u201cpagers\u201d to Winston Services, Inc. by two agreements executed in 1973. Plaintiff McGraw Edison Credit Corporation financed the transactions by buying the paging equipment and the two leases from Motorola, so that McGraw Edison owned the equipment and received the lease payments from Winston Services. As part of this transaction, Motorola agreed to repurchase the equipment in the event Winston Services defaulted on the lease payments. The construction of these repurchase agreements forms the crux of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-20\">The repurchase agreements between Motorola and McGraw Edison were contained in two letters from Motorola, one for each lease. In the first letter, Motorola agreed in the event of Winston Services\u2019 default to repurchase the equipment \u201cfor the then existing used equipment value.\u201d In the second letter, Motorola agreed to repurchase the pagers sold under the other lease \u201cfor 80% of the loan balance at the time of default.\u201d Both agreements require the repossessed equipment to \u201cbe in good order and repair, normal wear and tear excepted.\u201d Neither agreement mentions the word guaranty or surety. The complete text of these letters is set out in the notes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>Winston Services defaulted on the lease payments to McGraw Edison, but delivered 307 of the pagers to Motorola\u2019s warehouse. Motorola notified McGraw Edison of this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">McGraw Edison filed suit against Motorola on the repurchase agreements and for conversion of the pagers which Winston Services had delivered to Motorola. Motorola moved for summary judgment, raising the defense that the agreements were guarantees, and that Motorola\u2019s obligation on them had been discharged under Georgia law when, upon demand, McGraw Edison failed to sue Winston Services within the time specified by statute. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 103-205 (1968). Motorola did not submit any affidavits with its motion, but relied solely on the repurchase agreements themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The district court granted summary judgment on.both counts. As to the conversion count, the court held plaintiff had failed to make a proper factual showing of wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">As to the breach of contract count, the court held that the agreements were guaranty contracts as a matter of law, relying on <em>McMullan v. Community Acceptance Corp., </em>78 Ga.App. 616, 51 S.E.2d 575 (1949). The district court erred in holding that <em>McMullan </em>makes <em>all </em>repurchase agreements guarantees as a matter of law. <em>McMullan </em>involved the sale of a used car under an installment contract, with the subsequent sale of the installment contract to a finance company. The dealer entered a contract with the finance company, termed the \u201cdealer's repurchase agreement,\u201d whereby, upon default of the car\u2019s buyer and tender of the car, the dealer would pay \u201can amount equal to the unpaid balance\u201d due on the car (less certain finance charges). The Georgia court determined that the contract was one of suretyship.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-16\">The agreements here are different from the one in <em>McMullan. </em>The <em>McMullan </em>agreement contained an unconditional promise to pay the outstanding debt of the car\u2019s purchaser, regardless of the value of the repossessed car (which was, in fact, almost worthless). The second Motorola' agreement, promising to pay 80% of the loan balance, is closest to the <em>McMullan </em>agreement, but it contains an important difference. It is conditioned on the repossessed pagers being in \u201cgood order and repair.\u201d Thus, if the pagers are not in good order and repair, Motorola apparently has no obligation to pay 80% of the loan balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-17\">The first Motorola agreement is even further removed from that found to be a sure-tyship contract in <em>McMullan. </em>It obligates Motorola to repurchase the pagers for their \u201cused equipment value.\u201d This figure is not related to the purchaser\u2019s outstanding debt. Motorola might thus be obligated to pay more, or less, than Winston Services\u2019 loan balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>Under Georgia law, a contract of guaranty (or of surety) is the promise to \u201cpay the debt of another.\u201d <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 103-101 (1968). These repurchase agreements, which do not mention the words guaranty or surety and are not closely tied to the outstanding debt of the purchaser, are not on their face guaranty contracts as a matter of law. A fuller development of the facts may show the agreements to be ones of suretyship, but additional evidence is necessary to aid in their interpretation. In this regard, we note that McGraw Edison submitted an affidavit from its president at the time of the events in question, which stated that all parties had agreed when these contracts were entered that Motorola was <em>not </em>in any way acting as a guarantor, but rather that the repurchase agreements were entered to ensure that McGraw Edison had a market in which to resell the equipment if that became necessary, with Motorola in no way liable for Winston Services\u2019 default.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">We express no view on the ultimate merits of this issue. The discussion here has been for the purpose of showing why the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment was inappropriate. When the facts are fully developed, these agreements may yet be found to be guaranty contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the breach of contract count, and vacate the grant of summary judgment on the conversion count.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">REVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-14\">.
