Code, \u00a7\u00a7 211, 245, subd. (a)) and that appellant drew a knife on Donald Cress in a threatening manner (Pen. Code, \u00a7 417, subd. (a)). Appellant was committed to the Youth Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">At about 8:15 on the evening of September 26, 1980, Donald Cress, assistant produce manager of the Safeway store on Vineland in Sun Valley, observed appellant walking out the door of the store with batteries for which he had not paid. When Mr. Cress asked to see appellant\u2019s receipt, appellant pulled a hunting knife out of his pocket and waved it at Cress. Fearing injury, Mr. Cress jumped back and told appellant to get out.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">At the laundromat a few doors north of the Safeway store Carl Glatthorn had a $1 bill in his hand to place in a change machine. Suddenly he felt a sharp pointed object in his back. Appellant said, \u201cGive me the money.\u201d Mr. Glatthorn was afraid. Appellant grabbed the dollar bill and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Appellant was arrested in the same neighborhood at 9 p.m. because he fit the description of the suspect in the Safeway and laundromat incidents. In his pockets he had a hunting knife, Safeway batteries, and a $1 bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Contending that the victim Glatthorn did not see the sharp pointed object he felt in his back, appellant argues the evidence is insufficient to show that appellant assaulted him with a knife. However, the circumstantial evidence shows that the object was a knife. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 459, 467 [96 Cal.Rptr. 879].) Only seconds before the laundromat robbery, appellant waved a knife at Mr. Cress. Appellant was in possession of the same knife when arrested in the neighborhood 45 minutes after the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Next, pointing to the evidence that Mr. Glatthorn had a dollar bill in his hand which appellant \u201cgrabbed,\u201d appellant argues the evidence is insufficient to support a finding of robbery, and that it shows at most a snatch, a grand theft from the person. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 487, subd. 2.) This argument overlooks the evidence that before grabbing the money appellant put a knife to the victim\u2019s back and said, \u201cGive me the money,\u201d and that the victim was afraid. The evidence is sufficient to show a taking of property by force or fear. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211; <em>People </em>v. <em>Huston </em>(1958) 163 Cal.App.2d 363, 365, 366 [329 P.2d 334]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Welch </em>(1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 422, 423 [31 Cal.Rptr. 926]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lescallett </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 487, 491-492 [176 Cal.Rptr. 687].)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Wende</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Appellant is represented on appeal by court-appointed counsel. After setting forth his arguments and authorities concerning sufficiency of the evidence, counsel\u2019s brief requests this court \u201cto undertake an independent review of the record to determine for itself whether any additional arguable issues exist,\u201d citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Wende </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 436 [158 Cal.Rptr. 839, 600 P.2d 1071], We decline this undertaking. The requirements of <em>Wende </em>come into play only when \u201cappointed counsel submits a brief which raises <em>no </em>specific issues or describes the appeal as frivolous.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 441; italics added.) Since the brief in this case argues two specific issues, <em>Wende </em>is inapplicable. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 106, 109-110 [176 Cal.Rptr. 390].)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Counsel contends that appellant should be entitled both to review of the contentions presented by counsel and an independent review of the record by the court. He contends it is unconstitutional to deny appellant the \u201cbenefit\u201d of an independent review by the court even though counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>has been able to find specific issues to argue. This precise contention was rejected in <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d at p. 110 (hg. den.). The indigent appellant whose counsel can find no arguable issues is not similarly situated to the indigent appellant whose counsel can find arguable issues. <em>(Id.) </em>Although one has the benefit of the court\u2019s independent review, the other has the benefit of counsel\u2019s arguments. When counsel raises specific issues in the brief, the pertinent portions of the record are pointed out, the relevant legal authorities are collected, and, above all, the arguments for the appellant are forcefully <em>advocated </em>by counsel. <em>(In re Smith </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 192, 197 [90 Cal.Rptr. 1, 474 P.2d 969].) By contrast, where a no-issue <em>Wende </em>brief is filed, the court\u2019s review is unguided and undirected and is not initiated from the point of view of an advocate. <em>(In re Smith, supra, </em>at p. 203; <em>People </em>v. <em>Von Staich </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 172, 174-176 [161 Cal.Rptr. 448].)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Credit</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In computing appellant\u2019s maximum period of confinement, the juvenile court gave appellant credit for 143 days of confinement time. <em>(In re Eric J. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 522, 536 [159 Cal.Rptr. 317, 601 P.2d 549].) However, the court also gave additional credit for \u201cgood time.\u201d The disposition in this case occurred prior to <em>In re Ricky H. </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 176, 185-190 [178 Cal.Rptr. 324, 636 P.2d 13], in which the Supreme Court held that juveniles are not entitled to conduct credit for pretrial confinement. Since the additional credit is not authorized by law, the judgment should be modified accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The judgment is modified to provide that the minor has credit for 143 days of time served. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Stephens, Acting P. J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
