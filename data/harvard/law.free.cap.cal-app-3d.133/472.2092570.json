Resources Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 30000 et seq.) in the context of the Commission\u2019s refusal to approve City\u2019s Local Coastal Program (LCP) outlining future development plans for part of south San Diego Bay. The petition was filed originally in the California Supreme Court on account of the great public importance of the issues and the need for a uniform statewide resolution, but the high court has transferred it here. We have issued our alternative writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The procedural history of the matter may be outlined as follows: In the early 1970\u2019s before the present Coastal Act was passed, the City acting jointly with the San Diego Unified Port District formulated a development plan for its bayfront known as the Bayfront Redevelopment Plan, formally adopted in 1974. Then the Coastal Act was enacted, requiring each local government lying within the coastal zone to prepare a \u201clocal coastal program\u201d for its portion of the coastal area (\u00a7 30500, subd. (a)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A local coastal program is defined as a package of land use</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>plans, zoning ordinances, zoning district maps, and, within sensitive coastal resource areas, other implementing actions which satisfy the policies and restrictions of the Coastal Act (\u00a7 30108.6). The City reshaped its Bayfront Redevelopment Plan in light of the Coastal Act policies and requirements and submitted it for approval to the Commission in accordance with statutory requirements on February 2, 1979. On May 4, 1979, the regional commission suggested extensive revisions and amendments to City\u2019s LCP and approved the program conditioned upon such revisions. The plan with the regional commission\u2019s recommendations was submitted for further review to the Commission, and City objected to the revisions before the statewide Commission. However, after extensive hearings, the state Commission on September 18, 1979, adopted some of the proposed findings of the regional commission and granted conditional approval of the LCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">City then commenced judicial review procedures by filing a petition for administrative mandate review (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5) in the superior court on November 16, 1979. After extensive hearings and review of the administrative transcript, the superior court rendered its peremptory writ of mandate on March 5, 1981, remanding the matter to the Commission with directions to withdraw the conditional certification because the Commission has no conditional approval power and must either approve or disapprove the LCP. The Commission then held further hearings, withdrew its approval, and filed its return to the peremptory writ May 5, 1981, setting out what it had done. Over City\u2019s objections, the court discharged the writ but granted City leave to file a supplemental petition for review, which it did on June 22, 1981, again under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The supplemental petition forms the basis for this proceeding. It charges the Commission acted improperly in a number of ways: (1) it used an improper review standard exercising its independent judgment rather than deferring to City\u2019s legislative power; (2) it improperly found various areas to be \u201csensitive environments,\u201d \u201cmarine habitats,\u201d or other categories of land worthy of special protection; (3) it did not observe the special permission of the Coastal Act for development in \u201calready developed parts of South San Diego Bay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">After hearings on the supplemental petition beginning September 21, 1981, the superior court entered formal judgment in favor of the Commission. It found the Commission may exercise its independent judgment in deciding whether an LCP conforms to the statewide policies of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>the Coastal Act; its approval or refusal to approve an LCP is reviewable in the superior court under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 according to the substantial evidence test of review; and here the Commission\u2019s findings and order are supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the final judgment dated November 16, 1981, denied City the writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">City sought extraordinary relief by way of a writ of mandate. Although conceding the appealability of the superior court judgment, City contended the great public importance of the issues calls for immediate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In its response to the petition, the Commission did not oppose issuance of a prerogative writ. However, it stated there is a rising tide of litigation which threatens to interfere with coastal planning. For these reasons we have issued an alternative writ to settle the important legal issues raised in this and similar cases (see, e.g., <em>State of California </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Veta </em>Company) (1974) 12 Cal.3d 237 [115 Cal.Rptr. 497, 524 P.2d 1281]).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Summary of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">To facilitate understanding, the basic facts will be summarized before stating the contentions of the parties. City\u2019s coastal zone is bounded by Interstate 5 on the east, San Diego Bay on the west, the corporate boundary with National City to the north, and the San Diego city boundary to the south. The distinctive features of the area are the Sweetwater Marsh complex, Gunpowder Point, the \u201cD\u201d Street fill, and the Vener farm and marsh. The Sweetwater Marsh is a complex of healthy tidal marshlands supporting a wide variety of wildlife. Gunpowder Point is a 40-acre upland area next to the bay and the marsh which is the site of an abandoned and decaying munitions factory.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The \u201cD\u201d Street fill is a 90-acre upland north of the Sweetwater River Channel which was created by the dredging of the 24th Street Channel. It lies partly within the jurisdiction of the San Diego Unified Port District. A portion is nesting grounds for the California least tern, an endangered species.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">The Vener farm area is an undeveloped area including some wetlands east of the marsh complex and west of Interstate 5. This area and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Sweetwater Marsh area are admittedly places which contain significant biological resources entitled to special protection and enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Contentions of the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">As stated above, the superior court found substantial evidence supports the Commission\u2019s reasons for disapproving part of the City\u2019s LCP, and further found the Commission was entitled to exercise its independent judgment in deciding whether the LCP conformed to coastal policies. The court also determined the test of judicial review to be whether substantial evidence supported the Commission\u2019s findings under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 (which is made specifically applicable to review of the Commission\u2019s findings, \u00a7 30801).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The Commission quarrels with only one ruling, namely, the scope of judicial review of Commission procedures. Commission contends it acts in a quasi-legislative capacity, rather than a quasi-judicial manner when it approves or disapproves an LCP, and that such quasi-legislative administrative adjudications are not subject to substantial evidence review under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, but can only be challenged by traditional writ of mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085) on the basis of being arbitrary, capricious or lacking in evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The City\u2019s contentions are more numerous. First, it contends its legislative activity in drawing up the LCP cannot be challenged by Commission except on the basis of being completely arbitrary, capricious, or lacking in evidentiary support. Drawing upon a statement on the scope of judicial review of Industrial Welfare Commission action in <em>California Hotel &amp; Motel Assn. </em>v. <em>Industrial Welfare Com. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 200, at page 212 [157 Cal.Rptr. 840, 599 P.2d 31], City contends the scope of Commission review should be: \u201cThe Commission must ensure that the local government has adequately considered all relevant factors and has demonstrated a rational connection between those factors, the provisions of its local coastal program, and the policies of the Coastal Act.\u201d City suggests the Commission must be satisfied that statewide interests were balanced against local interests, and environmental concerns against economic concerns, but it cannot upset the balance struck by the local government unless that balance is irrational. Any other scope of review, City argues, invades its function as the primary land use planner, specifically designated by section 30500, subdivision (c), to formulate the details of the LCP under the code language stating, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>\u201c[t]he precise content of each local coastal program shall be determined by the local government ... in full consultation with the commission and with full public participation.\u201d (Stats. 1981, ch. 1173.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">City further contends the Commission has invaded City\u2019s province and has made incorrect decisions in these specific respects: (1) Gunpowder Point is misdescribed as an environmentally sensitive habitat area per sections 30107.5 and 30240, when it is a degraded area which is adjacent to a sensitive habitat; (2) similarly, both Gunpowder Point and the \u201cD\u201d Street fill are mischaracterized as entitled to protection as marine resources or biologically productive wetlands (\u00a7\u00a7 30230, 30231), although they are land environments; (3) the Commission has misapplied section 30233, subdivision (c), regulating diking, filling and dredging in wetlands, to the proposed extension of Tidelands Avenue and the Gunpowder Point access road, despite specific authorization in the statute for development of already developed parts of south San Diego Bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">I. The Statutes</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The Coastal Act begins with lengthy and detailed recitations of the legislative goals in sections 30001, 30001.5 and 30004, all set out in full in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Legislature, among other things, declares the need to protect the distinct and valuable natural resources which is the California coastal zone; states planned development of this area is essential to the economic and social welfare of the People of this state; advocates protection, maintenance and balanced development of the coastal zone environment with its natural and manmade resources and features; seeks to maximize public access to the coast consistent with sound resources conservation and with constitutional protection of the rights of private property owners in the vicinity; seeks to encourage local as well as state initiative and cooperation in planning coastal use; and finally, to achieve maximum responsiveness to local conditions, states the necessity to rely heavily on local government and local land use planning procedures and enforcement while yet providing maximum state involvement in federal activities, protecting regional, state and national interests and coordinating the many agencies whose activities affect the coastal zone, all to be achieved by provision for the Commission to insure continued state coastal planning and management.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Clearly, the statutory mandate is a large order. The goals are manifold and the potential for conflict among agencies, property owners and the Commission is great. A most important aim, however, is to insure statewide supervision over coastal zone development, to avoid local pressures having an undue impact upon the planning for this unique and irreplaceable resource; hence, the creation of the statewide agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>The goals, so far as relevant here, are made more specific in a number of provisions of the Act. For example, \u201cenvironmentally sensitive areas\u201d are defined in section 30107.5<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as regions where the plant or animal life is particularly rare or valuable and particularly vulnerable to degradation by human activities. Section 30240<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> states environmentally sensitive habitat areas \u201cshall be protected\u201d against significant disruption, a protection which includes certain regulation of development in adjacent areas also.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Sections 30230 through 30236, comprising the article entitled \u201cMarine Environment,\u201d similarly state the special protection to be afforded marine resources, areas and species of special biological or economic significance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Section 30231<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> states the mandatory goal of maintaining biological productivity and quality of coastal waters, streams, wetlands, estuaries and lakes to maintain optimum populations of marine organisms and for protection of human health, through such means as controlling waste and water runoff, preventing interference with surface water flow, providing buffer areas of natural vegetation, and minimizing alteration of natural streams.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Finally, section 30 2 3 3<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> states special rules for diking, filling and dredging operations in coastal waters, wetlands, estuaries and lakes. Such operations are permitted only when there is no feasible less environmentally damaging alternative and are limited to stated purposes, principally coastal related industrial facilities, including commercial fishing operations, maintenance or restoration of existing boating facilities, limited new or expanded boating facilities, and other stated uses. The permitted reasons for diking, filling, or dredging do not specifically include public recreational facilities other than \u201cvery minor incidental public facilities\u2019\u2019 and \u201cdevelopment in already developed parts of south San Diego Bay, if otherwise in accordance with this division.\u201d (Other exceptions are not here pertinent.)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>The Coastal Act also provides procedures for formulation and review of planned coastal development. The local government is designated to prepare the local coastal program, meaning the combination of land use plans, zoning ordinances, zoning maps and other implementing actions which meet the requirements and implement the policies of the Act. (See \u00a7 30108.6 defining local coastal program, and \u00a7 30500 designating the local government to determine the precise content of such programs.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Chapter 6 of the Act then provides procedures for the approval and certification of local programs by the Commission. Section 30510 et seq. provides for statewide review of local programs, within stated time limits and allowing for public hearings at various stages of the procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Finally, section 30801<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provides any aggrieved person may secure judicial review of Commission action by a petition for writ of mandate in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. The pertinent procedural statutes are not quoted here in full because the parties do not challenge any procedural aspects of what has transpired to date.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>II. The Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\n<em>A. Judicial Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">It is critical to determine at the outset whether substantial evidence review is mandated, as the trial court held, or whether instead, as Commission now argues, its actions may only be reviewed in the limited manner we review legislative enactments where fundamental constitutional rights are not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The trial court\u2019s choice of the substantial evidence review standard is bottomed on section 30801, which expressly makes review under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 applicable to Commission action.  Traditionally, section 1094.5 review is a procedure for reviewing quasi-judicial administrative rulings. The review standard may be either substantial evidence (as here, where fundamental rights are not implicated), or independent judgment, but in either event it is a far more searching scrutiny than review of legislative activity. The latter review traditionally proceeds by way of extraordinary writ of mandate and is limited (again in the absence of constitutional implications) to the inquiry whether the agency acted within the scope of its delegated authority; whether it used fair procedures; and whether its action was reasonable as opposed to being arbitrary, capricious, or lacking in evidentiary support <em>(California Hotel &amp; Motel Assn. </em>v. <em>Industrial Welfare Com., supra, </em>25 Cal. 3d 200, 211 et seq.; <em>Santa Ana Tustin Community Hospital </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1982) 127 Cal.App.3d 644, 653 [179 Cal.Rptr. 620]). Judicial review of quasi-legislative activity minimizes judicial interference in the interests of the separation of powers doctrine and defers greatly to the power of the quasi-legislative agency (see <em>Industrial Welfare Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 27 Cal. 3d 690, 702 [166 Cal.Rptr. 331, 613 P.2d 579]).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The reference to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 in the Act cannot be determinative of the issue whether the Commission acts in a quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative capacity when it rules on an LCP. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Otherwise, the mere labeling of the review process would characterize the underlying function. There is no authority for the proposition that citing section 1094.5 as the review procedure automatically characterizes an administration function as quasi-judicial. Further, cases in the administrative law area routinely examine the nature of the administrative function reviewed to determine the proper scope of review. The cases above cited are examples.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">At best, the reference to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 is some evidence of legislative intent. It is very weak evidence, however. The issue whether a function is legislative or judicial is sufficiently complex to baffle the most sophisticated courts which routinely must deal with the issue, and it is unlikely to have been analyzed by the Legislature and memorialized in offhand fashion by the use of the statutory reference. More likely, the Legislature intended to provide for judicial review, did not consider it within its province to determine the nature of that review and referred to section 1094.5 because it is the only statute directly providing for review of administrative action. The parties provide no legislative history to the contrary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">More important, however, it is essentially a judicial function to determine the scope of judicial review. We must determine on rational grounds, dealing with the essential nature of the function we review, whether it is legislative or judicial; whether it involves fundamental rights; and following from these determinations, what extent of review is authorized. It is unclear whether the trial court has engaged in this process, but we must in any event make our independent determination of this threshold question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The certification of an LCP has attributes of both kinds of functions. The approval of what is essentially a land planning or zoning package is like the indisputably legislative function of enacting zoning ordinances, in that the result of the process will be promulgation of general develop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>ment criteria and land use regulations for a large physical area affecting many members of the public. However, it is also like a judicial function in that general criteria, namely, the statewide standards of the Act, are applied to an individual instance, the LCP in question, to make an individual determination of conformance or nonconformance. This aspect of the function resembles the variance procedure, quasi-judicial, involving application of a general law to special facts. Also, the procedures mandated by the Act share common features with judicial processes, such as the holding of hearings, taking of testimony, to adjudicate individual issues; but also are like legislative processes in that the Commission also gathers evidence independently, formulates general standards from this evidence, employs its own experts, considers external facts not brought before it by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The local coastal program documents serve essentially the same function as a general plan, even requiring conformity of later zoning ordinances with the plan (\u00a7 30513).  Adoption or amendment of a general plan is legislative or quasi-legislative <em>(Selby Realty Co. </em>v. <em>City of San Buenaventura </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 110, 118 [109 Cal.Rptr. 799, 514 P.2d 111]; <em>Karlson </em>v. <em>City of Camarillo </em>(1980) 100 Cal.App.3d 789, 799 [161 Cal.Rptr. 260]; <em>Mountain Defense League </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1977) 65 Cal.App.3d 723 [135 Cal.Rptr. 588]; <em>Dale </em>v. <em>City of Mountain View </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 101, 107-108 [127 Cal. Rptr. 520]).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Both general plans regulating land use and local coastal programs under the Coastal Act set rules to be applied to future cases, unlike adjudicatory functions which apply such rules to specific sets of existing facts <em>(Strumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 34-35, fn. 2 [112 Cal.Rptr. 805, 520 P.2d 29]; <em>Santa Ana Tustin Community Hospital, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.3d 644, 652). Also, the local coastal program normally includes both a land use plan and implementing zone ordinances (\u00a7 30108.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The case of <em>Davis </em>v. <em>California Coastal Zone Conservation Com. </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 700, 706-707 [129 Cal.Rptr. 417] found a regional commission\u2019s function of approving development permits to be a quasi-judicial function, reviewed by substantial evidence standards. <em>Davis </em>gives a thorough review of administrative review cases falling into both categories, but does not specifiy the precise basis for its own ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>A case recently addressing the scope of review of activity of the Commission is this court\u2019s decision in <em>City of San Diego </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 228 [174 Cal.Rptr. 5], There we reviewed the Commission\u2019s denial of a permit to realign and widen a portion of a road adjacent to a coastal wetlands lagoon (Los Penasquitos Lagoon) by the substantial evidence review standard. The opinion states the parties agreed the matter is governed by the substantial evidence test (119 Cal.App.3d at p. 232) and there is therefore no discussion nor analysis of the suitability of that standard of review. The case is consistent, however, with <em>Davis, supra </em>(57 Cal.App.3d 700), dealing with grant or denial of a permit as a quasi-judicial function.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Most significant for our purposes, however, we note the Commission in approving or disapproving an LCP does not create or originate any land use rules and regulations. It can approve or disapprove but it cannot itself draft any part of the coastal plan. In that respect the Commission\u2019s review function sharply differs from the role of a legislative body and more nearly resembles the adjudicatory task.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">We conclude when the Commission reviews an LCP for conformity to statewide standards it performs a predominantly judicial rather than legislative function. The standard of judicial review of its action is therefore the substantial evidence test, which we must apply as did the trial court, to determine whether any credible evidence supports the Commission\u2019s decision not to certify Chula Vista\u2019s LCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\n<em>B. Standard for the Commission\u2019s Review of the LCP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The City has argued Commission has no legislative power and can therefore review the legislative action of City only by the standard of whether it is arbitrary or capricious. City\u2019s argument is twofold: First, the Act commits to City the task of drawing the specific details of the plan. Second, the legislative history shows intent to involve local government deeply in the planning process and to charge local entities with the primary land planning function. However, neither of these arguments is determinative. The fact that the planning power belongs to the City in part does not preclude the Commission also having coordinate powers at a later stage in the procedure. The construct of shared legislative powers between different agencies may not make for swift and smooth rule making, but it is not inherently impossible. The fact City is the first agency to work on the plan is not determinative of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>scope of Commission\u2019s powers. By comparison, the scope of the WCAB\u2019s judicial power is not limited because a hearing officer must first rule on each case. The Board is the ultimate fact finder and judge; so also the Commission may be the ultimate decision maker, quite consistently with the concept of City\u2019s initiatory role. A cursory examination of the statements of legislative goals embodied in section 30001.5 (see fn. 3, supra) makes this point plain. Local government is to be included, but statewide standards are to be formulated; local government plans, but a statewide commission reviews. Surely the Legislature did not go to all this trouble to create a statewide rubber stamp agency which does no more than review local legislation for arbitrary and capricious enactments. Rather, it is assumed statewide interests are not always well represented at the local level,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and therefore, an agency is needed which promulgates statewide rules and statewide policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The City argues if its function is legislative, the Commission may not exercise independent judgment in reviewing it. This argument does not depend on the classification of Commission\u2019s function. It has no merit in any case. The courts are limited by separation of powers doctrine in the way they review legislative decisions, but no such limit binds the review power of a separate agency created by the Legislature, here the Commission. As already stated, the entire scheme of the Act provides for the initial planning to be done locally and the final approval to be done by a statewide agency with an eye to statewide policies and limitations. The function of the statewide agency would be trivial and its existence unjustifiable if its function were purely to review City\u2019s action for rationality, for conceivable conformity to the state standards rather than actual compliance. Clearly, the Commission must exercise its independent judgment to decide if such conformity has been achieved because that decision cannot be completely delegated to the local entity where it is likely to be subject to local economic and political pressures which cannot so readily influence the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The situation is analogous to the case of <em>Dorcich </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 487 [167 Cal.Rptr. 897], involving the scope of discretion conferred on a statewide agency enforcing the Williamson Act to protect agricultural land and discourage premature urban uses (Gov. Code, \u00a7 51200 et seq.). The Act here is in many respects like the Wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>liamson Act\u2014designed to discourage premature urban uses in the coastal zone except in compliance with statewide standards.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <em>Dorcich, supra, </em>the court found the power of \u201capproval\u201d given the agency included the idea of discretion or adjudication, and that the statewide agency (Secretary) must exercise its independent judgment in making that determination (see modification of opn. on den. of rehg., 111 Cal. App.3d 476c). The same principles apply here. City\u2019s \u201cseparation of powers\u201d argument is unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">We conclude the Commission must exercise its independent judgment when reviewing the LCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">III. Whether Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u2022Supports the Commission Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">As stated above, the City contends the evidence is insufficient to establish these Commission findings: (1) Gunpowder Point is an environmentally sensitive habitat area; (2) Gunpowder Point and the \u201cD\u201d Street fill are marine areas or wetlands; (3) the extension of Tidelands Avenue across Sweetwater Marsh and the improvement of the southern dike to Gunpowder Point constitute impermissible diking, filling and road construction in a protected marsh, rather than permitted activity in an already developed part of the bay. City\u2019s focus on whether the affected areas correspond to particular categories in the various statutes does not resolve the basic issue whether the Commission could refuse to approve City\u2019s LCP. The statutes do not cause overall approval of an LCP to turn on whether a specific area targeted for development is, or is not, a sensitive habitat, a marine environment, or whatever. The statutes taken together protect \u201careas and species of special biological or economic significance\u201d (\u00a7 30230). Thus when development of any given region is contemplated, the question is the effect that development will probably have upon areas and species worthy of special protection. Here, there is no dispute that the Sweetwater Marsh complex is itself worthy of the very highest protection as one of the few remaining natural coastal marshlands in south San Diego Bay and, in fact, in all of coastal California, as an area of enormous biological productivity, nursery ground for many species of fish, home of at least 109 species of birds including such endangered species as the California least tern, the</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>California brown pelican, the light-footed clapper rail, the black rail and the Belding\u2019s Savannah sparrow, all species which are endangered because man has destroyed or significantly impacted their habitats.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Thus, the Commission has found, undisputed by City, that \u201cin view of the tremendous destruction of marsh habitat which has already occurred both in Sweetwater Marsh and the rest of San Diego Bay, and in view of the rarity and value of the habitats areas which are contained within the complex, that protection of the remaining wetlands in the Sweetwater Marsh Complex is of critical statewide and national importance to the preservation of wildlife.\u201d City not only does not disagree with this finding but has all along attempted in designing its LCP to accommodate these values by protecting the marshland in various ways, as by the use of buffer zones around development, the provision of special sites for bird nesting, the design of the proposed Tidelands Avenue extension so that it slopes and drains toward the bay rather than the marsh, and like mitigating measures. The Commission, however, has found that more protection and less intensive development is necessary. The issue is whether substantial evidence in the record supports that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The Commission findings are based mainly on the letters and reports of biologists and ecologists.  (Opinion evidence of experts in environmental planning or ecological sciences is a permissible basis for decision. See, e.g., <em>City of San Diego </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com., supra, </em>119 Cal.App.3d 228, 232; <em>Coastal Southwest Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>California Coastal Zone Conservation Com. </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 525, 532 [127 Cal.Rptr. 775].) The evidence pertinent to disapproval of the City LCP may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">(a) Gunpowder Point</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Gunpowder Point is a 40-acre upland area entirely surrounded by marsh and mudflats and connected to the Vener farmland area by two dikes, more or less deteriorated. City contemplates a 700-unit hotel complex on the Point, with no vehicular access to the Point except for emergency and service vehicles over a road to be built on the southern dike. A sand beach is to be developed on the western end of the island next to mudflats along the bayshore. The Commission finds the construction of the improvements would degrade the marsh complex and eliminate open space and upland habitat which forms a vital part of the marsh ecosystem. The use of buffers around the development would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>limit access of foot traffic but would not lessen the main impact of large buildings, construction and accompanying activity. Further, people and pets would have access from the proposed beach to the mudflat areas. The grading, filling, pile driving and other preconstruction activities would involve use of heavy equipment and could cause catastrophic increase in the amount of sediment reaching the wetlands. Noise levels could adversely affect the local wildlife. The permanent increase in levels of both noise and light resulting from the development could unfavorably impact such endangered species as the Belding\u2019s Savannah sparrow (which cannot mate when noise levels are high) and possibly other birds due to the imbalance of predation conditions caused particularly by excessive light. Gunpowder Point is an integral part of the marsh complex, although it is not itself a marsh. There is continuity of wetlands and adjacent uplands in a marsh complex and disturbance of one disturbs all.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">City contended that in its present degraded state Gunpowder Point provides little benefit to the marsh. City argued that part of the Point is disturbed, previously urbanized area characterized by debris and litter, and part is under cultivation for truck farming. The open areas are dominated by adventitious weedy species rather than native marshland flora and fauna. The species using the Point are predominantly those associated with disturbed habitat such as rodents, rabbits, house finches, house sparrows, etc., and only the peripheral areas support such species as the great blue heron, Belding\u2019s Savannah sparrow and light-footed clapper rail, and these zones will be preserved intact by buffers in the proposed LCP. Further, the present agricultural uses drain into the adjoining marsh or pond areas harmful runoff contaminated by sedimentation from plowed fields and chemical pollutants from insecticides, pesticides and fertilizers. Also, domestic dogs and cats are present on the Point and are a predator hazard to nesting birds.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Commission responds in its findings that first, while the Belding\u2019s Savannah sparrow, an endangered species, was observed on the northwest margin of the Point on two instances, that fact does not establish it does not also forage elsewhere on the Point. There is insufficient evidence to conclude it is confined to the periphery. Further, according to biologists, the ecological approach requires preservation of the Point regardless of the presence or absence at any given time of marshland wildlife, because its value is in its role of maintaining the system as contiguous wildlife habitat. The upland habitat needs to be enhanced for further beneficial wildlife uses. Also, even in its present partly degraded condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>tion, the Point provides open space and habitat value. Also, the fauna using the Point may play an integral part in the food web and ecological relationships which have developed in the marsh system; for example, herons and egrets feed on rodents, snakes and insects on the Point. Further, although the Commission agrees there is adverse sedimentary runoff contributed by present agricultural uses, construction activities usually generate tremendous sediment loads also.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">The Commission concludes the protection of Gunpowder Point is essential to maintain the integrity of the Sweetwater Marsh complex. The construction of a major resort facility essentially surrounded by marsh and mudflat would not assure protection of these habitat values consistent with the policies of the Coastal Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">(b) \u201cD\u201d Street Fill</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The \u201cD\u201d Street fill is a large manmade landfill in the northern part of the marsh, created in 1969. Seventy acres are in City jurisdiction and 27 acres are within the Port District. Since 1973, the California least tern, an endangered species, has nested on the fill. Between 10 and 40 pairs have been observed from time to time.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The City plan is to develop the major part of the \u201cD\u201d Street fill for permanent year-round residential uses. One hundred foot wide buffer zones consisting partly of natural vegetation are to separate the residential development from the marsh. Eight acres are to be set aside and buffered for a least tern nesting site.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The Commission finds the eight-acre site is not sufficient and also the planned development, both in its intensity and its permanent character, are deleterious to the marsh ecosystem. First, concentrating the least tern colony makes it more vulnerable to predation. Proximity of residential uses increases possibility of such predation by domestic pets. Further, terns require large areas of open space and visibility before they can securely colonize an area, again due to need for protection from predators, and therefore presence of many large buildings are harmful to the species. (This consideration was also relevant to the 700-unit hotel on the Point.) Noise and light pollution from development, as discussed for Gunpowder Point, adversely impact native species and affect the balance of predation. Concentrating the colony in an eight-acre site increases susceptibility to predators and there is insufficient evidence an eight-acre site offers enough open space for a viable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>colony of terns. The openness of the \u201cD\u201d Street fill that now attracts least terns to the area would be eliminated by the proposed development. The Commission concludes only light industrial development of the eastern one-third of the fill, plus a provision to fence off the western two-thirds of the fill from off-road vehicle use, would be compatible with the needs of the endangered least tern and the federal and state endangered species acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">(c) Tidelands Avenue Improvement</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Using both earth fill and pilings, City proposes to extend Tidelands Avenue over salt water and salt pan areas of the marsh. As mitigation, it offered to restore marsh habitat elsewhere to compensate for areas filled. The Commission, however, found the project barred by section 30233, subdivision (c), which forbids any diking, dredging or filling in marshlands except to maintain or enhance their functional capacity, or for limited statutory purposes not relevant here, or \u201cin already developed parts of south San Diego Bay, if otherwise in accordance with this division.\u201d The extension clearly would not enhance the marsh, although City argued it would have another beneficial effect favored by the Coastal Act, namely, facilitating public access to the coastlands. However, the Commission said it has consistently denied projects involving filling a wetland for any reason, citing for example the disapproved proposed widening of Carmel Valley Road in the Los Penasquitos Lagoon, denial of a permit for which project was affirmed in our decision in <em>City of San Diego </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com., supra, </em>119 Cal.App.3d 228. Also, the Commission found no development existed in the part of the marsh to be crossed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The Commission emphasized it did not rest its decision on a technicality: \u201cThe preponderance of scientific information available to the Commission suggests that construction of a roadway through the marsh would significantly degrade the entire marsh complex and would lead to further segmentation of an already very isolated and rare habitat.\u201d It pointed out the shrinking marshlands of Southern California are the final refuge for many endangered marsh dependent species, and extensive impacts would result from road construction and as a result of its presence in the marsh. Construction impacts were discussed under Gunpowder Point and include sedimentation and noise. Road presence would also cause increased noise levels and undesirable runoff polluted with heavy metals. Further, associated freeway modifications adjacent to Interstate 5 and the Sweetwater River flood control channel project <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>would permanently separate Sweetwater and Paradise Marshes, dramatically altering the existing estuarine ecosystem. Further, the Commission found a feasible less environmentally damaging alternative, namely, the possibility of providing connections from Route 54 via Interstate 5 to the \u201cE\u201d Street off-ramp in Chula Vista to assure adequate access to the bayfront development.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">(d) Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The City does not deny the possibility of any of the predicted adverse effects of its development which the Commission foresees. Rather, it contends first, it will take all economically feasible mitigating measures and, second, the remaining risks are justified by the gain in public access to and enjoyment of the bayfront area as a result of the planned development. It says the various alternatives for development suggested by the Commission such as, for instance, moving the 700-unit hotel from the Point to the adjacent less environmentally significant Vener farms area, are not economically feasible. It also says the Commission looked only at the reports and recommendations of environmentalists and biologists and did not consider land planning and urban design problems, the needs of the local people, nor the economic reality of the situation. It points out the Commission expressed some hope the entire marsh complex might be acquired for preservation by the federal government, possibly by the Army corps of engineers as mitigation for the adjacent Route 54-Sweetwater River flood control project, but present shrinking governmental resources make such acquisition unlikely. Therefore, either the City must be permitted to develop the area in such manner as it can afford and will undertake, or alternatively, things will be left as they are. If they are left as they are, environmental degradation will occur as the result of off-road vehicle activity on the Point and the \u201cD\u201d Street fill, which has already destroyed many birds and nests; agricultural sedimentation and runoff to the marsh; pollution by rubbish accumulation and dumping on the Point; and continued lack of legitimate public access to the Chula Vista coastlands. In the long run, it contends, the best choice for the public is to permit the City\u2019s planned development which may have some adverse impact on the marshland but will also provide much public benefit in terms of cleaning up eyesores, providing parks, open space, protected bird nesting sites, natural buffer zones, coastal access and marsh preservation as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Commission, however, insists on retaining the actual marsh complex and immediately adjacent uplands (such as Gunpowder Point and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u201cD\u201d Street fill) in a relatively undeveloped condition, with possible limited pedestrian or bicycle access for study and nature observation only. It wishes to keep development back to the more remote uplands, particularly Vener farms, and also to keep the development low in intensity and transitory in character (hotels, motels, rather than housing) to minimize the impact on the marshlands. Commission emphasizes the integrated nature of the entire habitat, the great shrinkage in this type of environment which has occurred over this century as a result of massive dredging, filling and development of marshland areas, and the great necessity, therefore, to provide maximum safeguards for the Sweetwater Marsh which represents approximately 75 percent of San Diego Bay\u2019s remaining natural marshland. (It notes also only 360 acres remain of the approximately 2,450 acres of salt marsh community which once existed in San Diego Bay.) It was impressed not only with the comparative rarity of coastal marshland in California but also with the relative richness, biologically speaking, of this environment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Commission takes the position any conceivable adverse impact on this last remaining valuable marsh area is too great a risk to be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">We conclude the record is replete with substantial evidence of risk to the marsh environment if the proposed development is allowed. As stated at the outset of this discussion, the Coastal Act presents competing values: local planning options and needs versus statewide concerns in the preservation of the unique California coastal zone. The Commission as representative of the state and protector of the statewide interests in conservation and coastal management must have an effective role when it comes to balancing these values, else the agency has no real purpose. Local government is not expected to concern itself with statewide interests to the same extent that a statewide agency would and here, the statewide interests to be protected clearly appear. The Commission must be permitted to decide the necessary level of protection. If it is compelled to accept risks it regards as unjustified in the name of economic necessity, it cannot carry out its statutory mandate to provide permanent protection for the state\u2019s distinctive and valuable coastal zone for the benefit of the people of California (\u00a7 30001.5). A number of specific statutes, most of them cited above in the footnotes, give additional underpinning to the Commission\u2019s authority in this re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>gard. Its job is to maintain and enhance marine resources of special biological and economic significance (\u00a7 30230) of which the Sweet-water Marsh is such a resource. It must protect biological productivity and quality of estuaries such as this marsh complex (\u00a7 30231). It may not permit diking, filling or dredging of wetlands except for limited stated purposes which do not include housing developments or hotels (\u00a7 30233). It must protect environmentally sensitive habitat areas against significant disruption of habitat values (\u00a7 30240), and the adjacent uplands to the marsh are such areas according to the opinions of many biologists and ecologists in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Substantial evidence supports the decision of the Commission to disapprove the City\u2019s Local Coastal Program.
