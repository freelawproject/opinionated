J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXm\">This John Raymond Eagles, Jr., appeals from a judgment of conviction of three counts of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence, in violation of Penal Code section 192, subdivision 3,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and from the sentence of three consecutive terms of imprisonment. He was acquitted of three counts of second degree murder. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Shortly before midnight on February 11, 1979, an automobile driven by defendant entered the intersection of Watt and El Camino Avenues in Sacramento at a high rate of speed and against a red light and struck another automobile, killing two of its occupants and one of the passengers in defendant\u2019s car and injuring nine other persons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>numerous witnesses to the collision and to defendant\u2019s driving conduct immediately prior thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Frederick Roloff testified that as he completed a left turn from Auburn Boulevard onto Watt Avenue, defendant\u2019s car passed him at a speed of about 80 miles per hour. Recovering from his \u201cinitial shock,\u201d Roloff accelerated to about 60 miles per hour, but defendant continued to pull away at a speed Roloff estimated as 90 to 100 miles per hour,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> during which defendant \u201cwent through\u201d a red light. From a parking lot off Watt Avenue James Byrd saw defendant\u2019s automobile \u201cstreak\u201d by at a speed he estimated as \u201cgoing faster than eighty,\u201d perhaps \u201cover a hundred miles an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">As Kathleen Hicks approached the intersection of Watt and El Camino, traveling southbound on Watt, she observed defendant\u2019s car as it came up behind her \u201cvery rapidly,\u201d passed her \u201creally flying . . . going a good 70 or 75\u201d and proceeded into the intersection against a red light, without braking. Michael Bard was stopped in a northbound lane on Watt waiting for the light to change. He estimated defendant\u2019s car was traveling \u201c[pjrobably between 60 and 70 miles an hour.\u201d James Giannelli, also stopped in a northbound lane on Watt, thought defendant\u2019s car was going \u201cabout 75.\u201d Edward Burger, similarly situated, estimated its speed at 60 to 65 miles per hour. The posted speed limit was 35 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">A Highway Patrol Multidisciplinary Accident Investigation team reconstructed the accident on the basis of skid marks, scratches and gouges in the pavement and on the damage to the vehicles and where they came to rest. Dewey Brown, a California Department of Transportation traffic engineer assigned to the team, thereupon calculated the speeds of the vehicles upon impact, concluding that defendant\u2019s Camaro was traveling 62.46 miles per hour and the Pinto he struck was traveling 36.77 miles per hour, \u201cplus or minus two miles an hour.\u201d Another member of the investigatory team, Aelred Sauer, a Highway Patrol safety inspector and mechanic with special expertise regarding motor vehicle brakes, testified that in his opinion the brakes and brake lights on defendant\u2019s car were operable at the time of the collision. A highway patrolman testified that the absence of skid marks before the point of impact indicated defendant\u2019s brakes were not applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Defendant testified and admitted exceeding the posted speed limit on Watt Avenue, but insisted that \u201c[everybody travels that fast at that time of night.\u201d He denied driving through a red light at the intersection of Watt Avenue and Auburn Boulevard and estimated that he was traveling between 55 and 60 miles per hour when he passed Roloff. He also denied that the light was red at Watt and Whitney when he drove through it. He admitted accelerating at one point to \u201cabout 70\u201d in response to a comment that his car was \u201cgutless,\u201d but said he had slowed to about 55 or 60 miles per hour as he approached El Camino Avenue, where he noticed traffic was stopped for a red light. At that moment one of his passengers asked him to change a tape and he looked down \u201cto see which tape to put in.\u201d When he looked up, the stopped cars were \u201cclose.\u201d As he braked, his automobile \u201cjerked\u201d to the left and he swerved around the cars and into the intersection at a speed of about 50 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">William Rennert, a passenger in defendant\u2019s car, estimated defendant was driving 40 to 45 miles per hour along Watt Avenue, but that he \u201ckicked up the speed a little bit\u201d to 55 or 60 in response to the derogatory comment on his car\u2019s performance and they approached El Camino Avenue at a speed of about 55 miles per hour. From his position in the back seat he could not see the traffic lights, but no one made any comment regarding them. He did not feel any braking or deceleration as they entered the intersection of Watt and El Camino.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In an effort to corroborate his denial that he passed through red lights at Auburn Boulevard and Whitney Avenue, defendant produced an accident investigator who testified, on the basis of signal \u201ctiming sheets\u201d and experiments he conducted retracing RolofFs progress onto and along Watt Avenue, that the signals were timed so that the lights must have been green for defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The investigator also questioned the accuracy of RolofFs estimate of the speed of a passing car at night. He did the same in regard to witness Byrd\u2019s estimate of defendant\u2019s speed as he passed the parking lot in which Byrd was standing; he performed an experiment purporting to show that defendant\u2019s speed must have been about 60 miles per hour if Byrd was able to walk out of the parking lot to the sidewalk and observe the car for as long as he said he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Defendant also produced an expert witness, William R. Neuman, a professor of civil engineering at California State University, Sacramento, who calculated, based on estimates of the weight of the cars and the manner in which they skidded, that defendant\u2019s car was traveling 54.47 miles per hour and the Pinto 37.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Defendant was found guilty of three counts of vehicle manslaughter, which the jury was told was the killing of a human being proximately caused in the driving of a vehicle by the commission of an unlawful act, a violation of the basic speed law, with gross negligence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It was instructed on the basic speed law (Veh. Code, \u00a7 22350) and traffic control law (Veh. Code, \u00a7 21453) and that a violation of each is inherently dangerous to human life or safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Defendant makes no claim on appeal that his driving conduct was not unlawful or inherently dangerous to human life or safety. Rather, he contends the trial court erred in preventing him from presenting evidence of the average speed of traffic observed on Watt Avenue on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>night sometime after the accident to establish <em>the </em>\u201cstandard of care\u201d required for gross negligence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Defendant argues for the first time on appeal that \u201cthe question whether or not [his] driving was marked by a gross \u2018failure to exercise care\u2019 was one of fact for the jury alone and . . . the actions of other similarly situated drivers was absolutely relevant to that factual determination.\u201d He now agrees with the trial court that the conduct of other drivers is not <em>the </em>measure of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument comes too late. \u201cIt is the general rule that questions relating to the admissibility of evidence will not be reviewed on appeal in the absence of a specific and timely objection at the trial on the ground sought to be urged on appeal. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Welch </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 106, 114-115 [104 Cal.Rptr. 217, 501 P.2d 225]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Richards </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 614, 618, fn. 1 [131 Cal.Rptr. 537, 552 P.2d 97]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Privitera </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 697, 710 [153 Cal.Rptr. 431, 591 P.2d 919, 5 A.L.R.4th 178].) Defendant tendered the issue on an improper theory resulting in a ruling predicated upon the theory. He cannot switch horses on appeal. Assuming a correct theory could have been tendered, the court nonetheless could have excluded the evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>In any event, defendant was not prejudiced by the exclusion of the evidence. He was permitted to testify, over and over, that, in his experience (he had driven the same route \u201c[a] lot of times\u201d), \u201c[everybody travels that fast at that time of night.\u201d He said he noticed several other cars traveling at the same speed, 55 to 60 miles per hour, on the night of the accident. He considered it safe to drive at that speed on Watt and always did so, in keeping with the flow of traffic. Moreover, on cross-examination, prosecution witness Roloff stated that in his opinion it was safe, for him at least, given his experience and his Porsche, to drive 60 miles per hour on Watt Avenue. And another prosecution witness testified that \u201ccars do whiz by on Watt Avenue, ... all the time\u201d and that he had seen cars exceeding the speed limit there before. He estimated that the other cars he observed that night were traveling between 40 and 50 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Finally, the overwhelming nature of the evidence against defendant renders it highly improbable that he was prejudiced by the error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].) A number of eyewitnesses saw defendant traveling at speeds far in excess of the posted speed limit on Watt Avenue. One of them tried to catch up with defendant, but defendant\u2019s car continued to pull away from him rapidly, though the witness reached a speed of 60 miles per hour. Even the evidence most favorable to defendant indicates that his car entered the intersection of Watt and El Camino Avenues against a red light and at a speed 20 miles per hour in excess of the posted speed limit, and the prosecution\u2019s expert said it exceeded the limit by almost <em>30 </em>miles per hour. It is clear, too, that contrary to defendant\u2019s testimony he did not attempt to stop at the red light; there were no skid marks before the point of impact, an eyewitness testified that the car\u2019s brake lights, which were operational, did not come on, and a passenger in defendant\u2019s car said that he felt no braking or deceleration as the car entered the intersection. We can hardly imagine a more compelling showing of gross negligence. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pfeffer </em>(1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 578, 580-581 [36 Cal.Rptr. 838].)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The trial court permitted the prosecution to present evidence of defendant\u2019s reckless driving during the afternoon before the accident, including testimony that he was speeding up to 85 miles per hour on Highway 50, weaving in and out of traffic and that he forced a car off the road while suddenly exiting at an off ramp. The prosecution prof<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>fered the evidence as relevant to defendant\u2019s state of mind involving the charges of second degree murder of which he was acquitted, characterizing that as his knowledge of the life-threatening dangers of excessive speed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court rejected defendant\u2019s <em>in limine </em>motion to exclude the evidence pursuant to Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> on the ground the evidence was relevant to show defendant\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> several hours later when the accident occurred. The evidence was properly admitted on the ground asserted by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Evidence of a prior uncharged offense may be offered to prove a disputed fact relevant to the offense charged, such as knowledge, but not to prove the defendant\u2019s disposition to commit the offense. \u201c[T]he fact sought to be proved may be either an ultimate fact in the proceeding or an intermediate fact \u2018from which such ultimate fact[] may be presumed or inferred.\u2019\u201d (Fns. omitted.) <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 303, 315 [165 Cal.Rptr. 289, 611 P.2d 883].) \u201cIn ascertaining whether evidence of other crimes has a <em>tendency </em>to prove the material fact, the court must first determine whether or not the uncharged offense serves \u2018logically, naturally, and by reasonable inference\u2019 to establish that fact.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Schader </em>[(1969)] 71 Cal.2d [761,] 775 [80 Cal.Rptr. 1, 457 P.2d 841] ....)\u201d (Fn. omitted.) (Thompson, at p. 316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Here, the evidence of prior driving conduct was offered to prove an intermediate fact (knowledge that conduct is life threatening) necessary to the establishment of the ultimate fact of implied malice, an element in the charges of second degree murder. <em>\u201c[M]alice </em>may be implied when a person, knowing that his conduct endangers the life of another, nonetheless acts deliberately with conscious disregard for life. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Sedeno </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 703, 722-723 . <em>..; </em>People v. <em>Phillips </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 574, 587 ....)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 290, 296 [179 Cal.Rptr. 43, 637 P.2d 279 ].) \u201c[T]here must be actual knowledge ... of the peril to be apprehended . . . coupled with a conscious failure to act to the end of averting injury.\u201d <em>(Kastel </em>v. <em>Steiber </em>(1932) 215 Cal. 37, 47 [8 P.2d 474].)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Evidence of excessive speed resulting in a near collision is relevant to knowledge of risk, \u201can actual awareness of the great risk of harm\u201d of excessive speed. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 301 [\u201cDefendant drove at highly excessive speeds through city streets, an act presenting a great risk of harm or death. Defendant nearly collided with a vehicle after running a red light . . . .\u201d]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Costa </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 160, 166-167 [252 P.2d 1].) Defendant\u2019s prior driving conduct occurred on the same day and some nine hours before the killings. Although it took place on a freeway with speed limits different than on Watt Avenue, it involved driving at excessive speeds, resulting in a near accident. We agree with the prosecutor at trial that it is a permissible inference that \u201c[w]hen you\u2019re driving around ... at a high rate of speed, almost cause an accident, you must see what the risk of harm is that can follow it.\u201d What defendant knew in the afternoon he undoubtedly knew that night before the fatal accident. The evidence was admissible to prove implied malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Defendant was acquitted of the charges to which the evidence was relevant. But he argues that the evidence was /\u00abadmissible on the issue of gross negligence, an element of the offenses for which he was convicted. We do not reach that issue for the following reasons.  Evidence that is relevant and admissible for one purpose may be admitted for such purpose even though it is inadmissible for another purpose. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 355; 1 Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook (2d ed. 1982) \u00a7 20.2, pp. 467-468; see <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Toledo </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 415 [167 Cal.Rptr. 270].) \u201cWhen evidence is admissible for a limited purpose ... a party who could be adversely affected if the evidence is not so restricted is entitled to have the trial judge restrict the evidence to the limited purpose . . . and instruct the jury accordingly.\u201d (1 Jefferson, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>supra, </em>at p. 468; Evid. Code, \u00a7 355; see <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Toledo, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.3d 415.) Defendant implies that it is the court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>duty to give the limiting instruction. That is not the case. The limiting instruction is available only \u201cupon request\u201d of the party affected. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 355.) No such request was made. Accordingly, we do not consider whether the challenged evidence also tends to prove an intermediate fact from which gross negligence may be inferred. (But see <em>People </em>v. <em>Costa, supra, </em>40 Cal.2d at pp. 166-167.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Defendant objects to the trial court\u2019s instruction based upon Penal Code section 193, subdivision (c),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that if the jury found defendant guilty of manslaughter <em>with </em>gross negligence it should either recommend that he be sentenced to county jail or make no recommendation, but if it found him guilty of manslaughter <em>without </em>gross negligence it should make no recommendation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He claims that this instruction implicitly informed the jury that the offense of manslaughter without gross negligence is punishable by imprisonment in county jail only and encouraged it improperly to consider punishment in the course of its deliberations of his guilt.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>We do not reach the issue tendered because we find that the error alleged is, in any event, harmless. We also note the statutory authority of the jury to recommend punishment has been repealed, effective January I, 1982. (Stats. 1981, ch. 110, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">To merit reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction it must be reasonably probable that a different result would have obtained if the claimed error had not occurred. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 836.) Our review of the evidence has convinced us that the verdict would have been the same without the claimed error. Defendant\u2019s driving conduct presents a paradigm case of gross negligence. If the jury considered a jail term too lenient a sentence, it undoubtedly did so for the same reason that led it inescapably to a finding of gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Defendant also contends that the trial court violated Penal Code section 654<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in sentencing him consecutively for the three manslaughter convictions, claiming that all three deaths resulted from a single, indivisible course of conduct. It is well settled that section 654\u2019s prohibition of multiple punishment is inapplicable where the criminal conduct involves \u201cviolence with the intent to harm more than one person or by a means likely to cause harm to several persons .. .. \u201d <em>(Neal </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1960) 55 Cal.2d 11, 20 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 873, 885 [135 Cal.Rptr. 654, 558 P.2d 552].) Defendant argues, however, that where the acts of violence are not intentional, but the result of gross negligence, the rule recognized in <em>Neal </em>is inapplicable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>De Casaus </em>(1957) 150 Cal.App.2d 274 [309 P.2d 835], an argument essentially the same as defendant\u2019s was rejected, the court upholding consecutive one-year jail sentences for six vehicular manslaughter convictions. The holding was reaffirmed in <em>In re Frank F. </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 383, 386-387 [153 Cal.Rptr. 375], in dicta, in rejecting the minor\u2019s contention that Vehicle Code section 23101 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>intended to supplant the vehicular manslaughter statute with regard to intoxicated drivers. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Lockheed Shipbuilding &amp; Constr. Co. </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 12-13 [138 Cal.Rptr. 445] [upholding multiple punishment for violation of former Lab. Code, \u00a7 6416 (repealed by Stats. 1973, ch. 267, \u00a7 1, p. 664; ch. 993, \u00a7 93, p. 1938, eff. Oct. 1, 1973), grossly negligent failure to provide a safe employment resulting in death, where conditions were based on an explosion which resulted in 16 deaths].) We think the rationale of the rule permitting multiple punishment where multiple victims are involved, the need \u201cto insure .. . defendant\u2019s punishment will be commensurate with his criminal liability\u201d <em>(Neal </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d at p. 20), supports these holdings. The \u201coutrage\u201d to which the vehicular manslaughter statute addresses itself was perpetrated on three victims, (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Lobaugh </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 75, 79 [95 Cal.Rptr. 547].) Defendant was not grossly negligent toward a single potential victim; rather, his utter disregard of people\u2019s safety endangered a large number of persons and killed three of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Defendant attempts to analogize this case to <em>People </em>v. <em>Lobaugh, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.3d 75, which held that a defendant may be convicted of only one violation of Vehicle Code section 23101, driving under the influence of liquor resulting in injury to another, though several persons are injured. That decision is inapposite. The court there observed: \u201cUnlike the usual \u2018multiple victim\u2019 case, here the fundamental concern of the state is not the outrage done the victims, but rather the prevention of \u2018drunken driving\u2019 and the punishment of those who so conduct themselves.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 79.) Penal Code section 192, conversely, is entirely concerned with the \u201coutrage done the victims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Reynoso, J.,* and Young, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 25, 1982.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-11\"> Penal Code section 192, subdivision 3, provides: \u201cManslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being, without malice.
