Art. 1753) which provides that cases removed by <em>certiorari </em>from a Justice\u2019s Court to the District Court, shall be tried <em>de novo, </em>and if the judgment be affirmed ten per cent, damages shall be added, is that the damages shall be added to the sum found to be due upon the trial in the District Court, when it shall be the same as that adjudged by the Justice, (or more,) thereby affirming the correctness of the decision of the Justice.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-8\">Error from Rusk. Tried below before the Hon. Charles A. Frazer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-9\">Judgment in favor of the defendants in error against the plaintiff in error, in a Justice\u2019s Court, for $80 30. <em>Gertioro/ri </em>by plaintiff in error; verdict for defendants in error for same amount, increased by interest since accrued ; judgment for defendants in error for the amount of the verdict and for ten per cent, damages thereon.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-10\"><em>S.

It is evident the Statute does not intend an affirmance of the judgment of the Justice as upon error; for it provides that the trial may be <em>de novo, \u201c </em>and if the judgment be affirmed, ten per cent, damages shall be added.\u201d (Hart. Dig. Art. 1753.) The evident meaning is, that the damages shall be added to the sum found to be due upon the trial in the District Court, when it shall be the same as that adjudged by the Justice, (or more,) thereby affirming the correctness of the decision of the Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">There is no error in the judgment, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
