At the Spring Term, 1857, the parties having been served, and failing to appear, judgment final was entered against them by default. A motion in arrest of judgment was filed, signed S. P. Donley, Armstrong and Flanagan, for motion, on the ground, mainly, that the charge recited in the recognizance, was not an offence for which an indictment w ould lie. There was no order disposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>of this motion. But it appeared by a bill of- exceptions, that S. P. Donley was the only one present, of the attorneys whose names were signed to the motion, and that the Court refused to permit him to present the motion, on the ground that it appeared to the Court from the records thereof, that said Donley was the District Attorney at the time of the indictment, recognizance, forfeiture thereof, and issue of <em>scire facias </em>thereon ; to which ruling defendant excepts, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-5\"><em>Donley dc </em>Anderson, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuN\">cited Daily v.

The writ of error has been prosecuted by other counsel, whose right is not questioned ; and as the objection taken in arrest of judgment goes to the foundation of the action, it is\" equally available on error, as in arrest of judgment. On the merits, the case comes clearly within the principle of the cases of Daily v. The State, (4 Tex. 417,) The State v. Cotton, (6 Id. 425,) and Cotton v. The State, (7 Id. 547.) On the authority of those cases the judgment must be reversed and the case dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Reversed and dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
