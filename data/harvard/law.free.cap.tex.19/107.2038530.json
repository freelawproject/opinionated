We have decided, and it is believed in more than one of the cases yet unpublished, that h\u00e9 has such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The fact that the affidavit in support of the claim in this case was made before such Commissioner, was not a good cause of demurrer; and the judgment is therefore reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Roberts, J., did not sit in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
