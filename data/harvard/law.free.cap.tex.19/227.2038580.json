Tried below before the Hon. Archibald W. 0. Hicks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-8\">Suit by defendant in error against plaintiff in error, service by publication, and judgment by default. The affidavit for publication of the citation, stated that the residence of the defendant was \u201c known to affiant, and that in consequence personal service can not be had on him.\u201d There was no statement of facts, upon which the judgment w#as rendered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-9\"><em>J. M. Ardrey, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asj\">argued that the affidavit for publication was fatally defective, and as to failure to make out statement of facts, cited McFadden v.

It evidently appears by the affidavit what was intended. And it was understood and acted on by the officer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>But the omission of the Court to make out a statement of facts is fatal to the judgment. That is a positive requirement of the Statute, which cannot be dispensed with. (Hart. Dig. Art. 782 ; McFadden v. Lockhart, 7 Tex. R. 573.) The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
