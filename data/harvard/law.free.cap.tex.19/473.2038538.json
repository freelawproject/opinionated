It was not very clear that the $68 50 had not been advanced after the levy, under the impression that plaintiff\u2019s contract with Robinson warranted him paying over the balance of the proceeds to Robinson. The Mdes had been sold and the proceed swere in the plaintiff\u2019s hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-9\">The Court charged the jury, that if they found for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>plaintiff they had nothing more to do, but if they found for the defendant, they should inquire what, if any, damage had been sustained by the defendant by the suing out of the injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff.

The advances, according to the evidence, about equalled the value of the property. But the plaintiff\u2019s claim, as stated in his petition, was for a less sum advanced, The property appearing by the evidence to have been sold, and the proceeds in the hands of the plaintiff, he could have no pretence to retain more than sufficient to cover his demands as stated by himself in his petition. The jury ought to have been instructed to ascertain the value of the property, and the excess should have been awarded to the defendant; and thus complete justice would have been done between the parties. To the end that it may be so done, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
