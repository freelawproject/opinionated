Thomas H. Norton.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b118-5\">The Code of Criminal Procedure repealed the Statute which required assignments of error to be filed in the Court below, so far as appeals in criminal cases are concerned; and such assignments may now be made in the Supreme Court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b118-6\">An indictment for gaming, which charged the defendant with playing cards for money \u201c at an out house to which divers persons did then and there resort,\u201d is sufficient under the Statute, which imposes a punishment on playing cards for money in an \u201cout-house where people resort.\"</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b118-7\">The result of previous decisions as to what is an out-house where people resort is, that the out-house must be one to which the people have resorted on more than one occasion,' or that more persons than those actually engaged in playing, are assembled on the particular occasion at which the offence is charged to have been committed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-8\">Appeal from Wood. Tried below before the Hon. Charles A. Frazer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-9\">Indictment for gaming, quashed on motion of defendant. The averment of the indictment, in the particular objected to, is fully stated in the Opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-10\"><em>Attorney General, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5\">cited the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, referred to in the Opinion, and then argued as follows :</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-11\">I understand the effect of these provisions to be, that no rule of practice, in force by virtue of former statutory laws, is operative. Defects in the new system of procedure are to be supplied by reference to the Common Law; or the Court, under Art. 745, may make rules of practice upon appeal, to supply omissions. There being no rule of Court upon this particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>subject, and the practice of requiring an assignment of errors being derived from the Statute, it follows that no such requirement is now in force.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-5\">The objection to the sufficiency of the indictment applies to the averment that the game of cards was played \u201c in a certain \u201c outhouse to which divers persons did then and there resort.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-6\">It is presumed that the District Court construed the words \u201c where people resort,\u201d to mean where people usually or habitually resort. But this is not the legitimate meaning of the phrase. The Act intended to prevent gaming where crowds of persons were assembled, whether as a general habit or upon a particular occasion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-7\">The rule stated in Wheelock v. The State, 15 Tex. R. 263, is that the place must be one to which people have resorted on more than one occasion, or at which more persons than the number actually engaged in the game were assembled on the particular occasion when the violation of law may have taken place.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-8\">This is doubtless the correct rule, and sustains the view already presented. Under the indictment in the present case, it would have been competent to prove that more persons, at the time stated in the indictment, had assembled together than those actually participating in the game of cards.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-9\"><em>D. 0. </em>Norton, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0B\">We think the indictment in this case cannot be sustained by any of the known rules of law, inasmuch as it deviates so far from the Statute, as to substitute particular for general terms. (Wheat. Cr. L. 91, 92.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b119-10\">Hemphill, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtF\">In this case there is no assignment of error, and the first question is whether the rule, requiring such assignment on appeals in criminal cases, has been repealed by the new Code. The Attorney G-eneral cites in support of the affirmation of this proposition, the following Article of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Code of Criminal Procedure, viz. : Art. 1st, \u201c That this Code \u201c is intended to embrace fully all the rules applicable to the \u201c prevention and prosecution of offences against the laws of the \u201c State.\u201d Section 4, p. 188, \u201c That from and after the first \u201c day of February, 1857, all Laws and parts of Laws which <em>\u201c </em>regulate and refer to the .prevention, suppression, prosecution \u201c and proceedings for the punishment of crime, shall stand \u201c repealed.\u201d Also Article 27th of the Code, viz.: \u201c That \u201c when\u00e9ver it is found that this Code fails to provide a rule \u201cof procedure in any particular state of case which may \u201c arise,\" and is therefore defective, the rules of the Common \u201c Law shall be applied and govern, when they are not incon- \u201c sistent with the general principles on which this system of <em>\u201c </em>procedure is founded.\u201d And further, that by Art. 745, it is provided that the \u201c Supreme Court may make rules of proced1 \u2018 ure as to the hearing of criminal actions upon appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In our opinion the effect of these provisions is, that the rule of practice requiring assignments of error in appeals in criminal cases to be made in the District Court, is no longer of force, and that this appeal cannot be dismissed for. the want of such assignment!</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The question in this case is upon the validity of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The averment objected to as insufficient, is to the effect that the game of cards was played at an out-house to which divers persons did then and there resort.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">This, in the motion to quash, is stated as neither following the language nor being within the intention of the Statute which, in relation to the offence, uses the words <em>\u201c </em>out-house, \u201c where people resort;\u201d whereas the indictment uses the special terms an outhouse where divers persons did then and there resort. It is not very easy to distinguish between the phrases an outhouse where people resort, and an out-house where divers persons resort. They are the same in sense and substance. The Court below may have been of opinion that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>-out-house where people resort, meant one where the people usually or habitually resort; and that an out-house where the people or divers persons resorted to on only one special occasion, did not come within the purview of the Statute. If so, there was a misapprehension, as we conceive, of the intention of the law. The question as to what constitutes an out-house where people resort, has been so fully discussed in the three several cases of Wheelock v. The State, 15 Tex. R. 253, 257, 261, that we are relieved from the necessity of again entering upon the subject. The resnlt of those decisions is, that the out-house must be one to which the people have resorted on more than one occasion, or that more persons than those actually engaged in playing are assembled on the particular occasion at which the offence is charged to have been committed. Under this indictment, it was competent to prove that more persons than those actually engaged in playing were present on the occasion. The averment is sufficient, and there was error in quashing the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
