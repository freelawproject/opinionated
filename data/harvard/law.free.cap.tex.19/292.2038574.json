The note was dated January 17th, 1853, payable twelve months after date, with interest at ten per cent, per annum from maturity. Judgment by default, and amount assessed at $495 principal, and $90 75 interest. On the note was indorsed January 17th, 1855, a credit of $50 as interest, signed J. Long. The indorsement to plaintiff was dated February 9th, 1855. In copying the note into the transcript, the Clerk first wrote the word \u201c date,\u201d and ran his pen through it and wrote \u201c maturity,\u201d which suggests that the interest for one year being as nearly the same as the credit indorsed, the mistake may have occurred by computing interest from date.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-8\"><em>B.
