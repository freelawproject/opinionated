The case is withdrawn from the jury on account of the counsel\u2019s remark.\u201d The jury were thereupon discharged by order of the court subject to the defendant\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">At the next sitting of the criminal court for Suffolk County, the defendant was again called for trial upon the same in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>dictments before another judge of the Superior Court, and the defendant seasonably filed a plea to the jurisdiction and two pleas in bar. The pleas were overruled and the defendant excepted. Before the jury were empanelled, the judge, with the consent of the defendant, reported the case to this court, which dismissed the report. (245 Mass. 163.) The defendant was again called for trial on the same indictments and was found guilty on each of them.. The case is here upon a report by the judge who presided at the last trial and who refused to allow the defendant\u2019s pleas in bar, which, in substance, alleged that he had before been placed in jeopardy for the same offences. The question we have to decide is whether at the first trial the court had power to discharge the jury upon the facts shown by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">It is an ancient rule of the common law that no person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice placed in jeopardy of fife or limb. It has been held, however, that from the necessity of the case there must be many exceptions to the rule. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Purchase, 2 </em>Pick. 521. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roby, 12 </em>Pick. 496, 502. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholes, </em>13 Allen, 554, 556. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCormick, </em>130 Mass. 61, 62. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>9 Wheat. 579. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>142 U. S. 148, 154, 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">It is manifest that we have no means of determining, as did the trial judge, the effect which the statement of counsel might reasonably have bad upon the minds of the jurors. If the judge, acting impartially, as we must assume he did, believed that the statement of counsel was likely to result in ah unjust verdict, we cannot say that bis action was without justification. Of course, he could not exercise the power vested in him to act arbitrarily or without good cause to believe that the action he took was necessary to prevent great injustice either to the Commonwealth or to the defendant. The power of the court is always to be used alike for the protection of the public and for the security of the defendant in his right to an impartial trial. It cannot be said as matter of law that the judge was not justified in dismissing the jury on the ground that the ends of justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>and public interest were likely to be defeated if the cas\u00e9 were allowed to proceed to a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\">In determining that no error of law appears for the reasons stated, it is unnecessary to decide whether G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 7, is applicable to the facts in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
