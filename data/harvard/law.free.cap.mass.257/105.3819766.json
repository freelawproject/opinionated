The place where the injury occurred as shown by the evidence was not on a sidewalk but on the part of the way designed for vehicular traffic \u00e1djacent to a rail of street railway tracks. There is no evidence of a breach of the statutory duty of the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to the alleged defect was that \u201cshe slipped on a patch of ice formed from water which had filled a saucer-shaped depression in the surface of the street.\u201d Another witness described the place as a \u201chole in. the pavement.\u201d There is nothing to indicate the size of the alleged \u201cdepression\u201d or \u201chole.\u201d The photographs of the plaintiff indicate a slight depression not amounting to a defect in the street. On the authority of <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>6 Cush. 524, <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>174 Mass. 181, and <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>256 Mass. 468, the plaintiff cannot recover. In view of the ground on which this decision rests, the other points argued need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
