No warning was given to the plaintiff of any danger. Two other passengers preceded her in leaving the car without injury. The record discloses no negligence on the part of the defendant. The condition of the highway had been unchanged for a long time and was nothing for which the defendant was responsible. The case is indistinguishable from <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Gardner, Westminster &amp; Fitchburg Street Railway, </em>193 Mass. 133, and is governed by its authority. This conclusion is supported in principle by <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>West End Street Railway, </em>161 Mass. 393, <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>182 Mass. 454, and <em>Kinnarney </em>v. <em>Milford &amp; Uxbridge Street Railway, </em>241 Mass. 127. The case is distinguishable from <em>Wakeley </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>217 Mass. 488. The numerous cases in other jurisdictions upon which the plaintiff relies cannot override the force of our own decisions. The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict ought to have been granted. The case seems to have been fully tried. The exceptions must be sustained and in accordance with G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 122, judgment is to be entered for the defendant. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
