T. and W. P. Dame, agents, would expire January 30, 1923. It requested the plaintiff to re-insure the property, \u201cmaking the insurance payable to this bank in case of loss,\u201d and \u201cinstruct the agent who renews this insurance that the new policies must be in our hands at least ten days before expiration, otherwise we shall have the property insured and decline to receive other renewals.\u201d The plaintiff also testified that on or about January 15,1923, he had a talk with John B. O\u2019Toole, the defendant\u2019s agent; that he handed the notice from the bank to O\u2019Toole and said to him, \u201cHere, Mr. O\u2019Toole, take care of this policy. It expires on the thirtieth, and a new policy be $1,000\u201d; and O\u2019Toole answered, \u201cI will take care .of it.\u201d The plaintiff further testified that at some time in the same month of January, O\u2019Toole handed to the plaintiff\u2019s bookkeeper in his (the plaintiff\u2019s) presence, at his store, a*n insurance policy in an envelope, and said, \u201cHere is your policy\u201d; that the plaintiff \u201cdid not look into the envelope to see what was in it, but knew there was a policy in it, and he caused the same to be sent ... to the Clinton Savings Bank . . . without examining it.\u201d This policy was written by the defendant and was dated February 1, 1923. It was in the Massachusetts standard form and purported to cover the premises in question against fire, for the sum of $1,000, commencing February 1, 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">On cross-examination the plaintiff stated that this policy must have been delivered to him on or about January 20, and he sent it to the bank the same day; that when O\u2019Toole delivered the policy he presented a bill for $30.40 premium, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>requesting immediate payment; that the plaintiff instructed his bookkeeper to send a check for the premium \"the first of the month.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\">John B. O\u2019Toole testified that the plaintiff came to his office January 22 and said, \u201cI want to have you put $1,000 on my block,\u201d and in reply to the question of O\u2019Toole, \"When do you want it to go on \u2014 the first of the month?\u201d the defendant replied, \"Yes\u201d; that the plaintiff told him to make the policy payable to the savings bank in case of loss; that there was no talk of the insurance expiring January 30, \"or any other day\u201d; that the plaintiff did not -show him the expiration notice from the bank; that he did not know the plaintiff had received such a notice; that the policy was delivered January 29 and was not inclosed in an envelope; that he said to the plaintiff, \"it doesn\u2019t go on until the first of the month and if you send me check the first of the month it will be all right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The premises were destroyed by a fire beginning about 2:45 o\u2019clock on the morning of January 31. The fire was well under control by six o\u2019clock that morning, but it burned for three days at intervals. The largest part of the damage was done before noon of February 1, 1923. The Norfolk Mutual Insurance Company policy was renewed by the Dame agency, and later the plaintiff collected insurance under this policy of renewal, and also $27,000 from other insurance companies. The plaintiff received a'notice dated January 31, of the cancellation of the policy of the defendant. In the Superior Court a verdict was directed for the defendant and the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">According to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony of his agreement with O\u2019Toole, he was to have a new policy of insurance in the sum of $1,000, O\u2019Toole agreeing to take care of it, and the plaintiff delivering to O\u2019Toole the notice showing that the Norfolk Mutual Insurance Company\u2019s policy expired January 30. He admitted that when O\u2019Toole delivered the policy, O\u2019Toole said, \"Here is your policy.\u201d Even if the plaintiff did not examine the envelope, he must have known it contained the policy he had contracted for, and he dealt with it as his own. He knew it was a policy of insurance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>and caused it to be sent, on the same day he received it, to the Clinton Savings Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\">On these facts the plaintiff cannot recover. The oral contract no longer subsisted when the written contract of insurance was delivered to the plaintiff. The written policy was received by the plaintiff without objection and forwarded by him to the mortgagee. The previous obligation under the oral contract was completed by performance when the policy was delivered, and, as shown by his acts, accepted by him. The result of this transaction was that thereafter the policy in writing set forth the rights and obligations of the plaintiff and defendant, and the previous oral agreement was at an end. He received the policy on January 20, according to his testimony, and without any request for further time to examine it sent it to the bank on the same day. He must be held to have accepted it and to have held it according to its terms, even if he did not read it. <em>Cass </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>236 Mass. 430, 433. <em>Urbaniak </em>v. <em>Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co. of Newark, </em>227 Mass. 132, 134. <em>Secoulsky </em>v. <em>Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. </em>223 Mass. 465, 466. The facts in <em>Monitor Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Buffam, </em>115 Mass. 343, make it inapplicable. The case at bar is governed by <em>Mowles </em>v. <em>Boston Ins. Co. </em>226 Mass. 426. On the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff he accepted the policy in fulfillment of the agreement to place a policy on the premises; although the prior policy expired January 30, he made no objection to the new policy beginning February 1, and by his own acts, as shown by the evidence, he must be held to nave accepted this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
