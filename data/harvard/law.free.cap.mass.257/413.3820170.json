That was in substance a request for a directed verdict. Under Common Law Rule 44 of the Superior Court (1923) the question whether the court should order a verdict must be raised by motion and not by a request for instructions. That is a valid rule and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>must be followed. The question argued by the defendant is not open on this record. <em>Carp </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>251 Mass. 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">If, however, the merits be considered, there was ample evidence of gross negligence on the part of the defendant causative in injuring the plaintiff. <em>Massaletti </em>v. <em>Fitzroy, </em>228 Mass. 487. <em>Altman </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>231 Mass. 588, 591. The case is quite distinguishable from <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>246 Mass. 518, <em>Shriear </em>v. <em>Feigelson, </em>248 Mass. 432, and similar decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Exceptions not argued of course are treated as waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
