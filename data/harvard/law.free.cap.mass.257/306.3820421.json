The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff and the case is here on the defendants\u2019 exceptions which recite all the material evidence. It is contended that the plaintiff was careless and that no negligence of the defendants\u2019 employee was shown. If not expressly conceded, it was not disputed, that the plaintiff, a boy six years old, drawing a sled, and a playmate aged six, rolling a bicycle tire, were travelling on Jerome Avenue in the town of Auburn going from his companion\u2019s home to the plaintiff\u2019s house. There were no sidewalks and the part used for travel which was about nine or ten feet in width was on the day of the accident filled with heavy snow from two to two and a half feet in depth which had been there for a week or more. By reason of these conditions there were two large ruts eight or nine inches deep, which were used by vehicles. A light snow also was falling and at the place of contact the street ran uphill. The boys were walking between the ruts when the truck went by. The evidence however as to what followed was contradictory. The driver of the truck, a witness for the defendants, testified that as he drove over the hill he passed \"these two boys.\u201d The plaintiff with a sled, who was on the right of the automobile, said, \"Do you want a push?\u201d The truck did not stop or run back until it was backed into another street \u201cto get off the road so if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>anything else was going up\u201d; that upon hearing the plaintiff \u201ccrying out down the road\u201d he \u201cwent down there\u201d and found the plaintiff lying across on the right hand side as he was going up, about twelve to eighteen inches away from the rut, and asked the plaintiff\u2019s companion, \u201cHow did he get hurt?\u201d The reply was, \u201cHe was running, pushing against the machine, and he slipped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">If this were the only evidence the plaintiff had no case. His own conduct caused his injuries. But the jury also were to pass upon the testimony of the boys. If they were believed, the plaintiff neither ran with, nor pushed the truck. It could be found that after it had passed they travelled behind, walking between the ruts when the truck suddenly stopped and without any warning backed six to ten feet running over the plaintiff\u2019s leg. The jury could say that the driver knew or in the exercise of ordinary care should have known that the plaintiff was in the rear of the truck, and that he must use the way as it was then whether he continued up the hill or decided to return to his own house. The jury also could consider the driver\u2019s further statements \u201cthat it was tough going for the snow was slippery; that the ruts were simply snow, and that there was ice down at the bottom; that there was wet snow on top. ... it was a pretty good climb that day for the truck\u201d and he \u201cshifted from second into low; that it doesn\u2019t take long to shift into second; that his truck did not slide back when he shifted into low . . . that he threw in his clutch and pulled the lever and went on; that he couldn\u2019t see how it could slide back. 'Q. Well you could slide back if you were not able to get it directly into low? A. Yes, if you left it go and didn\u2019t catch it it would go back.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiff had the right to assume that the truck would continue to move forward and not backward, and that if it moved backward the horn would be blown. If the plaintiff\u2019s version of what happened was believed, it is settled by <em>Dowd </em>v. <em>Tighe, </em>209 Mass. 464, and <em>Millay </em>v. <em>Town Taxi, Inc. </em>242 Mass. 314, that the questions posited were for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
