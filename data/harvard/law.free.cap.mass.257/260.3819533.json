This motion was denied, and the defendant excepted. The defendant then moved for a bill of particulars. This motion was denied. The defendant did not except to this ruling. The district attorney then stated that he would ask for a conviction on the ground that the defendant was carrying a revolver \u201cunder the cushion of the rear seat of an automobile driven by the defendant.\u201d This statement was offered in lieu of a bill of particulars. The defendant\u2019s counsel agreed that this was satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The evidence tended to show that the defendant was arrested while driving an automobile registered in his name, \u201cfor other violations of the law\u201d; that while searching the automobile the complainant found the revolver under the back seat thereof. The bill of exceptions further recites there was additional evidence from which it could be inferred that the revolver was carried by the defendant \u201cin his automobile in violation of the statute in question.\u201d The defend-' ant was convicted in the Superior Court. He moved \u201cto arrest judgment,\u201d because the evidence \u201cdoes not bear out the complaint or any part thereof.\u201d The motion was denied and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">An objection to a complaint for a formal defect apparent on its face must be taken before judgment is ordered by the District Court. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 17. The defendant went to trial in the District Court without objection to the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>by demurrer or motion to quash. It was not until the case was in the Superior Court that he moved to dismiss the complaint. This motion came too late. Matters in abatement are waived by going to trial in the District Court without objection to the complaint. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markarian, </em>250 Mass. 211, 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The complaint refers to St. 1925, c. 284, \u00a7 10. This statute contains five sections. Section 5 strikes out G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10, as previously amended by St. 1923, c. 248, \u00a7 1, and inserts in place thereof a new \u00a7 10. The defendant was satisfied with the statement made by the district attorney that Ife intended to show that the defendant was carrying a revolver under the seat of an automobile driven by the defendant. The defendant, therefore, understood the charge, and was not prejudiced by being unable to prepare his defence. G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 34. Section 35 of this chapter of the General Laws also provides that the defendant shall not be acquitted on the ground of variance between the allegation and the proof, if the essential elements of the crime are correctly stated, unless thereby prejudiced in his defence; and the defendant is not to be acquitted because of an \u201cimmaterial mistake in the indictment.\u201d The defendant was in no way harmed by the allegation of the complaint that he was charged with carrying a revolver in violation of \u00a7 10 of the statute. He knew the nature of the charge, and by answering in the affirmative the question of the court, if the statement of the District Attorney was satisfactory, he showed that he was not prejudiced in his defence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diamond, </em>248 Mass. 511, 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">There was evidence that the defendant carried the revolver in his automobile in violation of the statute; the defendant was not injured by the mistake in the complaint, and did not seasonably file an objection to the same. As the defendant was the owner and driver of the automobile in which the revolver was found, he could be convicted. There was no error in denying the motion in arrest of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
