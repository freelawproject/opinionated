We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The relevant facts are not disputed and the matter was ripe for disposition.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brill v.

Rodriguez was injured during the course of his employment at Sabert Corporation in 2012. Liberty was the workers' compensation carrier for Sabert. Rodriguez retained\n   the Gill &amp; Chamas law firm (law firm) to represent him in his workers' compensation matter and the third-party action against the tortfeasor. Rodriguez entered into an Agreement to Provide Legal Services in 2002 that provided the law firm would receive a fee, under the 2012 version of\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:21-7(c), as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (1) 33[.33]% of the first $ 500,000 recovered;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (2) 30% on the next $ 500,000 recovered;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (3) 25% on the next $ 500,000 recovered;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (4) 20% on the next $ 500,000 recovered; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (5) on all amounts recovered in excess of the above by application for a reasonable fee in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) hereof.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A settlement was achieved on behalf of Rodriguez with the tortfeasor for $ 1.2 million dollars. The parties stipulated that Rodriguez's workers' compensation benefits totaled $ 148,590.40.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Liberty asserted its rights to reimbursement of its lien under N.J.S.A. 34:15-40(b) (Section 40) from the third-party settlement. Section 40 makes clear that the remedies provided the employee by the workers' compensation laws do not preclude an employee from pursuing damages from a tortfeasor, referred to in Section 40 as the \"third person\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   In the event that the employee or his dependents shall recover and be paid from the said third person or his insurance carrier, any sum in release or in judgment on account of his or its liability to the injured employee or his dependents, the liability\n   of the employer under this statute thereupon shall be only such as is hereinafter in this section provided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In this statutory scheme, Section 40 then provides for reimbursement to the employer or its insurance carrier when an employee receives a recovery from the third person in the following way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   If the sum recovered by the employee or his dependents from the third person or his insurance carrier is equivalent to or greater than the liability of the employer or his insurance carrier under this statute, the employer or his insurance carrier shall be released from such liability and shall be entitled to be reimbursed, as hereinafter provided, for the medical expenses incurred and compensation payments theretofore paid to the injured employee or his dependents less employee's expenses of suit and attorney's fee as hereinafter defined.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The law firm sent Liberty a check for $ 98,310.26, net of its attorney's fees, calculated at 33.33% and costs, denoting it as \"payment in full.\" The $ 98,310.26 check amounted to only 66.67% of the $ 148,590.40 in workers' compensation benefits, and not 69.44%. Liberty disagreed with that calculation, and asserted the law firm was only entitled to an attorney fee calculated at 30.56%, or the sum of $ 102,431.17, because the overall percentage paid by Rodriguez in fees was 30.56%, plus $ 750 for expenses of suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In arriving at its calculation, Liberty argued that in the third-party action, the law firm was entitled to 33.33% of the first $ 500,000 recovered, or $ 166,666.67; 30% of the next $ 500,000 recovered, or $ 150,000;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   and 25% of the remaining $ 200,000 recovered, or $ 50,000, for a total fee of $ 366,666.67. The third-party counsel fee equaled 30.56% of Rodriguez's $ 1.2 million settlement. Liberty filed an order to show cause and verified complaint on behalf of Sabert Corporation seeking reimbursement\n   of the difference, $ 4120.91, claiming that the percentage should be calculated based upon the actual fee paid and not the settlement recovered. Rodriguez opposed the application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial judge determined that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [Rodriguez] paid $ 366,666.67 in attorney's fees, which constitutes 30.56[%] of his settlement. This 30.56[%] is less than the 33[.33] limit of the statute and therefore represents the percentage of attorney's fees that [Rodriguez] is responsible for.\n   <em>\n    Caputo v.

Because Section 40 was enacted prior to the implementation of the sliding scale contingent fee,\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:21-7(c), Rodriguez argues that case\n   law is precedential on this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Liberty argues that Rodriguez ignores the fact that the total percentage of fees paid equaled 30.56% of the $ 1.2 million settlement ($ 1,200,000 divided by $ 366,666.67 equals 30.56%), and not at the sliding scale rate of 33.33% applicable to the first level of the sliding scale of\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:21-7, which is the first $ 500,000 recovered, relying upon\n   <em>\n    McMullen\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We are convinced that the arguments raised on appeal lack merit.
