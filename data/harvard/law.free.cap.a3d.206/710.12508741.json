These consolidated cases raise issues concerning Vermont's anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) statute, 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1041. Plaintiff Garrett Cornelius filed suit alleging invasion of privacy by newspaper, The Chronicle, after newspaper published two articles containing information about plaintiff. In a series of orders, the trial court granted newspaper's motions to strike the claims under the anti-SLAPP statute and awarded newspaper a small fraction of the attorney's fees it sought. Plaintiff appeals the court's orders striking his claims and newspaper appeals the amount of attorney's fees. We conclude that the claims were properly stricken under the anti-SLAPP statute and that the court erred in limiting the attorney's fees award. Therefore, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. Plaintiff's claims stem from two articles written by newspaper. In July 2016, newspaper published one article under two titles. The article was entitled \"Cornelius brothers threaten parole officer\" on the newspaper website and entitled \"Cornelius brothers deemed a possible threat\" in the print version of the paper. The article explained that the State Police Vermont Intelligence Center (VIC) had cautioned local law enforcement about \"a possible threat from the Cornelius brothers, because of what they say is a history of erratic and violent behavior.\" It quoted the safety bulletin as follows: \" 'Both brothers have lengthy criminal involvements and are currently involved in active and ongoing investigations involving unlawful trespass, violation of court orders, and violation of several restraining orders,' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   and \" 'Although no direct threats to law enforcement have been made, their behavior has become increasingly violent, erratic and unpredictable.' \" The article was lengthy and reported about past behavior of plaintiff's brother, including criminal charges. It also described the brothers' involvement in the killing of Isaac Hunt, which the state's attorney determined was justified. In November 2016, The Chronicle published the second article at issue, which was entitled \"Garret Cornelius accused of aiding brother,\" and described plaintiff's arraignment on criminal charges for aiding in the escape of his brother. The article was based on the police affidavit supporting the information and the reporter's own observations at the arraignment. This article described plaintiff as \"loud and combative\" during the proceeding and stated that plaintiff \"offered verbal expletives to just about any officer of the court tasked with handling his case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Plaintiff filed suit against the newspaper alleging that the newspaper articles placed plaintiff in a false light.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to the July 2016 article, plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the article was incorrect because plaintiff did not have any criminal history, a history of erratic and violent behavior, or lengthy criminal involvements, and was not the subject of ongoing investigations or exhibiting escalating or increasingly unpredictable behavior. Plaintiff also alleged that the article falsely represented that he was argumentative with police during previous interactions and that he possessed a .22 pistol. As to the November 2016 article, plaintiff alleged that he was not \"loud and combative\" and did not offer \"verbal expletives to just about any officer of the court tasked with handling his case.\" Plaintiff asserted that he was respectful and courteous, and the false representations of his behavior were harmful to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Newspaper moved to dismiss the suit and to strike the complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Newspaper claimed that both articles were related to the newspaper's exercise of free speech and involved topics of public concern, and that there was reasonable factual support for the assertions made in the articles. As to the June 2016 article, newspaper delineated the source for each fact in the article and attached supporting affidavits and exhibits. As to the November 2016 article, newspaper explained that the bulk of the information in the article was derived directly from the affidavit accompanying the charges filed against plaintiff and from the personal observations of a newspaper reporter in the room for the arraignment and again attached an affidavit and exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. As to counts I and II, pertaining to the June 2016 article, the court granted the motion to strike.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court concluded\n   that the article contained matter connected to a public issue because the article concerned matters related to public safety and criminal investigations. The court noted that information in the article came from the VIC Bulletin, court records, and public Facebook posts made by plaintiff and his brother. The court further explained that the information about the killing of Isaac Hunt was a matter of public concern and plaintiff voluntarily put himself in the public eye by providing interviews to the media on the topic. The court concluded that plaintiff failed to show that he was actually injured by the articles or that the statements in it were \"devoid of any reasonable factual support and any arguable basis in law.\" 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1041(e)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. As to count III, pertaining to the November 2016 article, the court initially granted newspaper's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, V.R.C.P. 12(b)(6), and denied the motion to strike as moot. The court concluded that plaintiff had failed to plead a prima facie case because the opinion statements in the article could not be proven false, an element of a false-light claim. Following newspaper's motion to reconsider, the court granted newspaper's motion to strike count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Newspaper sought attorney's fees in conjunction with its motions to strike. 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1041(f)(1) (\"If the court grants the special motion to strike, the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney's fees to the defendant.\"). Newspaper attached an affidavit and the bills related to the litigation, seeking $34,185.33 in fees and expenses. The court initially granted newspaper's motion for attorney's fees. Following plaintiff's motion to reconsider, the court denied attorney's fees, reasoning that newspaper, a corporation with litigation insurance, was not the ordinary citizen the fee-shifting provision was meant to cover. The court subsequently revised this order, granting newspaper limited fees. The court reasoned that because newspaper had litigation insurance, it did not incur costs in excess of the deductible and therefore granted $5000, the amount of the deductible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I. Application of the Anti-SLAPP Statute\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. We first address plaintiff's argument that his suit did not fit within the bounds of the anti-SLAPP statute. The anti-SLAPP statute attempts \"to define the proper intersection between two constitutional rights-a defendant's right to free speech and petition and a plaintiff's right to petition and free access to the courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Felis v. Downs Rachlin Martin PLLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n    2015 VT 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 41,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n    200 Vt. 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n    133 A.3d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The statute contains a two-step process. A defendant may move to strike a complaint in \"an action arising from the defendant's exercise, in connection with a public issue, of the right to freedom of speech or to petition the government for redress of grievances under the U.S. or Vermont Constitution.\" 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1041(a). If the defendant satisfies the threshold requirement, the court must grant the motion \"unless the plaintiff shows that: (A) the defendant's exercise of his or her right to freedom of speech and to petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support and any arguable basis in law; and (B) the defendant's acts caused actual injury to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 1041(e)(1). The question of whether \u00a7 1041 applies is a question of law that we review de novo. See\n   <em>\n    Garretson v. Post\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051969\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/156/1508/\">\n    156 Cal.App.4th 1508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20230\">\n    68 Cal.Rptr.3d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 235 (2007) (explaining that trial court's ruling on SLAPP motion is reviewed under de novo standard of review);\n   <em>\n    Baseball Club of Tacoma v. SDL Baseball Partners, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237152\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/187/519/\">\n    187 Wash.App. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=348%20P.3d%201283\">\n    348 P.3d 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1286 (2015) (stating that trial court's ruling on special motion to strike is reviewed de novo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. In considering the proper scope of the anti-SLAPP statute, this Court emphasized that it would be inappropriate to adopt an overly broad interpretation of the statute because that would limit access to the courts.\n   <em>\n    Felis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n    2015 VT 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 41,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n    200 Vt. 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n    133 A.3d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, this Court held that in all cases involving the anti-SLAPP statute, the activity must meet the public-issue requirement of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 52 (\"We conclude that the 'in connection with a public issue' requirement of 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1041(a) must be met in any motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute, regardless of the type of activity.\"). The exercise of free speech in connection with a public issue includes, among other definitions: \"any written or oral statement made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law\" and \"any other statement or conduct concerning a public issue or an issue of public interest which furthers the exercise of the constitutional right of freedom of speech or the constitutional right to petition the government for redress of grievances.\" 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1041(i)(1), (4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10. We conclude that the articles in this case were exercises of free speech and connected to a public issue because they concerned public safety, law enforcement activity, possible criminal behavior, and the reporting of arrests. As an initial matter, we conclude that newspaper was exercising a right of free speech by publishing the articles. See\n   <em>\n    Braun v. Chronicle Publ'g Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"452945\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/52/1036/\">\n    52 Cal.App.4th 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2058\">\n    61 Cal.Rptr.2d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 63 (1997) (explaining that news reporting \"\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   free speech\"). We have not yet had occasion to delve too deeply into the meaning of \"in connection with a public issue\" as used in the statute. In\n   <em>\n    Felis\n   </em>\n   , this Court held that valuation of a party's business in the context of a divorce proceeding was not a matter of public concern.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n    2015 VT 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n    200 Vt. 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n    133 A.3d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although it is unpublished and nonprecedential, it is useful to consider an order by a panel of this Court because it is particularly on point.\n   <em>\n    Chandler v. Rutland Herald Publ'g\n   </em>\n   , No. 2015-265,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207628687\">\n    2015 WL 7628687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Vt. Nov. 19, 2015) (unpub. mem.), http://www.vermontjudiciary.org/sites/default/files/documents/eo15-265.pdf [https://perma.cc/XNZ6-79VH].\n   <em>\n    Chandler\n   </em>\n   held that matters relating to criminal charges were of public concern, explaining that \"[a]llegations of public corruption clearly present a matter of public interest, as do the results of an investigation into such allegations, including criminal charges being lodged against the person who made the allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *2. The case explained that the public and the media have a constitutional right of access to information about law enforcement and crime activities.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Although this holding is nonprecedential, we conclude it is persuasive and reaffirm today that matters connected to law enforcement investigation, public safety, and crime in the community are of public concern. As this Court has recognized in other contexts, under the First Amendment \"the public and the media have a constitutional right of access to information relating to the activities of law enforcement officers and to information concerning crime in the community.\"\n   <em>\n    Caledonian Record Publ'g Co. v. Walton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4799244\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/154/15/#p21\">\n    154 Vt. 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4799244\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/154/15/#p21\">\n    573 A.2d 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 299 (1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11. Therefore, we consider whether the two articles met this standard. Counts\n   I and II of plaintiff's complaint relate to an article published in July 2016 entitled both \"Cornelius brothers threaten parole officer,\" and \"Cornelius brothers deemed possible threat.\" The article repeated information from the confidential VIC bulletins regarding law enforcement's assessment that the brothers presented a possible threat. The article also recounted that plaintiff's brother posted a photograph of the head of Probation and Parole in Newport on his Facebook page, stating that the Cornelius brothers were looking for him and asking people with information about his whereabouts to call them. The article reported that the probation officer considered this a threat. The article then listed the criminal history of plaintiff's brother. The article also recounted that plaintiff had posted a message on the Newport Police Department's Facebook page, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Everyone in this state, INCLUDING me and my brother inherently have the constitutional right to fight our asses off defending our lives and defending our right to live FREE. We also have the constitutional right to have, reside on, and protect our property. We have the constitutional right to pursue and HAVE happiness. Our right to ENJOY LIFE is also constitutionally protected, and that by the definition of \"unalienable\" ....NOBODY CAN TAKE THOSE RIGHTS AWAY, NOR CAN YOU GIVE THEM UP. You f-DISGUSTING and CONSPIRING DIRTBAGS. You know who you are. I am done being patient with the LAWLESS and UNENDING WAR you have engaged in against us. You should have known better than to blatantly ignore the fundamental laws of the land, and you certainly should have known better than to F-WITH MY FAMILY. But you have, and you did...and you continue to do so. That was a bad idea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition, the article recounted the killing of Isaac Hunt and the state's attorney's determination that it was justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12. Plaintiff asserts that some information in the article was not public and was false. He asserts that the VIC bulletin was incorrect in that he had no criminal history and that he did not exhibit violent, criminal, or escalating behavior. He also claims that the characterization in the article that he threatened the parole officer was inaccurate and not a public matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13. We conclude that the article presented matters connected to a public issue. Given the connection to public safety and the operation of law enforcement, and especially given that defendant himself brought the reported-on issues to public attention by posting threats on the Newport Police Department's Facebook page, the public had an interest in law enforcement's action of characterizing plaintiff and his brother's actions as threatening and in the information that led to that characterization. The public also had an interest in the statements that plaintiff and his brother made on public Facebook accounts about law enforcement and the probation officer, particularly given that the brothers had previously placed themselves in the public light by providing interviews to the media about the killing of Isaac Hunt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14. We are unpersuaded by plaintiff's assertion that because the VIC bulletins are labeled confidential, the information contained in them cannot be connected to a public issue. The designation of the VIC bulletins as confidential does not make the subject matter they contain any less connected to a public issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Braun\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2058\">\n    61 Cal.Rptr.2d at 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that although investigation was closed to public, topic and event were still connected to public issue).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15. Because newspaper met its burden under the statute, the burden shifted to plaintiff to demonstrate that newspaper's exercise of its freedom of speech \"was devoid of any reasonable factual support and any arguable basis in law.\" 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1041(e)(1)(A). Plaintiff's assertion that information repeated from the VIC bulletin was inaccurate-including that he does not have a history of criminal behavior or erratic and violent behavior-is not enough to show a lack of reasonable factual support. Newspaper did not independently make these assertions, but attributed the statements to the VIC bulletin, which did contain those assertions. Moreover, the article's characterization that the brothers had threatened the probation officer stemmed from more than the VIC bulletin; it was directly related to the public Facebook post in which the brothers singled out the head of probation and the officer's personal statement that he considered it a threat. The characterization of the bizarre and escalating behavior was also supported by plaintiff's public post on the Newport Police Facebook page. Therefore, all the statements challenged by plaintiff in the June 2016 article had reasonable factual support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16. Turning to the November 2016 article, plaintiff does not challenge the fact that the article contained information connected to a public issue. The article described plaintiff's arraignment for aiding the escape of his brother. As explained above, the public has an interest in criminal charges and criminal proceedings and the article detailing plaintiff's arraignment was exactly this type of proceeding. In addition, plaintiff fails to demonstrate that the statements he challenges-that he was \"loud and combative\" and \"offered verbal expletives to just about any officer of the court tasked with handling his case\"-were devoid of reasonable support. The reporter was present in the room during the arraignment and filed an affidavit confirming his observations. Although plaintiff may disagree with the reporter's characterization of plaintiff's behavior, the statements made by the reporter, based on personal observations and reflecting primarily the reporter's perceptions and opinions, were not devoid of a reasonable basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17. As noted above, the court initially dismissed count III of the complaint, which pertained to the November 2016 article, for lack of a prima facie case. On appeal, plaintiff argues that this order was in error. Having concluded that the motion to strike was properly granted, we need not reach this argument. We have previously held that granting a motion to dismiss does not moot the motion to strike because the issue of attorney's fees remains a live controversy. See\n   <em>\n    Felis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n    2015 VT 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n    200 Vt. 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461447\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/200/465/\">\n    133 A.3d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that grant of motion to dismiss did not moot consideration of motion to strike because attorney's fees remained live issue). In contrast, granting the motion\n   to strike does moot the motion to dismiss because there is no further relief that the Court could grant.

The court declined to award the entire amount of attorney's fees requested by newspaper, but did not do so based on its discretionary authority to determine what amount was reasonable. Instead, the court concluded that as a matter of law newspaper was entitled only to the amount of its litigation-insurance deductible of $5000.
