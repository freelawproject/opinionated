(American). We affirm, based on A201's plain language, its evident goal to transfer the risk of construction-related losses to insurers and preclude lawsuits among contracting parties, and persuasive out-of-state authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For purposes of ACE's motion, the following facts are undisputed. ACE's insured, Equinox Development Corporation (Equinox Development), contracted in March 2012 with Grace Construction Management Company, LLC (Grace Construction), to build the \"core and shell\" of a new health club in Summit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   American was a plumbing subcontractor. Sometime in April 2013, after the work under the contract was completed, a water main failed and flooded the health club.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When the flood occurred, ACE provided Equinox Holdings and its subsidiaries, including Equinox Development, with blanket all-risk insurance including multiple forms of coverage for its operations in the United States. The policy term was September 2012 to September 2013, with coverage of $ 32 million per occurrence. Among other coverages, the policy insured Equinox's interest in its real and personal property, including \"[p]roperty while in the course of construction and/or during erection, assembly and/or installation.\" It also included any interests of contractors and sub-contractors for which Equinox would assume liability by contract. Regarding subrogation, the policy stated, \"In the event of any payment under this policy, except where subrogation rights have been waived, the Insurer shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all the Insured's rights of recovery therefore.\" ACE had provided Equinox with similar coverage, with a limit of $ 30 million, the preceding annual period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ACE paid Equinox almost $ 1.2 million for the net damages to its real and personal property. Less than $ 8,000 was for repairs to the \"core and shell\" construction covered by the A201 contract. The rest was apparently for damage to internal construction, furnishings and equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ACE eventually filed suit against American, claiming it was at fault for the water-main break and seeking recovery of its payments to Equinox. American promptly answered, invoking A201's subrogation-waiver provisions. Soon thereafter, American filed its motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted, relying mainly on an unpublished federal district court opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We review the trial court's order de novo, applying the same standard as the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Henry v.

In broad terms, A201 requires the owner and contractor to procure, respectively, property and liability insurance; and requires the owner and contractor and its subcontractors (and sub-subcontractors, agents and employees) to waive all rights against each other for damages covered by the required property insurance policy. A201 also extends the subrogation waiver to certain other forms of insurance that the owner may procure at its own option for losses during and after construction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Specifically, the contract requires an owner to procure \"builder's risk 'all-risk' \" insurance for the benefit of itself and its contractors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A201 \u00a7 11.3.1.

The contractor must obtain insurance to protect itself from claims arising out of its operations or those of its subcontractors, agents or employees. A201 \u00a7 11.1.1.5.

The waiver extension applies to two forms of insurance policies, which section 11.3.5 describes in terms of when they are procured, what they\n   cover, and their relation to other policies. The first is an insurance policy procured \"during the Project construction period,\" which covers real or personal property at or adjacent to the Project site, and is \"separate\" from the policy insuring the Project. A201 \u00a7 11.3.5. The second is an insurance policy provided \"after final payment,\" which covers the completed Project, and is \"other than\" the policy that insured the project during construction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20A.2d%20646\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Section 11.3.5 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    If during the Project construction period the Owner insures properties, real or personal or both, at or adjacent to the site by property insurance under policies separate from those insuring the Project\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    if after final payment, property insurance is to be provided on the completed Project through a policy or policies other than those insuring the Project during the construction period\n   </em>\n   , the Owner shall waive all rights in accordance with the terms of Section 11.3.7 for damages caused by fire or other causes of loss covered by this separate property insurance. All separate policies shall provide this waiver of subrogation by endorsement or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [ (Emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We turn now to ACE's claim on appeal. At bottom, ACE argues that its claim against American is not the kind that A201 subjects to a subrogation waiver. ACE contends that the subrogation waiver under section 11.3.7 has a spatial limit, applying only to claims for damage to the Work itself but not adjacent property, as well as a temporal limit, applying only to claims arising before construction is complete. Since the bulk of the water damage affected not the health club's \"core and shell\" but its internal construction and furnishings, and since the claim here arose after the Work was completed, ACE concludes that section 11.3.7 does not restrict it from suing American.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Regarding section 11.3.5, which expressly applies the subrogation waiver to certain post-completion insurance, ACE contends that its insurance policy was not \"other than\" a policy that insured the Project during construction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Noting that the record\n   does not disclose the exact date construction began and ended, ACE contends that its 2012-2013 policy simply extended its 2011-2012 policy and was thus\n   not a policy \"other than\" the one that insured the construction project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, ACE contends that even if its policy qualified as post-completion coverage governed by section 11.3.5, that section refers back to section 11.3.7-\"the Owner shall waive all rights in accordance with the terms of Section 11.3.7\"-and section 11.3.7 does not apply to claims for damage to non-Work property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We are unpersuaded by these arguments. ACE misconstrues the basic structure of the two subrogation-waiver provisions. Section 11.3.7 applies the waiver to any insured damage, whether occurring during or after construction, whether to the Work, to the Project, or to other insured property - so long as the policy covering the damage falls within one of the two categories identified: \"property insurance obtained pursuant to this Section 11.3\" or \"other property insurance applicable to the Work.\" Augmenting section 11.3.7, section 11.3.5 extends the waiver even to damage insured by a discrete policy. Thus, the waiver applies \"[i]f during the Project construction period the Owner insures properties, real or personal or both, at or adjacent to the site by property\n   insurance under policies\n   <em>\n    separate from\n   </em>\n   those insuring the Project.\" (Emphasis added). The waiver also applies \"if after final payment, property insurance is to be provided on the completed Project through a policy or policies\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   those insuring the Project during the construction period.\" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   ACE's blanket all-risk policy fell within both categories of coverage subject to section 11.3.7. Its builder's risk coverage constituted \"property insurance obtained pursuant to this section 11.3\" because it met the builder's risk insurance requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Comm'rs v.

Section 11.3.5 extends the subrogation waiver to damage covered by a policy \"separate from those insuring the Project\" that covers \"properties, real or personal or both, at or adjacent to the site.\" It would be absurd to extend the waiver to damage to non-Project property only if the policy covering it were completely \"separate from\" the policy that the owner is required to obtain. As the Nebraska Supreme Court observed, considering the identical provisions of A201-1997, \"We see no reason why the parties would intend a different result when, instead of purchasing two separate policies, the owner relied on one policy covering both the Work and the non-Work property.\"\n   <em>\n    Lexington Ins.

As the AIA's commentary to section 11.3.7 explains: \"The purpose of the required property insurance is to transfer the risk of insured losses from the owner and contractor to the insurance company.

The commentary states, \"[Section 11.3.5]\n   <em>\n    extends\n   </em>\n   the provisions for waiver of subrogation to other property insurance the owner may purchase. Such policies may cover property at or adjacent to the project, or they may replace the property insurance that was in effect on the work during construction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20N.E.2d%20524\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Describing section 11.3.5 as an extension implies that its purpose is to fill the gaps left by section 11.3.7 by continuing the waiver for any property and for any period that the owner's required or Work-related insurance may not cover but that it nonetheless insures through a separate policy. Together, the two provisions ensure a seamless waiver that shields the contracting parties from suit by subrogees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We reject ACE's argument that applying the subrogation waiver here is inconsistent with the contractor's obligation to obtain liability insurance. ACE contends the liability insurance requirement would be unnecessary if the subrogation waiver shields the contractor from suit by the owner's insurer. We are unpersuaded. The contract expressly recognizes that the subrogation waiver takes precedence over the contractor's insurance obligation. Section 11.3.7 states that the \"waiver of subrogation shall be effective as to a person or entity even though that person or entity would otherwise have a duty of indemnification, contractual or otherwise ....\"\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lexington Ins.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=749%20N.W.2d%20124\">\n    749 N.W.2d at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the identical provision in A201-1997 in rejecting a similar argument);\n   <em>\n    Chadwick v.

The liability insurance would also provide a source of compensation to injured third parties, who might otherwise seek remedies from the owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In sum, notwithstanding that most of the damage affected non-Work property and occurred after construction was completed, the subrogation waiver bars ACE's action against American, since its blanket all-risk insurance satisfied A201's requirements and covered the Work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The AIA revises the A201 contract every ten years.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Am.
