Rae contends that the court erred in finding that he had committed \"[t]hree or more acts\" of harassment pursuant to 5 M.R.S. \u00a7 4651(2)(A) (2018). Although we agree that there were not three or more acts of harassment, we affirm the judgment because the facts as found by the court are sufficient to prove that Rae's actions constituted criminal mischief, which can stand alone as a \"single act\" of harassment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 4651(2)(C) (2018) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 806(1)(A) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b62] A trust controlled by Rae's family purchased property abutting Allen's home in Belfast. Thereafter, a boundary dispute arose between Rae and Allen. Both parties claim to own a strip of land approximately twenty-feet wide situated between Allen's yard and what is now a garage on the trust's property. Despite attempts to resolve the dispute, including numerous visits from local law enforcement, the strip of land remained, at the time of the hearing, a source of considerable tension between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b63] On April 24, 2018, Allen filed for a protection from harassment order pursuant to 5 M.R.S. \u00a7 4652, alleging that Rae had harassed her. On May 14, 2018, the court held a contested hearing and heard testimony from both parties. The court found that Allen's testimony was credible and that Rae's testimony was \"not particularly credible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b64] Allen testified that she parked her boat trailer on the disputed strip of land to guard against what she believed was Rae's unlawful claim to the property. Rae testified that he asked Allen to remove the boat multiple times so he could more conveniently move construction equipment onto his property; when Allen refused, Rae responded by saying, \"if [the boat is] not gone by Sunday, I will move it for you.\" When Rae attempted to move the boat, he discovered that Allen had placed a boot lock on one of the tires of the boat trailer, rendering it immobile. Allen testified that she personally observed Rae \"cut\" and \"slice\" the valve stem off the boat trailer's tire. Rae denied cutting the valve stem but admitted he attempted to move the boat trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b65] The court found, based on Allen's testimony, that Rae committed an act of \"fear and intimidation\" by cutting off a tire valve stem on Allen's boat trailer, which Allen parked in the disputed area, and that Rae did it \"to be ... mean and harass [Allen] because of this dispute.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b66] After the hearing, the District Court entered an order of protection from harassment in favor of Allen and against Rae for one year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 4655(1), (2). The court made clear that it was not resolving the ownership of the disputed property or determining the boundary lines of the properties. Rae filed a motion for additional findings of fact and conclusions of law and a motion to amend the judgment; both motions were summarily denied. Rae timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b67] \"We review the trial court's findings of fact for clear error and will affirm those findings if there is competent evidence in the record to support them, even if the evidence might support alternative findings of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Preston v.

A person commits criminal mischief when he intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly damages, destroys, or tampers with the property of another \"having no reasonable grounds to believe [he] has a right to do so.\" 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 806(1)(A). In a protection from harassment proceeding, a court need only find that a person committed one of the enumerated statutory offenses by a preponderance of the evidence to make a finding of harassment under section 4651(2)(C).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patane v.

Allen testified that she personally observed Rae \"slice[ ] the valve off\" and \"cut it off to try and get the tire to go down so he could get the boot lock off.\" Although Rae denied damaging Allen's boat or attempting to cut the valve stem, he admitted that he attempted to move the boat but was unable to do so because of the boot lock. The court specifically found Allen's testimony credible and Rae's testimony not credible. Because a trial court is not bound to accept testimony and evidence as fact, and because determinations of the weight and credibility of testimony and evidence are \"squarely in the province of the fact-finder,\" we will not second-guess the trial court's credibility assessment of conflicting\n   testimony.\n   <em>\n    Sloan v.

Whether Rae harassed Allen does not turn on whether Rae had the right to remove Allen's boat from the property that he claims the trust owns, but rather on\n   <em>\n    the manner\n   </em>\n   in which he attempted to remove it. \"[E]ven when an individual may have a legal right to do something, the manner in which a legal act is performed can constitute harassment.\"\n   <em>\n    Cates,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8336250\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/916/941/\">\n    2007 ME 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8336250\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/916/941/\">\n    916 A.2d 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patane,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9516865\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/792/1086/\">\n    2002 ME 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9516865\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/792/1086/\">\n    792 A.2d 1086\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b612] Regardless of whether Rae had a valid property interest in the disputed strip of land,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   either personally or through the trust, his act of cutting the valve stem in an effort to remove the boat from the property qualifies as a single act of criminal mischief that constitutes an act of harassment. 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 806(1)(A) ; 5 M.R.S. \u00a7 4651(2)(C). This dispute should have been resolved by a reasonable and rational conversation between Rae and Allen or by Rae seeking a declaratory judgment or other court-ordered remedy to establish title and ownership to the disputed strip of land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   HJELM, J., with whom GORMAN, J., joins, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b613] I agree with the Court's conclusion that the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to support a finding that Mark Rae had engaged in an act against Laurie Allen that rises to the level of \"harassment,\" as the Legislature has defined that term,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 4651(2)(C) (2018). I also agree with the Court's conclusion that the evidence does not support the trial court's\n   finding that Rae engaged in two additional acts of harassment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 4651(2)(A) (2018). Although the trial court\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have granted judgment for Allen and issued an order of protection from harassment against Rae on the basis of the single act of harassment, that is not why the court issued the order. For that reason, I respectfully dissent and would remand for the court to reconsider whether the order should issue based on the one act of harassment-namely, damaging a tire valve-that Allen proved at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b614] Maine's statutes governing actions for protection from harassment vest the trial court with discretion in determining whether to issue a harassment order once harassment is proven. Pursuant to those statutes, if, after holding a hearing on the complaint for protection from harassment, the court finds that the plaintiff has proved that the defendant committed the harassment alleged, the court \"may\" issue a protection order. 5 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4654(1), 4655(1) (2018). This plain language calls for the court to exercise its sound discretion in determining whether to issue a harassment order in those actions where the party seeking such an order has proved her case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fitzpatrick v. McCrary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20ME%2048\">\n    2018 ME 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12495168\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/182/737/\">\n    182 A.3d 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that, in general, the word \"may\" used in a statute is permissive and discretionary).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b615] Particularly in the context of harassment proceedings, such a grant of discretionary authority to the court is eminently sensible, and the exercise of that discretion is important. As defined by the Legislature, \"harassment\" can take many shapes across a broad continuum, from acts of violence against a person that would constitute some of the most serious forms of criminal conduct, to acts that result in minor property damage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 4651(2). Yet any harassment order, which can be effective for one year, 5 M.R.S. \u00a7 4655(2) (2018), can impose significant restrictions on the defendant. The order may enjoin the defendant from having contact with certain persons or being present at certain locations; the order may award damages and attorney fees; and the order in fact may provide anything else \"determined necessary or appropriate in the discretion of the court.\" 5 M.R.S. \u00a7 4655(1). Once the court issues a harassment order, a violation of some types of its provisions is a Class D crime, which can draw nearly one year in jail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 4659(1) (2018) ; 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1252(2)(D) (2018) (stating the maximum jail term for a Class D crime).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b616] For these reasons, the trial court must be entrusted with making sound and careful determinations, tailored to the unique circumstances of each case, about whether and in what way it is appropriate to intervene through the imposition of judicial relief. That discretion may be properly exercised only by the trial judge, who is in the position to listen first-hand to the witnesses and watch them as they testify, and who can acquire an appreciation for the very human dynamics that are central to a harassment proceeding. As the Court points out,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Court's Opinion \u00b6 7, we have said as much in the context of protection from abuse cases, where the court also is given the same discretion in determining whether to issue a protective order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7 4007(1) (2018) (stating that \"[t]he court, after a hearing and upon finding that the defendant has committed the alleged abuse or engaged in the alleged conduct ...\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   grant a protective order\" (emphasis added) ). We have said,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   the trial court's ability to observe the witnesses invariably plays a part in its assessment of the impact a particular person's words and actions had upon another person. Appellate review is naturally limited by the written record's\n   inability to fully convey each witness's appearance, body language, stature, speech patterns, degree of eye contact, and numerous other nonverbal cues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

In fact, two of the grounds underlying the court's decision to issue the order are not supported by the record. This leaves only one act of \"harassment,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 4651(2)(C) -namely, when Rae cut a valve stem off a wheel on Allen's boat trailer she had parked on the disputed strip of land. The Court is willing to affirm the issuance of the harassment order against Rae based on this limited aspect of the record. But for the reason I have discussed, such a result would not obtain as a matter of law, and beyond that, it is impossible for us to know whether, in exercising its discretion, the trial court would have issued a protective order based on the one remaining ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b618]\n   <em>\n    If\n   </em>\n   the court had found only that Rae harassed Allen by cutting off the tire valve stem, and\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the court had then issued a harassment order on that limited basis, my analysis would be very different and I would agree with the Court's conclusion that the judgment should be affirmed. But to affirm the judgment here, we would be required to speculate that the court would have issued a harassment order against Rae based on the one instance of limited property damage. Rather than engaging in that speculation, I would vacate the judgment and remand for the court to determine whether, pursuant to section 4655(1), an order for protection from harassment should be issued based on the one episode of harassment that Allen proved at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b619] It may be that, on a remand, the court nonetheless would issue the order even on that more limited ground. Or maybe not. That is not a principled determination we can make on our record, and the Court's decision to affirm the issuance of the harassment order based on a very different predicate than the trial court used constitutes an intrusion into the discretion that is the trial court's-and not ours-to exercise.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Title 5 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4651, 4653 were amended during the pendency of this case, though not in any way that affects the present appeal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    P.L. 2017, ch. 455, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2 (effective Dec. 13, 2018) (codified at 5 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4651(2)(C), 4653(1)(B) (2018) ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The court also found that Rae \"[drove] across the corner [of either the disputed area or the trust's property]\" in a manner intended to be \"intimidating\" to Allen, and \"unnecessarily plow[ed] snow towards [Allen's] house.\" However, because the court did not find that these actions by Rae \"in fact cause[d] fear, intimidation or damage to personal property,\" they are not acts of harassment within the meaning of 5 M.R.S. \u00a7 4651(2)(A).
