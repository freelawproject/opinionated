On September 16, 2017, DHS' Office of Children, Youth and Families (OCYF) received a report that, on September 15, 2017, S.K. caused bodily injury to a minor (Minor) who resided at the Facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reproduced Record Volume I (R.R. I) at 1-2. OCYF conducted an investigation, whereby it determined, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [S.K.] is [ ] residential staff who had duties meeting the definition of a child care worker. [Minor] and [S.K.] were interviewed. Medical records and video were reviewed. The video shows that [Minor] was grabbed around [his] waist, lifted off of the floor, rotated in the air, and put on ground with force causing [Minor] to land on [his] shoulders, neck and back. The force was enough to cause [Minor's] legs/feet to approach [his] head when [Minor] landed on [his] shoulders/head. [Minor] has a diagnosed concussion as a result of [ ] being thrown on the ground by [S.K.]. [Minor's] and [S.K.'s] statements are consistent with the video and support the evidence of [S.K.] causing bodily harm to [Minor] through a recent act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   R.R. I at 2 (OCYF Investigation Report at 2). On October 10, 2017, OCYF filed an indicated report against S.K. as a perpetrator of abuse against Minor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. I at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 21, 2017, S.K. requested review of OCYF's report by DHS' Secretary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. I at 5-9. By December 7, 2017 letter, the Secretary's designee stated: \"We believe the report is accurate and being maintained in a manner consistent with the Child Protective Services Law [ (Law)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]. Thus[,] the report will remain on file as originally reported.\" R.R. I at 10. S.K. appealed to the BHA. A hearing was held on March 14, 2018, before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reproduced Record Volume II (R.R. II) at 1-241. On April 2, 2018, the ALJ issued an adjudication and recommendation denying S.K.'s appeal and declaring that OCYF proved that S.K.'s actions were reckless and, thus, constituted child abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 243-267. On April 20, 2018, the BHA adopted the ALJ's recommendation in its entirety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 242.

Cmwlth. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The facts of this case are not in dispute. The parties agree that S.K. was responsible for Minor's welfare and he was trained in and authorized to use Safe Crisis Management (SCM) restraint techniques when a child presents a danger to himself or to others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 11-12, 111-113, 137, 175, 187. On September 15, 2017, Minor did not want to attend school.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 26, 45. At breakfast, Minor notified staff that he intended to get kicked out of school, turn the building upside down and be restrained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 166. S.K. attempted choice theory techniques with Minor, asking him how such behavior would assist him in the program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 167-168. Minor went to school but, rather than participate, he wrote \"I don't care\" on his paper and put his head down, prompting his teacher to direct him to leave. R.R. II at 27, 46-47. After S.K. witnessed Minor storm out of school, S.K. and staff member D.F. followed Minor to his room to insure Minor's safety and that he did not damage the room.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 49, 172-173. Due to Minor's behavior in his room, S.K. and D.F. took Minor to a time-out room.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 27, 173-175. Minor struggled against S.K. on the way to the time-out room.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 174-175.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For approximately the first 10 minutes in the time-out room, Minor paced the floor and hit the walls as S.K. stood in the doorway speaking to him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 28, 54-55, 100, 177-179. Eventually, Minor asked S.K. to turn the lights off at the hallway switch so Minor could sleep, but S.K. explained that the lights had to remain on for the video recording that was in place for both their safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 55-58. Minor nevertheless made two additional attempts to push past S.K. to the hallway to turn the time-out room lights off, and each time made contact with S.K.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 28-29, 56, 58-62, 96-97, 104. On Minor's third attempt to reach out of the room, S.K. attempted to use an SCM-approved method to restrain Minor, but ended up restraining Minor in a manner that deviated from his Facility training.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 89-92, 112-113, 131, 187-190. Specifically, S.K. lifted up Minor and delivered him to the floor in such a manner that Minor's head and neck struck the floor first.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 29-32, 181-182, 186;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   S.K. Br. at viii. S.K. held Minor on the\n   floor in a kneeling torso hold until S.K. thought Minor was calm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 31, 64, 181-182, 184.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Immediately after the incident, S.K. escorted Minor back to his room and contacted the infirmary to check Minor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 184. Thereafter, Minor's head and back hurt, and he vomited several times.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 30-31. Minor received medical treatment first at the Facility, then at Grove City Medical Center emergency room, and finally at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 32-36, 38-41, 124-125. Minor was diagnosed with a concussion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 40, 138, 191, 193. The Facility discharged S.K. for his use of improper technique on September 15, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 95, 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Section 6303(b.1) of the Law provides, in pertinent part: \"The term 'child abuse' shall mean intentionally, knowingly or recklessly ... [c]ausing bodily injury to a child through any recent act or failure to act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303(b.1). Section 6303(c) of the Law specifies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Conduct that causes injury or harm to a child or creates a risk of injury or harm to a child shall not be considered child abuse if there is no evidence that the person acted intentionally, knowingly or recklessly when causing the injury or harm to the child or creating a risk of injury or harm to the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303(c). The BHA in this case adopted the ALJ's conclusion that S.K. did not intentionally or knowingly harm Minor, but that his actions were reckless and, thus, constituted child abuse under the Law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. II at 242, 264-265.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   S.K. argues that the BHA erred by applying a recklessness standard and concluding that he committed child abuse. He claims that since he accidentally injured Minor on September 15, 2017, pursuant to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    P.R. v.

DHS applied a foreseeability standard, concluded that the child's injury resulted from abuse, and denied the mother's request to expunge the indicated report. This Court reversed DHS' order, \"finding that foreseeability alone was an insufficient basis to sustain a conclusion that the injury resulted from abuse rather than an accident.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"312789,9409581\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/801/478/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"312789,9409581\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/801/478/\">\n    at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed this Court's conclusion that the mother's indicated report should be expunged, but did not endorse this Court's foreseeability standard. Rather, our Supreme Court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   To balance the competing objectives of protecting children from abuse while maintaining the parental right to use corporal punishment, the legal standard for differentiating abuse from accident must acknowledge some level of culpability by the perpetrator that his actions\n   could reasonably create a serious injury to the child. The standard that best comports with the problem of defining abuse in terms of nonaccidental injury is criminal negligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Criminal negligence intertwines the concepts of foreseeability and intent to a degree that this [Supreme C]ourt finds appropriate for differentiating cases of accidental and nonaccidental injury in keeping with the legislative directive contained within the [Law]. The legislature has defined criminal negligence as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor's failure to perceive it, considering the nature and intent of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   18 Pa.C.S.[ ] \u00a7 302(b)(4). This definition satisfies the parameters of defining an injury caused by abuse as something that occurs in contrast to an injury caused by accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Accordingly, ...\n   <strong>\n    in cases where a child suffers a serious injury arising from the administration of corporal punishment, a finding that the injury resulted from abuse versus accident will depend upon a showing, by the agency, through substantial evidence, that the injury resulted from criminal negligence\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"312789,9409581\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/801/478/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"312789,9409581\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/801/478/\">\n    at 486-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Although the Law has been amended since\n   <em>\n    P.R.\n   </em>\n   was decided, this Court has held that \"the criminal negligence standard proffered by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    P.R.\n   </em>\n   is now codified in the [Law] under the auspices of the definition of 'nonaccidental.' The result is that\n   <em>\n    P.R.\n   </em>\n   remains controlling precedent, and\n   <strong>\n    criminal negligence is still the proper standard\n    <em>\n     in corporal punishment cases\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    F.R. v.

The record evidence demonstrates that S.K. was a concerned staff person who tried everything within his means to de-escalate Minor's behavior. The circumstances known to S.K. were that Minor was agitated and threatening, and he had already carried out one of his threats - to get thrown out of school. S.K. maintained self-control. He talked and acted calmly toward Minor, using SCM-approved choice theory techniques, but Minor's agitation escalated. S.K. did not have a panic button or staff assistance available to him, and he was aware that a camera was recording his actions. Minor twice attempted to reach or get outside the time-out room, each time physically contacting S.K. in the process. S.K. warned Minor that a third try would result in restraint, and S.K.'s requests for assistance were futile. S.K. intended to use an SCM-approved upper torso restraint but, in a split-second decision to protect Minor and other residents, S.K.'s upper torso restraint did not go as planned, S.K. used a modified wrestling move and Minor landed on the floor. S.D. acknowledged the possibility that if S.K. had effectuated a proper upper torso restraint, Minor would have had access to the doorway and the hall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   This Court acknowledges that S.K. was aware that bodily injury could occur when SCM-approved manual restraints are used, and the risk increased if other restraint techniques are used. However, the OCYF failed to establish that, under the circumstances facing S.K. on September 15, 2017, S.K. consciously disregarded or was indifferent to the risk that Minor could be injured when S.K. restrained him. Nor is there any credible record evidence that S.K. grossly deviated from what a reasonable person would have found acceptable under the same circumstances. Accordingly, the BHA erred by concluding that S.K. acted recklessly and, thus, committed child abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the BHA's April 20, 2018 order is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   AND NOW, this 27\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of March, 2019, the Department of Human Services Bureau of Hearings and Appeals' April 20, 2018 order is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Section 6303(a) of the Child Protective Services Law (Law) defines an \"indicated report\" as a report issued by DHS if it \"determines that substantial evidence of the alleged abuse by a perpetrator exists based on any of the following: (i) [a]vailable medical evidence[;] (ii) [t]he child protective service investigation[; or] (iii) [a]n admission of the acts of abuse by the perpetrator.\" 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303(a) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Section 3490.4 of DHS' Regulations,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203490.4\">\n     55 Pa.
