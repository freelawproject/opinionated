Where N.J.S.A. 19:23-22.4 requires that sample primary ballots be printed in Spanish as well as English, must the official primary ballots, including mail-in ballots, also be printed in Spanish and English? Reading N.J.S.A. 19:23-22.4 in pari materia with related sections of the election laws, and considering the Legislature's policy to avoid disenfranchising voters whose primary language is Spanish, we conclude that the answer to the question is yes. To avoid disrupting the electoral process, our decision is prospective only, and any future challenge based on this decision must be filed in sufficient time to permit effectuation of the relief sought without delaying the election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before continuing our discussion, we address the procedural posture of the case. A few days before the June 5, 2018 primary election, plaintiff Edward Correa filed an order to show cause challenging the machine and mail-in ballots in Dover, Morris County. At the time, Correa was a \"declared candidate\" for a seat on the district committee in Ward 3, District 1 in Dover. Because at least ten percent of the registered voters in Dover spoke\n   Spanish as their primary language, N.J.S.A. 19:23-22.4 required that the sample ballots be printed in both English and Spanish. Relying on N.J.S.A. 19:23-31 and N.J.S.A. 19:63-7, Correa argued that the machine and mail-in ballots likewise should have been bilingual. The New Jersey Democratic State Committee intervened as a plaintiff in the action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The order to show cause, seeking injunctive relief, was heard on the Friday before the scheduled Tuesday election. After hearing arguments addressing both the legal issues and the practical impediments to granting plaintiffs the relief they sought, the trial court rejected plaintiffs' legal contentions and denied the application for an injunction. The trial court noted that the Legislature specifically added the bilingual-printing requirement only as to sample ballots and not as to official ballots, and reasoned that if the Legislature intended to change the language requirement for official ballots it would have specifically so provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The application for injunctive relief with respect to the June 5, 2018 primary election is now moot, since the election is long over. However, plaintiffs also sought an order requiring the County Clerk to provide bilingual ballots in future elections. The appeal from the denial of that relief is not moot. However, even if the entire appeal were moot, we would address it because the State election law issue concerns a matter of significant public importance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zirger v.

Plaintiffs, joined by amicus curiae American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, contend that once the Legislature amended the sample ballot law, the \"facsimile\" provision in N.J.S.A. 19:23-31 would automatically require that the official ballots follow the required format of the sample ballots. They further argue that if the official machine ballots must conform to the sample ballots, the mail-in ballots must likewise conform, because they must be exact duplicates of the machine ballots.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 19:63-7. While plaintiffs concede the law is ambiguous on those points, they urge that we resolve the ambiguity by considering the absurd result of defendants' proffered interpretation, and by considering the Legislative purpose of statutory amendments designed to protect Spanish-speaking voters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Where the plain language of a statute is clear, we enforce the statute as written.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DiProspero v.

However, not every statute is a model of clarity. When\n   the statutory language is sufficiently ambiguous that it may be susceptible to more than one plausible interpretation, we may turn to such extrinsic guides as legislative history, including sponsor statements and committee reports. We may also turn to extrinsic guides if a literal reading of the statute would yield an absurd result, particularly one at odds with the overall statutory scheme. An enactment that is part of a larger statutory framework should not be read in isolation, but in relation to other constituent parts so that a sensible meaning may be given to the whole of the legislative scheme. We also must be guided by the legislative objectives sought to be achieved by enacting the statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Wilson ex rel. Manzano v.

The Legislature has adopted a panoply of protections in voting districts where the primary language of at least ten percent of registered voters is Spanish.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 19:14-21 (bilingual sample ballots for general elections); N.J.S.A. 19:6-1 (appointment of additional District Board of Elections members who are of Hispanic origin and fluent in Spanish); N.J.S.A. 19:49-4(a)(2), (b) (delivery and display of bilingual sample ballots at a polling places). In counties where the primary language of at least ten percent of registered voters is Spanish, notices for challenging voters, instructions and affidavits to be completed by challenged voters, and complaint forms concerning the conduct of elections, must all be bilingual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 19:12-9 ; N.J.S.A. 19:15-18.1 ; N.J.S.A. 19:32-4.1. Additionally, bilingual voter registration forms must be available in any county where bilingual sample ballots are required in at least one of the county's election districts. N.J.S.A. 19:31-6.4(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As previously noted, defendants contend that if the Legislature intended to require bilingual official ballots, it would have included that requirement at the same time that it amended the statutes to require bilingual sample ballots. Plaintiffs respond that the Legislature should be deemed to be aware that sample ballots must be an exact copy, or facsimile, of the official ballot, and we should infer from the \"facsimile\" provisions of the election laws that the Legislature would expect the official ballots to mirror any required changes in the sample ballots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that accepting defendants' argument will lead to an absurd result which is contrary to the Legislature's intent to protect Spanish-speaking voters. They point out that having an official ballot that is only in English defeats the purpose of issuing bilingual sample ballots. In particular, they contend\n   that, even if the sample ballot is bilingual, a voter whose primary language is Spanish will then enter a voting booth and be confronted with a ballot printed only in English. A voter who is confused or unable to read the ballot due to a language barrier cannot leave the voting booth to seek an explanation and then re-enter the booth. N.J.S.A. 19:52-3 (stating that a voter who leaves the voting booth may not thereafter re-enter the booth \"on any pretext whatever.\"). Moreover, because the sample ballot advises voters that it is an exact copy of the official ballot, voters receiving a bilingual sample ballot can fairly expect that the official ballot will likewise be bilingual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Both sides have colorable arguments to make in this case. However, bearing in mind that our polestar is the Legislature's intent, that the election laws are to be construed liberally with an eye to facilitating rather than obstructing the right to vote, and that absurd results are to be avoided in statutory construction, we conclude that plaintiffs have the better arguments. As a practical matter, it makes no sense to provide bilingual sample ballots because voters are not fluent in English, but to expect those same voters to navigate an official balloting process that is\n   English-only. We will not presume that the Legislature intended that result. Rather, we presume that the Legislature, being familiar with its own enactments, would have expected that the \"facsimile\" language pertaining to sample and official ballots would result in the official ballots mirroring the sample ballots where the Legislature required the sample ballots to be printed in both Spanish and English. We acknowledge that if we have misconstrued the Legislature's purpose, the Legislature is free, as always, to amend the statutes to clarify its intent.\n   We reverse the order on appeal insofar as it denied plaintiffs' application for prospective relief, and we remand this matter to the trial court for the limited purpose of entering an order conforming to this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Reversed and remanded.
