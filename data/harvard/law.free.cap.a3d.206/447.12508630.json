The trial judge granted defendants' motion for an involuntary dismissal because plaintiffs could not prove damages. Plaintiffs could not prove damages because another judge had granted defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   pretrial motion to bar plaintiffs' damage claims as a sanction for failing to respond to defendants' notice to produce documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judge who granted defendants' pretrial motion for sanctions, including their request to bar expert testimony, did so even though defendants had filed the motion in violation of multiple court rules. Defendants filed the motion belatedly, without demonstrating good cause to do so, and despite their never having demanded an expert report from plaintiffs. They did not certify they were not delinquent in their discovery obligations, which they were, as they had not responded to plaintiffs' discovery. They also disregarded the rule requirements that are prerequisites to having a motion for discovery sanctions listed for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The grant of defendants' motion despite their multiple missteps resulted in the functional equivalent of a dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint with prejudice for a discovery violation; a sanction the Supreme Court has characterized as \"drastic\" and has cautioned against imposing if a lesser sanction will suffice.\n   <em>\n    Abtrax Pharm., Inc. v. Elkins-Sinn, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288096\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/139/499/#p514\">\n    139 N.J. 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 514,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288096\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/139/499/#p514\">\n    655 A.2d 1368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). Perhaps more significantly, the sanction could be viewed as the uneven-handed administration of court rules, resulting in an unjust determination and the needless expenditure and delay caused by a meaningless trial; all anathema to the purpose for which the rules exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   1:1-2. We thus reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This civil action arose out of a home improvement contract, which plaintiffs alleged defendants failed to complete, leaving them with an uninhabitable house. Plaintiffs filed a six-count complaint in August\n   2016, and defendants filed an answer and counterclaim the following month. Defendants served plaintiffs with requests for admission and a notice to produce documents, including documentary evidence of plaintiffs' damage claim. Defendants did not serve interrogatories. Their demand for documents did not demand experts' reports. Plaintiffs served defendant with\n   interrogatories and a notice to produce documents. None of the parties answered discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The discovery end date was July 25, 2017. In October the parties proceeded to mandatory arbitration as required by\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:21A-1(a)(3). The arbitrator rendered an award for plaintiffs. Defendants rejected the award and demanded a trial de novo, as permitted by\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:21A-6(b)(1). Two weeks after arbitration and three months after the discovery end date, defendants filed the motion that resulted in the orders from which plaintiffs have appealed. Plaintiffs filed a cross-motion seeking an order \"Extending Discovery with Consent of All Parties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants entitled their motion for discovery sanctions \"Motion for Plaintiffs' Failure to Serve Discovery and to Bar Plaintiffs' Late Service of Liability or Damage Experts Reports Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:23-5(3)(b) [sic].\" They supported the motion with a certification from their attorney. In his certification, the attorney did not explain why he did not file the motion before the discovery end date. He summarized the pleadings, explained plaintiffs had not responded to defendants' requests for admission and notice to produce documents, and omitted to disclose defendants had not responded to plaintiffs' interrogatories and notice to produce documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs informed the motion judge in their cross-motion that defendants had not responded to plaintiffs' discovery demands. Nevertheless, the judge granted defendants' motion and denied plaintiffs' cross-motion. He barred plaintiffs from presenting any evidence of damages not documented during discovery, knowing plaintiffs had produced no such documentary evidence, as attested to by defendants in their motion. He gave this explanation, typed below his signature on the order: \"The [discovery end date] expired on July 25, 2017. The documents sought to be introduced were only made available on the eve of arbitration. This results in substantial and undue prejudice to the [d]efendant[s].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The motion judge denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. In the decision he delivered from the bench at the close of oral\n   argument, the judge noted that \"discovery rules are designed to reach the substantive merits of a matter rather than permitting reliance on procedural mechanisms that might result in concealment and surprise.\" He did not, however, cite to any rule concerning the timing of motions seeking sanctions for discovery violations, nor did he cite to the requirements of any rule authorizing such sanctions.

Plaintiffs developed the proofs they were permitted to present. Defendants moved for an involuntary dismissal. The court granted the motion, based on the absence of any damage proofs. The court also dismissed defendants' counterclaim. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, plaintiffs argue it was fundamentally unfair for the motion judge to bar them from proving damages when defendants had committed the identical discovery violations. Plaintiffs add that the motion judge compounded his error by overlooking\n   defendants' non-compliance with virtually every prerequisite for filing a motion for sanctions based on discovery violations. In doing so, plaintiffs argue, the court imposed a draconian sanction unauthorized by any court rule applicable to a discovery violation. Plaintiffs also contend the motion judge erroneously denied their motion for reconsideration, and the trial judge erred by involuntarily dismissing their action. Last, they contend the motion judge erred by denying their motion to extend discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants do not dispute that they did not comply with their discovery obligations, nor do they dispute that they did not comply with the provisions of certain rules concerning discovery sanctions. Rather, they argue a court has inherent discretionary power to impose sanctions for failure to make discovery, a power the motion judge did not abuse. They point out that plaintiffs did not argue to the motion judge several points they now raise on appeal. Defendants assert that because the motion judge did not abuse his inherent power to impose sanctions for failure to make discovery, he properly denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, and the trial judge properly dismissed plaintiffs' action when they failed to prove damages at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We begin our analysis with some fundamental observations.

When defendants filed their motion for sanctions, they offered no explanation for their failure to file the motion within the discovery period. That they had not done so was obvious from their certification, in which they referred\n   to the arbitration and the arbitrator's award. For that reason alone, the motion judge would have acted well within his discretion by denying the motion.\n   <em>\n    Carbis Sales, Inc. v.

Here, however, defendants did not even attempt to make a showing of good cause, and the trial court did not find defendants had made such a showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants had ample opportunity during the discovery period to compel plaintiff to provide discovery responses. Their failure to do so, without explanation, suggests they did not have good cause to wait until after the arbitration to file the motion. When the motion judge granted defendants' motion for sanctions, he emphasized the undue prejudice to them. But the possible prejudice was not \"undue.\" Defendants' wholesale disregard of the discovery rules refutes that proposition. Moreover, in weighing the prejudice to the parties, we fail to discern how the possible prejudice to defendants - who could still offer a defense, rely on their requests for admission, and offer proofs to support their counterclaim - was somehow greater in magnitude than the prejudice to plaintiffs, who the motion judge effectively barred from proving their case at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   If a trial court declines to enforce a mandatory rule - particularly a rule designed to provide uniformity and fairness in its application - the court should explain its reasons for doing so.

Here, that admonition was overlooked when the motion judge, in effect, dismissed plaintiffs' complaint by precluding them from presenting proofs of damage at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendants' motion was filed in disregard of the following requirements, deficiencies readily apparent from the motion and supporting certification: (1) the motion was filed out of time without a showing of good cause (\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:24-2(a) ); (2) defendants did not certify they had made a good faith effort to obtain the discovery before filing the motion (\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:6-2(c) ); (3) defendants did not certify they were not in default in discovery obligations owed to plaintiffs (\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:23-5(a)(1) ); and, (4) defendants invoked\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:23-5(b) to bar plaintiffs from presenting expert testimony at trial even though defendants had never demanded an expert as required by\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:23-5(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs were subjected to the functional equivalent of the \"ultimate sanction\" even though defendants had not only disregarded their own discovery obligations, but had also disregarded in their entirety the mandatory provisions of the rules authorizing the imposition of sanctions for failing to make discovery. The trial court misapplied its discretion by disregarding these mandates without an explanation for doing so and by imposing the equivalent of the ultimate sanction when the moving parties were delinquent and lesser sanctions would have sufficed to erase the prejudice to all parties. We thus vacate the order precluding plaintiffs from presenting expert or other testimony concerning their damages. We also vacate the order denying their motion for reconsideration, as well as the order involuntarily dismissing their case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings. The trial court shall conduct a conference and issue an order imposing reasonable deadlines for completion of discovery, dispositive\n   motion practice, and if necessary, trial. Because\n   defendants had a full opportunity to present their counterclaim and have not cross-appealed from its dismissal at trial, there is no need to litigate that issue a second time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    This appeal does not involve sanctions imposed for violating a discovery order. The trial court had issued no such order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    This subsection of\n    <em>\n     Rule\n    </em>\n    1:6-2 makes an exception for actions that have \"been specially assigned to an individual judge for case management and disposition of all pretrial and trial proceedings and ... all cases pending in the Superior Court, Chancery Division.\"\n    <em>\n     R\n    </em>\n    . 1:6-2(b) &amp; (c). Nothing in the appellate record identifies this action as such a \"specially assigned\" case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
