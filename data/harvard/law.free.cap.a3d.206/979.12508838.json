Borough of Belmar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"344152\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/238/179/\">\n    238 N.J. Super. 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"344152\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/238/179/\">\n    569 A.2d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Law Div. 1989). The trial court found that the Borough improperly used funds derived from beach fees (beach funds) to settle non-beach related litigation; improperly deposited into the Borough's general fund certain donations raised through a campaign to help rebuild the boardwalk (the buy-a-board donations); planned to improperly use the buy-a-board donations, and certain other funds restricted for beach use, to rebuild a boardwalk pavilion (the Taylor Pavilion) that was largely used for non-beach purposes; and doubled the\n   fees for beach-front parking spaces in order to raise money for the general fund. The trial court found that defendants' actions or planned actions violated the Borough's obligations under the public trust doctrine and N.J.S.A. 40:61-22.20, which was enacted to implement the doctrine. The trial court also concluded that the Borough violated plaintiffs' substantive civil rights and awarded plaintiffs about $ 170,000 in counsel fees and costs under the New Jersey Civil Rights Act (CRA), N.J.S.A. 10:6-2(f).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In challenging the resulting trial court orders, defendants - the Borough, and its Mayor and Council - contend that most of plaintiffs' issues were not ripe; the trial court's decision violated the separation of powers doctrine; the court erred in holding that the Borough must use the buy-a-board donations to rebuild the boardwalk; the court erred in finding that violations of the public trust doctrine were substantive rights for purposes of a counsel fee award under the CRA; the court erred in voiding the ordinance doubling the parking fees; paying litigation fees from the beach fund did not violate the public trust doctrine or the CRA; no counsel fee could be awarded because plaintiffs' attorney had no retainer agreement; the counsel fee award was excessive; and any fee award should be paid from the beach fund instead of the general fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We conclude that the disputes in this case were ripe for adjudication. We affirm the orders on appeal, except that we modify the order awarding counsel fees under the CRA. We hold that when a municipality violates the beach fee statute, N.J.S.A. 40:61-22.20, by charging unreasonable beach fees, that violation constitutes the deprivation of a substantive civil right under the New Jersey Civil Rights Act, and a successful plaintiff is entitled to counsel fees. However, because the CRA requires\n   the violation of an unambiguous, specific statutory or constitutional provision,\n   most of the conduct plaintiffs proved in this case, while wrongful, did not establish CRA violations or entitle them to counsel fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under the limited circumstances of this case, we agree with the trial court that parking fees - charged only for beach-front parking and nowhere else in the Borough - constituted beach fees. The record supports the trial court's findings that doubling the parking fees in order to raise general revenues for the Borough imposed an unreasonable beach fee on users of the beach. Plaintiffs are entitled to counsel fees under the CRA for that violation of N.J.S.A. 40:61-22.20. Plaintiffs did not prove that the Borough's regular beach-badge fees were unreasonable, nor did they prove that they were physically excluded from any portion of the Borough's beach. Because CRA counsel fees are available for the violation of N.J.S.A. 40:61-22.20 that plaintiffs proved, we do not reach the separate issue of whether counsel fees are available under the CRA solely for a violation of the common-law public trust doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As background, it is helpful to briefly review the public trust doctrine and the\n   <em>\n    Slocum\n   </em>\n   decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The public trust doctrine refers to the common-law principle that a state holds, \" 'in trust for the people,' \" \" 'ownership, dominion and sovereignty' over tidally flowed lands\" extending to the mean high water mark.\n   <em>\n    City of Long Branch v.

In 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused extensive damage along the Borough's beachfront. The storm virtually destroyed the boardwalk and several pavilions located along the boardwalk. Some of the pavilions had been built, or rebuilt after previous storms, using money raised from beach-badge fees, and they were used for beach-related purposes. But the Taylor Pavilion was not built with beach funds and had primarily been used for community functions unrelated to the beach. The Borough anticipated that it would receive insurance proceeds from policies covering the pavilions, as well as money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to cover some reconstruction costs. In an effort to raise private funds toward the cost of rebuilding the boardwalk, the Borough also conducted a \"buy-a-board\" campaign, telling potential donors that\n   their donations would allow them to pay for actual boards on the boardwalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Borough planned to use insurance proceeds and FEMA reimbursement money associated with beach-related pavilions to rebuild the Taylor Pavilion. The Borough also anticipated using the buy-a-board donations for that purpose. The Borough Council planned to issue bonds to fund the Taylor Pavilion construction, and it anticipated using the insurance, FEMA, and buy-a-board monies to repay the bonds. In addition, to avoid raising taxes on its residents, the Borough doubled the parking fees along the street adjacent to the beach, and paid certain non-beach-related litigation expenses using money from its beach fund instead of from its general fund. Plaintiffs filed a nine-count complaint challenging these actions as violating\n   <em>\n    Slocum\n   </em>\n   , violating the public trust doctrine, and violating the beach fee statute. After hearing motions and a two-day bench trial, the trial court decided the issues in plaintiffs' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We will defer to a trial court's factual findings so long as they are supported by substantial credible evidence.\n   <em>\n    Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v.

The judge was also familiar with the long history of disputes over Belmar's use or misuse of beach funds. That litigation included an injunction issued by Assignment Judge Lawrence M. Lawson, precluding the Borough from spending beach funds to rebuild the Taylor Pavilion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial judge also construed the parties' joint submission of issues - which referred to \"the Borough's plans\" to take the disputed actions - as an admission by the Borough that it had such plans. We find no error in the trial judge drawing that inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Given the history of this litigation, we cannot say the trial judge erred in deciding that there was a genuine dispute over which assets belonged in the beach fund and that there was a current need for a declaratory ruling as to the proper allocation of the funds, even in the absence of a municipal appropriation of the funds or other legally binding action by the Borough Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Several of defendants' additional arguments are clearly without merit and warrant only brief discussion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:11-3(e)(1)(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants argue that they were entitled to use the buy-a-board funds to reconstruct the Taylor Pavilion and the trial court erred in holding otherwise. We disagree. The buy-a-board funds were not beach fees. However, they were voluntary contributions, raised through a solicitation that clearly indicated they would be used to pay for the reconstruction of the boardwalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The proper use of those contributions is governed by the statute addressing the use of funds raised by bequests, legacies and gifts. That statute, N.J.S.A. 40A:5-29, states in pertinent part: \"Any local unit is authorized and empowered to accept ... gifts made to it and is empowered to utilize such ... gifts in the manner set forth\n   <em>\n    in the conditions of the ... gift\n   </em>\n   ....\" (emphasis added). For the reasons stated in the trial judge's October 23, 2015 oral opinion, we conclude that the buy-a-board donations were solicited\n   for the explicit purpose of rebuilding the boardwalk, and the language of the solicitations constituted the \"conditions\" of the gifts or donations. N.J.S.A. 40A:5-29.

Accordingly, the donations must be deposited in the beach fund and used to pay for reconstruction of the boardwalk. Defendants' arguments to the contrary are without sufficient merit to warrant further discussion.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:11-3(e)(1)(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On this appeal, defendants do not challenge the substance of the trial court's\n   decision determining the extent to which beach funds could be used to reconstruct the Taylor Pavilion, although they contend the issue was not ripe for decision. The funds at issue derived from pavilions whose prior construction was paid for with beach fees. The court held that when those pavilions were destroyed by Sandy, the insurance proceeds and FEMA reimbursement funds received, or to be received in future by the Borough, had to be allocated to the beach fund and used for beach purposes. With respect to the Taylor Pavilion, which was primarily to be used for non-beach purposes, the judge held that a portion of those funds could be used to pay the proportionate cost of rebuilding the relatively small area of the building that would be used for beach purposes. We affirm that decision, as to ripeness and as to the merits, for the reasons stated by the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We agree with the trial judge that the Borough was not entitled to spend money from the beach fund to settle claims from a lawsuit (known as the \"Partner Litigation\") that were unrelated to the beach. That issue was ripe for the court's consideration. While\n   the case was pending in the trial court, the parties were able to agree on which portion of the Partner Litigation settlement should be paid from the beach fund and which portion should be paid from the general fund. Accordingly, they agreed that the general fund would reimburse the beach fund for the former's share of the settlement obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We next turn to the parking fee issue, which concerns parking spaces on the beach side of Ocean Avenue. The\n   <em>\n    Slocum\n   </em>\n   decision apparently assumed that parking fees could be considered beach-related income, because it held that the administrative costs associated with maintaining the parking meters could be charged to the beach fund.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Slocum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"344152\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/238/179/\">\n    238 N.J.

As previously noted, defendants did not ask the trial court to relieve them from the orders resulting from\n   <em>\n    Slocum\n   </em>\n   , but instead accepted that the Borough was still bound by the\n   <em>\n    Slocum\n   </em>\n   decision. As a result, we need not decide whether the public trust doctrine or N.J.S.A. 40:61-22.20 apply to parking fees generally. However, we add these observations pertinent to this particular case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At oral argument on May 6, 2016, both sides agreed on the essential facts concerning parking in the Borough. There are no parking lots where beach users can park. Therefore, anyone arriving by car to use the beach must use street parking. The Borough does not charge for street parking (i.e., through meters or parking kiosks) anywhere\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   for the parking spaces on the eastern side of Ocean Avenue, directly adjacent to the beach. Under those unique circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude\n   that the parking fees are a form of beach fee - a fee aimed at persons who are parking in order to obtain access to the beach. The Borough has essentially conceded that point for decades; it has allocated sixty percent of the parking\n   revenue to the beach fund and forty percent to either its general fund or a parking utility fund, on the theory that the majority of parking revenue comes from beach users, but some parking revenue is earned at night from people who do not intend to use the beach. In turn,\n   <em>\n    Slocum\n   </em>\n   allows the Borough to charge the beach fund for the upkeep of the meters and for other costs related to the parking spaces.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We affirm the trial court's finding that in 2013 and 2014, the Borough departed from the sixty-forty split of income between the parking utility fund and the beach fund without a financial justification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We also find that the trial court's decision, ordering the allocation to the beach fund of parking fees paid during hours the beach was open to the public, was reasonable and supported by the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Rova Farms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1930491\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/65/474/#p484\">\n    65 N.J. at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=323%20A.2d%20495\">\n    323 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   There is also substantial credible evidence to support the judge's finding that the one hundred percent increase in the hourly parking fee, from a dollar to two dollars per hour, was not imposed to pay for permissible beach-related costs, but was instead aimed at increasing the Borough's general revenues to avoid raising taxes on its residents. Contrary testimony from the Borough's CFO was vague and not supported by documentary evidence. The mayor and Borough Council members repeatedly expressed their intent to increase general revenues without raising taxes, and the Council rejected proposals to impose parking fees anywhere else in the town. Given this particular town's past history as detailed in\n   <em>\n    Slocum\n   </em>\n   , and its current policy of charging\n   for parking on the beachfront and\n   <em>\n    nowhere else\n   </em>\n   in the town, we conclude there was sufficient credible evidence to support the trial court's findings that the parking charge amounted to a beach fee and the town violated N.J.S.A. 40:61-22.20, by imposing on beach users an unreasonable increase in that fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   To be clear, we are not holding that any and all fees for parking near a beach necessarily constitute beach fees; that issue is not before us. However, the record here supports the trial court's finding that these parking fees were beach fees. The record also supports the court's conclusion that in doubling the fees, the Borough was intentionally and improperly using beach fees to raise money for its general fund, to avoid raising taxes on its residents. \"Limiting access by placing an unreasonable economic burden on the public undermines the objectives of the public trust doctrine to the same extent as any physical barrier....

We agree with the trial judge's conclusions that the Borough misallocated and misused some beach-related funds, for the reasons she stated. However, apart from parking fees, the judge did not decide\n   the reasonableness of the Borough's beach fees, an issue that was not before her in any event. In their appellate brief, plaintiffs argue that we can infer from the record that they paid unreasonable beach-badge fees, but their claim is unsupported by the evidence. Plaintiffs assert that if the Borough misspent money from the beach fund, or failed to deposit monies into the fund that belonged there, the beach-badge fees the\n   Borough charged must necessarily be unreasonable.

The evidence in this case did not approach that level of detail. There was, for example, no evidence as to the reasonableness of the amount of the reserve in the beach fund.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   At most, there was evidence that buy-a-board funds that should have been placed in the beach fund were placed in another account, some beach-related funds were improperly spent to pay litigation expenses, and the Borough government had future plans to spend beach funds on non-beach projects. However, those plans had not yet been implemented and might never have been implemented if the voters disapproved the bond ordinance for the Taylor Pavilion. There was also evidence that the beach fund could have avoided paying about $ 36,000 in annual bond interest if the Borough had used the buy-a-board proceeds to pay down the bonds. But, there was no evidence that the $ 36,000 would have made a difference to the reasonable amount of beach fees charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs did not introduce the type of expert rate-setting testimony that would have been needed to support a conclusion that the current beach-badge fees the Borough was charging were unreasonable. In fact, their complaint did not even specifically allege that those rates were unreasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor did they introduce the type of expert evidence the court relied on in\n   <em>\n    Slocum\n   </em>\n   concerning the reasonableness of the amount of the beach fund reserve. Those are not trivial evidentiary gaps. Superstorm Sandy had\n   recently inflicted tens of millions of dollars in damage to the beach and boardwalk. Absent expert testimony, one cannot say that it was unreasonable for the Borough to maintain a significant reserve in the beach fund against potential future storm damage, or that it was unreasonable to raise the beach-badge fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   After reviewing the transcripts, we also have reservations about some of the language the court used concerning the absolute duty to maintain beach fee proceeds in the beach account at all times, and the imprecise use of language concerning the identity of money raised through beach fees. To address the latter issue first, both plaintiffs and the court repeatedly referred to the funds as belonging to beachgoers, as though they had an individual right to the money, which would be violated by any misallocation of the funds. The characterization is inaccurate. The funds belong to the municipality, albeit they can only be used for restricted purposes relating to the beach, as provided in N.J.S.A. 40:61-22.20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Borough's CFO, Robbin Kirk, testified that it is not unusual for a municipal fiscal administrator to transfer money back and forth between accounts during a fiscal year to meet temporary shortages in one account or the other. Kirk testified that on occasion, she had transferred funds from another account to the beach fund to meet a temporary shortfall in the beach fund, and vice versa. She testified that was not deemed improper accounting so long as the Borough's accounts documented the interfund transfers, so that money temporarily transferred from one fund to another would be reimbursed to the proper fund. There was no testimony, expert or otherwise, that this was improper or not a generally accepted practice in municipal finance and accounting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Borough does not challenge that it remains bound by the accounting procedures set forth in\n   <em>\n    Slocum\n   </em>\n   . However, that does not necessarily mean that any violation of\n   <em>\n    Slocum\n   </em>\n   is itself a violation of the public trust doctrine or of plaintiffs' substantive civil rights. In ruling otherwise, the trial court essentially morphed prophylactic remedies or procedures, designed to prevent violations of the public trust doctrine, into elements of the doctrine itself and\n   characterized any variation from those procedures as violations of individual, substantive civil rights. Taking that approach conflates substantive rights with procedural remedies, may unduly involve courts in the day-to-day business of municipal accounting, and may encourage unnecessary litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Secure Heritage\n   </em>\n   , 361 N.J.

Consequently, the fact that plaintiffs filed the lawsuit to rectify misallocation of expenses for the Partnership\n   Litigation, correct violations of accounting procedures required by\n   <em>\n    Slocum\n   </em>\n   , and prevent the future misuse of various funds, does not determine their right to counsel fees under the CRA.\n   The CRA does not extend the right to counsel fees for any and all successful litigation against a government entity. It is limited to successful litigation concerning individual substantive rights guaranteed by \"laws\" or by the Constitution. The CRA provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Any person who has been deprived of any substantive due process or equal protection rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or any\n   <em>\n    substantive rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of this State\n   </em>\n   , or whose exercise or enjoyment of those substantive rights, privileges or immunities has been interfered with or attempted to be interfered with, by threats, intimidation or coercion by a person acting under color of law, may bring a civil action for damages and for injunctive or other appropriate relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [ N.J.S.A. 10:6-2(c) (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We previously construed this provision as requiring either (a) a deprivation of a substantive right; or (b) threats, intimidation, or coercion constituting an interference or attempted interference with the right.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [P]lacement of a comma after \"laws of this State\" and before the word \"or\" divides the clause into two separate, independent phrases that do not act to modify nor qualify one another. Thus, properly read, the statute provides a person may bring a civil action under the Act in two circumstances: (1) when he's deprived of a right, or (2) when his rights are interfered with by threats, intimidation, coercion or force. Clearly, defendants' contrary interpretation renders the terms \"deprive\" and \"interfere\" indistinguishable, yet they are clearly different in meaning. Indeed, it makes sense to require, as the Legislature evidently did, that a plaintiff show \"threats, intimidation or coercion\" were employed if constitutional rights were merely interfered with or an attempt was made at interfering with them, and that no such showing is required where one has actually been deprived of the right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Felicioni v.

On the other hand, because the CRA is remedial legislation, and because it uses the term \"laws\" rather \"statutes,\" it could be argued that the Legislature intended the term \"laws\" to include fundamental rights enshrined in our common law and that the right to use the beaches is such a fundamental right.
