Because we conclude that the motion court erred in restricting its legal analysis to evidence of the events and circumstances occurring at and prior to the moment that the trooper realized that the operator was not the person who was the subject of the complaint that led to the traffic stop, we vacate the suppression order and remand for the court to determine whether the trooper's subsequent actions were reasonably related in scope to the purpose of the initial stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] Viewed in the light most favorable to the court's order, the following facts are supported by the evidence presented at the suppression hearing.\n   <em>\n    State v. Blier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12318686\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/829/\">\n    2017 ME 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12318686\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/829/\">\n    162 A.3d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the evening of August 2, 2017, the trooper received a report that a caller, who identified himself by name, had observed a \"visibly intoxicated\" man walking around the parking lot in front of a store and repeatedly getting in and out of a vehicle, which the caller described. The trooper believed that the caller's self-identification added to the credibility of the report. The trooper responded to the location and, from a distance, observed three or four individuals in the store's parking lot milling around a vehicle matching the description provided by the caller, several of whom were getting in and out of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b63] At the suppression hearing, the trooper testified that, from his vantage point, he was unable to determine the gender or discern any identifying characteristics of the individuals around the vehicle because of the glare from the setting sun. After several minutes, the trooper observed three people get into the vehicle, which then exited the parking lot onto a public way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b64] The trooper did not observe any erratic operation or traffic infractions, but immediately activated the cruiser's blue lights to stop the vehicle because he believed that it was being operated by the intoxicated male. The vehicle pulled over promptly and appropriately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b65] When the trooper approached the vehicle, he \"immediately\" realized that the driver was a female, not a male. There were two male passengers in the vehicle-one was seated in the front, the other in the rear. At the trooper's request, the operator produced the vehicle's registration, but she did not have her license and said it was at her home. The operator appeared to have a \"droopy\" look to her face and her speech was slurred. The trooper, who is a certified drug recognition\n   expert, testified that his observations suggested possible drug impairment. The operator of the vehicle, Bennett-Roberson, denied consuming alcohol but admitted that she had taken prescription medication. She did not identify the medication she had taken. The trooper then asked her to exit the vehicle to conduct field sobriety tests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b66] Bennett-Roberson was arrested for operating under the influence (Class D), 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2411(1-A)(A)(1) (2018), and operating a motor vehicle without a license (Class E), 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1251(1)(A) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b67] On February 28, 2018, Bennett-Roberson filed a motion to suppress all evidence stemming from the stop of her vehicle. She argued that the trooper lacked a reasonable and articulable suspicion to initiate the stop and did not have a reasonable and articulable suspicion to order her out of the vehicle to conduct further investigation-including field sobriety testing-because his suspicion that an intoxicated male was operating the vehicle dissipated as soon as he realized that the operator was a female.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State argued that the trooper was justified in initiating the stop and in ordering Bennett-Roberson out of the vehicle because his order was reasonably related to the basis for the initial stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b68] The court granted Bennett-Roberson's motion, concluding that the initial seizure-the vehicle stop-was valid, but the subsequent investigatory seizure-the license check and the trooper's order that she exit the vehicle-was not, and suppressed \"[a]ll evidence gathered from the point at which the [trooper] determined the driver of the vehicle to be a female.\" The court reasoned that, as soon as the trooper realized that the driver was female, the \"basis for the stop ceased to exist\" because his concerns that an intoxicated male was operating the vehicle under the influence were \"no longer supported\" by the facts then available to him. The State filed a timely notice of appeal with the approval of the Attorney General, pursuant to 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2115-A(1), (5) (2018) and M.R. App. P. 21(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b69] Neither party challenges the facts found by the court. The State disputes only the court's legal conclusion that the trooper's investigation after the stop was not reasonable because it was not supported by the information underpinning the trooper's justification for the initial stop-that an intoxicated male was operating the vehicle. When a court grants a motion to suppress based on undisputed facts and the only question involves a legal conclusion, we review the motion court's decision de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because neither party challenges\n   the validity of the initial stop on appeal, we address only the second part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b611] The reasonableness of an officer's actions after an initial seizure is measured by \"a weighing of the gravity of the public concerns served by the seizure, the degree to which the seizure advances the public interest, and the severity of the interference with individual liberty.\"\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11313043\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/606/793/#p795\">\n    606 A.2d at 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

The reasonableness of an officer's post-seizure actions is not limited to the reason for the stop; if, during an otherwise valid stop, an \"officer discovers additional evidence of possible wrongdoing, he may expand his inquiry as suggested by this new information.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Hill\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   an officer observed a truck being driven with no rear bumper or discernible rear license plate, which is a traffic violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11313043\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/606/793/#p795\">\n    606 A.2d at 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And, in each case, we held that the officer's subsequent act of requesting the operator's license and the vehicle's registration information was reasonably related to the circumstances justifying the initial stop because there is a strong state interest in ensuring that drivers are properly licensed and registered and the intrusion of asking a motorist for\n   such documentation is minimal.\n   <em>\n    Huether\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11460114\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/748/993/\">\n    2000 ME 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11460114\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/748/993/\">\n    748 A.2d 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11313043\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/606/793/#p795\">\n    606 A.2d at 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b615] Here, the motion court concluded that once the trooper realized that the operator was not the male he initially suspected of operating under the influence, the \"basis for the stop ceased to exist\" because the trooper's concerns were \"no longer supported by any information\" available to him at the time of the stop. The court's analysis was incomplete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b616] Contrary to the court's determination, the basis for the stop did not cease to exist the moment the trooper realized that the operator was a female.
