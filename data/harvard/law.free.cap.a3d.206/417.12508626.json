Similarly, the Introductory Statement to the 1954 Senate Bill, which first extended the tax exemption to widows, provided, \"This bill is designed to continue the exemption of the dwelling house of certain disabled veterans to their widows during widowhood and while they are residents of New Jersey.\"\n   <em>\n    Introductory Statement to S. 19\n   </em>\n   3 (L. 1954, c. 148). The language pertaining to the exemption's cessation upon remarriage applies to both section 54:4-3.30(b)(1) and section 54:4-3.30(b)(2), which contain almost identical terms, including the phrase \"during the surviving spouse's widowhood or widowerhood.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Tax Court emphasized that a committee statement to a 1977 amendment permitted a widow to \"carry the exemption with her to any dwelling house she may acquire, with the requirement retained that she be residing in the dwelling house and not\n   remarried.\"\n   <em>\n    S.

The court apparently repeated the misquote as evidenced by its added emphasis and subsequent question: \"Does 'has not remarried' mean 'is not remarried' or 'unmarried' as in the present tense, so as to permit a suspension of the exemption during a remarriage? Or does it mean 'has not ever remarried' in the past tense, resulting in the extinguishment of the exemption upon remarriage?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20N.J.%20Tax%20200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20N.J.%20Tax%20200\">\n    at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Given that deference, the regulations persuade us that the statutory exemption scheme contemplates the exemption ends upon a surviving\n   spouse's remarriage.
