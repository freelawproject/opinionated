Specifically, we are asked to determine whether rockweed is private property that belongs to the adjoining upland landowner who owns the intertidal soil in fee simple, or property that is held in trust by the State through the\n   <em>\n    jus publicum\n   </em>\n   for the public to harvest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b62] Acadian Seaplants, Ltd., appeals from a summary judgment entered by the Superior Court (Washington County,\n   <em>\n    Stewart, J.\n   </em>\n   ) in favor of Kenneth W. Ross, Carl E. Ross, and Roque Island Gardner Homestead Corporation (collectively, Ross), who are owners of upland property where-without the landowners' permission-Acadian has harvested rockweed that is attached to the intertidal land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its judgment, the court declared that rockweed growing in the intertidal zone is the private property of the upland property owners. We agree that rockweed in the intertidal zone belongs to the upland property owner and therefore is not public property, is not held in trust by the State for public use, and cannot be harvested by members of the public as a matter of right. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I.

The most abundant of the species is known by the scientific name\n   <em>\n    Ascophyllum nodosum\n   </em>\n   and is often found on rocks and ledges in the intertidal portions of Maine's seacoast. Rockweed is a plant. It does not grow in intertidal sand but obtains its nutrients from the surrounding seawater and air. Rockweed attaches to\n   hard, stable objects such as ledges and rocks using a disc-like structure called a holdfast. The sole function of the holdfast is to secure the rockweed in place by penetrating the surface of substrate by up to four millimeters. A rockweed's holdfast typically remains intact and attached to a substrate for decades, allowing rockweed to generate new growth. If the rockweed becomes detached from a substrate, it cannot reattach its holdfast to a different substrate and will float freely in the water or be cast onto the land. Rockweed, which is typically two to four feet in length but can grow to be more than six feet, is important to Maine's coastline ecology because it moderates temperatures and provides a habitat for marine organisms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b65] Acadian is a commercial entity that operates in Maine and Nova Scotia and harvests rockweed from the Maine intertidal zone for use in various commercial products, such as fertilizer and animal feed. Acadian harvests rockweed during mid-tide, using three-to-four-ton-capacity skiffs and specially designed cutting rakes. During the harvesting operation, Acadian operates the watercraft in intertidal waters without walking or traveling on the intertidal land itself. The Department of Marine Resources regulates the harvest of rockweed in Cobscook Bay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12 M.R.S. \u00a7 6803-C (2018) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12142687\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/497/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6001(7), (13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Acadian annually harvests the statutory maximum 17 percent of eligible harvestable rockweed biomass in Cobscook Bay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12142687\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/497/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6803-C(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b66] Ross owns coastal intertidal property on Cobscook Bay, and Acadian has harvested rockweed from Ross's intertidal property without his consent. In December of 2015, Ross commenced this action by filing a two-count complaint against Acadian, seeking, in Count 1, a declaratory judgment that he exclusively owns the rockweed growing on and affixed to his intertidal property, and, in Count 2, injunctive relief that would prohibit Acadian from harvesting rockweed from his intertidal land without his permission. Acadian's answer to the complaint included a counterclaim for a judgment declaring that harvesting rockweed from the intertidal water is a form of \"fishing\" and \"navigation\" within the meaning of the Colonial Ordinance and is therefore a public right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment predicated on a joint statement of material facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 56. In March of 2017, after holding a hearing, the court (\n   <em>\n    Stewart, J.\n   </em>\n   ) granted Ross's motion in part by entering summary judgment for Ross on his request for declaratory judgment in Count 1 of his complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court also entered judgment for Ross on Acadian's counterclaim and denied Acadian's motion. Ross then moved to dismiss Count 2 of the complaint, and the court granted the motion without objection from Acadian, resulting in the entry of a final judgment. Acadian filed a timely notice of appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14 M.R.S. \u00a7 1851 (2018) ; M.R.

Then we apply the more expansive \"common law\" approach urged by the Chief Justices and the concurrence to this opinion and address whether the common law permits the public to harvest rockweed as an activity that constitutes a \"reasonable balance\" between the public's rights within the intertidal zone and the private property interests held by the upland property owner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 57.

Although there is a navigational component to harvesting rockweed, it is secondary to what Acadian seeks to do. Rather, the harvesters operate the skiffs in intertidal waters for the principal purpose of engaging in a different, nonnavigation activity, namely, cutting and taking significant portions of rockweed plants. The harvesting of rockweed, even by boat, involves the use of the intertidal land itself because living rockweed is attached to the intertidal substrate even if it does not draw nutrients from the land. Therefore, Acadian uses the intertidal waters not for \"navigation\" in its own right, but merely to gain access to the attached rockweed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gerrish v.

Harvesting rockweed from the intertidal land is therefore not within the collection of rights held in trust by the State, and members of the public are not entitled to engage in that activity as a matter of right. And because neither view of the public's right to use the intertidal zone accommodates the activity at issue here, we determine-contrary to the position of the concurring justices-that this case does not present us with the occasion to consider the vitality of the holding in\n   <em>\n    Bell II\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   SAUFLEY, C.J., with whom MEAD and GORMAN, JJ., join, concurring in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   [\u00b634] In 1989, the Law Court, in a sharply divided opinion, made a regrettable error, limiting public access to the intertidal zones on Maine's beaches in\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

No authority, however, is offered for that assertion.

Setting aside the question of whether, for purposes of determining the scope of intertidal rights, commercial activities can be equated with recreational activities, the core principle urged by the dissent was drawn from the lessons of our case law, including\n    <em>\n     Hill\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7883156\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/557/168/#p170\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7883156\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/557/168/#p170\">\n     at 181-89\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
