The District presents the following issues for this Court's review: (1) whether CAB arbitrarily and capriciously disregarded record evidence; (2) whether CAB's decision is erroneous because it is contrary to law, is not supported by substantial evidence, and disregards I-Lead's failure to comply with the academic performance requirements in the State Board of Education's Regulations and academic goals set forth in I-Lead's charter application; (3) whether CAB committed an error of law by concluding that it cannot decide if I-Lead violated the Sunshine Act;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (4) whether CAB erred when it concluded that I-Lead did not violate the Public Official and Employee Ethics Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ethics Act); and (5) whether CAB's decision regarding I-Lead's compliance with\n   highly-qualified teacher\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   requirements (HQT) was erroneous. After review, we vacate and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The District operates Reading Senior High School (RSHS), which serves approximately 3,500 students in grades 10 through 12. I-Lead, Inc. is a Pennsylvania nonprofit corporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   I-Lead is a charter school that was established in the District in 2010 and which operates pursuant to the Charter School Law (CSL).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   I-Lead is the only charter school within the District's boundaries. I-Lead's mission is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [I-Lead] empowers youth age 17 and up who have dropped out of school and appear on the off-roll list to be self-sufficient members of the 21st Century economy as effective leaders, creative entrepreneurs, and engaged citizens. At [I-Lead], leadership, citizenship, academics, and work experience are integrated, and responsibility for learning and leading is shared among the youth, the staff, families, and the community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 319a. I-Lead's target students include individuals 17 to 21 who are not attending school, students who are enrolled but truant, enrolled students at risk of dropping out, and individuals experiencing hardships and challenges such as,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , court adjudications, addiction, homelessness, abuse and pregnancy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 707a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 27, 2010, the District approved Resolution Gen-55 which granted I-Lead's charter application (Charter Application)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   for a 3-year term, but directed I-Lead to provide classes for students in grades 9 through 12. I-Lead and the District executed a charter agreement (Charter Agreement) which imposed specific responsibilities upon I-Lead, including: complying with the CSL, complying with secondary education curriculum requirements, and \"observ[ing] the provisions of the [Charter Application.]\" R.R. at 331a. The Charter Agreement further mandated that \"[I-Lead] will provide education for grades 9 through 12 but will give preference in enrollment to [dropout] students consistent with its [Charter A]pplication.\" R.R. at 331a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In October 2013, the District renewed I-Lead's charter for a 5-year term (July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2019). Although a new charter agreement was not proposed following the October 2013 renewal vote, approximately 10 months later, by August 8, 2014 letter, the District proposed a new charter agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 5, 2015, the District's counsel Allison S. Petersen (Petersen) sent a letter to I-Lead's counsel, Robert W. O'Donnell\n   (O'Donnell), threatening to \"move forward with [charter] revocation proceedings\" based on numerous concerns with I-Lead's operation. R.R. at 305a. Petersen described I-Lead's students' academic performance as \"deficient and not in accordance with the intent of the [CSL].\" R.R. at 304a. Petersen also expressed concern with I-Lead's failure to take \"steps to ensure that all of [I-Lead's] teaching staff are highly qualified as required under federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on I-Lead's bylaws, board meeting minutes and other documents, Petersen further accused that I-Lead was \"not operating in accordance with the [CSL], the Sunshine Act, the Ethics Act or [I-Lead's] own bylaws.\" R.R. at 305a. Petersen voiced concerns with I-Lead, Inc.'s involvement in I-Lead's management, and the sharing of common board members between the two entities. Petersen also expressed that I-Lead's board members' statements of financial interest were incomplete and some members had failed to file them at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based thereon, Petersen explained that the District was preparing a resolution to present at its June 25, 2015 meeting to revoke I-Lead's charter. Notwithstanding, Petersen proposed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   To avoid the time and expense of revocation proceedings, the [ ] District is willing to make one more attempt to reach a resolution on [the implementation of accountability] standards.\n   <strong>\n    If\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    I-Lead\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    agrees to\n   </strong>\n   [certain enumerated]\n   <strong>\n    accountability terms and conditions\n   </strong>\n   as part of a renewal charter acceptable to the [ ] District, the term of which would be from the 2014-[20]15 school year through the 2018-2019 school year ('Renewal Term'),\n   <strong>\n    the\n   </strong>\n   [ ]\n   <strong>\n    District would agree to forego revocation at this time and continue to monitor the performance and operations of\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    I-Lead\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    during the Renewal Term.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   R.R. at 305a-306a (emphasis added). On June 15, 2015, O'Donnell responded, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Please be advised that there is no management contract or other financial agreement between [I-Lead and I-Lead, Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ] The role of I[-]Lead[,] Inc. has purely been that of a donor. I[-]Lead[,] Inc. has funded [I-Lead] in a variety of ways and has never realized any gain nor was any gain intended. For example, the lease which your client already has provides that there is\n   <strong>\n    effectively no rent\n   </strong>\n   charged by I[-]Lead[,] Inc. The only payment is for operating expenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The only 'money changing hands' that you refer to is the advancement of funds by I[-]Lead[,] Inc. to [I-Lead] to meet cash flow needs. These funds are lent\n   <strong>\n    without interest\n   </strong>\n   . There is simply no basis for the sinister implications in your letter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   As far as academic performance is concerned, as you are well aware,\n   <em>\n    the priority for enrollment at [I-Lead] is drop[ ]out status. These students start from well behind the conventional enrollee and to impose unrealistic performance standards creates inevitable conflict later on.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Your letter unequivocally threatens revocation proceedings which my client believes unnecessarily creates more conflict and expense and undermines their [sic] efforts to serve their [sic] students.\n   <em>\n    Therefore, [I-Lead] is prepared, albeit under duress, to sign the charter agreement as proposed in your letter.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   R.R. at 263a (underline emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On September 21, 2015, I-Lead submitted a request to amend its charter (Amendment Request) to \"clarify the terms of its charter[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.R. at 238a. On September 23, 2015, (just two days after I-Lead submitted its Amendment Request, only three months after the District proposed to \"forego revocation\" and I-Lead accepted the District's proposed terms, and just two years after the District renewed I-Lead's charter), the District's Board of School Directors (District's Board) approved a resolution initiating revocation proceedings against I-Lead. R.R. at 306a. The resolution referenced as grounds for revocation the same concerns raised in Petersen's June 5, 2015 letter. Specifically, the District's Board specified in Charge 1 that I-Lead \"\n   <em>\n    [f]ail[ed] to meet the requirements for student performance set forth in [Chapter 5 of State Board of Education's Regulations,] 22 P[a.] Code Ch. 5 (relating to curriculum) or subsequent regulations promulgated to replace 22 P[a.] Code Ch. 5, or fail[ed] to meet any performance standards set forth in the written charter.\n   </em>\n   \" R.R. at 311a. The District's Board averred in Charge 2 that I-Lead \"\n   <em>\n    [v]iolat[ed] [ ] provisions of the [CSL] and/or any provisions of law which the charter school has not been exempted, including federal laws and regulations governing children with disabilities.\n   </em>\n   \" R.R. at 312a. The District's Board alleged in Charge 3 that I-Lead \"\n   <em>\n    [f]ail[ed] to meet generally[-]accepted standards of fiscal management or audit requirements.\n   </em>\n   \" R.R. at 313a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The District's Board appointed a hearing examiner who held hearings on both the Amendment Request and the revocation proceedings on January 21 and 22, 2016 and February 2, 5, 8 and 9, 2016. During a 30-day public comment period which followed the hearings, 987 written communications were submitted\n   <strong>\n    supporting\n   </strong>\n   I-Lead.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 18, 2016, the District granted in part and denied in part the Amendment Request. On May 25, 2016, the District's Board voted to revoke I-Lead's charter based on Charges 1 and 2. On June 23, 2016, I-Lead filed with CAB a petition appealing the charter revocation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 16, 2016, pursuant to Section 1729-A(d) of the CSL,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   I-Lead filed a motion to\n   supplement the record (I-Lead Motion) with the following documents: (1) minutes and attachments from I-Lead's Board of Trustees' 2016 public meetings; (2) August and September 2016 letters of support from public officials; (3) 2016 statements of financial interest filed by I-Lead board members and administrators; and (4) I-Lead Board of Trustees' meeting minutes from January and March 2014. I-Lead also requested a hearing at which former I-Lead Board chair and Executive Director, President and CEO of I-Lead, Inc. David Castro (Castro) would testify regarding the independent committee that negotiated the lease for I-Lead's building and the discussions held at public meetings pertaining to those lease transactions. On November 21, 2016, the District filed a motion to supplement the record\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   (District Motion) with I-Lead's and the District's 2015-2016 Specific Performance Profile (SPP)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   scores released by the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) on October 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On January 3, 2017, CAB's hearing examiner denied I-Lead's Motion because its documents were not relevant and/or were not previously unavailable, and granted the District's Motion because the SPP data was relevant and previously unavailable. Subsequently, I-Lead submitted, and the hearing examiner granted, a motion to supplement the record with Citadel Intermediate High School's (Citadel)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   2016 SPP scores released by the PDE on October 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On June 13, 2017, CAB granted I-Lead's appeal from the District's charter revocation. CAB explained its rationale for supplementing the evidence as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The 2015-2016 SPP [scores] of I-L[ead] and the [District], which were released by PDE on October 27, 2016, were\n   <strong>\n    previously unavailable and are directly relevant to the issue of I-L\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    ead\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    's academic performance.\n   </strong>\n   CAB has considered SPP data in its revocation and nonrenewal cases since the SPP system took effect in Pennsylvania.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   CAB Op. at 24 (citations omitted; emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On the merits, CAB held that I-Lead's students had demonstrated significant improvement and accordingly, I-Lead had satisfied the CSL's performance requirements. CAB also ruled that I-Lead's failure to meet HQT requirements was not alone sufficient to deny I-Lead's charter. In addition, CAB noted that I-Lead acknowledged its Sunshine Act violations and the record showed improvement with its compliance, but concluded that CAB did \"not [ ] have jurisdiction over open meeting challenges for local agencies.\" CAB Op. at 29. Thus, CAB \"[could not] consider these alleged Sunshine [Act] violations in determining whether or not I-L[ead]'s charter should be revoked.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. CAB further determined that I-Lead's alleged Ethics Act violations did not warrant charter revocation because although there was commingling between I-Lead and I-Lead, Inc., there was no evidence that anyone was enriched by it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   CAB explained that although it does not have jurisdiction to hear Ethics Act violations, it \"can take into consideration [lack of compliance] in determining governance issues,\" and rejected the District's argument that I-Lead's Board members' failure to file financial disclosure statements should be attributed to I-Lead.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. The District timely appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

CAB analyzed I-Lead's academic performance and distinguished critical factors as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   I-L[ead] is unique in that it actively recruits students who are 'at-risk' for dropping out of school or failing, and enrolls students who are pregnant, have been adjudicated by the courts, are truant, and/or have significant issues that impede their ability to function in a traditional school setting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   The significant factor in deciding if I-L[ead]'s charter should be revoked is whether I-L[ead] has shown that it can increase academic performance in those students that it has undertaken to educate - students who are 'at-risk' for\n   dropping out of school or failing. In fact, I-L[ead] originally applied to provide a charter school to grades 11 and 12. When the [District] granted the charter, it added grades 9 and 10. This changed the need to provide comprehensive high school services that [I-Lead] was not previously prepared to provide. I-L[ead] has improved its attendance rates and has significantly increased its enrollment from 205 to 520.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   The CSL encourages the establishment of schools to serve a variety of purposes. It was enacted to create a system of independent, mission-driven public schools that operate outside of the school district structure. 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1702-A. Our prior interpretation requiring proficient or above proficient achievement on state standardized tests is not wholly applicable to a case in which the [c]harter [s]chool educates students who are dropouts, at significant risk of dropping out, who have been out of the school system, or who have other significant issues that impede traditional learning such as early pregnancy, a history of crime or delinquency, and social-emotional issues. While academic progress is absolutely expected, it is inappropriate to expect exactly the same achievement on standardized tests when the pool of students and the mission of the charter school is so different from the public school. The comparison between I-L[ead], which serves students in grades nine through twelve, is simply not a perfect comparison with the RSHS which serves students in grades ten through twelve. We do not agree with the [District] that a different grade configuration is 'irrelevant when making that comparison.' Similarly, based upon a review of the evidence, CAB does not agree with the [District] that I-L[ead] has made 'insignificant progress' given its pool of students.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   The strong support from community members including a State Representative, a State Senator, a County Commissioner, members of the Reading City Council, and, most especially, parents of students at I-L[ead] is also noteworthy. Taken as a whole, I-L[ead] provides a service to a significant pool of students in this community and should be given more time to improve its academic performance, especially considering that I-L[ead's] ... revocation proceedings [were instituted] only two years into its five-year renewal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   The facts in this record support the conclusion that I-L[ead]'s students have shown improvement, and CAB believes it should be given additional time because of the at-risk population the charter school serves. Because the legislative mandate of the CSL is to increase learning opportunities for all students and to improve pupil performance of all students, I-L[ead] has this statutory obligation to do so. CAB strongly urges I-L[ead] to continue on the path of improvement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   CAB Op. at 26-28 (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The District argues that CAB's analysis is erroneous because it \"applied an exception to Chapter 4 standards that\n   the CSL does not condone.\" District Br. at 38. Specifically, the District contends that CAB erred by disregarding established academic standards because of I-Lead's focus on at-risk students: \"Never before has CAB ever taken the position that different standards should apply to such schools, or that these schools should be given a pass on the standards imposed on everyone else.\" District Br. at 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Contrary to the District's characterization, CAB did\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   \"appl[y] an exception to Chapter 4 standards[,]\" but, instead, in conducting its\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, simply exercised the independent judgment and discretion that the CSL authorizes. District Br. at 38. The record is clear that the CSL did not explicitly mandate that I-Lead's charter be revoked, and CAB considered I-Lead's academic performance, weighed the CSL's purpose, and evaluated I-Lead's mission, student and community benefits and strong community support. Based thereon, with the exception of its failing to consider the 2015-2016 academic performance\n   data, we hold that CAB properly exercised its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

(the two entities have common board members and/or administrators and do not have a written contract that delineates each entity's responsibilities to the other or payment terms); and (2) I-L[ead] violated the [CSL], the Sunshine Act and its own Bylaws in that decisions relegated to the Board of Trustees are being made by others outside the public realm, 'including decisions about budgeting, contracts and leases ....' It is the overlap of board members and administrators involved with both I-L[ead] and I-L[ead], Inc. which is the underlying problem.

A 'conflict of interest' is defined by the Ethics Act as '[u]se by a public official or public employee of the authority of his office or employment or any confidential information received through his holding public office or employment\n   <em>\n    for the private pecuniary benefit\n   </em>\n   of himself, a member of his immediate family or a business with which he or a member of his immediate family is associated ....' 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102 (emphasis added).

Such a process includes prior public notice and subsequent public disclosure of\n   all proposals considered and contracts awarded. 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102.

Financial Disclosure Forms\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Further, this Court finds no merit to the District's argument that I-Lead's officials' and employees' failure to file financial disclosure statements justifies charter revocation.

Sunshine Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The District next asserts that CAB erred when it refused to consider I-Lead's alleged Sunshine Act violations as a basis for charter revocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Section 1716-A(c) of the CSL, 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1716-A(c), mandates that a charter school's board of trustees must comply with the Sunshine Act. In support of its argument that I-Lead repeatedly failed to comply with the Sunshine Act, the District referenced I-Lead's nonpublic decisions such as its adoption of its annual budget, expenditures to lease school facilities, employees' hiring and employment termination, decisions to borrow large sums of money and the repayment of such loans. In response, CAB stated: \"The courts of common pleas, not CAB, have jurisdiction over open meeting challenges for local agencies. The remedy is a legal challenge within thirty days of an alleged violation of the Sunshine Act[.] There is no evidence on this record that the [District] made such a legal challenge.\" CAB Op. at 29-30 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Notwithstanding, CAB acknowledged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   I-L[ead]'s Board [of Trustees] held only three to four meetings a year, and the [District] introduced copies of every meeting minute supplied by I-L[ead]. The [I-Lead] Board [m]inutes admitted into the record show some attempted compliance with the [CSL]. Six sets of minutes from the 2013-[20]14 school year and half of the 2014-[20]15 school year do show that: (1) each meeting was advertised in accordance with the notice requirements of the Sunshine [Act]; (2) the Board [of Trustees] discussed and approved financial reports, and the school's financial position on the record at each meeting; (3) the Board [of Trustees] created an Executive Committee of the school to handle day-to-day operations and matters arising between meetings of the Board [of Trustees]; (4) the Board [of Trustees] approved restructuring, employee resignations, and staffing requests from the Executive Committee; and (5) the Board [of Trustees] voted on important matters such as amending the by-laws to establish an independent committee for facility negotiations and electing Dr. Natalini as Board [of Trustees] chair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    I-L[ead] admits to minutes-recording errors in the past and contends that it has worked to correct Sunshine [Act] violations by receiving training on how properly to [sic] record public meeting minutes, and has posted those minutes to its website following each meeting of the Board [of Trustees] since the hearings below.

Highly-Qualified Teachers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Finally, the District contends that I-Lead's failure to adhere to HQT requirements was further justification for I-Lead's charter revocation, and that CAB failed to give sufficient weight to the issue. The District first maintains that CAB's factual findings are inconsistent with respect to the percentage of I-Lead's HQTs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Regardless of any inconsistencies in its factual findings, CAB's opinion makes clear that it acknowledged that \"I-Lead did not always meet the HQT requirements.\" CAB Op. at 28. CAB further explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   Even the [District] concedes that these violations alone would not be significant enough to warrant revocation of the charter. The employment of HQTs is not a significant, fundamental, or material reason to revoke a charter.... These HQT violations should be considered, but only if they constitute a part of a wider pattern of significant violations of law by I-L[ead] will they constitute sufficient evidence to revoke I-L[ead]'s charter.\n   <strong>\n    Therefore, this evidence will be considered along with the evidence of other alleged violations.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   CAB Op. at 29 (citations omitted; emphasis added). Thus, CAB properly considered I-Lead's lack of compliance with HQT requirements. It weighed that evidence as a factor when it exercised its independent judgment and discretion, as permitted by the CSL.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, this Court discerns no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Based on the foregoing, this Court vacates CAB's order and remands this matter to CAB to consider the matter anew with the inclusion of the following additional information: I-Lead's 2015-2016 academic performance data (including SPP score and Keystone Exam proficiency percentages), its dropout and graduation rates and its compliance with its Charter Application's academic goals. Based thereon, CAB is to render a new decision on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   For all of the above reasons, CAB's order is vacated, and the matter is remanded to CAB for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   AND NOW, this 14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of March, 2019, the Pennsylvania State Charter\n   School Appeal Board's (CAB) December 20, 2017 order is vacated, and the matter is remanded to CAB for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Jurisdiction is relinquished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   DISSENTING OPINION BY JUDGE COHN JUBELIRER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Because I would conclude the Pennsylvania State Charter School Appeal Board (CAB) did not err or abuse its discretion in holding that the revocation of I-Lead Charter School's (I-Lead) Charter was not warranted based on its holistic consideration of the evidence before it, the alleged violations of, among other statutes, the Sunshine Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the unique nature and needs of I-Lead's mission and student population, and the considerable community support for I-Lead, I would affirm CAB's Order.

Cmwlth. 2014). Taking these legislative mandates to heart, I-Lead established its school in 2010 \"with a mission to provide former students who had dropped out of school and other at-risk students,\" such as those who were truant, pregnant, had been adjudicated delinquent by the courts, or had other issues that impacted their ability to function in traditional school settings, \"with an educational option to finish high school.\" (CAB Opinion (Op.) at 1; Finding of Fact (FOF) \u00b6 2.) It applied to provide education for only 11th and 12th grades, but when the Reading School District (District) granted the Charter, it added 9th and 10th grades to the school, grades for which I-Lead had not been prepared to offer. (CAB Op. at 26.) Because \"[n]inth grade is a significant year in which students drop-out or get off-track,\" the addition of these grades did not change the focus of I-Lead's mission. (FOF \u00b6 36.) I-Lead proceeded with its mission to provide an educational option to at-risk students, beginning with 205 students in the 2011-12 school year, a number that has increased to 520 by 2015. (CAB Op. at 26; FOF \u00b6\u00b6 4, 22.) With these legislative purposes and I-Lead's mission in mind, CAB considered the District's decision to revoke I-Lead's Charter five years after it began operating and a mere two years after the District renewed that Charter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   In its decision, CAB acknowledged, as we all must, the importance of a charter school's ability to meet academic performance requirements, stating that \"academic progress is absolutely expected.\" (CAB Op. at 27.) But, CAB also recognized that a\n   <strong>\n    direct\n   </strong>\n   comparison of charter schools and traditional schools as a means of measuring academic performance and improvement\n   <strong>\n    may not be appropriate in all cases\n   </strong>\n   . Without considering, among other factors, the differences in the grade levels served and the unique characteristics and needs of the enrolled student populations, such direct comparisons may become \"over-simplified.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27.) In reflecting on such comparisons, CAB reasoned\n   that \"it is inappropriate to expect exactly the same achievement on standardized tests when the pool of students and the mission of the charter school [are] so different from the public school.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) Thus, CAB took a holistic approach to resolving the question before it, considering, in addition to the academic performance of I-Lead's students over the years, the particular at-risk student population served by I-Lead, the need for this type of educational option, and the community support for its continued operation. I agree that this approach can be, in some circumstances, an appropriate way of ascertaining whether the revocation of a charter is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The Majority holds that CAB \"deliberate[ly] disregard[ed] ... relevant evidence by failing to consider the 2015-2016 [School Performance Profiles (SPP) ] data in deciding whether to revoke I-Lead's charter,\" which reflected a decrease in proficiency scores.\n   <em>\n    Reading Sch. Dist. v. I-Lead Charter Sch.\n   </em>\n   , 206 A.3d 27, 36-37,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201179160\">\n    2019 WL 1179160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 2019) (internal quotation omitted). However, nothing in CAB's decision suggests to me that it disregarded any particular test score or data set in making that decision. Instead, CAB noted that it had considered all of the evidence before it,\n   <strong>\n    including the supplemental evidence\n   </strong>\n   claimed to have been disregarded by the Majority, and was satisfied that, \"given I-L[ead]'s focus and mission to educate at-risk students,\" I-Lead had made \"improvement in student performance in the last several school years.\" (CAB Op. at 26, 34; Conclusion of Law \u00b6 14.) That CAB did not directly cite the statistics from the 2015-2016 School Year in its opinion does not mean CAB disregarded that evidence. Rather, CAB's decision reflects, and the record supports, that \"I-L[ead]'s students have shown improvement.\" (CAB Op. at 28.) Citing the legislative mandate to increase learning opportunities for\n   <strong>\n    all students\n   </strong>\n   , the student improvement shown, the improved dropout rates, and the strong community support for I-Lead, CAB, in its expertise, concluded that I-Lead \"should be given additional time\" \"to improve its academic performance, especially considering that [the District] instituted revocation proceedings only two years into [I-Lead's] five-year renewal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Moreover, the Majority's analysis suggests that a direct comparison with Reading Senior High School (RSHS) is required to determine whether I-Lead's students have achieved the requisite level of academic performance that would allow I-Lead to retain its Charter.\n   <em>\n    Reading Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   , 206 A.3d at 39-40 and n.26 (comparing the test scores, dropout rates, and graduation rates of I-Lead to RSHS and stating \"I-Lead's proficiency rates for the relevant school years were clearly significantly lower than RSHS's rates\"). However, as CAB observed in its decision, RSHS does not serve 9th graders, the population that is often most at risk for dropping out of school or getting off track. (FOF \u00b6\u00b6 23, 36; CAB Op. at 26-27.) I agree with CAB that a direct comparison of I-Lead and RSHS is not reasonable given their different student populations and missions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   As observed by the Majority, Section 1729-A(a)(2) of the CSL, 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1729-A(a)(2), permits, but\n   <strong>\n    does not require\n   </strong>\n   , the revocation or non-renewal of a charter based on the failure to meet student academic performance standards.\n   <em>\n    Reading Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   , 206 A.3d at 37-38, 40. Despite this observation and its recognition that \"CAB was free to consider numerous factors and to exercise its independent discretion in reaching its decision,\" the Majority would still remand this matter for CAB to issue a new decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-43. In doing\n   so, the Majority is not saying that CAB must come to a different result, but that it must mention the 2015-2016 School Year scores in its decision. Thus, CAB could still find, as it already has, that revocation of I-Lead's Charter was not warranted given a holistic review of the evidence. Under these circumstances, I believe a remand is unnecessary and that the Court should defer to CAB's expertise and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Further, I note the practical implications of a remand for CAB to issue a new decision addressing issues that I would conclude have been adequately and correctly resolved in the present decision. CAB's remand decision will likely be followed by another appeal, resulting in the diversion of additional funds that could be otherwise used for the education of both the District's and I-Lead's students. And, continued proceedings challenging I-Lead's operation will continue to cast a shadow on I-Lead's ability to provide additional educational opportunities to the at-risk students it has chosen to educate. These practical implications deserve consideration in determining whether a remand is warranted in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Finally, I note my agreement with the Majority that the District's argument that CAB erred in refusing to consider I-Lead's alleged Sunshine Act violations is without merit.\n   <em>\n    Reading Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   , 206 A.3d at 46-48. However, I do so primarily because I agree with CAB that it lacks jurisdiction to consider whether a violation of the Sunshine Act has occurred in the first instance, as such determinations fall within the jurisdiction of the local court of common pleas. (CAB Op. at 29-30);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section 715 of the Sunshine Act, 65 Pa.

In addition, Castro testified:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n    [L]ooking at the data[,] ... there was a significant problem with students exiting the District when they turned 17.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-218\">\n    And we believed at the time that there were a ... significant number of students that had earned significant credits in the 9th and 10th grade, but they were then dropping out, and that we would be able to serve them in the 11th and 12th grade, and this fit very well with our mission to try to help low income learners to go to college.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-219\">\n    R.R. at 680a. Castro expounded:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n    [W]e knew we were focusing on a population that is very low[-]performing academically. We knew that we were trying to reach out to students that were disconnected from [s]chool and that, perhaps, had been out of [s]chool for a[ ]while, and we expected them to be presenting with severe academic deficits.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    R.R. at 685a. When asked if I-Lead enrolled such students, Castro stated: \"Yes, we certainly did. We got - and even more challenges than could have imagined when we were in the application phase.... I mean the students present not only with severe academic deficits, but with extraordinary social problems[.]\" R.R. at 685a.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    In response to his representation that I-Lead primarily focused on dropouts, Castro was asked how I-Lead defined that term. He explained:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n    Well, I would say we define it in several layers. The first layer would be someone that's ... not in school, who's still at an age where they [sic] can be in school. So that would be somebody who's 17 and above and who is not in school even though they're [sic] entitled to go to [s]chool until they're [sic] 21 years old.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n    So then it would be people that ... have had a substantial history of truancy... - they may be theoretically on the books somewhere, but they're actually not attending school....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n    And then the third level would be students who are at risk of dropping out, which would be people who have been in school but are not accumulating credits or are experiencing extremely poor academic performance ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n    And then I would add a final tranche to that which is students that are suffering with social issues that are likely to impede their academic engagement[.]\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-227\">\n    R.R. at 707a. When asked if he \"would agree ... that not every child enrolled by [I-Lead] falls into one of those four categories[,]\" Castro replied:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n    I actually don't agree with that. I think ... I would turn it around. I would say that there may be a small minority of students to which those categories do not apply, but I think that it is, in all likelihood,\n    <strong>\n     less than five percent of our population, and that the rest of the population would be very appropriately described by those categories that I just mentioned, fall into at least one, if not multiple of them.\n    </strong>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-229\">\n    R.R. at 707a (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"30\">\n   <p id=\"p-230\">\n    I-Lead contends that CAB was justified in not considering its performance goals since CAB found that the charter was \"not properly granted because the [District] itself unilaterally changed the design and structure of the [c]harter [s]chool by requiring it to serve grades 9 and 10[.]\" I-Lead Br. at 35. The Dissent similarly notes that the District \"added 9th and 10th grades to the school, grades for which I-Lead had not been prepared to offer.\" Dissenting Op. at 49. Further, I-Lead argues, even if the Charter Application goals applied, they \"required students to 'develop competency' in academic areas, did not require a specific statistical level of achievement, and did not apply until after the school's fifth year of operation.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6960780\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/89/731/#p739\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <strong>\n     Notwithstanding, I-Lead subsequently voluntarily signed the Charter Application\n    </strong>\n    that expressly required it to \"observe the provisions of the [Charter Application] ....\" R.R. at 331a. Further, while it is true that I-Lead's specific academic goals were to be measured after five years of operation, and the District initiated revocation proceedings at the start of I-Lead's fifth operating year, the record was supplemented at CAB's\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    proceeding with data for five full years of operation. Thus, it was appropriate for CAB to consider whether I-Lead had achieved the goals stated in the Charter Application for the five-year period including the 2015-2016 school year.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"31\">\n   <p id=\"p-231\">\n    The Charter Application \"provided that I-L[ead], Inc.

This Court recognizes CAB's independent discretion, but\n    <strong>\n     it must exercise that discretion properly\n    </strong>\n    , by considering all relevant evidence.

Dissenting Op. at 51. CAB is free to use its expertise when reviewing charter school revocation decisions. However, CAB may not capriciously disregard evidence when doing so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    65 Pa.
