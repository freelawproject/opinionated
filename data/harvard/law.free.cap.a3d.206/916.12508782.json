Specifically, the Defendant sought to impeach the State's witness with the witness' conviction of conspiracy to commit assault with a dangerous weapon in aid of racketeering and threatening to commit a crime of violence in aid of racketeering. We hold that a witness' prior convictions for\n   VICAR offenses are admissible for witness impeachment. Convictions for VICAR offenses cross the conceptual dividing line between crimes involving the basic level of dishonesty required to commit any crime and those characterized by inherent deceitfulness, furtive conduct, and disregard for societal cohesiveness. Individuals who choose to involve themselves with an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity and who choose to commit or conspire to commit violent acts with the express purpose of aiding such an enterprise are also likely willing to lie under oath, as judged by our standard outlined in\n   <em>\n    State v. Giddens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1991832\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/335/205/\">\n    335 Md. 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1991832\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/335/205/\">\n    642 A.2d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The trial court erred in excluding the witness' prior convictions for impeachment purposes at trial. However, we hold further that the exclusion of these convictions was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the Court of Special Appeals'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   affirmation of the trial court's exclusion of the convictions is reversed, but Mr. Rosales is not granted a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After we granted certiorari, the State raised for the first time the issue of jurisdiction and contended that this Court did not have jurisdiction to reach the merits. As a result, we also address this Court's jurisdiction and review our prior classification of Maryland Rule 8-202 as a \"jurisdictional\" rule that required immediate dismissal of an appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the following reasons, we determine that this Court has jurisdiction to reach the merits. Although in the past this Court has considered the thirty-day time limitation for noticing an appeal within Maryland Rule 8-202 as \"jurisdictional,\" that deadline is based on a rule and not on a statute. Therefore, the basis for dismissal for failure to file a notice of an appeal within thirty days is not lack of jurisdiction, but failure to comply with the Maryland Rules. Furthermore, appellate courts must also consider waiver and forfeiture before dismissing an appeal. As explained in detail below, jurisdiction in this case is consistent with Maryland Rule 8-202.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Underlying Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This case involves an encounter between a former member of the Mara Salvatrucha (\"MS-13\") gang, Hector Hernandez-Melendez (\"Mr. Hernandez-Melendez\"), a.k.a. \"Scrappy,\" and a group of current MS-13 members. Mr. Hernandez-Melendez was walking to his girlfriend's home on September 26, 2012 at about 7:00 p.m. through the Langley Hampshire Neighborhood Park in Langley Park, Prince George's County, Maryland. While Mr. Hernandez-Melendez was resting on a swing, Wilfredo Rosales (\"Mr. Rosales\") and six other men approached Mr. Hernandez-Melendez and asked if he was Scrappy. Mr. Hernandez-Melendez said no. The group then asked Mr. Hernandez-Melendez to lift his shirt. When Mr. Hernandez-Melendez refused, he was thrown to the ground and stabbed by someone in the group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   An ambulance transported Mr. Hernandez-Melendez to Washington Hospital Center. After Mr. Hernandez-Melendez received care for his injuries, detectives arrived and questioned him. He told the detectives that he did not recognize any of his attackers except for Mr. Rosales. He knew Mr. Rosales did not stab him but he believed that Mr. Rosales removed $ 150 from his wallet. He also believed Mr. Rosales was the instigator of the attack because Mr. Rosales was the only one in the group who would have recognized Mr. Hernandez-Melendez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Mr. Hernandez-Melendez, he \"walk[ed] through\" Mr. Rosales in 2006.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, after that encounter\n   and prior to the incident in the park, Mr. Hernandez-Melendez had not had any contact with Mr. Rosales since 2006. Mr. Hernandez-Melendez confirmed the identity of\n   Mr. Rosales through photo identification. Based upon this identification, Mr. Rosales was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. The Trial\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The State charged Mr. Rosales with nine counts related to the assault of Mr. Hernandez-Melendez. On May 30, 2013, a jury trial began in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County and Mr. Hernandez-Melendez testified in the State's case. During direct examination, Mr. Hernandez-Melendez testified about his prior experience as a member of MS-13. He stated that in his opinion, he was attacked as retaliation for testifying as a government witness against three MS-13 members in a federal homicide trial in Washington, D.C. in 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Prior to Mr. Rosales' cross-examination of Mr. Hernandez-Melendez, the trial court heard argument on the State's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to preclude Mr. Rosales from questioning Mr. Hernandez-Melendez about his 2011 conviction in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for conspiracy to commit assault with a dangerous weapon in aid of racketeering and threatening to commit a crime of violence in aid of racketeering in violation of the federal statute, Violent Crimes in Aid of Racketeering Activity (\"VICAR\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State asked the trial court to prohibit admission of the convictions under Maryland Rule 5-609. The State argued that these were convictions that could not be used to impeach his credibility, contending that these crimes were neither infamous crimes nor crimes relevant to credibility. Mr. Rosales argued that these offenses were impeachable because they were relevant to credibility and were different from other crimes of violence. The trial court granted the\n   State's motion and ruled, \"we are going to exclude any reference to his conviction, and we are going to exclude any questions as to what he was in jail for.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the conclusion of the trial, the jury deliberated and found Mr. Rosales guilty of two of the nine counts-retaliation against a witness and participation in a criminal gang. On June 26, 2013, the trial court sentenced Mr. Rosales to twelve years of imprisonment with six years suspended on the conviction for retaliation against a witness and a consecutive sentence of ten years with five years suspended on the conviction for participation in a criminal gang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Post-Trial Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Rosales filed an initial notice of appeal on October 16, 2013 and a motion to permit a notice of appeal past the filing date. The circuit court granted the motion. The initial appeal was docketed in the Court of Special Appeals as No. 1835, September Term 2013. Mr. Rosales voluntarily dismissed this appeal in October 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On September 27, 2016, Mr. Rosales filed a Petition for Postconviction Relief. Among other allegations, Mr. Rosales alleged ineffective assistance of his trial counsel because he had requested that trial counsel file an appeal and trial counsel did not timely file the appeal. A hearing on the petition was scheduled for February 1, 2017. Prior to the start of the hearing, the State agreed that Mr. Rosales was entitled to file a belated appeal. During the hearing, the State and Mr. Rosales briefly went on the record to inform the postconviction court that they had reached an agreement. Specifically, the State said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Your Honor, in this case, trial counsel filed a notice of appeal past the filing date, and then tried to get it recognized... which he wasn't able to do. We are willing to-I think it's the right thing to grant a belated appeal, and to\n   hold the rest of the post-conviction issues in abeyance for Mr. Rosales.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The postconviction court agreed to sign the proposed consent order, and the order was docketed. The consent order authorized a belated notice of appeal and ordered that the postconviction petition be withdrawn without prejudice. In the consent order, Mr. Rosales was permitted to re-file a petition \"after the appellate process is concluded, provided the filing occurs within ten (10) years from [the] original sentencing date.\" Mr. Rosales subsequently filed the belated appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In an unreported opinion filed on December 11, 2017, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that the trial court properly concluded that Mr. Hernandez-Melendez's prior convictions involved violent crimes that were not relevant to credibility and were non-impeachable crimes under Maryland Rule 5-609.\n   <em>\n    Rosales v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 2659, Sept. Term, 2016,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206312861\">\n    2017 WL 6312861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. Dec. 11, 2017). Regarding jurisdiction, the Court of Special Appeals noted in a footnote that Mr. Rosales was given a belated opportunity to file a notice of appeal through postconviction relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The footnote stated, \"[a]ppellant's initial appeal was voluntarily dismissed as untimely filed. Appellant subsequently filed a Petition for Post-Conviction Relief based on his counsel's failure to note a timely appeal, and he was given the right to file a belated notice of appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *n.1. Neither party had raised any issue about jurisdiction before the Court of Special Appeals. Mr. Rosales petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted on March 6, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Rosales presents one question for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   1. Were the complainant's prior convictions for committing violent crimes in aid of racketeering activity,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , for conspiracy to commit assault with a dangerous weapon in aid of racketeering activity and threatening to commit a crime of violence in aid of racketeering activity, admissible for purposes of impeachment under Maryland Rule 5-609 ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As explained more fully below, we answer yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On August 28, 2018, after briefing this Court on the merits, the State raised for the first time a lack of appellate jurisdiction\n   in the Court of Special Appeals and this Court and filed a Motion to Vacate and Remand with Instructions to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction. The State argued dismissal of this matter was mandatory and that the Court of Special Appeals should have never addressed the merits of this case. Mr. Rosales filed a response on September 4, 2018, arguing that the State waived any claim for lack of jurisdiction in this matter. Accordingly, we will also address the jurisdiction issue below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"The standard of appellate review of an evidentiary ruling turns on whether the trial judge's ruling was based on a pure question of law, on a finding of fact, or on an evaluation of the admissibility of relevant evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Brooks v.

Appellate Jurisdiction of this Court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the State's Motion to Vacate and Remand with Instructions to Dismiss for\n   Lack of Jurisdiction, the State argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction for two reasons. First, the consent order did not make the prerequisite findings that would warrant a court granting a belated opportunity to appeal as postconviction relief. Second, under Maryland Rule 4-407, the consent order is not a final judgment. Mr. Rosales argues that the State waived any jurisdictional claim because the State did not raise the jurisdictional issue earlier and that the postconviction proceeding was sufficient under the Maryland Rules. For the following reasons, this Court concludes it has jurisdiction to reach the merits of this case and declines to\n   vacate and remand this matter with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"In Maryland, appellate jurisdiction, except as constitutionally created, is statutorily granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Schuele v.

Appellate jurisdiction is codified in \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceeding Article (\"Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.\") of the Maryland Code, which states in its entirety:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Except as provided in \u00a7 12-302 of this subtitle, a party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court. The right of appeal exists from a final judgment entered by a court in the exercise of original, special, limited, statutory jurisdiction, unless in a particular case the right of appeal is expressly denied by law. In a criminal case, the defendant may appeal even though imposition or execution of sentence has been suspended. In a civil case, a plaintiff who has accepted a remittitur may cross-appeal from the final judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The statute contains no time provision for entry of an appeal.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 12-401(e) (\"Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, an appeal shall be taken by filing an order for appeal with the clerk of the District Court within 30 days from the date of the final judgment from which appealed.\") (illustrating a statutory time limitation in the context of an appeal from a district court to a circuit court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Currently, no statute sets forth a time limitation for an appeal from a final judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter such as this one. Instead, the time limitation is governed by the Maryland Rules. Maryland Rule 8-202(a) details\n   the time limitation for a party to file an appeal from a final judgment in the circuit court. Specifically, the Rule states, in pertinent part, \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this Rule or by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken.\" Md. R. 8-202(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This current scheme did not always exist. Until the adoption of the 1957 Maryland Code, there was a time limitation for appeals set forth in both statute and rules. Specifically, the predecessor statute to the current appellate jurisdiction statute contained a time limitation to notice an appeal. Additionally, the Maryland Rules also contained different time provisions within the Rules for noticing an appeal based on the type of action, such as a criminal or a civil action, that was appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   With the adoption of the 1957 Code, the thirty-day time limitation for appeals from\n   a circuit court to an appellate court was eliminated from the statute.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Md. Code (1951), Art. 5 \u00a7 6 (\"All appeals, or writs of errors, allowed from any judgment or determination of a court of law, to the Court of Appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of this State, other than from decisions on questions arising under the insolvent law, shall be taken within thirty days from the date of such judgment or determination....\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Md. Code (1957), Art. 5 \u00a7 6 (\"Any party may appeal to the Court of Appeals from a final decree, or order in the nature of a final decree, entered by a court of equity.\"). It is significant that from the 1957 Code to present, no statute has set forth a time limit for an appeal in a case such as this one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Thus, the General Assembly removed the time limitation for appeals in the 1957 code and this Court exclusively adopted the time limitation as a part of Maryland Rule 812.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a committee note to Maryland Rule 812, the Court's Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The committee invited attention to the fact that by this Rule the time for taking an appeal is uniformly made thirty days in all cases, civil as well as criminal. Since the adoption of this Rule a great many procedural provisions in statutes providing different times for appeal have been repealed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Thus far, this Court has failed to acknowledge this change in the statutory scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have continued to refer to the requirement of Maryland Rule 8-202(a) and its predecessors as \"jurisdictional.\" Therefore, if an appellant failed to comply with the thirty-day filing requirement, we would, in dismissing the appeal for that reason, frequently refer to a lack of \"jurisdiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Our prior case law evidences this reliance on statutory jurisdiction. In 1858, in\n   <em>\n    Porter v. Timanus\n   </em>\n   , this Court reviewed several orders and decrees from the Orphans Court for Howard County.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1859256\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/12/283/\">\n    12 Md. 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1858). At the onset of the opinion, this Court declared two of the orders \"not open for review\" and dismissed them from the appeal \"on the ground[s] that [the appeal of the orders] was not taken in thirty days, as required by the act of 1818, ch. 204, sec. 1.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1859256\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/12/283/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   , the thirty-day requirement was set forth in the statute. Therefore, a failure to comply with the statute divested this Court of authority to reach the merits of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Error arose when this Court began characterizing the thirty-day requirement as \"jurisdictional\" after the adoption of the 1957 Code. This language occurred in\n   <em>\n    Houghton v. Cty. Com'rs. of Kent Cty.\n   </em>\n   , when this Court referred to the dismissal of an appeal under the Maryland Rule 1012, now Rule 8-202(a), as a \"jurisdictional\" rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2059791\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/305/407/#p413\">\n    305 Md. 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 413,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2059791\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/305/407/#p413\">\n    504 A.2d 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986) (\"Consequently, the present appeal was taken more than thirty days from the final judgment of the circuit court.

Failure to comply with a jurisdictional time prescription, we have maintained, deprives a court of adjudicatory authority over the case, necessitating dismissal-a \"drastic\" result. The jurisdictional defect is not subject to waiver or forfeiture and may be raised at any time in the court of first instance and on direct appeal.

The mandatory claim-processing rules that the Courts promulgate on the other hand are less rigid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6023194,12457263\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/428/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As explained above, some opinions of this Court have referred to the thirty-day time limitation in the Maryland Rules as \"jurisdictional,\" failing to recognize that the thirty-day requirement no longer appears in the statute. We now recognize that Maryland Rule 8-202(a) is a claim-processing rule, and not a jurisdictional limitation on this Court. Despite this recognition, Maryland Rule 8-202(a) remains a binding rule on appellants, and this Court will continue to enforce the Rule. We are not concluding that it is inappropriate for a court to dismiss an untimely appeal. Rather, we are stating that the appropriate grounds for dismissal of an untimely appeal is to dismiss for a failure to comply with the Maryland Rules, instead of for lack of jurisdiction. Further, as the Rule is not jurisdictional, a reviewing court must examine whether waiver or forfeiture applies to a belated challenge to an untimely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Proper characterization of Maryland Rule 8-202(a) as a claim-processing rule permits us to consider the basis for review of Mr. Rosales' belated appeal. This Court has consistently recognized that a belated appeal can be granted as a postconviction remedy for constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Garrison v.

Md. R. 4-401(a). A hearing is promptly held on the petition \"unless the parties stipulate that the facts stated in the petition are true and that the facts and applicable law justify the granting of relief.\" Md. R. 4-406(a). Upon the conclusion of the hearing, \"[t]he judge shall prepare and file or dictate into the record a statement setting forth separately each ground upon which the petition is based, the federal and state rights involved, the court's ruling with respect to each ground, and the reasons for the action taken thereon.\" Md. R. 4-407(a). Additionally, the judge shall issue \"an order either granting or denying relief.\" Md. R. 4-407(b). \"The statement and order constitute a final judgment when entered by the clerk.\" Md. R. 4-407(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In this case, the postconviction court did not follow the appropriate postconviction procedures. Mr. Rosales and the State entered into a consent agreement signed by the postconviction court to permit a belated appeal. A hearing was not held on the merits of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim and the postconviction court did not issue a statement of reasons or order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Further, the consent order reserved Mr. Rosales' right to refile a postconviction petition upon the conclusion of these appellate proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Ordinarily, we would dismiss Mr. Rosales' appeal for failure to comply with the Rule's thirty-day deadline and the absence of the postconviction court's proper findings under the Postconviction Act to grant a belated appeal. However, this Court believes it is evident from the record of the postconviction hearing that the State was conceding ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to the failure of Mr. Rosales' counsel to file a timely appeal. The record indicates that Mr. Rosales, the State, and the postconviction court agreed that a belated appeal was a proper remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Further, this issue has proceeded through the appellate system without the State filing a motion under Maryland Rule 4-408 or objecting to a review on the merits by the Court of Special Appeals. \"[A] question not presented or argued in an appellant's brief is waived or abandoned and is, therefore,\n   not properly preserved for review.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hobby v.

Where the State has failed to object to the entry of the consent order during the postconviction proceedings and has failed to raise this issue before the Court of Special Appeals, the State has effectively waived any objection to the inadequate postconviction proceedings. Finally, Maryland Rule 1-201(a) states, \"[t]hese rules shall be construed to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For the reasons stated above, given the unique history of these proceedings and the apparent consent of all parties, this case presents a narrow circumstance in which we will consider the merits without the filing of a timely appeal or without the postconviction court following the appropriate postconviction process. Otherwise, a remand would inevitably result in the postconviction court making the appropriate findings under the Postconviction Act to permit Mr. Rosales to file a belated appeal, the appeal working its way up the appellate ladder, and this Court addressing the exact issue that was already briefed and argued before this Court. Therefore, we will reach the merits of this matter. We can take this step because, considering our above reconsideration of how the 30-day filing requirement relates to appellate jurisdiction, there is no jurisdictional impediment for us to do so. This is an exceptional circumstance, and this Court urges the circuit courts in the future to comply with the postconviction procedures outlined in Maryland Rule 4-401 et seq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

As previously stated, an individual convicted of a VICAR offense must act in consideration for something of pecuniary value or with the purpose of gaining entrance into, maintaining a position in, or increasing position in the enterprise to be convicted under \u00a7 1959. VICAR offenses are different from other acts of violence which we have previously held are not impeachable. Typically, one who aids a racketeering enterprise will be living \"a life of secrecy and dissembling,\" \"being prepared to say whatever is required by the demands of the moment,\" and \"pos[ing] [a] grave danger to the fabric of society ....\"\n   <em>\n    Giddens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1991832\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/335/205/\">\n    335 Md. at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1991832\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/335/205/\">\n    642 A.2d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \"At the very heart of our determination... is the kinds of conduct which give rise to this offense.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The association with others in the enterprise in a concerted effort to advance or cover up racketeering activity, not the predicate offense, that makes VICAR crimes inherently deceitful. The criminal conduct at issue is measured, planned, and entered into, not out of haste, but as a critical element of a person's membership in a racketeering enterprise. Further, much of this conduct requires secrecy and tears at the fabric of society.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, we conclude that, pursuant\n   to the standard enumerated in\n   <em>\n    Giddens\n   </em>\n   , VICAR offenses are within the \"eligible universe\" of offenses which may be used to impeach a witness' credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   While some racketeering activity under \u00a7 1961 may not qualify as an infamous crime or be otherwise relevant to a witness' credibility, on balance, the great majority of enumerated offenses meet these criteria. Many of the predicate and racketeering offenses engaged in are admissible under either the \"other crimes relevant to credibility\" or \"infamous crimes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, gang and drug distribution activity account\n   for over 60% of the racketeering activity in criminal RICO cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pamela Bucy Pierson,\n   <em>\n    RICO Trends: From Gangsters to Class Actions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20S.C.%20L.%20Rev.%20213\">\n    65 S.C.L. Rev. 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 221 (2013). On balance, Hernandez-Melendez's VICAR conviction is certainly within the \"eligible universe\" of those convictions admissible to impeach a witness' credibility, especially when viewed with an eye toward the racketeering activity most frequently engaged in by criminal enterprises. We see no principled rationale to distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Giddens\n   </em>\n   . Thus,\n   <em>\n    Giddens\n   </em>\n   should control here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Moving on to the second and third steps of the Maryland Rule 5-609 analysis, the second step requires that we ensure that the conviction is less than fifteen years old, has not been reversed or vacated, was not the subject of a pardon, and no appeal from the judgment is pending.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. R. 5-609(b)-(c). In this case, the conviction occurred in 2011 and was therefore less than fifteen years old. None of the other potential issues are applicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Under the third step, the Court must ensure that the probative value of the conviction outweighs its prejudicial impact. Md. R. 5-609(a)(2). The trial court never conducted this balancing test because it concluded that the conviction failed the first step and was not probative of credibility. The five factors relevant to assessing whether probative value outweighs prejudicial impact include: \"(1) the impeachment value of the prior crime; (2) the point in time of the conviction and the [witness'] subsequent history; (3) the similarity between the past crime and the charged crime; (4) the importance of the [witness'] testimony; and (5) the centrality of the [witness'] credibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Burnside v.

Thus, this factor weighs in favor of admission. Factor two and three, are not particularly relevant here as Mr. Hernandez-Melendez\n   was the victim, not the defendant. Factors four and five weigh heavily in favor of admitting the conviction. \"[T]he potential for unfair prejudice is less ... where the witness to be impeached with evidence of a prior conviction is not the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    King v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3491842\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/407/682/#p704\">\n    407 Md. 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 704,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3491842\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/407/682/#p704\">\n    967 A.2d 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). Mr. Hernandez-Melendez was the victim of the attack and the only witness, and he only recognized Mr. Rosales as one of his attackers because of their previous interaction in the MS-13 gang. His credibility was central to the prosecution. Therefore, we\n   conclude the factors weigh in favor of admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The final issue we must address is whether failing to allow impeachment with the criminal convictions was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Mr. Rosales argues that the case turned heavily on Mr. Hernandez-Melendez's credibility. He asserts that the exclusion of any evidence bearing on Mr. Hernandez-Melendez's credibility was harmful error. The State disagrees, noting that during the trial on numerous occasions, Mr. Hernandez-Melendez stated that he was in prison and described instances of his conduct relating to his involvement with MS-13. The only thing the jury would have learned from the admission of the convictions, the State argues, is the name of crimes for which Mr. Hernandez-Melendez was convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Typically, to determine whether the error committed by the trial court was harmless, we apply the following test:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   [W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \"harmless\" and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is not a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of-whether erroneously admitted or excluded-may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    Dorsey v.

Rosales' jury, on the other hand, had ample opportunity to learn of Mr. Hernandez-Melendez's suspect credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In the present case, the defense counsel referred to Mr. Hernandez-Melendez as \"a convicted felon\" in his opening state and as a \"gangster\" throughout the case. Mr. Hernandez-Melendez testified and admitted on numerous occasions to his membership in the MS-13 gang. Further, he admitted to engaging in criminal activity with the gang. Specifically, he stated that he would \"attack other gangs.\" Mr. Hernandez-Melendez also told the jury that he had been \"in jail for about four years\" which he served pursuant to the VICAR convictions. He also stated that he was on probation both at the time of the attack and during his current testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The rationale in favor of admitting the VICAR convictions, as stated above, is that criminal activity in aid of racketeering enterprise is probative of credibility. If the jury already knew that Mr. Hernandez-Melendez was involved with an enterprise engaged in racketeering-the MS-13 gang-and that he was incarcerated for this association, knowing the name, date, and sentence imposed would add little value to the jury's consideration of the witness' credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   For these reasons, the jury had the benefit of sufficient information to evaluate and determine the victim's credibility. While erroneous, there is not a reasonable possibility that excluding impeachment evidence in the form of Mr. Hernandez-Melendez's VICAR convictions contributed to the guilty verdict against Rosales. We conclude the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Maryland Rule 8-202 requires an appellant to file a notice of appeal within thirty days of entry of a judgment. This is not a limit on an appellate court's jurisdiction but is more properly classified as a claim processing rule. Properly understood, we are not barred from reaching the merits of this case. As to the merits, we hold that Mr. Hernandez-Melendez's prior VICAR convictions for conspiracy to commit assault with a dangerous weapon in aid of racketeering, and threatening to commit a crime of violence in aid of racketeering are admissible for impeachment purposes under Maryland Rule 5-609. The trial court erred in excluding the witness' prior convictions for impeachment purposes. The trial court should not have restricted cross-examination of Mr. Hernandez-Melendez. However, we hold further that the exclusion of these convictions was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, Mr. Rosales is not granted a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
