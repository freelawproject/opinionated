Essentially, Vladimirsky presents three issues for this Court's review: (1) whether the Secretary properly calculated Vladimirsky's compensation; (2) whether the School District of Philadelphia (District) violated Vladimirsky's due process rights; and (3) whether the Secretary was required to address additional issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After review, we vacate and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The District hired Vladimirsky as a teacher and professional employee on September 1, 1997. Vladimirsky worked as a social studies teacher at Overbrook High School (Overbrook). As a result of incidents occurring on February 17 and March 9, 2011, Assistant Superintendent Linda Cliatt-Wayman instructed Vladimirsky to report to work at the High School Academic Division on March 14, 2011 pending an investigation of Vladimirsky's alleged aggressive and agitated classroom behavior. After an investigatory conference on March 23, 2011, Overbrook's then-principal Payne Young (Young) prepared an unsatisfactory incident report (SEH-204) recommending Vladimirsky's discharge. Young also recommended placing the SEH-204 in Vladimirsky's personnel file, and giving him an unsatisfactory rating for the September 2010 to June 30, 2011 period. Following an April 28, 2011 conference, Young issued a May 2, 2011 conference summary, wherein, she upheld the SEH-204 because Vladimirsky's behavior was excessive and unprofessional. After a June 8, 2011 second-level conference, the District's Talent Acquisition Office's Deputy Chief Lissa S. Johnson (Johnson) issued a conference summary recommending that Vladimirsky's employment be terminated and that incident documentation be placed in his personnel file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Vladimirsky requested a hearing before the District's School Reform Commission (SRC) and on November 28, 2011, a hearing was held before the SRC. Effective July 20, 2011, the SRC terminated Vladimirsky's employment. Vladimirsky challenged his employment termination by pursuing litigation against the District before the Secretary and this Court. On August 3, 2016, this Court concluded that the District failed to comply with the mandatory provisions of the Public School Code of 1949 (School Code),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and thus held that Vladimirsky's employment termination was a nullity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vladimirsky v.

This Court rejected the school district's argument, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Merrell remained in the workforce by continuing to work in the occupational safety industry and kept his teaching certificate in an active status after the [s]chool [d]istrict did not hire him in 1997.\n   <strong>\n    The mere fact that he did not apply for a social studies teacher position more aggressively does not establish his failure to mitigate damages.

Due to his efforts, the backpay amount for more than the 13-year period was reduced to $25,789[.00]. The record amply demonstrates that Merrell exercised reasonable due diligence to mitigate damages and has not withdrawn from the work force.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Merrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7312148\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/51/286/\">\n    51 A.3d at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Here, the Secretary held that there was\n   <strong>\n    no record evidence\n   </strong>\n   that after March 2012, Vladimirsky made any attempts to find similar employment. This finding is contradicted by the very same record testimony the Secretary cited in support of that finding, wherein Vladimirsky testified that he \"stopped [searching for teaching positions]\n   <strong>\n    toward the end of\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    2012\n   </strong>\n   ].\" R.R. at 255A (emphasis added). Thus, the Secretary's finding is unsupported by the record evidence and directly contradicted by Vladimirsky's testimony that he attempted for well over one year to find teaching jobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Importantly, the Secretary found that from July 2011 through March 2012, Vladimirsky \"made an honest, good-faith effort to find similar work[.]\" Secretary's Dec. at 6. The finding was based on Vladimirsky's testimony that he sent his resume to numerous school districts, estimating the number of school districts to be between 24 and 36.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 256A. Vladimirsky explained that in some cases he sent more than one resume to a school district. He also stated that he received responses from only a small percentage of the school districts, and those responses were rejection letters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 252A. Vladimirsky further explained that he stopped searching\n   for a teaching position because his search was rendered almost pointless as a direct result of the District's illegal employment termination. When asked on cross-examination why he gave up searching for a teaching position, he expounded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   I was, according to them, fired, which polluted my ability to get another position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [ ] Being fired from a position in the [ ] [D]istrict does not make you prospectively a very good employee. I did attempt. As you say, maybe I could have attempted even harder. I was rejected at every turn, which simply reinforced the perception that I am tainted; I am a teacher who was fired from a tenured position and these people do not want to hire me. I have to survive, I have to move on with my life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [ ] I have parents that I'm responsible for who are old and sick, so there's, you know, more responsibilities than: oh, I'm a teacher and that's my commitment.

However, Vladimirsky's expert Richard M. Miller (Miller),\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified regarding his involvement in the District's teacher hiring process and Vladimirsky's belief that a continued search for teaching positions would be futile:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q.

It didn't come up a whole lot, but I think that if you got into a fistfight with your principal, you were unlikely to think that you would get a job somewhere else, but you consider each case depending on what goes on. But the answer is when you have seven or 17 other teachers to choose from, why would you pick somebody with a shady past or with any blemish on their [sic] record?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   In Lower Merion School where I'm somewhat familiar with, there's a thousand applicants, a thousand applicants for a social studies job.

In my experience in the governance councils that I've sat on -- and I hired teachers for Success for All for the three years; it was more than just a governance council - I wouldn't consider anybody whose credentials were besmirched and might affect the -- you know, I was doing a program to report the efficacy of their program, and if they found out that some of the teachers had anything going on in the past, I would not consider hiring them, in my personal experience.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q.

He remained employed at Sunrise at all relevant times thereafter.\" Secretary's Dec. at 2, \u00b6 11. Once Vladimirsky was no longer eligible to receive unemployment compensation benefits, and he had been unsuccessful in obtaining a teaching position, he accepted the position at Sunrise as a security guard because he needed income to live.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Secretary recognized Vladimirsky's resume submission to 24 to 36 school districts during the period between the District's employment termination and his acceptance of the Sunrise position, as an \"honest, good-faith effort to find similar work[.]\" Secretary's Dec. at 6. In contrast, the Secretary found that because Vladimirsky ceased looking for a teaching position after March 2012, he did not mitigate his damages after March 2012 and was not entitled to recover lost salary beyond the first quarter of 2012. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has explained in the employment discrimination context:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [T]he 'lower sights' corollary to the mitigation doctrine, ... holds that, after unsuccessfully attempting for a reasonable period of time to secure substantially equivalent interim employment, a [wrongfully terminated employee]\n   <strong>\n    is required to 'lower his sights' by seeking less remunerative work.\n   </strong>\n   But the duty to lower one's sights arises only after a reasonably diligent search for employment similar to that lost has been made.\n   <strong>\n    Doubts as to\n   </strong>\n   whether or\n   <strong>\n    when a\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    wrongfully terminated employee\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    must lower his or her sights are resolved against the employer.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Tubari Ltd., Inc. v.

Vladimirsky's inquiries were consistently rebuffed or ignored. Vladimirsky received rejection letters or no response at all, and was not invited for a single interview, for almost a year and a half. Vladimirsky contends that he concluded that the stigma resulting from the District's improper termination of his employment rendered continued application submission unlikely to result in a teaching job.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, upon the cessation of his unemployment compensation benefits, he accepted a job outside of the teaching profession to financially support his family. The District failed to show that Vladimirsky's decision to accept the security guard position and cease searching for a teaching job given the aforementioned circumstances was unreasonable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Raya &amp; Haig Hair Salon v.

Accordingly, because the record evidence reveals that the District did not satisfy its burden and Vladimirsky mitigated his damages, Vladimirsky is entitled to the compensation he would have earned had he not been dismissed, less any earnings he actually received during the relevant time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    The Sunshine Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Vladimirsky argues that the District failed to comply with the Secretary's August 25, 2016 order directing that Vladimirsky be reinstated. Vladimirsky contends that because the District did not pursue Vladimirsky's reinstatement through the SRC, and the SRC did not reinstate him, the District violated the Sunshine Act. Specifically, Vladimirsky relies on Section 708 of the Sunshine Act which provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   An agency may hold an executive session for one or more of the following reasons:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (1) To discuss any matter involving the employment, appointment, termination of employment, terms and conditions of employment, evaluation of performance, promotion or disciplining of any specific prospective public officer or employee or current public officer or employee employed or appointed by the agency, or former public officer or employee, provided, however, that the individual employees or appointees whose rights could be adversely affected may request, in writing, that the matter or matters be discussed at an open meeting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 708(a)(1). Section 708(c) of the Sunshine Act mandates that \"[o]fficial action on discussions held pursuant to subsection (a) shall be taken at an open meeting.\" 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 708(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The District rejoins that this Court ordered Vladimirsky to be reinstated, thus the Sunshine Act does not control. This Court's order expressly directed: \"[T]he Acting Secretary of Education's November 19, 2014 order is REVERSED. [ ] Vladimirsky is hereby reinstated to his position as a professional employee of the [District] and the matter is REMANDED to the [Secretary] for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Vladimirsky I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486908,6781023\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/986/\">\n    144 A.3d at 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Sunshine Act defines an official action as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (1)\n   <strong>\n    Recommendations made by an agency\n   </strong>\n   pursuant to statute, ordinance or executive order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (2)\n   <strong>\n    The establishment of policy\n   </strong>\n   by an agency.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (3)\n   <strong>\n    The decisions on agency business\n   </strong>\n   made by an agency.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   (4)\n   <strong>\n    The vote taken by any agency\n   </strong>\n   on any motion, proposal, resolution, rule, regulation, ordinance, report or order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   65 Pa.C.S \u00a7 703 (emphasis added). Here, because this Court ordered Vladimirsky's reinstatement, the SRC was not required to recommend, establish, decide or vote on anything. Accordingly, since no official action was necessary, the Sunshine Act did not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    Reinstatement Letters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Vladimirsky asserts that the District's letters offering him reinstatement were illegal and thus void. Consequently, Vladimirsky maintains he was not reinstated. This Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   On August 3, 2016, this Court ordered Vladimirsky's reinstatement. In accordance with this Court's Order, on August 25, 2016, the Secretary ordered Vladimirsky reinstated effective August 3, 2016. This Court recognizes that the District requested the Secretary to vacate his order based on its petitioning the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for allowance of appeal. However, when the Secretary did not address the request, the District in fact, sent a letter to Vladimirsky offering reinstatement \"with a start date of November 4, 2016.\" R.R. at 848A (emphasis omitted). Vladimirsky responded by stating his position that the SRC has to reinstate him at a public meeting and that Vladimirsky could not be reinstated with pending disciplinary action. The District responded on December 2, 2016, explaining that SRC action was not required, that the District had the right to proceed with disciplinary action and requested Vladimirsky to report to work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 854A-855A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   This Court agrees with the District. As explained above, SRC action was not required because this Court ordered Vladimirsky to be reinstated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the District was free to proceed with disciplinary action as this Court specifically concluded: \"\n   <strong>\n    Vladimirsky is reinstated to his position as a professional employee until the District properly terminates his employment in accordance with the\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    School Code\n   </strong>\n   ....\"\n   <em>\n    Vladimirsky I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486908,6781023\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/986/\">\n    144 A.3d at 1003-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).

The Scheduling Order stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   At the hearing, the following issues/matters shall be considered:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   a. The [District's] request for a stay or supersedeas pending review by the [Secretary].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   b. [Vladimirsky's] request for enforcement of [the Secretary's] orders reinstating [Vladimirsky] to his position with the [District].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   c. The amount of back pay, if any, that should be awarded to [Vladimirsky], taking into account his duty to mitigate damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   R.R. at 139A. Vladimirsky claims the Secretary did not address issues a and b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   First, the Secretary's decision was dated May 1, 2018, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied the District's Petition for Allowance of Appeal on January 23, 2017. Therefore, the issue of the District's request for a stay or supersedeas was clearly moot on the date the Secretary issued his opinion. Second, the Secretary concluded that the District reinstated Vladimirsky as of its first offer of reinstatement. Consequently, the issue of enforcement of the Secretary's reinstatement order was also moot at the time the Secretary issued his decision. Accordingly, the Secretary addressed the issues properly before him,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the amount of backpay and mitigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    Liberty Interests and Records Expunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Vladimirsky states in his brief: \"The [Secretary] refused to order expunction of the records against Vladimirsky. We now ask the Court to do so.\" Vladimirsky Br. at 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1551(a) provides in pertinent part: \"Review of quasijudicial orders shall be conducted by the court on the record made before the government unit. No question shall be heard or considered by the court which was not raised before the government unit ....\" Pa.R.A.P. 1551(a). This Court remanded this matter in\n   <em>\n    Vladimirsky I\n   </em>\n   for Vladimirsky's reinstatement and calculation of damages. The Hearing Officer specified the issues to be determined in its Scheduling Order (the District's stay request, Vladimirsky's Enforcement Application and damages/mitigation). As Vladimirsky's record expunction was not before the Secretary, it was properly not heard or considered by the Secretary. Consequently, it cannot now be considered by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   This Court notes that although it reversed Vladimirsky's employment termination because the District failed to comply with the School Code, it did not address the actual charges. Moreover, if Vladimirsky had accepted the reinstatement, the original charges could again be reinstituted and disciplinary proceedings could be brought against Vladimirsky correspondingly. Accordingly, the Secretary did not err in not addressing Vladimirsky's records expunction and we will not do so now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    Lost Compensation Due to Vladimirsky\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Vladimirsky next argues that the Secretary failed to properly compensate him:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   The Secretary did not include what is due to [ ] Vladimirsky during the years that he was employed by [Sunrise]. Nor did he apply the statutory interest rate of 6% per year. [Section 1155 of the School Code,] 24 [P.S.] \u00a7 11-1155. Nor did he factor in the accumulated sick and personal days which Vladimirsky was entitled to be paid pursuant to the ... [c]ollective bargaining agreement. Nor did he provide an order for the District to pay into the ... retirement fund for the years in question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Vladimirsky Br. at 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Section 1130 of the School Code provides that where a final decision on the\n   discharge of a professional employee is in the employee's favor, \"there shall be no abatement of salary or compensation.\" 24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1130.

The availability of such positions before the District terminated Vladimirsky's employment on July 20, 2011 is not relevant to the mitigation issue and artificially inflates the number of allegedly available positions. This inclusion of 351 irrelevant and misleading job advertisements on 351 pages of Exhibit SDP-4 represents nearly one quarter of the entire exhibit. Similarly, such irrelevant evidence of allegedly available positions occupies 15 of Exhibit SDP-3's 65 pages.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    Act of February 14, 2008, P.L. 6, 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.101 -67.3104.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    Exhibit SDP-5, containing the District's Right-to-Know Request, contains information pertaining to positions beginning in 2009.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    For example, \"available\" positions listed in Exhibit SDP-3 (the list Leslie described as \"over 60 pages long\") include those located in counties distant from Philadelphia, including: York, Allegheny, Montour, Lancaster, Lehigh, Clearfield, Berks, Dauphin, Adams, Lackawanna, Warren, Blair, Washington, Centre, Northampton, Bradford, Clinton, Beaver, Crawford, Armstrong, Monroe, Erie, Northumberland, Columbia, McKean, Fayette, Luzerne, Carbon, Butler and Lycoming. An in-depth review of the document raises further questions as to its value. Many positions were listed as part-time and substitute positions.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Ex. SDP-3 at 1, 2. Some titles identified the positions cryptically, such as simply: \"High\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 2, 4); \"Instructor\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 1, 2); \"Teacher\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    ); \"Marketing Technician Support Teacher\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 3). Curiously, 11 positions on the list were allegedly obtained from the product auction website, \"eBay.\" Even more dubious is the inclusion of 10 allegedly \"available\" positions with the District - the same entity that terminated Vladimirsky's employment. Further, with respect to Exhibit SDP-4, many of the job advertisements pertained to jobs outside of the Philadelphia area, and part-time and substitute teacher positions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Vladimirsky's conclusion is supported by Miller's testimony that Vladimirsky's likelihood of being hired was\n    <strong>\n     significantly\n    </strong>\n    reduced given the District's unlawful termination of his employment for cause.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    Vladimirsky also argues that Leslie's report was inadmissible hearsay.
