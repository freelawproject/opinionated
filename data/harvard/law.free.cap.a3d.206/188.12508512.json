King. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in concluding that the doctrine of litigation privilege barred her action sounding in defamation and fraud. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our decision. The defendant was the chief disciplinary counsel for the Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel. The plaintiff was terminated from her position as a staff attorney for the Office of the Probate Court Administrator following a disciplinary proceeding conducted pursuant to the Connecticut Judicial Branch Administrative Policies and Procedures Manual Policy 612, titled \"Corrective Discipline.\" While the proceeding was pending, the Probate Court Administrator notified the defendant of the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant then assigned an assistant chief disciplinary counsel to investigate the matter. Thereafter, the defendant initiated grievance proceedings against the plaintiff. A reviewing committee issued a reprimand to the plaintiff. The Statewide Grievance Committee (committee) and the Superior Court affirmed the reprimand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the pendency of the grievance proceeding, the plaintiff filed her own grievance complaint against the defendant. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant's decision to file a grievance \"violated several sections of the Practice Book, the duties and responsibilities of her office, and the public's trust ....\" In response, the defendant contended that the plaintiff's grievance complaint was without merit. The grievance panel found no probable cause and dismissed the complaint against the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff then instituted the present civil action against the defendant. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant \"published false and defamatory statements and remarks about the plaintiff in her (defendant's) answer to [the plaintiff's] Grievance Complaint [against the defendant] ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant moved to dismiss the action on the ground of litigation privilege. The court concluded that the litigation privilege barred the action and granted the motion to dismiss. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The issue presented is whether the court erred in concluding that the litigation privilege extends absolute immunity to statements made to the attorney disciplinary authority by an attorney who is the\n   subject of a grievance complaint. In deciding a motion to dismiss, a \"court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader .... The motion to dismiss ... admits all facts which are well pleaded, invokes the existing record and must be decided upon that alone.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Gold\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rowland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086348\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/296/186/#p200\">\n    296 Conn. 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200-201,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=994%20A.2d%20106\">\n    994 A.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). \"Additionally, whether attorneys are protected by absolute immunity for their conduct during judicial proceedings is a question of law over which our review is plenary.\"\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Seaman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20523\">\n    308 Conn. 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 530,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687438\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/892/778/3687438/\">\n    69 A.3d 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Connecticut has long recognized the litigation privilege.
