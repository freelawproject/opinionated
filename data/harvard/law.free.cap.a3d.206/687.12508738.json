On February 28, 2019, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the parties' arguments and reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, further briefing or argument is not required to decide this matter.

Merida also filed a motion to appoint counsel for the hearing, but the trial justice denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the hearing on his motion to correct his sentence, defendant argued that the twenty-four months he spent on home confinement should be credited toward his overall sentence, pursuant to G.L. 1956 \u00a7 12-19-2(a). Specifically, he argued that this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial justice then reviewed several relevant cases decided by this Court, taking time to explain each case to defendant and distinguishing the cases based on their facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Merida also argued that a prisoner, whom he knew, had received credit toward his sentence for the time he spent on home confinement while awaiting trial. However, at that hearing, defendant could not remember all the details of that case. The trial justice therefore continued the hearing, at defendant's request, so that defendant could obtain more information regarding the case he had mentioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   One week later, on November 9, 2016, at the continued hearing, Merida argued that two of his cellmates, Mr. Bagley and Mr. DePina, received credit for home confinement toward their overall sentence. However, the trial justice found those cases distinguishable, explaining that, \"[i]t appears that Mr. Bagley was sentenced for bail violation and asked for credit for time served and home confinement, but it wasn't a sentencing after trial where he was held in home confinement as a condition of bail prior to trial.\" She further explained that Mr. DePina was sentenced after a plea agreement with a \"capped\" plea, stating that, \"if I did give him credit for time served in home confinement, it was in accordance with an agreement whereby he agreed to plead guilty and he pled guilty.\" Having heard defendant's arguments, the trial justice issued a bench decision denying defendant's request to receive credit for time spent on home confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Merida filed a timely notice of appeal on December 1, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before this Court, Merida argues that: (1) the trial justice erred in her interpretation of case precedent, specifically our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Quattrocchi\n   </em>\n   , arguing that the interpretation was inconsistent with the provisions of \u00a7 12-19-2(a) ; (2) his equal-protection rights were violated by virtue of the failure to award him credit for his pretrial time on home confinement;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) the trial justice erred in denying his motion to appoint counsel, given the complexity of the legal issues and the fact that English is defendant's second language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"A motion to reduce sentence under Rule 35 is essentially a plea for leniency.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Specifically, defendant contends that he was entitled to twenty-four months of credit for time that he spent on home confinement between the dates of May 11, 2004, and May 9, 2006. The defendant argues that, based on this Court's interpretation of \"imprisonment\" in\n   <em>\n    Quattrocchi\n   </em>\n   , home confinement is a form of imprisonment, and, therefore, his overall sentence should be reduced by the two years he spent on home confinement while on bail awaiting trial. He bases this contention on certain language in \u00a7 12-19-2(a), which provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Whenever it is provided that any offense shall be punished by a fine or imprisonment, the court imposing punishment may, in its discretion, select the kind of punishment to be imposed, and, if the punishment is fine or imprisonment, its amount or term within the limits prescribed by law; provided,\n   <em>\n    if the punishment to be imposed is imprisonment, the sentence or sentences imposed shall be reduced by the number of days spent in confinement while awaiting trial and while awaiting sentencing\n   </em>\n   * * *.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"We have previously held that the General Assembly's enactment of the so-called dead-time provisions of \u00a7 12-19-2 was a benevolent effort to assist the person who, because of an inability to make bail, has been cast into a sort of limbo as he awaited the disposition of the charge or complaint which had caused his incarceration.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

That provision specifically prohibits the director from granting a person credit for time spent on home confinement prior to trial and prior to conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This Court has stated that, \"when we are faced with statutory provisions that are in\n   <em>\n    pari materia\n   </em>\n   , we construe them in a manner that attempts to harmonize them and that is consistent with their general objective scope.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because both \u00a7 12-19-2 and \u00a7 42-56-20.2 govern sentencing of a person convicted of\n   a crime, they may be read together as part of a greater statutory sentencing scheme created by the General Assembly.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9285497\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/841/659/#p666\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Reading the two provisions together, it is clear that, if the accused is unable to make bail and must await trial at the ACI, then, pursuant to \u00a7 12-19-2, the director of the ACI must grant credit for that time if the accused is later convicted. On the other hand, if the accused makes bail and is able to await trial in his home, then, pursuant to \u00a7 42-56-20.2(j), the director cannot give credit for that time, even if the accused is confined in his home as a condition of bail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nevertheless, Merida argues that our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Quattrocchi\n   </em>\n   , where we held that \"[w]e are persuaded that home confinement is a form of imprisonment during which an employee's liberty is significantly restrained[,]\" when read in conjunction with \u00a7 12-19-2, entitles him to a reduced sentence for the time he spent on home confinement.\n   <em>\n    Quattrocchi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7347153\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/687/78/\">\n    687 A.2d at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, defendant has filed requests for counsel that show that he is indigent and cannot afford his own attorney. Nevertheless, a Rule 35 motion is not a \"critical stage of a prosecution\" where the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches, because the proceeding occurs after a prosecution has been completed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oliveira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8190430\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/961/299/#p308\">\n    961 A.2d at 308-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Additionally, the issue at bar-whether \u00a7 12-19-2 afforded defendant time off his sentence for the time he spent on home confinement-was not so complex as to require the appointment of counsel as a matter of fundamental fairness and due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In this case, a review of the record fails to reveal any error. The seasoned trial justice clearly understood the struggles that a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant might face in a case such as this. She gave the defendant every opportunity to present his case, and she conducted her own research into relevant statutes and caselaw that could have provided relief to the defendant. The trial justice also granted the defendant a continuance to provide him an opportunity to further prepare and strengthen his arguments in support of his request for relief. Moreover, she explained to the defendant the factual distinctions between the defendant's case and those of his cellmates who had purportedly received credit for home confinement. Therefore, we hold that the trial justice was well within her discretion in denying the defendant's request for counsel in connection with his motion to correct sentence, and this Court will not disturb that ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the above-stated reasons, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed.
