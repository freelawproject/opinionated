The issue before this en banc Court is whether, following the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Montgomery v.

Accordingly, we are constrained to affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 1981, a jury convicted Lee of second-degree murder. The convictions stemmed from the shooting death of Robert Walker during an attempted robbery. The evidence at trial established that Lee suggested the robbery to her brother, Dale Stacy Madden, that Lee was designated to serve as the lookout, and that Lee was aware that her brother was carrying a loaded gun. Lee was tried jointly with co-defendants Madden and another man, co-conspirator Arthur Jeffries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following conviction, the court properly sentenced Lee to a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.

Under the current statutory framework, a juvenile who commits first- or second-degree murder must be charged as an adult. A defendant can then request that his or her case be transferred to the Juvenile Division.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6355. If the trial court denies the transfer request, and the juvenile is convicted of first- or second-degree murder, the trial court must sentence the juvenile to a maximum term of life imprisonment. Moreover, the mandatory minimum sentences set forth above apply only to juveniles convicted of first- or second-degree murder after June 24, 2012. Section 1102.1 does not prescribe minimum sentences for juvenile homicide defendants who were convicted of first- or second-degree murder before June 24, 2012. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1102.1.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Commonwealth v.
