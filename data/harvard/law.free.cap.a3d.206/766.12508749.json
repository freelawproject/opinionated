In addition, matters involving judicial economy, docket management [and control of] courtroom proceedings ... are particularly within the province of a trial court.... Accordingly, [a] trial court holds broad discretion in granting or denying a motion for a continuance. Appellate review of a trial court's denial of a motion for a continuance is governed by an abuse of discretion standard that, although not unreviewable, affords the trial court broad discretion in matters of continuances.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Peatie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060994\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/112/8/#p12\">\n    112 Conn.

Yuille commenced this action in 2013. There was little activity in the case between December 4, 2013, when Parnoff filed his answer and special defenses, and January 26, 2017, when the court,\n   <em>\n    Bellis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , ordered that trial was to begin on January 31, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 30, 2017, Yuille filed a reply to Parnoff's special defenses. Also on January 30, 2017, counsel for\n   Yuille filed a motion to continue the case until March 1, 2017, on the ground that he had only recently been retained by Yuille. The court denied Yuille's motion, stating: \"The defendants, indeed all parties were fully aware that their case was exposed to trial on one hour's notice as their counsel at the time were all told and agreed to same when the court granted yet another continuance in a very old case. As it turned out, the parties were given [five] days notice of their trial date rather than the one hour's notice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 30, 2017, Attorney Michael S. Lynch, on behalf of the law firm of Bai, Pollock, Blueweiss &amp; Mulcahey, P.C. (law firm), filed a motion to withdraw the law firm's appearance as counsel for Parnoff and Barbara A. Parnoff. The basis for the motion was that \"the attorney-client relationship [did] not exist in that there [was] a severe breakdown in communication between attorney and clients and the attorney is not authorized to represent or act on behalf of the clients.\" Specifically, after noting the complicated history between these parties and the disputed attorney's fees, the motion indicated that in December, 2016, Parnoff had advised in writing that the law firm was required to obtain his authorization prior to performing any further work on his file. After attending the status conference in which the matter was ordered to trial, Lynch indicated that he repeatedly requested authorization from Parnoff to work on the file; Parnoff, however, did not provide the necessary authorization. Under these circumstances, Lynch and the law firm requested permission to withdraw their appearance in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the hearing on the motion to withdraw on February 2, 2017, the court,\n   <em>\n    Bellis,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , stated: \"[B]efore I hear from either or both of the Parnoffs, I just want to point out that the case is very old, that there's been four trial dates in it, and there will not be a continuance of the trial date. I do note that ... there was a motion for\n   stay that was filed back in September, 2015, asking for a stay for the purposes of the\n   <em>\n    Parnoff\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Yuille\n   </em>\n   case to be decided as opposed to any other case, and so there was a brief stay but that was years into the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"So when the case was last continued, counsel at the time on both sides were informed that I would reluctantly grant ... that latest continuance but that when the decision was issued by the Connecticut Supreme Court, that the case would be on one hour's notice and it would ... immediately proceed to trial because, quite frankly, I did not want to continue the case the last time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"So here we are. The case is on trial. It will not be continued again due to the age of the case and the many continuance requests ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Over the course of the hearing on the motion to withdraw, Lynch reiterated what he had stated in his motion, namely, that he did not have the ability to defend Parnoff because Parnoff had not authorized him to do the work. The court questioned Parnoff regarding whether he would cooperate with counsel; Parnoff, however, did not provide a clear response to the court's questions. The court considered a letter from Parnoff to Attorney Charles Fleischmann of the law firm, dated December 14, 2016, in which Parnoff notified the law firm that it should not perform any further work for which he would be billed without his written approval. The court also considered a series of emails from Lynch to Parnoff in which Lynch notified Parnoff of the court's January 26, 2017 order setting deadlines for the filing of trial management reports and proposed stipulations of fact. Parnoff, however, had not authorized Lynch to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing on the motion to withdraw, the court stated: \"Well ... I'm going to find good cause to grant the motion. I'm going to find that\n   there is a breakdown in the relationship and communications, and I'm going to find further that it was caused, Attorney Parnoff, by your refusal to cooperate with your attorney based on the information and evidence before me, and that you put Attorney Lynch in a no-win position where he was not given-where he was attempting to do what was required to do to defend you properly, and that you-your instructions to him were to not do anything and you did not respond, so there is not any way that he can properly represent you based on all this information.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before court adjourned on February 2, 2017, Parnoff indicated that he was going to try to find an attorney to represent him during the trial but that he did not know how long it was going to take. In response, the court stated that \"[i]t was your choice not to cooperate with your attorney and not to give him authorization to do what needed to be done, so because of that I'm not going to continue the case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 3, 2017, Parnoff informed the court that he was on medication and was not practicing as a commissioner of the Superior Court. The court stated that it had previously informed all counsel that, with respect to a continuance, it would consider a current letter from a medical provider indicating that it would jeopardize Parnoff's physical or mental well-being to appear in court. Such a letter was not\n   provided to the court. The court also noted that Parnoff had an active law license and remained a commissioner of the Superior Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 7, 2017, Barbara A. Parnoff filed a motion for a continuance in which she requested that the matter be removed from the trial list in order for her to find an attorney to represent her in the matter. The same day, Parnoff filed a motion to remove the case from the trial list to allow reasonable time for trial preparation. In his motion, Parnoff stated that he had worked on this case with Attorney Paul Pollock of the law firm, who had retired, and Fleischmann, who had not responded to his December, 2016 letter. He indicated that he first learned that this case was ordered to trial on January 26, 2017, when he was in court on an unrelated matter. Parnoff did not state in the motion, however, that he was going to find another attorney to represent him. He stated, rather, that \"[n]either the undersigned nor his wife have any experience as defense attorneys or in defense litigation and both have long-standing medical conditions for which treatment is continuing ....\" Parnoff attached, as an exhibit to his motion, a letter from an outpatient mental health treatment coordinator indicating that Parnoff had a medical appointment scheduled for February 7, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Prior to jury selection on February 7, 2017, the court,\n   <em>\n    Radcliffe, J.\n   </em>\n   , considered Parnoff's motion to remove the case from the trial list. At that time, Parnoff described this motion as \"a motion to get the thing off the trial list; to stop with the proceedings and ... have [this matter] placed on a trial list in a period of time that unrepresented people who thought they were being represented for the last three or four years have an opportunity to get trial counsel.\" Judge Radcliffe initially referred both motions to Judge Bellis, as she had previously ruled on these issues. After consulting with Judge Bellis, however, Judge Radcliffe bifurcated the matter as to Barbara A. Parnoff and ordered that jury\n   selection would begin that afternoon in the case against Parnoff. The evidence in the case against Parnoff commenced on February 14, 2017, almost two weeks after the date that Judge Bellis had set for the commencement of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In support of his argument that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering him to commence trial on extremely short notice, Parnoff points out that this was a complex case and both sides had promptly requested that the matter be continued. He contends that the case was old because of the many collateral appeals and that the prior continuance requests were appropriate. He further argues that a continuance would not have had an adverse impact upon the witnesses or the reliability of the evidence, and that he had submitted medical evidence demonstrating his inability to cope with the complexity of the matters at hand. Finally, Parnoff contends that the denial of the continuance had a devastating impact upon his ability to defend the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Specifically, Parnoff contends that throughout all of the lawsuits and appeals over the years originating from this set of facts, he had never represented himself. He contends that, in addition to the disputed funds at issue, this case also involved his license to practice law, and that he should not have been expected to represent himself in the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On the basis of our review of the record, we disagree with Parnoff that the court abused its discretion by ordering this matter to trial. It is important to note that six years had elapsed between June 29, 2004, the date that Yuille received her arbitration award in this matter;\n   <em>\n    Parnoff I\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778300\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/139/147/\">\n    139 Conn. App. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   153 ; and July 26, 2010, the date that Parnoff misappropriated the funds that had been placed in escrow pending resolution of the parties' dispute. Another six and one-half years had passed before the court's January 26, 2017 order directing that this matter was scheduled for trial. During this\n   time, in addition to\n   <em>\n    Parnoff I\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 147,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20A.3d%20349\">\n    57 A.3d 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Parnoff II\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=163%20Conn.%20App.%20273\">\n    163 Conn.

Moreover, Parnoff, an attorney with an active law license, as noted by the trial court, was a party to all of this litigation and would have had firsthand knowledge of the underlying proceedings and complicated history involving the disputed funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the present case, the court specifically found that Parnoff was responsible for the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship by refusing to cooperate with Lynch and to give him the authorization necessary to work on the case. It was for this reason the court stated that it was not going to grant a continuance to Parnoff after granting Lynch's motion to withdraw. Parnoff was informed that the court would consider a current letter from a medical provider stating that it would jeopardize his physical or mental well-being to appear in court. Although Parnoff attached a letter to his motion to remove the case from the trial list, that letter indicated that Parnoff had an appointment on February 7, 2017, and did not state that it would jeopardize Parnoff's physical or mental well-being to appear in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the time this case was ordered for trial, it was over three and one-half years old and the parties' fee dispute had been the subject of multiple related lawsuits. Prior to the court's January 26, 2017 order, this case had previously been set down for trial on September 24, 2014, September 24, 2015, and November 17, 2015. Five pretrial conferences had also been scheduled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, despite the complicated history of this\n   case, the issues presented in this matter were not complex. The court had the discretion, as a matter of docket management, to schedule this matter for trial. See\n   <em>\n    Peatie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060994\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/112/8/#p12\">\n    112 Conn.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The following facts are necessary for the resolution of this claim. The operative complaint alleged conversion, statutory theft, and breach of fiduciary duty. The factual basis for each of these causes of action was the same. Specifically, Yuille alleged that in 1998, she retained Parnoff to represent her in an action against her employer. After prevailing in this action and receiving an arbitration award in the amount of $ 1,096,032.93, she learned that her fee agreement with Parnoff, pursuant to which Parnoff was to receive a fee of 40 percent of her recovery, violated a state statute. She, therefore, disputed Parnoff's entitlement to a fee of $ 438,413.17. On November 16, 2004, Yuille agreed that Parnoff could pay himself $ 125,000 from the 40 percent he was claiming as a fee, on the condition that the balance of the fee would be held in escrow pending resolution of the fee dispute. That same day, Parnoff established an account in his name as trustee for Yuille in which he placed the balance of the disputed fee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   According to Yuille's complaint, in March, 2005, Parnoff commenced an action against her claiming that she had breached her contract with him by refusing to pay him the full 40 percent contingency fee provided in the parties' retainer agreement. Following trial in that case, the jury awarded Parnoff $ 252,044.27. On July 13, 2010, the court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict. Yuille alleged that despite the automatic stay provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 61-11, and the fact that the entitlement to the disputed funds remained undecided pending appeal of Parnoff's prior action, on July 26, 2010, Parnoff transferred the sum of $ 363,960.87 from the escrow account to his personal account, thus misappropriating the funds from the 2004 arbitration award.

Parnoff has not negated the reasonable hypothesis that the jury concluded that he was not acting as Yuille's attorney at the time that he converted the funds. In fact, Yuille's complaint alleged that, on November 16, 2004, after the parties' fee dispute arose, Parnoff established an account in his name as trustee for Yuille in which he placed the balance of the disputed fee and that Parnoff had sued Yuille to recover the full 40 percent of the contingency fee in March, 2005. It was a reasonable hypothesis for the jury to believe that at the time Parnoff converted the funds in 2010, he was no longer acting as Yuille's attorney. Accordingly, because the jury's answer to the interrogatory can be harmonized with the verdict, Parnoff cannot prevail on his claim that the verdict is irreconcilably inconsistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Parnoff's final claim is that the court improperly declined to submit his special defense of waiver to the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The following facts are necessary for the resolution of this claim. On December 4, 2013, Parnoff filed his answer and special defenses. The special defenses alleged, inter alia, that Yuille's claims were barred by the doctrines of equitable estoppel, unjust enrichment, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The special defenses also alleged that Yuille had failed to mitigate damages, had breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and had waived possession of the funds by failing to file a counterclaim or seek affirmative relief to obtain a right to the possession of the funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 30, 2017, in response to the court's order, Yuille filed a reply to Parnoff's special defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On February 14, 2017, after the trial had commenced, Parnoff filed an amended answer and special defenses. In addition to the allegations contained in the December 4, 2013 special defenses, the amended special defenses alleged that Yuille's claims were barred by the doctrine of unclean hands, the applicable statutes of limitations and the doctrine of accord and satisfaction. The amended special defenses also alleged that any amounts due to Yuille should be reduced and set off by certain\n   other sums. Yuille did not file a reply to the amended answer and special defenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Prior to the start of the evidence, the court indicated that it would charge the jury on Parnoff's special defenses if they were supported by the evidence; the court commented, however, that it \"[had not] seen anything that [it] could really charge on at [that] point.\" During a break in the cross-examination of Yuille, the court again indicated that it would submit Parnoff's special defenses to the jury if there was any evidence to support them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   During\n   the court's charge to the jury, the court stated that \"there are various defenses which were raised here by way of a special defense in which [Parnoff] made claims that notwithstanding the claims made by [Yuille] that she could not recover for ... one or more of these bases. And the court has examined\n   the special defenses. And I am not going to instruct you on, nor should you consider, any of the special defenses raised in this case.\" The court then proceeded to charge on the claims raised by Yuille, namely, conversion, statutory theft and breach of fiduciary duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On appeal, Parnoff argues that he is entitled to a new trial based on the court's failure to charge on the special defense of waiver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   He contends that he was denied the right to have the jury decide an issue of fact fairly presented by the pleadings and the evidence. Specifically, Parnoff refers to defendant's exhibit L, an affidavit signed by Yuille in a prior related action,\n   <em>\n    Parnoff\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mooney\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield, Docket No. CV-04-4001683-S. In this affidavit, Yuille averred that she hired Attorney Laura Mooney in 1996 in connection with a workplace injury she sustained in 1995 while employed at Bridgeport Hospital. In 1997, Yuille authorized Mooney to pursue a bad faith claim against the hospital for its bad faith handling of her workers' compensation claim. In 1998, Yuille retained Parnoff to represent her in a wrongful termination claim. Yuille averred that, to her recollection, she did not authorize Parnoff to bring a bad faith claim, as she\n   had already hired Mooney to handle that claim. She later learned, however, that Parnoff had also brought a bad faith claim on her behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   According to the affidavit, after Parnoff advised Yuille of the arbitration award in her favor on the bad faith claim he had brought, Yuille advised Parnoff that the contingency fee of 40 percent that he was seeking to collect was too high. The affidavit further states that \"[i]n any event, I told Parnoff that any fee from the award\n   should be split between him and Mooney, since it was my understanding that they were working together and he had used her work to prosecute my case.\" After Parnoff refused to share the fee, she asked that the fee from the award be held in escrow pending resolution of the fee dispute. On the basis of this affidavit, Parnoff contends that Yuille waived any claim that she might have against him and in favor of Mooney, who was not a party to this action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree with Parnoff that this affidavit constitutes evidence in support of his special defense of waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"It is well established that waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Worth Construction Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dept. of Public Works\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777748\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/139/65/#p70\">\n    139 Conn.

At best, Yuille's statement in her affidavit is an assertion that Parnoff and Mooney should split the fee\n   <em>\n    to which they were legally entitled\n   </em>\n   rather than split the fee that violated the statutory cap on contingent fees contained in \u00a7 52-251c. Moreover, as the court correctly pointed out when discussing this affidavit at trial, \"[t]here is no claim by Attorney Mooney in this case-Attorney Mooney is not a party in this case, nor is she claiming any title, as far as this court is aware, to any of the monies that were contained in the certificate of deposit account and were later deposited in a personal account by the defendant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   With regard to whether Yuille had waived her right to the disputed funds, the court was presented with evidence that Yuille had retained counsel and defended her interest in the disputed funds from the inception of the lawsuit in\n   <em>\n    Parnoff I\n   </em>\n   , supra, 139 Conn.

He did question the court's instruction regarding whether he had a right to recover based on the prior Appellate Court opinions. This instruction is not at issue in the present appeal. He then questioned whether it was necessary to tell the jury that it should not consider the special defenses. After the court explained that it had to do that because it had initially told the jury that there was an answer and special defenses, Parnoff responded: \"I see. I see what your reasoning is.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    At oral argument before this court, counsel for Parnoff stated that he \"[did not] believe\" that Parnoff filed a request to charge on the special defenses. Prior to closing argument at the trial court, however, the court commented that Parnoff had submitted a series of requests to charge. The requests, if any, are not in the court file or in the appendices to Parnoff's brief. In any event, Parnoff never took any steps to rectify the record, to the extent he believes, contrary to counsel's representation at oral argument, that he submitted such requests.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Parnoff also refers to defendant's exhibit M, a page of a transcript from the prior proceeding, in which Yuille indicated that half of Parnoff's fee should be paid to Mooney, as support for his claim that the court improperly declined to charge the jury regarding waiver.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Mooney testified that following a prior lawsuit, she had been paid and was not seeking any additional compensation by way of any legal fee in this action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
