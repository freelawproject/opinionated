Upon careful review, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts and procedural history have been adopted from the findings of fact contained in the Decision of the Orphans' Court filed September 16, 2016, as well as our own review of the record. Joseph and Margaret Passarelli were married on November 27, 1998, and have two minor children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Spring of 2015, Margaret agreed with Joseph to meet with an attorney, Michael Perna, Esquire, to discuss estate planning. Margaret was unaware that Joseph had previously met with Attorney Perna and only learned of their pre-existing relationship shortly before the execution of the estate planning documents. During this time period, Margaret was facing a possible cancer diagnosis and was emotionally upset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Attorney Perna prepared various documents, including powers of attorney and wills, as well as the Trust, at Joseph's direction. On May 21, 2015, Margaret and Joseph met with Attorney Perna to execute the documents. The irrevocable trust agreement included a schedule of assets,\n   compiled by Joseph, to be conveyed to the Trust. The schedule included two property companies known as Japen Holdings, LLC, and Japen Properties, LLP (collectively, \"Japen\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Trust, 5/21/15, Schedule A. Prior to execution, Margaret did not ask about the inventory of assets, nor did she read the trust documents. Margaret did, however, inquire as to the disposition of trust assets in the event of divorce and was informed by Attorney Perna that the Trust would survive a dissolution of the couple's marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Trust named Joseph and Margaret as Settlors and Joseph as Trustee. The document named Settlors and their two minor children as discretionary income beneficiaries during the lifetime of the Settlors. The Trust also authorized discretionary distributions of principal to Settlors and/or their children for support, health, comfortable maintenance, education, and general welfare. The Trust further provided that, at the death of Settlors, the Trust would continue for the benefit of the children and their living issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sometime after executing the Trust, Margaret discovered that Joseph, through Japen, had purchased two properties in Florida (the \"Properties\") without her knowledge and had included these properties in the corpus of the trust, via Japen. In September 2015, Margaret discovered Joseph was having an extra-marital affair and filed for divorce. She also discovered that Joseph's girlfriend was living in one of the Properties. In October 2015, Margaret filed, in the divorce action, an emergency petition for special relief to prevent dissipation of marital assets. In December 2015, the divorce court froze fifty percent of certain accounts included in the corpus of the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 19, 2016, Margaret filed, in the Orphans' Court, a petition to terminate the Trust pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 7736 and 7740.6. The court held an evidentiary hearing and subsequently issued findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court found that Joseph had concealed the fact that he purchased the Properties with marital assets and had failed to disclose that fact at the time of the Trust's execution. The court further found that Margaret would not have agreed to execute the Trust had she known about the existence of the Properties. As a result, the court concluded that Margaret had met her burden of proving fraudulent conduct by Joseph and dissolved the Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Joseph timely appealed and a divided three-judge panel of this Court reversed. On November 29, 2017, Margaret filed an application for reargument en banc, which this Court granted on January 12, 2018. Joseph raises the following questions for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. Whether a finding of fraud may be premised upon a failure to identify each asset contributed to a trust?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2. Whether non-disclosure of an asset conveyed to a trust can be construed as fraudulent misrepresentation where[:] (a) the complaining party had no present interest in the asset conveyed to [the] trust[;] (b) the asset became part of the trust[;] and (c) the complaining party received a benefit from the asset conveyed to the trust[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   3. Whether non-disclosure of $ 470,000 of assets conveyed to a trust is material where the assets made part of the trust total $ 14,600,000[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   4. Whether a trust agreement should be terminated premised upon fraud where the alleged victim professes to have never read the instrument but it conferred upon the alleged victim a tangible benefit consistent with the estate planning goals she sought to achieve?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Substituted Brief of Appellant, at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Joseph first asserts that the Orphans' Court erred in finding Margaret proved Joseph fraudulently induced her to execute the trust agreement because he failed to disclose the existence of the Properties. The Orphans' Court found that Joseph concealed the fact that he was having a long-term extra-marital affair and had used marital assets to purchase and maintain a Florida home for his girlfriend. The court concluded that Margaret would not have executed the trust if she had been aware of those facts. Joseph argues that trust law imposes no duty to disclose each and every asset contributed to a trust and that Margaret failed to establish the requisite elements of fraud. For the following reasons, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"A trust arises when, by a sufficient declaration of its terms, the three following elements concur: sufficient words to create it, a definite subject matter, and a certain or ascertained object.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Pugh v.

The Orphans' Court characterized this definition as requiring proof that: (1) the testator had no knowledge of the concealed or misstated fact, and (2) the testator would not have made the same bequest had she known the truth.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Orphans' Court Decision, 9/16/16, at 4. Applying this standard to the evidence presented in the instant matter, the Orphans' Court concluded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [Margaret] testified credibly that she had no knowledge of the purchase of the [Properties] with marital assets on May 1, 2015. [Joseph] admitted that at the relevant time, the date [Margaret] executed the Trust, [Margaret] had no knowledge of his purchase of the [Properties].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [Joseph] suppressed the existence of the [Properties] to [Margaret]; the list of real property identified on Schedule A omits these properties as well. [Margaret], however, understood the Trust to encompass all of their marital property at the time. By failing to disclose the information [to] [Margaret,] she did not, and could not[,] know[ ] exactly what assets or issues were really on the table as part of the transaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [Joseph's] failure to disclose the purchase, and existence, of the [Properties] was an act of fraud intended to induce [Margaret] to execute the Trust document he wanted and created. Whether one labels his action a suppression of the truth or a suggestion of what is false by silence, the result is the same-the fraudulent inducement of [Margaret] to execute the Trust. As the Supreme Court has explained, \"[t]he concealment of a material fact can amount to culpable misrepresentation no less than does an intentional false statement.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Moser v.

First, as noted above,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Paul\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   -upon which the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Glover\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   court based its holding-was a case ultimately involving undue influence, a similar yet distinct legal theory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Paul\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court did not engage in a pure fraud analysis. For this reason, the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Paul\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   court's fact-specific distillation of the appellant's burden in that case is not directly applicable to a case rooted squarely in fraud. As such, the subsequent adoption by the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Glover\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   court of the factors enumerated in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Paul\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   as a definitive test for fraud was, in our opinion, in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Glover\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   court misstated the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Paul\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"test,\" omitting entirely\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Paul\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   's requirement that there be \"fraud and misrepresentation\" in the concealment of a material fact from the testator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, in relying on\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Glover\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   rather than the Supreme Court's case from which it purported to glean its analytical framework, the Orphans' Court relied on an incomplete characterization of the law. Indeed, the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Glover\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   framework entirely omits the concepts of knowledge/recklessness, justifiable reliance and injury, all of which are key elements any fraud inquiry.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Eigen\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Accordingly, in relying on\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Glover\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the Orphans' Court essentially failed to engage in a fraud analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This matter is distinguishable from\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Glover\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Paul\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   for another reason. Unlike those cases, which addressed the fraudulent inducement of wills, this matter involves an irrevocable trust. Unlike a will, which is ambulatory and does not \"speak\" until the death of the testator, an irrevocable trust is just that-irrevocable-from the moment of its execution. While a will may be amended by codicil or revoked in its entirety, the transfer of property to an irrevocable trust is an immediate and final transfer of ownership. Because it is not easily modified or rescinded, an irrevocable trust provides stability and security for both the settlor and beneficiaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Paul\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and/or\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Glover\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   provide the proper framework for a fraud analysis in the context of wills, we conclude that, where an irrevocable trust is at\n   issue, a stricter standard should apply. Thus, we hold that it is appropriate to apply, in the instant matter, the test for fraud as expressed in the case law concerning common-law fraud, as well as in the Restatement of Trusts and the Restatement of Property, which incorporate elements of knowing or reckless misrepresentation; intention to mislead another into reliance; and resulting injury caused by reliance. With this in mind, we turn to an application of those principles to the instant matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In Pennsylvania, the definition of fraud in the inducement is well-settled.
