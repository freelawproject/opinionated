On appeal, the defendant contends that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that (1) he was not deprived of a fair trial due to prosecutorial improprieties, and (2) the trial court properly denied his motion for a new trial for lack of jurisdiction. We disagree but conclude that the form of the trial court's judgment is improper in that the trial court should have dismissed rather than denied the motion for a new trial. Accordingly, we reverse in part the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court with direction to render judgment consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following underlying relevant facts and procedural history are set forth in the Appellate Court's decision. \"During the fall of 2011, the victim, Dallas Boomer, saw both the defendant and Tramont Murray, his close friends, on a daily basis. The three men often conducted drug deals together out of rental cars .... During November, 2011, the defendant became estranged from both the victim and Murray ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"On December 6, 2011, at approximately 1 o'clock in the morning, the victim was sitting in the driver's seat of a parked rental car on a residential street in New\n   Haven. Murray was sleeping in the reclined passenger seat. The victim saw the defendant's car pull over to the side of the road and idle nearby, so he shook Murray awake. Murray instructed the victim to drive away. The defendant then approached the victim's parked vehicle with his hand in his sleeve and began shooting at the windshield. The victim attempted to drive away, but could not. Six bullets struck the rental car, and the victim suffered fatal injuries as a result.\n   \"Immediately after the shooting, Murray, the sole witness, was questioned by the police. When the police asked Murray to identify the shooter, he stated that he had not seen the shooter .... Three weeks later, on December 27, Murray made a second statement to the police in which he identified the defendant as the shooter. Murray testified consistently with this statement at the defendant's trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    171 Conn.

Specifically, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the prosecutor did not deprive him of a fair trial when she (1) violated a court order by attempting on three occasions to elicit inadmissible prior consistent statements made\n   by Murray, and (2) asked the jury during closing argument\n   to speculate about the contents of a conversation between Murray and his mother that was not in evidence. In response, the state asserts that the Appellate Court properly concluded that these claimed improprieties did not deprive the defendant of his right to a fair trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   With respect to the defendant's claim that the prosecutor thrice violated the trial court's order related to the inadmissibility of Murray's prior consistent statements, the Appellate Court's decision sets forth the following relevant facts. \"On the first day of trial, outside the presence of the jury, the prosecutor asked the court whether Murray's second statement to the police, in which he identified the defendant as the shooter, would be admissible as a prior consistent statement. The court responded: 'Well, again, without finally ruling on that, the answer is not necessarily because the rule generally is that when a witness is impeached for a prior inconsistent statement, prior consistent statements are not normally\n   admissible. They can be admissible under the discretion of the court, particularly-and I emphasize particularly-where the prior consistent statement pre-cedes the prior inconsistent statement .... [W]e may have to see what develops, but certainly the answer to what you just said is not necessarily.' The court further stated: 'I haven't given my final rulings on this because I have to see what the witness says on direct, obviously, but I think you must be aware of the general way that I look at this so that you are not surprised, and I think that I have said so.' \" (Emphasis omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    Id., at 315-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    157 A.3d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the state's direct examination of Murray, after establishing that Murray had failed to identify the defendant as the shooter in his initial encounter with the police, the prosecutor engaged in the following colloquy with Murray:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \" '[The Prosecutor]: Did there come a time about three weeks later when you went back into the police department and gave another statement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \" '[Murray]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \" '[The Prosecutor]: And in that statement, did you essentially tell the police what you have testified to today in court?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \" '[Murray]: Yes.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 322 n.4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    157 A.3d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defense counsel did not object to this testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After this testimony, the prosecutor committed the first of the alleged improprieties when she asked: \" 'Now, with regard\n   to giving that statement [to the police] on December 27, which is essentially what you spoke about today ....' Defense counsel objected, and the court sustained the objection, noting that '[t]he contents of the second interview should not be divulged further than they already have been without [express] permission of the court. As you know, there are evidentiary rules pertaining thereto.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    Id., at 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    157 A.3d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   Later, during that same direct examination, the second alleged impropriety occurred when \"the prosecutor asked Murray: 'And let me just ask you this: when you spoke to the police again, what did you tell them with regard to who was the shooter?' The court sua sponte excused the jury and addressed the prosecutor, stating: 'I don't know how many times I have told you on the record, and, I believe, explicitly, that ... prior consistent statements are not admissible into evidence unless they precede prior inconsistent statements .... I have told you, with respect to the second interview, on multiple occasions, multiple occasions do not get into the contents.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"After the prosecutor indicated that she did not think that the court had been explicit in ruling that Murray's prior consistent statements were inadmissible, the court stated that '[u]nder no circumstances without prior permission of the court ... may you ask this witness about any prior consistent statement postdating the original inconsistent statement of December 6. You may not ask him about the substance of that without prior permission of the court, that includes, but is not limited to ... the substance of his statement to the police on December 27. I had thought that I was explicit, but perhaps I was not, and if so, please forgive me.' The court continued, stating: 'I have told you repeatedly not to go there. If you go there again, without prior permission of the court, you are asking-you are basically going to require me to do things that, believe me, I do not want to do. So, don't go there.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    Id., at 316-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    157 A.3d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finally, the prosecutor engaged in the third alleged impropriety related to prior consistent statements. This impropriety occurred when, \"after asking Murray whether he had visited the victim's family the day after the victim's murder, the prosecutor asked: 'With regard to what had occurred with [the victim's] murder, did you tell them what happened?' Defense counsel objected,\n   and the court sustained the objection, instructing the prosecutor to '[a]sk your next question, keeping in mind rulings that the court has already made.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    Id., at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    157 A.3d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With respect to the claim that the prosecutor improperly referred to facts not in evidence, the factual underlayment is as follows. During the trial, the state presented evidence that Murray's mother encountered Murray crying at his girlfriend's home. The prosecutor asked Murray's mother to describe Murray's demeanor as she spoke to him, and she began to tell the jury what Murray had said to her during that encounter. Defense counsel objected. The court sustained the objection and did not permit Murray's mother to testify about what Murray had said. Then, in closing argument, when referring to Murray's encounter with his mother at his girlfriend's home, the prosecutor argued: \" 'They talked, and he told her things, I can't say what they were, but I think you can think about it.' Defense counsel objected, and the court instructed the jury that '[t]his is not in evidence. Do not speculate. That is improper argument.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    Id., at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    157 A.3d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In analyzing these alleged improprieties, the Appellate Court assumed that the prosecutor had improperly disregarded the trial court's evidentiary rulings related to\n   Murray's prior consistent statements.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    Id., at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    157 A.3d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to the prosecutor's closing argument inviting the jurors to speculate about statements not in evidence regarding Murray's conversation with his mother, the Appellate Court determined, consistent with a concession by the state, that this argument was improper.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    Id., at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    157 A.3d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because the Appellate Court either assumed that these actions of the prosecutor were improper or accepted the state's concession to that effect, we need only address whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that these claimed improprieties constituted a violation of the defendant's right to due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We begin with the standard of review. \"[T]he touch-stone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial [impropriety] is the fairness of the trial, and not the culpability of the prosecutor .... The issue is whether the prosecutor's conduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process .... In determining whether the defendant was denied a fair trial [by virtue of prosecutorial impropriety] we must view the prosecutor's comments in the context of the entire trial.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12493560\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/180/882/#p543\">\n    328 Conn. 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 543,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12493560\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/180/882/#p543\">\n    180 A.3d 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ''[O]ur determination of whether any improper conduct by the state's attorney violated the defendant's fair trial rights is predicated on the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"501421\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/204/523/#p540\">\n    204 Conn. 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 540,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20A.2d%20653\">\n    529 A.2d 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987) ], with due consideration of whether that [impropriety] was objected to at trial ....

First, there is no dispute that the comments of the prosecutor were not invited by either the argument or conduct of defense counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, we conclude that the claimed improprieties were not severe. With respect to the prosecutor's allegedly improper comments regarding Murray's prior consistent statements, the severity of the alleged improprieties is belied by the fact that Murray's prior consistent statement identifying the defendant as the shooter already had been admitted into evidence without objection. Indeed, the jury already\n   had heard that Murray had given a second statement to the police that was consistent with his testimony at trial. The fact that evidence regarding Murray's prior consistent statement was already admitted into evidence without objection demonstrates both that it was not severe, in that it did not elicit an objection when it was first introduced by the state, and that the impact of the prosecutor's allegedly improper questions was lessened by the fact that the jury had already heard evidence pertaining to that statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Moreover, it is important to note that Murray did not answer any of the prosecutor's questions. It is axiomatic that questions are not evidence, only the answers to the questions are evidence. In the present case, the fact that the witness did not answer these allegedly improper questions supports the Appellate Court's conclusion that the alleged improprieties were not severe. Accordingly, we conclude that the severity factor weighs in favor of the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   With respect to the third factor, namely, the frequency of the impropriety, we conclude that this factor also weighs in favor of the state. The defendant points to three instances in which the prosecutor may have improperly referred to Murray's prior consistent statements, and one instance in which the prosecutor improperly commented on statements not in evidence. Therefore, over the course of a weeklong trial, the defendant claims four instances of prosecutorial impropriety. Thus, we cannot conclude that these improprieties were pervasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Fourth, we consider whether the claimed improprieties involved a critical issue in the case. We conclude that the statements made by the prosecutor in the present case did involve a critical issue-namely, the credibility of Murray, the state's key witness and the primary source of evidence used to obtain a conviction of the defendant. Accordingly, we conclude that this factor weighs in favor of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   With respect to the fifth factor, we conclude that the trial court adopted curative measures in response to the alleged improprieties. In response to the prosecutor's improper comments regarding Murray's prior consistent statements, the trial court sustained each of the defendant's objections and once even interjected, sua sponte, to prevent Murray from answering an inappropriate question. Moreover, the trial court provided an instruction prior to jury deliberations as follows: \"[i]t is the answer, not the question or the assumption made in the question that is the evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In connection with the prosecutor's improper reference to facts not in evidence during the closing argument, defense counsel immediately objected and the trial court gave a curative instruction. The court instructed as follows: \"Do not speculate on this. This is not in evidence. Do not speculate. That is improper\n   argument.\" \"[W]e have previously recognized that a prompt cautionary instruction to the jury regarding improper prosecutorial remarks or questions can obviate any possible harm to the defendant .... Moreover, [i]n the absence of an indication to the contrary, the jury is presumed to have followed [the trial court's] curative instructions.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ceballos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2636136\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/266/364/#p413\">\n    266 Conn. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 413,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=832%20A.2d%2014\">\n    832 A.2d 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). Therefore, we conclude that the strength of the prompt curative measures weighs in favor of the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, we consider the sixth factor, namely the strength of the state's case. We cannot conclude that the state's case was particularly strong. There was limited physical evidence, and no murder weapon was ever recovered. Nevertheless, \"we\n   have never stated that the state's evidence must have been overwhelming in order to support a conclusion that prosecutorial [impropriety] did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stevenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458155\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/563/#p596\">\n    269 Conn. 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 596,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=849%20A.2d%20626\">\n    849 A.2d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Under the circumstances presented in this case, in which the objectionable evidence already was before the jury, the witness was never permitted to answer the improper questions, and prompt curative instructions were given, we simply cannot conclude that the defendant's right to due process was violated. Accordingly, because the majority of the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in favor of the state, we conclude that the claimed improprieties in the present case did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The defendant next argues that the Appellate Court improperly upheld the trial court's denial of his motion for a new trial on the ground that the trial court lost jurisdiction upon the execution of the defendant's sentence. In particular, the defendant asserts that a trial\n   court continues to have jurisdiction over a criminal matter for four months after judgment pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"69221\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/242/125/#p136\">\n    242 Conn. 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 136,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20A.2d%20823\">\n    698 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997), and, therefore, should have ruled on the merits of his timely filed motion for a new trial. The state counters that the Appellate Court properly upheld the trial court's denial of that motion because the trial court lost jurisdiction upon execution of the defendant's sentence. We agree with the state's jurisdictional conclusion. In light of that jurisdictional defect, however, we further conclude that, as a matter of form, the trial court should have dismissed rather than denied the defendant's motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The following additional facts set forth in the Appellate Court's decision are relevant to the defendant's claim. \"On March 18, 2013, one week after the defendant was convicted of murder, he filed a motion for a new trial alleging that the prosecutor had 'continually elicited hearsay statements that the court had precluded by an earlier ruling and offered inadmissible hearsay statements during closing [argument].' ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"[Subsequently, at] the defendant's sentencing hearing ... defense counsel attempted to argue the defendant's motion for a new trial, but was stymied by the unavailability of the trial transcript. Both defense counsel and the court agreed to postpone arguments until the transcript became available. Defense counsel stated that, so long as the motion was heard at a later date, he did not have a problem going forward with the defendant's sentencing. The court agreed, stating: '[T]he proper way to consider this argument, which ... let me just say I view as colorable ... [i]s to have [defense counsel] file a memorandum with transcript references ... give the state a fair opportunity to file a memorandum of [its] own with transcript references, and then perhaps schedule argument, you know, at a convenient time. Obviously, there are a lot of family\n   members here that are here to see the sentencing, and you're not proposing postponing the sentencing.

Specifically, although this court relied on the four month rule to find that the court had jurisdiction in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , the trial court in that case did not rule on the motion for a new trial within four months of the judgment but waited until approximately five months after the judgment to rule on the motion.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"69221\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/242/125/#p136\">\n    242 Conn. at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20A.2d%20823\">\n    698 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   did not address the fact that the ruling on the motion occurred beyond the four month grant of jurisdiction or, more importantly, under what authority the trial court could rule on a motion five months after the sentencing. The concurring and\n   dissenting opinion in the present case, however, notes the discrepancy but attempts to salvage the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   by focusing on the fact that the motion was filed prior to sentencing. Of course, nothing in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   states that it was the fact that the motion was filed prior to sentencing that permitted the trial court to exercise jurisdiction beyond the four month period. Furthermore, even if we were to assume that filing the motion prior to sentencing extended the jurisdiction of the court, it certainly would not be extended in perpetuity. Yet that is precisely what\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   and the concurring and dissenting opinion suggest. Indeed, although the court paid lip service to the four month rule in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , it actually permitted an extension of five months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Noting this disparity, the concurring and dissenting opinion further attempts to salvage the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   by explaining that this court \"not only applied the four month rule, but determined that the trial court retains jurisdiction over a motion for a new trial as long as it was timely filed prior to sentencing, even if the court did not rule on the motion within the four month time frame.\" By doing so, the concurring and dissenting opinion no longer relies on\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   for its application of the four month rule but seems to assert that, as long as a motion is timely filed prior to sentencing, the trial court retains jurisdiction to modify the sentence at any time to rule on the motion. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   First, the concurring and dissenting opinion's position is not even supported by\n   <em>\n    Wilson.\n   </em>\n   As explained previously in this opinion, in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , this court suggested that the civil rule that allows trial courts to reopen or set aside civil judgments within four months of judgment applies to criminal cases. Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   or the rule of practice on which that decision relied addresses retaining the limited extension of jurisdiction past a four month period even if the motion was filed before sentencing. Second, if we were to agree with\n   the concurring and dissenting opinion and adopt its reading of\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , we would essentially give courts an even broader ability to modify criminal judgments than that allowed in civil judgments under the four month rule. We decline to take such a dramatic departure from our well established common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Furthermore, over the years following this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , we consistently have reaffirmed the principle that a trial court loses jurisdiction upon the execution of the defendant's sentence, unless\n   it is expressly authorized to act.

As these cases demonstrate, post-\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , this court has not wavered from the rule that a trial court's jurisdiction is lost upon the execution of the defendant's sentence. By contrast, we cannot find, and the defendant does not point to, any case in which this court has relied on\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that a trial court retains jurisdiction after the defendant's sentence has been executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Accordingly, given the long and consistent history of our courts applying the traditional rule that jurisdiction is lost upon the execution of a sentence, we cannot conclude that\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   reflects a retreat from that common-law rule. Instead, we acknowledge that\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   are anomalies in this court's case law, and we take this opportunity to clarify and reiterate, as we have consistently done since\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , that a trial court loses\n   jurisdiction once the defendant's sentence is executed, unless there is a constitutional or legislative grant of authority.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Luzietti\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"763488\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/230/427/\">\n    230 Conn. at 431-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=646%20A.2d%2085\">\n    646 A.2d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, any reliance on\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   by the defendant to extend the jurisdiction of the trial court beyond the point at which his sentence was executed is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In the present case, the defendant's motion for a new trial, although filed before his sentence was executed, was not ruled upon before the sentence was executed. Consequently, the trial court lost jurisdiction. A motion for a new trial-even a timely filed motion that is not ruled upon before sentence is executed-is not a special grant of authority that imbues the trial court with jurisdiction until it is ruled upon. We note that this is an unusual circumstance, and not one that makes us question or need to revisit the well established rule that the court loses jurisdiction upon sentencing. Although we acknowledge that the trial court incorrectly failed to rule on the motion for a new trial before sentencing the defendant, we are mindful of the old adage that bad facts make bad law. Therefore, we refuse to expand the jurisdiction of criminal courts in an effort to address the highly unusual circumstances of the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Indeed, the circumstance this case presents is exceedingly rare and unlikely to recur because a mechanism already exists for trial courts to maintain jurisdiction in this type of situation. Specifically, the court simply could have stayed the execution of the sentence until the motion was heard and ruled upon. To be sure, \"[t]he common law has long recognized a court's ability to stay the execution of a criminal sentence\" in order to \"fulfill its duty to implement the penalties dictated by the legislature for criminal offenses and to promote the ends of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Copeland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"757672\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/225/46/#p49\">\n    225 Conn. 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49-50,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=621%20A.2d%201311\">\n    621 A.2d 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993).

The fact that it was not the intent of the court or the parties to do so does not alter the fact that jurisdiction was lost. Jurisdiction does not turn on the intent of the parties or the court. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Das\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5765104\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/356/#p361\">\n    291 Conn. at 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=968%20A.2d%20367\">\n    968 A.2d 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying postsentencing motion to vacate judgment of conviction and to withdraw plea of nolo contendere on\n   ground that trial court lost jurisdiction upon sentencing, and concluding that there is no constitutional violation exception).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Accordingly, the trial court, albeit inadvertently, lost jurisdiction over the defendant's case. Although we observe that this was unintentional, we believe the trial court correctly ruled that \"the jurisdictional argument is not a matter of my intent .... [T]he trial court just\n   plain has no jurisdiction. It's not a matter of intent or good faith or bad faith, or anything else. The court just flat out [has] no jurisdiction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Appellate Court, therefore, properly concluded that the trial court correctly determined that it had lost jurisdiction over the defendant's case when the defendant began serving his sentence. As we explained previously in this opinion, the trial court denied the defendant's motion for a new trial. Given that it lacked jurisdiction, however, it should have dismissed that motion.

Specifically, the defendant asserts that the trial court violated Practice Book \u00a7 42-53, which required the trial court to adjudicate his motion for a new trial. The defendant further claims that, by sentencing him before ruling on the motion, the trial court improperly rendered itself unable to adjudicate the motion because it lost jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Practice Book \u00a7 42-53 (a) provides: \"Upon motion of the defendant, the judicial authority may grant a new\n   trial if it is required in the interests of justice.

Rather, he asserts that the requirement is implicit because it expressly requires that the trial court \"shall grant the motion\" if certain conditions are met.

Furthermore, on appeal to this court, the defendant did not establish harm that resulted from the trial court's alleged error in failing to adjudicate his motion for a new trial prior to sentencing him. Instead, the defendant merely asserts that the appropriate remedy for the error is to vacate his sentence so that his motion for a new trial can be adjudicated. We disagree.

The import of this rule was not raised until the state, with a further extension of time, filed its brief opposing the defendant's motion for a new trial.

I find the court's application of this rule in the present case to prevent a ruling on the defendant's motion so illogical that I cannot believe our law compels this result. In fact, it does not. Rather, there are in my view exceptions to this rule that permitted-in fact, required-the trial court to retain jurisdiction over the defendant's motion for a new trial, which was timely filed prior to sentencing. These exceptions fall within the scope of our existing case law. To the extent that they do not, I believe that under this court's inherent authority to develop the common law, this court should adopt a sensible exception to avoid such an illogical result. Finally, even in the absence of any exception, I would conclude that it was plain error for the trial court not to have ruled on the motion for a new trial before sentencing, and I would reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court with direction to remand the case to the trial court with direction to rule on that motion-a simple solution that I cannot fathom our law does not permit.

In a situation such as this, it is the\n   <em>\n    courts\n   </em>\n   that define the contours of their common-law jurisdiction over a common-law motion, not the legislature.

Under this\n   exception, the trial court in the present case had jurisdiction to rule on the timely filed motion for a new trial, despite the defendant's having begun serving his sentence, because the motion was filed and, even with an extension of time for briefing, was to have been ruled on within four months of the sentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clearly, if a court retains jurisdiction to modify a sentence for up until four months after the judgment, a timely motion for a new trial filed prior to sentencing falls within this four month time frame. Accordingly, under the four month rule espoused in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , even after sentencing, the trial court retained jurisdiction to rule on the timely filed motion for a new trial because the motion's filing and the court's ruling both occurred before four months had passed after sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Then, in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , this court stated that \"the trial court retained jurisdiction to entertain the motion for a new trial [that was timely filed prior to sentencing but not decided until] after sentencing because it could have opened the judgment.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"69221\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/242/125/#p136\">\n    242 Conn. at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20A.2d%20823\">\n    698 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This possibly suggests that\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   not only applied the four month rule, but determined that the trial court retains jurisdiction over a motion for a new\n   trial as long as it was timely filed prior to sentencing, even if the court did not rule on the motion within the four month time frame.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the extent that the court in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   misapplied the four month rule in this regard, such an error does not affect the applicability of the four month rule to the present case, in which the trial court did rule on the motion within four months of sentencing. See footnote 7 of this concurring and dissenting opinion. In all other aspects, the procedural posture of the present case is nearly identical to that of\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   : a motion for a new trial filed before sentencing and within\n   the time permitted to file such a motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , the trial court in the present case retained jurisdiction to decide the defendant's motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The majority counters that the four month rule does not apply, in essence holding that\n   <em>\n    Luzietti\n   </em>\n   and subsequent cases overruled\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   sub silentio.

Fairness, equity and justice are essential to the justice system as a whole, not just to the civil side of that system. Although this court never has applied the mutual mistake exception in a criminal case, I can think of no policy reason that justifies remedying mutual mistakes in civil cases but not in criminal cases, especially in light of the greater liberty interests at stake in criminal cases. The Appellate Court, in fact, has noted that the exception should apply equally in criminal cases. In\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dayton\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491209\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/171/482/\">\n    176 Conn.

See part I A of this concurring and dissenting opinion. In exceptional circumstances, as in the present case, where both parties and the court did not realize that application of the rule at issue would deprive the court of jurisdiction, such a mutual mistake\n   should not divest the court of jurisdiction to decide a timely filed motion for a new trial. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1960825\" index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/8/248/#p251\">\n    8 Conn.

Such an application of the rule is unfair, inequitable and unjust, and I would therefore conclude that the court could have exercised jurisdiction to rule on the motion for a new trial in this case because of mutual mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Even if, as the majority suggests, neither of these exceptions apply and our current case law does not permit a trial court after sentencing to rule on a timely filed motion for a new trial, I believe we can and should recognize such a sensible exception to what Holmes would refer to as the \"axioms and corollaries [akin to] a book of mathematics.\" O. Holmes, supra, p. 5. As discussed previously, the rule at issue is a common-law rule. As a common-law rule borne out of experience and sensibility; see id.; this court has the inherent power to define its contours to ensure that its application does not lead to unsensible and unjust results, inherent power that includes the ability to limit its scope and applicability through exceptions to it, such as for timely filed motions for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Ultimately, it is a question of judicial policy for this court to determine whether our common-law rule should prevent a timely filed motion for a new trial from being adjudicated when the trial court and the parties mistakenly believed that the court could rule on the motion after sentencing. See\n   <em>\n    Dacey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Bar Assn.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556231\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/184/21/#p25\">\n    184 Conn. 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 25-26,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=441%20A.2d%2049\">\n    441 A.2d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981) (defining common law as \"the prevailing sense of the\n   more enlightened members of a particular community, expressed through the instrumentality of the courts ... in view of the particular circumstances of the time\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). I would hold that our law should permit a trial court under these circumstances to exercise jurisdiction to rule on the timely filed motion for a new trial. If the trial court denies the motion, the court's judgment and sentence remain the same. If the trial court were to find the motion to have merit, I believe our law should permit the court to \"open, correct and modify\" its judgment by vacating the sentence and ordering a new trial, just as our court could order if, on appeal, we were to find error. Such an exception would be consistent with this court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , to the extent that\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   does not rely on the four month rule. It may be unclear from\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   whether the court relied solely on the four month rule in holding that the trial court retained jurisdiction over a motion for a new trial that was timely filed prior to sentencing, but not ruled on until after sentencing. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"69221\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/242/125/#p136\">\n    242 Conn. at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20A.2d%20823\">\n    698 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . What is clear from\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , however, is that this court held that there was an exception to the common-law rule at issue under such circumstances. Just as in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , the trial court in the present case originally had jurisdiction over a timely filed motion for a new trial, and the issue is whether the court then accidentally lost jurisdiction. As a matter of law,\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   clarified that the common-law rule does not deprive the court of jurisdiction in these circumstances. As a matter of judicial policy, such an exception is necessary to protect a defendant's ability to seek review of his new trial claims from the court that presided over the trial and had the opportunity to view the effect of any alleged improprieties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The state argues that an unflinching application of the general rule is necessary to ensure eventual finality and to prevent trial judges from dawdling over motions for too long. Both policies are laudable, but, in my view,\n   neither suffices to justify\n   strict adherence to a supposed general rule at such a cost to defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   First, as the state admitted candidly in argument before this court, finality is not achieved in this case: it is an illusion. Namely, the issues raised in the timely motion that the trial court accidentally lost jurisdiction over can and will be raised in postjudgment petitions for a new trial or habeas corpus or a motion to correct an illegal sentence. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   , supra, 295 Conn. at 837, 839,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=992%20A.2d%201103\">\n    992 A.2d 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"permitting correction of both illegal sentences and sentences imposed in an illegal manner\" and noting that \"[t]he defendant has a legitimate interest in the character of the procedure which leads to the imposition of sentence even if he may have no right to object to a particular result of the sentencing process\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). The state goes on to argue that while that might be true, there is virtue in moving the case along to the inevitable next step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Although I cannot disagree with-and perhaps join the state in-the cynical view on which this argument is based (i.e., there will always be a postjudgment challenge), to me, this inevitability should not contribute to the misapplication of a rule to a situation to which it should not apply. Moreover, although this defendant or any other might very well be able to add his new trial claims to any other collateral challenge he brings, as the state well knows, the obstacles to relief for a convicted criminal defendant increase as the burdens of proof heighten in collateral proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Would it\n   not have been better for everyone if we had the considered views of the trial judge on these issues (issues the trial judge called \"colorable\"), whether on direct appeal or on collateral review? In fact, we must defer to the judge who sat through the trial and witnessed the impact on the jury of the prosecutor's actions and the court's rulings. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20325\">\n    313 Conn. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 347,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20A.3d%201238\">\n    96 A.3d 1238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (\"the trial [judge has a] superior opportunity to assess the proceedings over which he or she has personally presided\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Ruling on the issue through a timely filed motion for a new trial, reviewed on direct appeal with deference, very likely removes the issue from among any the defendant might seek to raise in a collateral proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Additionally, this court previously has rejected arguments that the need for \"finality\" justifies upholding a judgment obtained through mutual mistake or fraud. In\n   <em>\n    In re Baby Girl B.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"549908\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/224/263/#p283\">\n    224 Conn. at 265-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=618%20A.2d%201\">\n    618 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the commissioner of the Department of Children and Youth Services (commissioner) filed a petition for termination of parental rights on the ground of abandonment pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (1).

Although the court in\n   <em>\n    In re Baby Girl B.\n   </em>\n   , was required to interpret \u00a7 52-212a, the court's analysis established that a public policy in favor of finality does not necessarily trump the court's inherent authority to open judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Finally, even as the majority applies the jurisdictional rule with exactitude, it tempers the rule with an obvious work-around: the trial court can simply sentence the defendant and stay the sentence until the court gets around to ruling on the motion. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Walzer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519119\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/208/420/#p425\">\n    208 Conn. 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424-25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=545%20A.2d%20559\">\n    545 A.2d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). In my view this is no rule at all. Although I agree with the majority that staying the proceedings is a \"useful mechanism,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   it surely does not\n   vindicate the policies the state offers\n   in support of the rule. This work-around undercuts not only the finality of the judgment, but also the other policy justification the state offers for the draconian rule the majority adheres to, i.e., that trial judges will take too long to rule on such motions. I am not aware that this is a prevalent problem. If it is, perhaps it is an issue the Rules Committee of the Superior Court can address. But the sanction of the court losing jurisdiction over a timely motion for a new trial that it characterized as \"colorable\" seems to me to be a solution far out of proportion to a potential problem that is so easily overcome by other means. Better in my view to recognize an exception to the rule than to pay lip service to a rule so easily avoided, especially when an exception would be an equally useful mechanism.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   As a result, I find neither of the state's policy justifications persuasive. Rather, on the basis of judicial experience\n   and sensibility; see O. Holmes, supra, p. 5; I believe judicial policy, consistent with this court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , favors recognizing an exception under the circumstances at issue in this case. As a result of either accident or the parties' mutual oversight of controlling law, a defendant should not be deprived of his opportunity to have his properly filed common-law motion for a new trial decided by the judge who oversaw his criminal trial, and personally observed the jury and its reaction to evidence and arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Even if I were to accept the majority's conclusion that there is no exception under the common law that would permit the trial court to rule on a timely filed motion for a new trial after the defendant had been sentenced, I have no trouble calling the trial court's \"unintentional\" loss of jurisdiction what it clearly was: plain error. As two erudite commentators have advised: \"Plain error is most likely found where the trial court and the parties have overlooked clearly controlling law, be it a constitution, statute, rule, case law or 'established practice.' \" C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, Connecticut Appellate Practice and Procedure (3d Ed. 2000) \u00a7 8.7, p. 304. This seems to me to be a textbook-perhaps hornbook-example of plain error: the trial court and the parties overlooked controlling case law when the court, with the parties' agreement, continued the new trial motion and went on to sentence the defendant. More specifically, if both the state and the Appellate Court are correct that the \"traditional rule\" applies in the present case, ending the trial court's jurisdiction when the sentence was pronounced and executed, with no exception for a timely filed motion for a new trial or the parties' and the court's mutual mistake, in my view it was plain error for the trial court to so pronounce and execute sentence, leaving a\n   properly filed motion to be lost in the oblivion. At the very least, the court should have stayed the defendant's sentence while it considered the\n   motion, as the majority suggests trial courts do routinely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   I fully recognize that \"[t]he plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings .... [I]n addition to examining the patent nature of the error, the reviewing court must examine that error for the grievousness of its consequences in order to determine whether reversal under the plain error doctrine is appropriate.

The trial court in this case failed in that obligation by losing jurisdiction over the motion. That it did so accidentally or inadvertently does not make it any more fair to the defendant or impact public confidence any less. I do not read the majority to contend otherwise. Rather, while acknowledging that it was error for the trial court not to rule on the pending motion, the majority concludes that this error was neither so obvious nor so harmful as to constitute \"manifest injustice.\" I do not agree.\n   As to whether the error was \"so clear\" or \"so obvious,\" the majority appears to conclude that the error falls in a sweet spot (or, for the defendant, a not so sweet spot). Namely, we are told that the rule that the trial court loses jurisdiction upon sentencing is a \"generally accepted\" and \"well established\" jurisdictional and common-law doctrine. Yet, because of what the majority considers to have been \"anomalies in this court's case law\" that \"may have resulted in some confusion,\" the error was not sufficiently clear to fall within the clear error test. This is a needle I have a hard time threading.\n   The majority's view might be persuasive if, when the trial court sentenced the defendant without ruling on his timely new trial motion, it had sorted among what the majority finds to be anomalous or confusing precedents. But, like the parties, the trial court missed altogether the \"loss of jurisdiction\" issue, sorting among the precedents only after the horse had left the jurisdictional barn. Thus, the trial court's error was not in determining whether\n   <em>\n    Luzietti\n   </em>\n   applied, as opposed to\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , but rather in not considering the import of the \"well established\" rule\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   , at a time when it still could have ruled on the defendant's motion, as it was obliged to, including by putting off the sentencing proceeding or by pronouncing sentence and staying its execution. Whether this error actually affected the court's subject matter jurisdiction was perhaps arguably not clear or obvious, but the fact that the court should have, but did not, rule on the new trial motion prior to sentencing\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   clear and obvious. By not doing so, the defendant was denied an opportunity to seek a new trial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-53. This seems to me exactly the kind of error that the plain error doctrine was designed to address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   As to the second prong of the plain error test, although I agree with the majority that unlike the situation for defendants in structural error cases, the defendant in the present case was required to establish harm that amounts to manifest injustice, I disagree that the defendant failed to do so. The majority concludes that there is no \"manifest injustice\" because the alleged prosecutorial improprieties detailed in the motion for a new trial are the same improprieties that this court concludes lack merit on direct appeal. What the record in this appeal lacks, however, is the ruling of the trial judge who presided over the defendant's trial. Today's majority essentially declares that that ruling was unnecessary. I do not agree, and I would conclude that the defendant was harmed by not having his motion for a\n   new trial reviewed first by the trial judge who supervised his criminal trial, notwithstanding our conclusion today affirming the judgment of the trial court on the record presented. See footnote 1 of this concurring and dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   It is well established that a trial judge is in a better position to assess any error or prejudice that occurred during trial. It is the trial judge who viewed the evidence, heard the witnesses' testimony and counsel's arguments, and viewed the jury's reaction. Motions for a new trial provide the best remedy when claims of prosecutorial impropriety are alleged because they permit the trial court to rely on its personal experience at trial, during which the court may have observed the effect and prejudice, if any, the impropriety had on the jury. It is because of this firsthand experience that trial courts are afforded discretion in deciding motions for a new trial, which we then review for abuse of that discretion. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4142981\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/290/278/#p288\">\n    290 Conn. 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 288-89,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=963%20A.2d%2011\">\n    963 A.2d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). Thus, the manifest injustice in this case is not necessarily that the defendant would have prevailed on his claims, but rather that the parties\n   <em>\n    and this court\n   </em>\n   have lost the benefit\n   of the trial court's considered views of his claims, especially in light of the fact that the trial judge deemed the defendant's motion for a new trial \"colorable ....\" Even if the trial court would have denied the motion, we would have had the benefit of a record of its reasons for doing so, which potentially could impact our review of the claims on direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   It is the significance of the trial court's discretion that distinguishes this case from the case cited by the majority,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4142981\" index=\"321\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/290/278/#p288\">\n    290 Conn. 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"322\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=963%20A.2d%2011\">\n    963 A.2d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , defense counsel waived a trial on part B of the information, which charged the defendant as a repeat offender, and, thus, the trial court did not \"accord him a hearing regarding his jeopardy as a repeat offender and ... make a finding regarding his status as a repeat offender in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 42-2....\" (Internal\n   quotation marks omitted.)

The Appellate Court in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   had held that the trial court's failure to abide by \u00a7 42-2 was plain error because \"[a] court commits plain error when it fails to implement properly the mandatory provisions of clearly applicable rules of practice.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=963%20A.2d%2011\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   This court reversed in part the judgment of the Appellate Court, explaining that \"apart from the trial court's failure to comply strictly with the applicable rule of practice, which we do not condone, the defendant has failed to raise any doubt with respect to the validity of his prior conviction.

The sole issue in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   was the legal question of whether the defendant could waive a hearing on the part B information and bypass Practice Book \u00a7 42-2. In the present case, the trial court was required to exercise its discretion to determine whether to grant a new trial on the basis of whether the alleged prosecutorial improprieties prejudiced the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   At great risk of being unduly practical, and understanding that the defendant must demonstrate prejudice, I fail to understand just what the state and the majority fear here. If the trial court denies the defendant's motion, the court has vindicated the defendant's right to a ruling on his timely motion, respected its authority and obligation to rule on that motion, and prevented collateral litigation on the failure of the court to rule on the motion and the failure of the parties to recognize their oversight. If the trial court grants the motion for a new trial, there is no need for this appeal, unless the state seeks and obtains permission to appeal. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-96 (state cannot appeal in criminal case unless permitted to do so by trial court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   I further part company with the majority on the issue of manifest injustice in that the majority already has concluded that the trial court could not under any circumstances have granted the motion as a matter of discretion. I reject that notion. It was the trial judge who observed the questions the prosecutor posed, the witnesses' conduct and the jury's reaction, and expressed his own frustration with the prosecutor. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489485\" index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/97/#p312\">\n    171 Conn.

I do not agree that our affirmance of the judgment on the prosecutorial impropriety issues raised; see part I of the majority opinion; means that the trial court's own ruling on those issues was preordained or ineluctable. It is not possible to say that the court would have abused its discretion if the record had been augmented by the court's views and the court had\n   <em>\n    granted\n   </em>\n   the motion\n   for a new trial on the basis of the issues the defendant sought to raise in that motion. And if the trial court had granted the motion, there could be no doubt that the defendant had been so harmed as to amount to manifest injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Nor can I agree with the state that the defendant has suffered no manifest injustice because he can always raise his claims in a petition for a new trial or for a writ of habeas corpus. As the state well knows, the burdens of demonstrating prejudice are much steeper in such collateral proceedings. See footnote 12 of this concurring and dissenting opinion. In addition, the defendant would suffer prejudice by virtue of any delay he would endure if he were entitled to prevail, and would have prevailed, on his timely filed motion. In fact, being consigned to having to raise his claims in a collateral proceeding because of the trial court's accidental and inadvertent loss of jurisdiction\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   the manifestation of prejudice that in my view warrants invoking the plain error doctrine. Accordingly, because the error in this case was clear and harmful, I would reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case\n   to that court with direction to remand the case to the trial court to rule on the motion for a new trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   I therefore respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    The defendant appealed directly to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3), and we subsequently transferred the appeal to the Appellate Court.

As this court repeatedly has recognized, a judge sitting in the criminal court often finds that it is necessary to stay the execution of a defendant's sentence to ensure that criminal sentences are imposed in the manner intended. See\n    <em>\n     Copeland\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Warden\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"757672\" index=\"349\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/225/46/#p49\">\n     225 Conn. 46\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 49,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"350\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=621%20A.2d%201311\">\n     621 A.2d 1311\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1993). For instance, if a defendant has charges pending in multiple jurisdictions, staying the execution of the sentence in one jurisdiction until the defendant is able to resolve his matters in another jurisdiction enables the defendant to receive appropriate credit for the time served on the charges. Therefore, instead of being a \"work-around,\" as the concurring and dissenting opinion asserts, this is a useful mechanism, which is expressly rooted in case law and routinely utilized by Superior Court judges, and could have been utilized by the trial court in the present case to avoid the result the concurring and dissenting opinion seeks to avoid. Given the fact that a trial court loses jurisdiction in a criminal case upon execution of the defendant's sentence, the well established procedure, which the law has recognized for years, is more properly viewed as a way to promote the ends of justice and efficiency.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    The concurring and dissenting opinion asserts that, \"[e]ven if the majority is correct that\n    <em>\n     Luzietti\n    </em>\n    has thrown cold water on\n    <em>\n     Wilson\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Myers\n    </em>\n    , the trial court could have opened the judgment to rule on the new trial motion under the related concept of mutual mistake.\" The concurring and dissenting opinion then proposes that this court should apply the civil mutual mistake doctrine, which allows a party to file a motion to open or set aside a judgment within four months from the date of judgment if it was obtained because of a mutual mistake. It is important to note that neither of the parties asked this court to adopt this rule, and it was not argued at the trial court or the Appellate Court. Accordingly, we decline to address it.

Otherwise, the trial court would be in the unenviable position of either ignoring the Appellate Court's decision in its entirety or grappling with its determinations on issues that the Appellate Court has determined have no merit. However, it is unclear what authority this court has to vacate the decision of the Appellate Court in these circumstances.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    Rather than tackle these procedural complexities, the concurring and dissenting opinion's proposal is to \"reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court with direction to remand the case to the trial court to rule on the motion for a new trial.\" Not only does this suggested remand order ignore the defendant's sentence-which was not an illegal sentence-but it disregards the fact that the Appellate Court has considered the merits of the defendant's prosecutorial impropriety claims and found those claims to be meritless.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    The concurring and dissenting opinion appears to read much into the trial court's statement that the motion for new trial was colorable.

In fact, although not relied on by the majority, one of the justifications advanced in support of the rule is that upon execution of sentence, the custody of the defendant is transferred from the court to the Commissioner of Correction, which arguably implicates the court's jurisdiction over the defendant's person.

This difficulty is exacerbated in this case if the defendant is required to bring his claim by means of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which requires him to establish prejudice;\n    <em>\n     Strickland\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Washington\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"385\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p694\">\n     466 U.S. 668\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 694,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"386\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p694\">\n     104 S.Ct. 2052\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"387\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p694\">\n     80 L.Ed.2d 674\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1984) ; or by means of a petition for a new trial, which requires him to establish that there will be \"a different result in a new trial\";\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492117\" index=\"388\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/534/#p92\">\n     328 Conn. 84\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 92,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492117\" index=\"389\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/534/#p92\">\n     177 A.3d 534\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2018) ; or by means of direct appeal, in which the appellate courts are deprived of the trial court's views on the matter, especially in light of the fact that it is unknown if the trial court would have granted the \"colorable\" motion in the present case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    The majority attempts to distinguish the \"useful mechanism\" of staying the defendant's sentence from the exception that I suggest our case law permits, or should permit, on the ground that it \"is expressly rooted in case law ....\" Rather than distinguish, the history of staying proceedings bolsters my view that this court has inherent power to develop the common law, including through the creation of exceptions to a common-law jurisdictional rule. A court's power to stay the execution of a sentence derives not from a statute or a constitutional provision. It is an inherent common-law power: \"The common law has long recognized a court's ability to stay the execution of a criminal sentence in a variety of contexts .... [T]he power to stay the execution of a sentence, in whole or in part, in a criminal case, is inherent in every court having final jurisdiction in such cases, unless otherwise provided by statute .... Absent an abuse of discretion or a limiting statute, therefore, a trial court has the ability to stay the execution of a criminal sentence in order to fulfill its duty to implement the penalties dictated by the legislature for criminal offenses and to promote the ends of justice.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Copeland\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Warden\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"757672\" index=\"390\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/225/46/#p49\">\n     225 Conn. 46\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 49-50,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"391\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=621%20A.2d%201311\">\n     621 A.2d 1311\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1993) (permitting court to stay execution of sentence until after defendant finished psychiatric treatment); see also\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Leak\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088187\" index=\"392\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/297/524/#p537\">\n     297 Conn. 524\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 537,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"393\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=998%20A.2d%201182\">\n     998 A.2d 1182\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2010) (trial court had inherent common-law power to impose on defendant consecutive terms of commitment following insanity acquittals of multiple offenses by staying execution of one term of commitment until expiration of another term of commitment).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    It is true that the exception I suggest involves the trial court fulfilling its duty to decide a motion for a new trial after the sentence has been executed, as in\n    <em>\n     Myers\n    </em>\n    , while the mechanism of staying the execution of the sentence occurs after sentencing but before execution. This distinction, however, does not justify the majority's conclusion that the court loses subject matter jurisdiction under the former circumstance but not the latter. Under both circumstances, the defendant has been sentenced. The only difference is whether the defendant is in the custody of the Department of Correction. Such a difference appears to implicate personal jurisdiction, not subject matter jurisdiction. See footnote 2 of this concurring and dissenting opinion. As such, both mechanisms are the product of the common law, which this court develops pursuant to its inherent authority.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    The majority makes a very fair point in questioning whether the exception that I suggest exists (or should exist) can extend \"in perpetuity.\" I have the same question about the mechanism that the majority says should have been employed. Can the trial court stay the defendant's sentence \"in perpetuity\" while considering the new trial motion? I imagine that at some point under either scenario an appellate court could be called on to exercise its supervisory authority over the administration of justice to compel a ruling on the motion. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 60-2 (\"[t]he supervision and control of the proceedings shall be in the court having appellate jurisdiction from the time the appellate matter is filed,\n    <em>\n     or earlier\n    </em>\n    , if appropriate\" [emphasis added] ) and 66-6 (permitting this court to modify trial court order concerning stay upon motion for review).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    The state objects even to our considering this issue as plain error, although it admits that this court may raise an issue as plain error on its own. See Practice Book 60-5. I do not find it a particularly close question that this case involves an exceptional circumstance that justifies raising plain error on our own, i.e., the \"unintentional\" or \"inadvertent\" loss of jurisdiction over a motion that is the last step before the trial court was to sentence the defendant to sixty years imprisonment. Given this unique and exceptional circumstance, I see very little risk that significant violence will befall our plain error jurisprudence if we invoke the doctrine in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    Additionally, even accepting, as I do, the state's representation before the trial court that its agreement \"to continue the motion for briefing and argument\" was \"not meant to deceive either the defendant or the [trial] court,\" I fail to understand how the state's position opposing plain error review contributes to \" 'public confidence in the judicial proceedings.' \"\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     McClain\n    </em>\n    , supra, 324 Conn. at 812,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489137\" index=\"394\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/209/#p812\">\n     155 A.3d 209\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Like the trial court and the defendant, the state quite apparently overlooked controlling law, leading to a loss of the defendant's opportunity to press his \"colorable\" new trial motion. This collective inadvertence, I believe, quite clearly \"affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     McClain\n    </em>\n    , supra, at 812,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489137\" index=\"395\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/209/#p812\">\n     155 A.3d 209\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    Although I have been unable to find a case with a procedural posture identical to that of the present case, in other unique cases in which the trial court failed to rule on a motion or failed to conduct a hearing, this court has remanded the case to the trial court to rule on the motion or conduct the hearing and then, based on the outcome of those further proceedings, either this court or the trial court has been permitted to vacate the sentence and order a new trial.
