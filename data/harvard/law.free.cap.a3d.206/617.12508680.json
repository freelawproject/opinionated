Brown, William Lawrence III and Mirsada Begovic (collectively, OpenPittsburgh.Org) appeal from the Allegheny County (County) Common Pleas Court's (trial court) March 15, 2018 order dismissing their appeal. OpenPittsburgh.Org presents the following issues for this Court's review: (1) whether the County Administrative Code's (Administrative Code) subject matter restriction on voter referenda and agenda initiative petitions related to the conduct of elections is unconstitutional; (2) whether the ordinance (Ordinance) proposed by the Agenda Initiative Petition (Petition) to establish a Voting Process Review Commission to conduct periodic review of the County's voting machine systems is legally proper under the County Home Rule Charter (CHRC) and Pennsylvania's Home Rule Charter and Optional Plans Law (HRC &amp; OPL)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as it does not involve the conduct of elections as defined by Pennsylvania law; (3) whether the Ordinance can be read in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Election Code (Election Code)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Pennsylvania Constitution because it follows the electors' constitutional right to select devices used for recording and computing votes;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, (4) whether the Ordinance's severability clause enables County Council to enact the Ordinance's lawful provisions and sever any individual unlawful, invalid, void or unenforceable provisions therefrom without rejecting the Ordinance in full. After review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 24, 2017, OpenPittsburgh.Org submitted the Petition to the County Council's clerk to place the Ordinance on the County Council's regular meeting agenda. Although County Council determined that the Ordinance met all of the Administrative Code's formal requirements, it nevertheless issued a Statement of Clarification dated August 7, 2017 certifying the Petition as insufficient. County Council relied on the County Solicitor's conclusion that the Ordinance is not legally proper for County Council's consideration. On August 17, 2017, OpenPittsburgh.Org appealed from County Council's decision to the trial court, asking the trial court to reverse the County Solicitor's conclusion and to compel County Council to place the Ordinance on its agenda. The trial court dismissed OpenPittsburgh.Org's appeal as meritless.

The preamble to the Charter provides[:] 'We the people of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, believe that: ... [a] home rule government that permits initiative and referendum will respond to the concerns of its citizens.' Article XII of the Home Rule Charter sets forth three areas for voter involvement. First, 'voters of the County shall have the power to propose ordinances by petition for consideration by County Council.' Home Rule Charter, Article XII, \u00a7 1 (entitled 'Agenda Initiative'). Section 2, entitled 'Voter Referendum,' provides, 'voters of the County shall have the power to propose ordinances by petition for consideration by the voters of the County.' Home Rule Charter, Article XII, \u00a7 2(a). Voter referendum questions must be germane to County government and involve a single subject, clearly expressed in the title. Moreover, the petition seeking a voter referendum must be signed by voters of the County comprising five percent of the number of voters who voted in the most recent gubernatorial election, which currently requires approximately 23,000 voters. [CHRC,] Article XII, \u00a7 2(b). If approved by the voters, the ordinance proposed in the referendum question 'shall become effective in accordance with its terms' and 'shall not be subject to veto and shall not be amended or repealed by County Council for two years following its approval.' [CHRC,] Article XII, \u00a7 2(d). Finally, the third method of voter involvement is amending the Home Rule Charter through a referendum initiated by ordinance of County Council or by petition of voters.

Because the Pennsylvania Constitution reserves the power to provide, by general law, the use and choice of voting machines to the General Assembly, and the General Assembly has enacted the Election Code which delegates said power to the County's Board of Elections (Elections Board), the Election Code is the final authority on voting machines in this Commonwealth. Thus, the Elections Board has the exclusive control over election equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Section 5-1205.16 of the Ordinance establishes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A. If the [Voting Process Review] Commission's preliminary review finds the County's present voting system fails to meet all of the mandatory minimum criteria and that updating, upgrading or modifying it would be insufficient, or, if at a later point in its continuing review the Commission deems full replacement of the existing voting system to be necessary or advisable and the preferred alternative, then\n   <strong>\n    upon the\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Voting Process Review\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    Commission's request, County Council shall by resolution cause a referendum question to be placed on the ballot in a special election; a yes vote to the question approving, and a no vote rejecting, replacement as designated by the\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Voting Process Review\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    Commission; the question to read: 'Shall the County of Allegheny replace its current voting system in accordance with the designation and recommendations of the Voting Process Review Commission?\n   </strong>\n   '\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   B.\n   <strong>\n    A referendum\n   </strong>\n   to approve or reject replacement of the existing voting system\n   <strong>\n    shall be scheduled\n   </strong>\n   for no later than would enable implementation of the [Voting Process Review] Commission's\n   findings prior to the municipal election cycle preceding the next presidential election.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   C.

The Ordinance not only usurps the General Assembly's authority and the Elections Board's control over Commonwealth voting machines, but also the funding thereof.
