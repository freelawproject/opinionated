Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   1In this case involving the reporting requirements for a cancer claim by a volunteer firefighter under Sections 108(r) and 301(f) of the Workers' Compensation Act (Act),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bristol Borough (Employer) petitions for review of an order of the Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Board) that affirmed, as modified, a Workers' Compensation Judge's (WCJ) order granting William Burnett's (Claimant) claim petition and awarding him total disability benefits for a closed period. Section 301(c)(2) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2), provides that the term \"injury\" as used in the Act shall include an \"occupational disease\" as defined in Section 108 of the Act. The Act of July 7, 2011, P.L. 251 (commonly known as Act 46), amended Section 108 to\n   include: \"(r) Cancer suffered by a firefighter which is caused by exposure to a known carcinogen which is recognized as a Group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   77 P.S. \u00a7 27.1(r). Act 46 also added Section 301(f) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 414, which requires that any claim by a member of a volunteer fire company be based on evidence of direct exposure to a carcinogen referred to in Section 108(r) as documented by reports filed pursuant to the Pennsylvania Fire Information Reporting System (PennFIRS).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the present case, the WCJ determined Claimant met his burden of proving his entitlement to benefits for cancer, which his doctors diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell/Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (large B-cell NH-lymphoma ), under Sections 301(c)(2), 301(f) and 108(r) of the Act. The WCJ determined that Claimant's medical expert, Dr. Tee L. Guidotti (Dr. Guidotti), credibly opined in his report\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that Claimant's type of lymphoma arose from his exposure to Group 1 carcinogens in fire smoke, primarily trichloroethylene (TCE), a halogenated alkene compound formed by the reaction of organic material produced by burning and chlorine from sources such as polyvinyl chloride furnishings and products found in structures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The WCJ also determined that Claimant's incident participation report, based on information compiled from his volunteer fire company's PennFIRS reports, met the PennFIRS reporting requirements in Section 301(f) of the Act. The Board also determined that Claimant's incident participation report met the reporting requirements in Section 301(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, Employer contends: (1) the Board erred by disregarding the plain language of Section 301(f) of the Act, which requires that a volunteer firefighter use only PennFIRS reports to prove exposure to a known Group 1 carcinogen; (2) the WCJ erred in allowing testimony from the Pennsylvania Fire Commissioner regarding the legislative history of Section 301(f)'s requirements regarding the forms of proof for volunteer firefighter claims; (3) the Board erred by failing to require proof that Claimant's specific cancer was directly related to firefighting exposure; and (4) the Board erred in sustaining a subrogation lien that was never properly established by competent admissible evidence. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Claim Petition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In September 2015, Claimant filed a claim petition under Section 108(r) of the Act alleging he sustained large B-cell NH-lymphoma as a result of exposure to IARC Group 1 carcinogens while working as a volunteer firefighter for Employer. Claimant sought full indemnity benefits from February 18, 2015, into the future. Claimant's petition indicated he had additional employment. Employer filed a timely answer denying Claimant's material allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Claimant, 57 years old at the time of his deposition, testified that he is still a member\n   of Goodwill Hose Company No. 3, a volunteer fire company in Bristol Borough. WCJ Op., 10/14/16, Finding of Fact (F.F.) No. 13a. He initially joined the company in 1976, and served as a firefighter, lieutenant, captain, assistant chief, deputy chief, and chief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Regardless of his rank, Claimant would respond to fires and be an active participant in the attack phase, interior firefighting and overhaul.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Claimant indicated he fought all types of fires, including houses, warehouses, industrial structures, commercial buildings, and cars. F.F. No. 13e. Claimant estimated he participated in 2,000 responses to incidents during his career. F.F. No. 13p. He responded to his last fire call in January 2015. F.F. No. 13z.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Claimant further testified that since 1979 he began working as a mail carrier for the U.S. Postal Service. F.F. No. 13s. During the 1980s, Claimant also worked as a part-time paid firefighter for Bristol Borough. F.F. No. 13u. He would fill in for absent regular full-time employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In February 2015, Claimant's doctors diagnosed him with large B-cell NH-lymphoma. F.F. No. 13w. Claimant began treating with Dr. Lebovic at that time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Claimant received six rounds of chemotherapy and continued his cancer treatment with Dr. Lebovic. F.F. No. 13x.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 1, 2015, Claimant returned to work as a mailman without restrictions. F.F. No. 13y. Claimant received the same amount of pay as he did prior to the onset of his disability in February 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In support of his claim, Claimant introduced a medical report from Dr. Guidotti, a physician board certified in internal medicine, pulmonary medicine and occupational medicine. F.F. No. 14a. Dr. Guidotti is also a well-recognized expert in toxicology and epidemiology as applied to the problems of occupational and environmental exposure, with particular reference to the occupational health of firefighters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. Guidotti noted Claimant's 39 years of firefighting. F.F. No. 14b. Claimant became acutely ill with diarrhea in early February 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   His doctors diagnosed him with large B-cell NH-lymphoma on February 26, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dr. Guidotti explained that the IARC recognizes there is an association between large B-cell NH-lymphoma and the occupation of firefighter. F.F. No. 14e. In particular, Dr. Guidotti concluded that scientific studies establish there is a causal relationship between firefighting and large B-cell NH-lymphoma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Dr. Guidotti further stated that the IARC concluded, based upon medical and scientific studies, that firefighters have an elevated risk, \"up to doubling,\" for developing large B-cell NH-lymphoma. F.F. No. 14f. Dr. Guidotti noted there is strong evidence showing that large B-cell NH-lymphoma is associated with carcinogenic exposures known to occur during firefighting. F.F. No. 14h. TCE is a halogenated alkene compound formed by the reaction of organic material produced by burning and chlorine from sources such as polyvinyl chloride furnishings and products found in structures. TCE, often present in smoke at structure fires, has been specifically associated with several types of large B-cell NH-lymphoma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Guidotti stated the present \"state of the art,\" as indicated by the pertinent medical and scientific studies, is that the weight of the evidence favors the conclusion that constituents of fire smoke, particularly TCE, are associated with elevated risk of large B-cell NH-lymphoma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Consequently, Dr. Guidotti opined within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Claimant's cancer, a specific form of NH-lymphoma, arose out of his occupation as a firefighter. F.F. No. 14i. To that end,\n   the doctor noted Claimant had no other risk factors for large B-cell NH-lymphoma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Claimant also introduced the deposition testimony of Pennsylvania Fire Commissioner Edward Mann (Fire Commissioner). Fire Commissioner testified the Governor appointed him to his post in 2000. F.F. No. 15a. Fire Commissioner has been involved in the fire service since he first joined a local volunteer fire department in 1977.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also served in the U.S. Air Force as a fire protection specialist for 17 years and remained active in the fire service wherever he was stationed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As part of his responsibilities, Fire Commissioner serves as liaison between the fire service, the Governor's Office, and the General Assembly. F.F. No. 15b. Fire Commissioner is familiar with PennFIRS. F.F. No. 15c. The purpose of PennFIRS, which he described as Pennsylvania's version of the National Fire Reporting System (NFIRS), is to collect data related to the cause of fires, fire damage, and the injuries to civilians and firefighters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As part of PennFIRS, there is a report completed by a volunteer fire company or the fire company that responds to an incident or event. F.F. No. 15d. However, the report contains no evaluation of the carcinogens found at a particular fire scene. F.F. No. 15e.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Fire Commissioner further testified that he is familiar with the occupational cancer literature from the IARC, the National Fire Protection Agency, and other groups concerning the hazards of firefighters' exposure to smoke. F.F. No. 15g. According to the literature, one of the hazards of firefighting is exposure to carcinogens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Our review of Fire Commissioner's deposition reveals he testified \"there is\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   place on the PennFIRS reports for PennFIRS to log or catalog the carcinogens a particular firefighter would be exposed to fighting fires.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dep. of Fire Commissioner Edward Mann (Mann Dep.), 4/22/14, at 14; R.R. at 361a (emphasis added). Fire Commissioner further testified there is no place in the PennFIRS reports to document the carcinogens a firefighter would be exposed to from smoke during the overhaul stage at a fire scene or from diesel exhaust. F.F. No. 15g. Summarizing, Fire Commissioner testified the PennFIRS reports contain no information specifically identifying the carcinogens to which any volunteer firefighter in Pennsylvania was exposed during his career. F.F. No. 14h.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On cross-examination, Fire Commissioner indicated he is familiar with the language of Section 108(r) as it is documented by reports filed under PennFIRS. F.F. No. 15i. Fire Commissioner further testified that the purpose of the reporting language in Act 46 was to ensure that a firefighter making a cancer claim could prove that he actually attended the fire. F.F. No. 15j.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In addition, the Commissioner explained on cross-examination that the only practical way to log exposure to specific carcinogens at the scene of a fire would be to put air monitoring equipment into the burning building, gather all the particulates from the atmosphere, and ship them to a chemist for analysis. F.F. No. 15k. A review of the chemist's report would reveal the type and amount of carcinogen present in the building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Fire Commissioner opined\n   that although this could be done, it would be absolutely impractical and cost prohibitive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C. WCJ's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Reviewing the evidence, the WCJ found Claimant's testimony to be competent and persuasive, and he credited it in its entirety. F.F. No. 28. The WCJ found that Claimant established he engaged in firefighting activities for more than four years and that prior to his diagnosis of large B-cell NH-lymphoma, he did not show any signs of cancer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Claimant's testimony established his exposure as a firefighter to IARC Group 1 carcinogens in fire smoke, soot, diesel exhaust and contaminated gear.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Claimant first learned of the relationship between these exposures and cancer when he reviewed Dr. Guidotti's report in September 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The WCJ also found that Claimant's credibility was supported by Fire Commissioner's testimony and documentation from Claimant's volunteer fire company showing that it participates in PennFIRS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The WCJ further found that Claimant's testimony supports the medical opinions of his expert, Dr. Guidotti.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In addition, the WCJ not only credited, but afforded great weight to, Fire Commissioner's testimony in its entirety. F.F. No. 30. In particular, the WCJ accepted Fire Commissioner's testimony regarding: the purpose of the PennFIRS reporting requirements in Act 46; the fact that firefighters are exposed to carcinogens in the fire service, and the fact that exposures to carcinogens are not monitored at the fire scenes as part of either PennFIRS or NFIRS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   With respect to the medical evidence, the WCJ accepted Dr. Guidotti's report as more credible than the report of Employer's medical expert, Dr. Howard M. Sandler (Dr. Sandler). F.F. No. 32. In particular, the WCJ rejected Dr. Sandler's opinion that there was no reliable, scientifically derived evidence that Claimant's time spent as a volunteer firefighter caused him to sustain exposure of any nature that had an impact on the development of his large B-cell NH-lymphoma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To the contrary, the WCJ accepted Dr. Guidotti's opinion, expressed within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Claimant's cancer arose out of his service as a firefighter and that the exposures associated with his service strongly contributed to the risk of his cancer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Guidotti, based on his review of the pertinent scientific and medical literature, opined that the current \"state of the art\" is that the weight of the evidence favors a conclusion that elements of fire smoke, particularly TCE, are associated with an elevated risk of large B-cell NH-lymphoma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   More specifically, Dr. Guidotti stated that there is scientific evidence of an elevation in the risk of NH-lymphoma in general among firefighters, and that there is strong collateral evidence that the risk of large B-cell NH-lymphoma is particularly elevated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This collateral evidence specifically suggests that the cause within firefighting is exposure to halogenated alkenes and likely other carcinogens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Based on the evidence presented, the WCJ determined that Claimant's large B-cell NH-lymphoma was covered under Section 108(r) of the Act, and that he was entitled to a presumption of compensability under Section 301(f) of the Act. F.F. No. 33a. The WCJ found that Claimant sustained direct exposure to Group 1 carcinogens related to large B-cell NH-lymphoma in\n   <em>\n    fire smoke\n   </em>\n   , soot, diesel engine exhaust and contaminated gear during 39 years of service as a firefighter. F.F. No. 33c. The WCJ further found that Employer's\n   PennFIRS reports properly documented Claimant's fire service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As a result of his work-related cancer, Claimant suffered a complete loss of earnings beginning in February 2015 and continuing through July 31, 2015. F.F. No. 35. Claimant returned to work without restrictions on August 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Accordingly, the WCJ granted Claimant's claim petition and awarded him total indemnity benefits beginning February 26, 2015, continuing through July 31, 2015, at which time Claimant's indemnity benefits were suspended. WCJ Order, 10/14/16. The WCJ also awarded Claimant 10% interest on all deferred and unpaid compensation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition, the WCJ ordered Employer to pay a medical services lien in the amount of $ 78,104 in favor of Independence Blue Cross (Highmark).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Board Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In its appeal to the Board, Employer argued the WCJ erred in determining that Claimant met his burden of proving direct exposure to Group 1 carcinogens by documentation filed under PennFIRS. Specifically, Employer asserted Claimant submitted no relevant PennFIRS reports into the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Citing our decision in\n   <em>\n    Steele v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Findlay Township)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317759\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/1173/\">\n    155 A.3d 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 2017), the Board recognized that PennFIRS documentation is required for Claimant to meet his burden of proof. However, in\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   , the claimant did not submit\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   reports into the record. Consequently, the Court did not address what information PennFIRS reports must establish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Board further determined that nothing in the language of the Act precludes the use of expert testimony to establish a firefighter's exposure to Group 1 carcinogens. Thus, the Board reasoned that once a volunteer firefighter establishes his continuous service of four or more years of firefighting duties, he may satisfy his burden of establishing exposure to Group 1 carcinogens in the same manner as a career firefighter - through expert scientific evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bd. Op., 3/6/18, at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Here, the Board noted the WCJ found that Claimant used PennFIRS documentation establishing his fire service.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317759\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/1173/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This documentation consisted of an incident participation report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WCJ Hr'g, Notes of Testimony (N.T.), 3/30/16, Ex. C-4; Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 293a-346a. Claimant's counsel identified this document as a report pulled from the PennFIRS computerized system. N.T., 3/30/16 at 12; R.R. at 94a. The Board further observed that Employer did not object to Claimant's assertion that the report is a PennFIRS document. Bd. Op. at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Board recognized that Claimant's reports detailed the number and type of incidents to which he responded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. From January 2003 through December 2014, Claimant responded to 380 incidents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Claimant participated in grass fires, building and structure fires, trash and rubbish fires, cooking and chimney fires, and other types of fires including an incident involving a chemical reaction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board determined Claimant's incident participation report met the PennFIRS requirement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Board rejected Employer's argument that Claimant should have submitted a separate PennFIRS document for every single incident that detailed what possible carcinogens he was exposed to at the scene.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In particular, the Board cited the Fire Commissioner's testimony that there is no place in a PennFIRS document or in the software to log in the carcinogens a firefighter encountered when fighting a\n   fire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   More significantly, the Board noted the Fire Commissioner's testimony that it would be too cumbersome, costly and impractical to add this requirement to PennFIRS reports.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Board further observed that Dr. Guidotti's report credibly established that the IARC recognized Claimant's specific type of cancer as being caused by exposure to Group 1 carcinogens while firefighting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Guidotti's report further established that Claimant's direct exposure to Group 1 carcinogens while firefighting actually caused his large B-cell NH-lymphoma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Summarizing, the Board determined that Claimant's submission of PennFIRS documentation regarding his service as a volunteer firefighter, together with Dr. Guidotti's testimony that direct exposure to Group 1 carcinogens while firefighting caused Claimant's large B-cell NH-lymphoma, met Claimant's burden of proof for establishing a compensable cancer claim under Section 108(r) of the Act. Bd. Op. at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In addition, the Board rejected Employer's contention that the WCJ erred in finding that Trover Solutions\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Trover)/Highmark was entitled to subrogation in the amount of $ 78,104 given the lack of evidence of an enforceable lien. In so doing, the Board noted that the WCJ accepted testimony that Independence Blue Cross (Independence BC) asserted a lien.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The WCJ also found that Independence BC preserved its lien and was entitled to subrogation under the Act in the amount of $ 78,104.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   However, the Board noted the WCJ erroneously named Independence BC rather than Highmark as the entity entitled to subrogation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, the Board considered the WCJ's mistake to be a mere typographical error and corrected it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As a final note, the Board determined that Trover/Highmark presented substantial, competent evidence supporting the WCJ's finding that Highmark was entitled to the subrogation lien.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Trover/Highmark submitted a letter asserting a lien of $ 78,104, which the WCJ found to be recoverable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Trover/Highmark also submitted a consolidated statement of benefits indicating Highmark paid $ 78,104 on Claimant's behalf for his cancer treatment from March 10, 2015, to October 20, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Employer petitions for review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

In a plurality decision reversing this Court, the Supreme Court first addressed the causation requirement in Section 108(r) of the Act. In interpreting the language of Section 108(r), the Court stated (with emphasis by underline added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   The express language of Section 108(r), namely that the claimant has a 'cancer... which is caused by exposure to a known (Group 1) carcinogen' clearly imposes an initial burden of causation on the claimant.\n   <em>\n    Importantly, however, the provision only requires the claimant to establish a general causal link between the claimant's type of cancer and a Group 1 carcinogen. In other words, the claimant must produce evidence that it is\n    <strong>\n     possible\n    </strong>\n    that the carcinogen in question caused the type of cancer with which the claimant is afflicted. It does not require the claimant to prove that the identified Group 1 carcinogen\n    <strong>\n     actually\n    </strong>\n    caused claimant's cancer. Section 108(r) embodies a legislative acknowledgement that firefighting is a dangerous occupation that routinely exposes firefighters to Group 1 carcinogens that are known to cause various types of cancers. The 'general causation' requirement under Section 108(r) constitutes a recognition that different types of cancers have different etiologies and it weeds out claims for compensation for cancers with no known link to Group 1 carcinogens. The burden imposed by Section 108(r) is not a heavy burden\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   In this regard, epidemiological evidence is clearly relevant and useful in demonstrating general causation. Epidemiology deals with, inter alia, the identification of potentially causative associations in various populations between possible causative agents and the resulting incidence of particular diseases and seeks to generalize those results. In so doing, epidemiology may provide 'useful information as to whether there is a relationship between an agent and a disease and, when properly interpreted, can provide insight into whether the agent can cause the disease.'\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Blum by Blum v.

Unlike the proof required under Section 108(r), the employer may not rebut the evidentiary presumption with generalized epidemiological evidence that claimant has a type of cancer that may (or may not) possibly be caused by a Group 1 carcinogen\n   </em>\n   . As indicated, epidemiological studies merely identify statistical associations between disease and potentially causative agents in broad populations, and thus do not provide any evidence demonstrating the specific cause of a particular claimant's cancer.\n   <em>\n    To reach the stage of the proceedings at which the employer attempts to rebut the presumption of employment-related causation, the claimant has already carried his\n   </em>\n   or her Section 108(r) burden of proof that his or her cancer is a type that may be caused by a Group 1 carcinogen. The employer may not rebut the evidentiary presumption merely by revisiting this determination and challenging its accuracy.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    A. PennFIRS Reporting Requirements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Interpretation of Section 301(f)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Employer first contends the Board erred as a matter of law by disregarding the plain language of 301(f) of the Act, which requires that a volunteer firefighter use only PennFIRS reports to establish direct exposure to a known Group 1 carcinogen. Employer asserts Section 301(f) specifically differentiates between volunteer firefighters such as Claimant and career professional firefighters for several important reasons, including the fact that certain members of volunteer departments may engage solely in non-firefighting activities such as traffic control or social/fundraising events. Another distinction, Employer argues, is based on the much greater number of responses by career firefighters in an urban setting to structure fires. For example, in the present case, Claimant responded to a rough average of only four structure fires per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In short, Employer contends Section 301(f) requires that a volunteer firefighter seeking compensation for a cancer claim under Section 108(r) produce concrete evidence of direct exposure to a known Group 1 carcinogen and that the exclusive method of proving such exposure is documentation in PennFIRS reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Citing our decision in\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   , Employer asserts the PennFIRS requirement cannot be brushed aside or satisfied by mere evidence that a volunteer firefighter responded to fires. In\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   , we recognized that the language of Section 301(f) clearly requires that volunteer firefighters provide evidence of direct exposure to carcinogens as documented by PennFIRS reports. Consequently, we determined that lay testimony from the claimant and two firefighters regarding the decedent's exposure to carcinogens did not satisfy that requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   , we also noted the principle of statutory construction stating that when the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of law may not be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit. 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). Nonetheless, we recognized that the Board augmented its discussion of the plain language of Section 301(f) by reviewing the legislative history of Act 46. Reviewing the\n   changes made to the original bill previously vetoed by the Governor and the comments of the bill's sponsor, we noted that the legislative history of Act 46 confirmed an intent to treat volunteer firefighters differently from career firefighters. In particular, we observed that in cases where the amount of actual exposure of the volunteer firefighter is disputed, the conflict is to be resolved by objective, documentary evidence of exposure to carcinogens in the form of PennFIRS reports. In\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   , we concluded that the Board correctly determined the claimant did not and could not establish her late husband's direct exposure to Group 1 carcinogens through lay witness testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Here, Employer asserts, when confronted with the identical issue, the Board disregarded the holding in\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   and declared that the language of the Act does not preclude the use of expert testimony to establish exposure to a Group 1 carcinogen. Reasoning that\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   did not address the issue of what information needed to be included in a PennFIRS report, the Board decided that if a claimant could establish his presence at fire scenes through PennFIRS reports, testify as to the smoke and other substances encountered at the fire scenes, and then get an expert to opine that his cancer resulted from exposures to carcinogens at those fire scenes, the claimant met the requirements in Section 301(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Employer argues the Board's decision is nothing more than an acknowledgement that applying the clear and unambiguous language in Section 301(f) would have resulted in a denial of Claimant's claim, a result which the Board was unwilling to endorse. Employer asserts that if the legislature intended for a claimant to prove Group 1 exposures by medical and scientific testimony, it would have so directed. Similarly, if the legislature intended for PennFIRS reports to only show presence at fire scenes, it would have so stated. Rather, Employer maintains that by mandating the use of PennFIRS reports as the only acceptable proof of exposure to Group 1 carcinogens, the legislature did in fact prohibit any other means of proving such exposures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Here, Employer asserts, Claimant did not submit a single PennFIRS report. Rather, Claimant submitted a log sheet noting the calls to which he responded. However, the log sheet did not indicate the duration of any call or the role Claimant filled on the call. Most importantly, Employer argues, the log sheet did not indicate whether Claimant experienced any exposure, let alone a direct exposure, to a Group 1 carcinogen. In sum, Employer alleges Claimant's log sheet may have been sufficient to show his mere presence at a fire call, but that is not the standard imposed by Section 301(f). Rather, Employer asserts, the applicable standard requires that designation of exposure to Group 1 carcinogens must appear in a PennFIRS report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Fire Commissioner's Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Employer also contends the WCJ erred in allowing Fire Commissioner to testify regarding the legislative history of Act 46 and the wisdom of the General Assembly's decision to require a different form of proof for volunteer firefighter claims as opposed to career firefighter claims. Employer asserts Claimant presented Fire Commissioner's lay testimony in the hope of circumventing the PennFIRS reporting requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   More particularly, Employer argues Fire Commissioner's testimony that the intent of the PennFIRS reporting requirement was not to report carcinogens encountered by firefighters was in direct conflict with comments from the sponsor of Act 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Before the House of Representatives on the third consideration of HB 797, when asked by another Representative why the use of PennFIRS was being proposed, and how the volunteer fire companies will use it, State Representative Frank A. Farry, the sponsor of the legislation, stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   PennFIRS is the State fire reporting system, which has been in place for approximately 8 years. During the negotiations regarding this bill, it was determined there needed to be a method by which volunteer firefighters can file a claim under the rebuttable presumption provision.\n   <em>\n    Because this standard provided for career firefighters could not be applied to volunteers, it was determined the utilization of the PennFIRS system would serve to document that the volunteer firefighter was present at an incident where a known carcinogen was present. Mr. Speaker, my legislation provides a standard for volunteer firefighters and departments to document as potential evidence that the volunteer firefighter was directly engaged in firefighting duties at an incident where a known carcinogen was documented to be present and the volunteer firefighter was directly exposed to a class 1 carcinogen\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    Mr. Speaker, HB 797 provides a built-in incentive for volunteer fire companies to utilize the PennFIRS system and will push for them to provide thorough information when filling out their PennFIRS reports\n   </em>\n   . The majority of stakeholders in this legislation - local governments, the insurance industry, and the fire service - have all agreed to work together to develop best practices for\n   <em>\n    documenting exposures\n   </em>\n   , and we all hope to develop risk management strategies to reduce exposures and ultimately lower the number of cases of cancer. PennFIRS is the frontline tool to document these incidents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Pa. Legis. Journal - House, June 21, 2011 at 1338 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Employer notes Fire Commissioner's testimony that the intent of the PennFIRS reporting requirement is not to document the specific carcinogens encountered by firefighters, and that there is currently no standard operating procedure used to measure carcinogens at fires. However, Employer points out Fire Commissioner never suggested to the General Assembly or anyone else that the PennFIRS reporting requirements be removed from the bill. Furthermore, Fire Commissioner acknowledged there are places on the PennFIRS form to report exposure to diesel fuel emissions, asbestos, toxic gases and other hazardous materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Summarizing, Employer alleges Fire Commissioner's lay testimony as to legislative intent behind Act 46 was merely his opinion and is not competent evidence. Fire Commissioner admitted he was not privy to the legislative formulation or discussion of HB 797, which became Act 46 during Governor Tom Corbett's administration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mann Dep. at 22-23; R.R. at 369a-70a. Therefore, Employer maintains that Fire Commissioner's testimony as to the legislative intent for including the PennFIRS reporting requirements in Act 46 should not have formed the basis of any of the WCJ's Findings of Fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Interpretation of Section 301(f)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   To begin our analysis, we note that a firefighter-claimant asserting a cancer claim under Section 108(r) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 27.1(r), must first establish that he was diagnosed with a type of cancer\n   <em>\n    possibly\n   </em>\n   caused by one or more IARC Group 1 carcinogens.\n   <em>\n    Sladek\n   </em>\n   . This general causation requirement does not impose a heavy burden on a claimant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12502618\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/195/197/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To that end, our\n   Supreme Court recognized that Section 108(r) embodies a legislative acknowledgement that firefighting is a dangerous occupation that routinely exposes firefighters to Group 1 carcinogens.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12502618\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/195/197/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Section 301(f) then provides an evidentiary presumption of entitlement to compensation for a claimant who can show he: (1) served four or more years in continuous firefighting duties; (2) had direct exposure to a Group 1 carcinogen; and (3) passed a physical examination prior to asserting a claim or prior to engaging in firefighter duties after undergoing a physical examination that revealed no evidence of cancer. 77 P.S. \u00a7 414.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Thereafter, Section 301(f) imposes an additional requirement on volunteer firefighters. As discussed above, Section 301(f) provides in pertinent part that any claim made by a member of a volunteer firefighting company \"shall be based on evidence of\n   <em>\n    direct exposure\n   </em>\n   to a carcinogen referred to in [S]ection 108(r) as documented by reports filed pursuant to [PennFIRS] and provided that the member's claim is based on\n   <em>\n    direct exposure\n   </em>\n   to a carcinogen referred to in Section 108(r).\" 77 P.S. \u00a7 414 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The crux of Employer's argument is that Section 301(f) requires that a volunteer firefighter use\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   PennFIRS documentation to establish direct exposure to a Group 1 carcinogen by documenting not only his presence at an incident, but also the carcinogen or carcinogens he encountered at the incident. In light of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Sladek\n   </em>\n   , this is an overly restrictive interpretation of the language in Section 301(f), which would lead to a result that would be unreasonable and essentially impossible to execute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Initially, we note, nothing in the language of Section 301(f) explicitly requires volunteer fire companies to identify and document the specific Group 1 carcinogens encountered at a fire incident in PennFIRS reports in order for the evidentiary presumption of compensability to apply to their volunteer firefighters. When the words of a statute are not explicit, the intention of the General Assembly may be determined by considering, among other things, the object to be obtained, the consequences of a particular interpretation, and the contemporaneous legislative history. 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(4), (6), (7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   , we reviewed the legislative history of Act 46. We noted that the sponsor of the legislation, Representative Farry, explained that \"utilization of the PennFIRS system would serve to\n   <em>\n    document that a volunteer firefighter was present at an incident\n   </em>\n   where a known carcinogen was present.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pa. Legis. Journal - House, June 21, 2011 at 1338 (emphasis added). To that extent, we observed that the legislative history of Act 46 confirmed its intent to treat volunteer firefighters differently than career firefighters.\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   , the parties disputed the actual exposure of the volunteer firefighter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12502618\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/195/197/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   However, contrary to Employer's assertion, our decision in\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   does not support an interpretation of Section 301(f) that would require all volunteer fire companies in Pennsylvania to identify and document the Group 1 carcinogens present at every incident.

Notably, Section 301(f) does not require career firefighters to identify and document the carcinogens encountered at every incident.

The report describes the type of incident (such as cooking fire, electrical,\n   building fire, false alarm). The report also denotes Claimant's participation at that incident with an asterisk. In introducing Exhibit C-04, Claimant's counsel stated that the information in the report was pulled from PennFIRS documentation. N.T., 3/30/16 at 12; R.R. at 94a.

F.F. No 15j; Mann Dep. at 27-28; R.R. at 374a-75a. Based on discussions he had with various other professionals in the fire service, Fire Commissioner believed the only real purpose of the PennFIRS reporting requirements was to establish that an individual actually attended the fire.

Similarly, there is no place in PennFIRS to catalog the specific carcinogens to which a firefighter would be exposed to from smoke during overhaul or from diesel exhaust. F.F. No. 15g; Mann Dep. at 14; R.R. at 361a. Therefore, Fire Commissioner testified that PennFIRS reports could not be used to specifically identify the carcinogens to which any volunteer firefighter in Pennsylvania was exposed. F.F.

To become eligible for compensation for an occupational disease under Section 108 of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 27.1, a claimant must prove a disability resulting from a disease enumerated in Section 108 and that the disease arose out of and was related to the claimant's employment.\n   <em>\n    Allingham v.

Employer thus maintains Claimant is not eligible for compensation under the Act. More specifically, Employer contends that in order to trigger the presumption of credibility in Section 301(f) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 414,\n   Claimant must establish his cancer was\n   <em>\n    caused by\n   </em>\n   exposure to a Group 1 carcinogen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   With respect to Claimant's four-prong burden of proof under Sections 108(r) and 301(f), Employer conceded Claimant met the first two prongs by establishing (1) four or more years of firefighting service and (2) that he had cancer. However, Employer asserts Claimant failed to establish (3) that his cancer was a type of cancer caused by exposure to a Group 1 carcinogen found in the firefighter's requirement. Employer further alleges Claimant failed to establish (4) direct exposure to a Group 1 carcinogen as documented by PennFIRS reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Competency of Claimant's Medical Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Employer next alleges Dr. Guidotti's opinion on the precise issue of whether a Group 1 carcinogen caused Claimant's large B-cell NH-lymphoma was equivocal and lacked factual support in the record. Employer asserts Dr. Guidotti did not identify the records or documents he reviewed when he formed his opinion as to the cause of Claimant's lymphoma. Furthermore, Dr. Guidotti authored his report on the causation of Claimant's cancer in September 2015. As such, Dr. Guidotti's report preceded Claimant's deposition, which was taken in October 2015. Thus, Employer alleges, Dr. Guidotti did not hear or read Claimant's testimony before drafting his report on causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In addition, Dr. Guidotti did not mention whether he reviewed Claimant's incident participation log, the document Claimant offered to prove direct exposure. Therefore, Employer argues Dr. Guidotti formed a medical causation opinion without any indication of the number or type of fires to which Claimant responded and without any indication as to what carcinogens Claimant encountered while on duty. Rather, Dr. Guidotti based his causation opinion on facts Claimant related in his affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Moreover, Dr. Guidotti's report included incidents such as a fire at Dow Chemicals and a fire where pesticides were illegally stored in a crawlspace. Because Claimant did not testify as to either incident in his affidavit or deposition, Employer alleges the source of Dr. Guidotti's information about these incidents was unclear and therefore his testimony lacked a proper foundation in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Regarding general causation, Employer asserts Dr. Guidotti acknowledged that the causal relationship between firefighting and large B-cell NH-lymphoma is only now coming under study. As such, the doctor indicated that the evidence is too sparse to be conclusive and thus requires the use of an inference. Consequently, Employer alleges Claimant established only a suspected or probable association between firefighting and large B-cell NH-lymphoma. However, using a weight of the evidence criterion, Dr. Guidotti found a relationship between firefighting and Claimant's lymphoma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Relying on the report of its expert, Dr. Sandler, Employer further argues Dr. Guidotti attempted to associate the byproduct of burning materials into halogenated alkene compounds, including TCE, a Group 1 carcinogen found in fire smoke and specifically associated with large B-cell NH-lymphoma. However, Employer asserts, there are no PennFIRS reports, or any other source, which would permit Dr. Guidotti to conclude Claimant had any firefighting exposure to TCE. As such, there is simply no evidence of Claimant's direct exposure to TCE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Again relying on its expert's report, Employer further argues Dr. Guidotti did not adequately describe his methodology and\n   based his opinion as to causation on speculation and deductive reasoning because of the lack of scientific evidence. To that end, Dr. Guidotti focused only on studies that would affirm the conclusion that firefighting is related to some types of lymphoma. However, these studies focused exclusively on urban firefighters, as opposed to part-time, rural firefighters. None of these studies accounted for the lower exposures of volunteer firefighters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Employer further asserts expert testimony is required to prove direct exposure to Group 1 carcinogens because such exposure is largely a question of toxicology. In order to determine direct exposure to a particular substance, an expert must calculate the quantity, duration, and volume of the substance and its effect on each affected organ. Employer asserts Dr. Guidotti, Claimant's sole expert, did not and could not make these calculations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Summarizing, Employer argues, in light of the lack of a factual basis in the record and the use of speculation and inference in the place of scientific methodology, Dr. Guidotti's opinions and report did not constitute substantial, competent evidence. Therefore, Employer maintains this Court must reverse the grant of Claimant's claim petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Employer's Rebuttal Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Employer further alleges that even if Claimant presented enough evidence to warrant application of the presumption of compensability in Section 301(f) of the Act, it produced rebuttal evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption. As a general rule, a presumption is but an evidentiary advantage and its only effect is to shift the evidentiary burden of going forward to the opponent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re: Annexation by Borough of Irwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"467278\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/165/119/\">\n    165 Pa.Super. 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20A.2d%20757\">\n    67 A.2d 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1949).

Rather, the WCJ should have determined whether Dr. Sandler presented substantial competent evidence supporting a proposition contrary to the presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Employer asserts nothing in the text of Section 301(e) or 301(f) of the Act suggests that an employer must prove that a particular lifestyle choice, genetic marker or hazardous exposure caused a particular claimant's cancer. Rather, the only burden imposed upon the employer is to show that the occupation did not cause the disease or injury. Here, Employer argues it provided sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In particular, Employer cited an IARC Monograph on firefighting which determined that 90% of municipal fires are extinguished within 5-10 minutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dr. Sandler's Report (Sandler Rep.), 3/14/16, at 6; R.R. at 450a. The length of a fire in a municipal setting drastically limits the potential exposure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Employer further maintains that its expert, Dr. Sandler, conclusively showed that firefighting and large B-cell NH-lymphoma are not causally linked. Employer argues its burden stopped there. Nevertheless, Dr. Sandler offered other reasons for large B-cell NH-lymphoma. To that end, the strongest known etiologic factor for B-cell lymphomas is a previous infection with the Epstein-Barr virus, a part of the herpes virus family.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sandler Rep. at 9; R.R. at 453a. The doctor observed that although nothing indicates Claimant suffered from Epstein-Barr, he does have a history of shingles, which has been linked to the development of cancer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20A.2d%20757\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Summarizing, Employer asserts it provided the WCJ with substantial, competent evidence that exposure to Group 1 carcinogens did not cause Claimant's large B-cell NH-lymphoma.

WC Supervisor described the overall nature of HRI's business as providing subrogation and workers' compensation recovery services to healthcare insurers across the country.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12502618\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/195/197/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   WC Supervisor identified an Agent Authorization document as an agency agreement between HRI and Independence BC upon which HRI relied in subrogation matters on behalf of Independence BC. F.F. No. 27d. WC Supervisor also explained the consolidated statements of benefits (CSBs) used to detail the benefits paid by Independence BC and Highmark for cancer treatment in Act 46 cases involving the City of Philadelphia. F.F. No. 27e. In particular, WC Supervisor described how the lien amounts are obtained and processed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12502618\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/195/197/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The WCJ found WC Supervisor's testimony competent, significantly persuasive and particularly credible as to the CSB and \"the process of identification and diagnosis codes as to medical services provided ....\" F.F. No. 29. The WCJ further found in Finding of Fact No. 29 that WC Supervisor's testimony is supported by the detailed lien in the present case for the relevant time period of services Highmark provided to Claimant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trover CSB; Ex. D-INLB-01 (469a-75a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Ultimately, the WCJ found that \"Independence [BC] preserved its lien amounting to $ 78,104 and is subrogated accordingly pursuant to Section 319 of the Act.\" F.F. No. 31. Accordingly, the WCJ ordered Employer to pay Independence BC (Highmark) $ 78,104 for benefits provided. WCJ Order, 10/14/16. On appeal, the Board affirmed the subrogation lien, but modified the WCJ's order to reflect a subrogation lien on behalf of \"Trover Solutions/Highmark rather than Independence [BC].\" Bd. Order, 3/6/18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Employer raises numerous issues regarding the subrogation lien. First, Employer contends Trover lacks standing because it failed to establish a contractual agency relationship with Highmark. Although Highmark may have standing as an insurer, Employer argues Trover is not an insurer and thus lacks standing absent proof of an agency relationship with Highmark. Second, Employer asserts Trover's CSB, admitted as Exhibit D-INBL-01, and the BCBS Service Plan, admitted as Exhibit D-INBL-02, are hearsay documents and are irrelevant to the issue of whether Highmark properly established its right to subrogation. Third, Employer contends WC Supervisor's deposition, admitted as Exhibit D-INBL-03, is insufficient to establish a contractual relationship between Trover and Highmark. Employer further asserts WC Supervisor's deposition was taken for cases involving subrogation liens in firefighter cases involving the City of Philadelphia and is irrelevant here. Fourth, Employer contends Trover's CSB and BCBS Benefits Plans were not properly authenticated and cannot be considered self-authenticating absent certification by the custodian, or another qualified person, to show they are of a regularly\n   conducted activity. Fifth, Employer contends Trover's CSB is irrelevant because it is merely a listing of procedures with no reference to Highmark. Therefore, it cannot establish a relationship between Trover and Highmark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   We recognize that the City of Philadelphia, as an employer, raised similar issues in\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Knudson)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12321840\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/165/1039/\">\n    165 A.3d 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.

In\n   <em>\n    Knudson\n   </em>\n   , we determined that the employer waived these issues by failing to raise them before the WCJ.

Board Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   To begin, we note that Employer also raised these issues before the Board. In rejecting Employer's contentions, the Board noted that Trover/Highmark, through Subrogee Counsel's letter, indicated that it was asserting a lien in the amount of $ 78,104, the amount the WCJ found to be recoverable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bd. Op. at 12-13. Trover/Highmark also submitted a CSB indicating that Highmark paid a total of $ 78,104 on Claimant's behalf related to his cancer diagnosis during the period of March 10 through October 20, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. The Board determined that this evidence constituted substantial, competent evidence to support the WCJ's award of a subrogation lien in the amount of $ 78,104.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   First, we reject Employer's contention that Trover lacks standing as a subrogation agent because it failed to establish a contractual agency relationship with Highmark. As indicted by his letter asserting Highmark's subrogation interest in this case, Subrogee Counsel explicitly entered his appearance on behalf of Highmark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. C-8; R.R. at 428a. In his interlocutory order, the WCJ noted that he received Subrogee Counsel's letter in May 2016, prior to the scheduled close of the record on July 1, 2016. R.R. at 546a. Subrogee Counsel's letter stated that Highmark had a subrogation lien for $ 78,104 in paid benefits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313130\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/820/868/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is sufficient to establish that Highmark timely preserved its subrogation lien under Section 319 of the Act by asserting it before the close of the record.\n   <em>\n    Evans v. Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd.

Cmwlth. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Further, WC Supervisor testified in her deposition that HRI, Trover's predecessor,\n   provides subrogation and workers' compensation recovery services to healthcare insurers across the nation. F.F. No. 27a; Dep. of Jennifer L. Armstrong (Armstrong Dep.) at 5; R.R. at 486a. WC Supervisor acknowledged that her testimony as to HRI/Trover's representation of Independence BC and Highmark will be relative to the general, overall process of how these subrogation matters are handled. F.F. No. 27b; Armstrong Dep. at 6-7; R.R. at 487a-88a. WC Supervisor further testified that HRI/Trover executes an agency authorization document with the healthcare insurer it represents and that it relies upon this document in pursuing subrogation matters. F.F. No. 27d; Armstrong Dep. at 13-14; R.R. at 494a-95a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Thus, WC Supervisor's accepted testimony established a course of dealing or industry practice between HRI/Trover and insurers, established the insurer/clients as the source of documents upon which it relies when it undertakes extensive recovery services, and establishes how the documents are created and maintained in the regular course of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Given the findings by the WCJ and the evidence supporting them, we reject Employer's contention that Trover failed to produce sufficient evidence of an agency relationship with Highmark for purposes of asserting a subrogation lien on Highmark's behalf. We must examine the record in its entirety to determine if it contains sufficient evidence to support the WCJ's findings.\n   <em>\n    Knudson\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    A &amp; J Builders\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Although WC Supervisor testified regarding HRI's role in subrogation matters in Act 46 cases involving Philadelphia firefighters, the WCJ could reasonably infer from Subrogee Counsel's letter and WC Supervisor's testimony about HRI/Trover's course of conduct and reliance, that Trover represents Highmark as an authorized agent, or at least an apparent agent, in this subrogation matter. This is especially true in the absence of any evidence that HRI/Trover's business practices, course of conduct or reliance changed after WC Supervisor's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   \"The creation of an agency relationship requires no special formalities.\"\n   <em>\n    B &amp; L Ashphalt Indus., Inc. v.

To establish an agency relationship, direct proof of specific authority is not needed where it can be inferred from the facts that the parties intended to create an agency relationship.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11206297\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/753/264/#p269\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   As a final point on the standing matter, there is no dispute that Claimant incurred medical bills. Also, there is no assertion that the bills remain unpaid. Further, no entity other than Highmark claims to have paid the bills. These circumstances tend to support the Board's ultimate determination that Highmark, through its agent Trover, is a proper party to assert subrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Second, the WCJ also accepted WC Supervisor's testimony regarding the process of determining the lien amounts in HRI/Trover's CSBs as competent, significantly persuasive and particularly credible. F.F. No. 29. WC Supervisor testified as to how the lien amounts in the CSBs for benefits paid by healthcare insurers related to the firefighters' cancer claims are determined. Armstrong Dep. at 15-20; R.R. at 496a-501a. WC Supervisor further stated that the CSBs and the cumulative lists related to them are records kept in the ordinary course of business. Armstrong Dep. at 20; R.R. at 501a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   The WCJ also found that WC Supervisor's testimony regarding the CSBs was supported by the lien detail in Trover's CSB in this case, which was admitted into evidence as Exhibit D-INBL-01. F.F. No. 29. Trover's CSB includes an itemized list of medical benefits provided to Claimant for treatment of his large B-cell NH-lymphoma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 469a-75a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Nevertheless, Employer maintains that Trover's CSB is a hearsay document and that WC Supervisor's testimony is insufficient to authenticate it because she does not work for Highmark. We disagree. Commonwealth agencies are not bound by the technical rules of evidence in agency proceedings, and all relevant evidence of reasonably probative value may be received. 2 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 505 ;\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   . This statutory maxim has been properly interpreted to permit a relaxation of the strict rules of evidence in agency hearings and proceedings, including those held by a WCJ.\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   . Generally, issues concerning the admission and exclusion of evidence fall within the sound discretion of the administrative tribunal and will not be reversed on appeal absent a finding of an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11206297\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/753/264/#p269\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Nonetheless, for a hearsay document to be admissible into evidence under the business records exception in Pa.R.E. 803(6), it must be supported by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.\n   <em>\n    Keystone Dedicated Logistics, Inc. v.

As observed above, in the absence of evidence that HRI/Trover's business practices, course of conduct and reliance changed after WC Supervisor's testimony, the WCJ could infer that the described activity continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Additionally, the CSB provides on its face that it pertains to cancer treatment rendered to the named Claimant during the period of his disability. This information is corroborated by Subrogee Counsel's professional representations in his letter to the WCJ. We further note the WC Supervisor's testimony of creation of and reliance on documents in HRI/Trover's recovery services business, and the absence of evidence that the business practices changed. Given all the foregoing, we discern no abuse of discretion by the WCJ in determining that the CSB was what its proponent claimed, Pa.R.E. 901(a) (authentication generally), and that there was nothing about the document's circumstances which created a suspicion about a lack of trustworthiness. Pa.R.E. 803(6)(E) (exception to rule against hearsay; records of a regularly conducted activity).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   The object of authentication under the business records exception is to establish a presumption of trustworthiness to offset the hearsay character of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Virgo\n   </em>\n   . We note that Employer did not offer any evidence to challenge authentication or trustworthiness of the CSB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   In sum, viewing the record in its entirety, and in a manner favorable to the party prevailing before the compensation authorities, we hold that the WCJ's award of a subrogation lien in favor of Highmark for $ 78,104 is supported by competent, substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
