The court determined that, as a matter of law, none of the Association's rules and regulations had been adopted properly pursuant to the Association's bylaws, specifically section 5.17. The Association argues that the court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Kimberly S. Scott and Thomas H. Scott and asserts that (1) the bylaws unambiguously give the Board of Directors the authority to adopt and amend rules and regulations concerning the use and operation of the property and (2) the court's interpretation of section 5.17 of the bylaws would render the bylaws ambiguous, resulting in a genuine issue of material fact. We affirm the court's judgment in part, but vacate the judgment in other respects and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] The parties agreed to the following facts in a joint statement of material facts. Fall Line comprises 128 condominium units adjacent to Sunday River ski resort in Newry. The Association is a nonprofit organization whose membership consists of all record owners of Fall Line's condominium units. A board of directors is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Association. Fall Line was organized under the Maine Condominium Act, 33 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1601-101 to 1604-118 (2018), and the Fall Line Declaration of Condominium was\n   adopted on November 19, 1985. Fall Line is governed by its declaration, its bylaws, and certain promulgated rules and regulations. The Board first established \"Rules and Regulations Applicable to All Unit Owners\" in 1985 and most recently amended the rules in 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b63] The Scotts own a unit at Fall Line and therefore are members of the Association. On February 28, 2017, the Association filed a small claims action against the Scotts in the District Court (Rumford) seeking $38.29 in outstanding interest on the Scotts' account and $500 in attorney fees. In response, the Scotts filed a complaint against the Association and certain members of the Board seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that \"all rules, regulations, and limitations affecting Unit Owners and their use of their units and of any common element at Fall Line not approved by a majority in interest by the Unit Owners\" are void.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Association and certain members of the Board counterclaimed against the Scotts; the District Court (\n   <em>\n    Carlson, J.\n   </em>\n   ) consolidated all causes of action and later transferred the case to the Business and Consumer Docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b64] After discovery, both parties moved for partial summary judgment. On June 8, 2018, the court (\n   <em>\n    Mulhern, J.\n   </em>\n   ) granted summary judgment in favor of the Scotts on two of their counts, including the count seeking the declaratory judgment invalidating all rules and regulations promulgated by the Board without the approval of a majority in interest of the unit owners.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its judgment, the court declared \"all rules and regulations putatively established by the Association are void, pending a vote to garner the approval of a majority in interest of the unit owners at Fall Line\" after determining, as a matter of law, that \"none of the extant rules and regulations were properly adopted under the Bylaws.\" After the court issued its combined order on the cross-motions for summary judgment, the Association timely appealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14 M.R.S. \u00a7 1851 ; M.R. App. P. 2B(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b65] We review a ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment de novo, reviewing the trial court's decision for errors of law and considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against whom the judgment has been granted in order to determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Frost\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767886\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/146/118/\">\n    2016 ME 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767886\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/146/118/\">\n    146 A.3d 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Generally, \"we will avoid an interpretation that renders meaningless any particular provision in the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Farrington's Owners' Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8943327\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/878/504/\">\n    2005 ME 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8943327\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/878/504/\">\n    878 A.2d 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). \"The language employed by the parties is to be construed to give effect to the plain meaning of the words used.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Augusta v.

The Scotts assert that the word \"may\" indicates that the Board is permitted to promulgate and amend rules and regulations concerning the use of the units, common areas, and facilities, but that, when the Board does so, it must be with the approval of a majority in interest of the unit owners. The Association, on the other hand, argues that the Board has the unfettered authority to promulgate and amend such rules and regulations regardless of whether the unit owners approve, but that the Board may seek to have its actions approved by a majority in interest of the unit owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b69] As always, we start with the language of the contract itself to determine the contract's meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farrington's Owners' Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8943327\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/878/504/\">\n    2005 ME 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8943327\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/878/504/\">\n    878 A.2d 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Am. Prot. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9346631\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/814/989/\">\n    2003 ME 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9346631\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/814/989/\">\n    814 A.2d 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the placement of the word \"may\" and the context in which it is used determines the plain meaning of the word and the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Augusta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11288467\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/436/388/#p392\">\n    436 A.2d at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because \"may\" appears before the phrase \"be promulgated and amended by the Board of Directors with the approval of a majority in interest of the Unit Owners,\" we would read the word as modifying that entire phrase, unless doing so creates an absurd result.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11288467\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/436/388/#p392\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As written, the section limits the Board's authority to promulgate or amend \"[r]ules of [c]onduct,\" i.e. \"[r]ules and regulations concerning the use of the [u]nits and the [c]ommon [a]reas and facilities ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b610] The Association, however, asserts that \"may\" should\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be read as modifying the language it precedes and argues that \"may\" imposes no limitation on the Board's authority to promulgate or amend rules of conduct. In support of its argument, the Association points to section 2.03(e) of the bylaws, entitled \"Powers and\n   Duties [of the Board of Directors].\" Section 2.03 states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The Board of Directors shall have the powers and duties necessary for the administration of the affairs of the Condominium Association and shall do all such acts and things\n   <em>\n    except as by law or by the Declaration or by these Bylaws may not be delegated to the Board of Directors by the Unit Owners.\n   </em>\n   Such powers and duties of the Board of Directors shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (e) Adoption and amendment of rules and regulations covering the details of the operation and use of the Property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (emphasis added). Although we agree that section 2.03 does grant the Board the \"powers and duties\" to adopt and amend \"rules and regulations covering the details of the operation and use of the [p]roperty,\" we note that section 2.03 includes a limiting clause. That clause-italicized above-explains that the Board's authority may be curtailed or held in check by, among other things, provisions in the bylaws. Section 5.17 is just such a check. Because we are careful not to render any language in a contract superfluous, we read section 5.17 to unambiguously limit the Board's broad authority under section 2.03(e) to adopt and amend rules and regulations, at least those rules and regulations of conduct concerning the use of the units, common areas, and facilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farrington's Owners' Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8943327\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/878/504/\">\n    2005 ME 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8943327\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/878/504/\">\n    878 A.2d 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Am.

The limitations found in section 5.17 are applicable exclusively to the rules and regulations concerning the use of the units, common areas, and facilities, and, therefore, the only existing rules and regulations that are \"void\" are those concerning the use of the units, common areas, and facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b612] If the parties cannot agree on which rules and regulations concern the general \"operation and use\" of the property and which concern the \"use\" of the units, common areas, and facilities, or cannot undertake successfully the process required to approve any previously adopted rules or regulations, they may have to ask the court to determine which of the rules and regulations previously promulgated or amended by the Board are rules and regulations concerning the use of the units, common areas, and facilities. We sincerely hope that such a use of judicial resources will not be necessary to make common sense determinations that should be within the parties' own capabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b613] To summarize, we declare that section 5.17 unambiguously states that the Board, in order to promulgate or amend rules of conduct concerning the use of the units, common areas, and facilities, must seek approval from a majority in interest of unit owners. There is no such limitation on other types of rules or regulations governing the general operation and use of the property. We do not pass judgment on what constitutes a rule of conduct that dictates the use of the units, common areas, or facilities. If the parties insist on prolonging this litigation, the question of what is or is not a rule of conduct regarding the use of a unit, common area, or facility would be a question of fact appropriate for a factfinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Judgment affirmed in part and vacated in part.
