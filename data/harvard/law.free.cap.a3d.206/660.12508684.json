(Employer) to reimburse Pharmacy for medications it had dispensed to Ryan Allem (Claimant). Employer challenged these fee determinations for the stated reason that Pharmacy was not a \"provider\" under the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act (Act)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, thus, not entitled to reimbursement. Concluding that the Bureau's Medical Fee Review Section lacked jurisdiction to determine whether Pharmacy was a \"provider,\" the Hearing Office vacated the three determinations and dismissed Employer's appeal thereof. Pharmacy argues that the Hearing Office's adjudication has left it without a forum to challenge Employer's refusal to reimburse it for medications it dispensed to treat Claimant for his work injury, and this violates due process. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 2, 2016, Bucks County Orthopedic Specialists prescribed Claimant a medical cream compound consisting of \"Ketamine 10%, Flurbiprofen 10%, Gabapentin 10%, Cyclobenzaprine 3%, Bupivacaine 2%, [and] Transdermal Base (qs)\" to treat his pain. Reproduced Record at 98a (R.R. __). Pharmacy dispensed the medication to Claimant on three occasions and thereafter invoiced Employer $ 3,634.17 for each prescription. Employer denied payment on the first invoice of November 30, 2016, for the following reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Charge for pharmaceuticals exceed the fees established by the fee schedule rates [and the usual customary and reasonable] rates. [Employer] does not cover pain cream compounds. A letter of medical necessity from your doctor is required if no alternatives are available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   R.R. 4a. Employer denied payment on the second invoice of December 29, 2016, stating as follows: \"Request for treatment has been denied, withdrawn or refused\" and \"Denied: Utilization review filed.\" R.R. 16a. Likewise, Employer denied payment on the third invoice of March 1, 2017, stating as follows: \"Denied: Medical records. Please resubmit with related medical records to: [Employer's address].\" R.R. 40a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pharmacy filed three applications with the Bureau's Medical Fee Review Section, requesting a review of Employer's refusal to pay the three invoices for the compound cream. The Medical Fee Review Section found, first, that Employer had timely refused payment on each of the three invoices. Next, the Medical Fee Review Section found that the amount of payment owed under the required \"Workers' Compensation fee calculations\" was $ 3,322.16. R.R. 29a. The Medical Fee Review Section directed Employer to pay Pharmacy $ 3,322.16, plus ten percent interest on each invoice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While the Medical Fee Review Section's review of the third application was pending, Employer filed a request for a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing on the first two administrative decisions. Employer identified the legal issue as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Lack of jurisdiction in the fee reviewers and lack of proper \"provider\" status on the part of the billing entity. Failure to bill at the proper statutory rates; and award in excess of statutory rates. Employer reserves right to amend to include additional grounds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   R.R. 44a. The Hearing Office assigned Employer's appeal to a hearing officer, and Employer's application was amended to include the Medical Fee Review Section's decision on Pharmacy's third application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 24, 2017, Employer filed a motion to dismiss its own appeal. In support,\n   Employer argued that because Pharmacy was not a \"provider\" within the meaning of the Workers' Compensation Act, the Hearing Office lacked jurisdiction. Pharmacy opposed the motion to dismiss, arguing that Employer had waived its \"provider\" argument by not raising the issue in its denial of Pharmacy's invoices or with the Medical Fee Review Section. By decision and order of October 30, 2017, the Hearing Office granted Employer's motion to dismiss. Relying on this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Selective Insurance Company of America v. Bureau of Workers' Compensation Fee Review Hearing Office (The Physical Therapy Institute)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947335\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/86/300/\">\n    86 A.3d 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014), the Hearing Office held that it could not proceed on Employer's appeal because it challenged Pharmacy's status as a \"provider,\" an issue beyond its jurisdiction. Likewise, the Medical Fee Review Section lacked jurisdiction to act upon Pharmacy's fee review applications and, thus, the Hearing Office vacated those determinations. Finally, the Hearing Office rejected Pharmacy's waiver argument, citing this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Pittsburgh Moose Lodge # 46 v. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (Greico)\n   </em>\n   , 109 Pa.Cmwlth. 53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1363561\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/109/53/\">\n    530 A.2d 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), that subject matter jurisdiction is an issue that can be raised at any point in litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pharmacy argues that the Court should reconsider its ruling in\n   <em>\n    Selective Insurance\n   </em>\n   because it leaves a provider that renders medical treatment to a workers' compensation claimant without recourse whenever an employer refuses payment for the stated reason that the provider is not a \"provider\" within the meaning of the Act. Pharmacy suggests that this Court direct the Bureau of Workers' Compensation to promulgate a regulation to create a remedy by which a putative provider may obtain a determination of its status. A remedy is necessary because otherwise Pharmacy will be deprived of property without due process of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Applicable Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We begin with a review of the applicable provisions of the Act, which,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , require employers to provide the medical care needed to treat an employee's work injury. Section 306(f.1) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 531. To that end, employers must pay \"reasonable surgical and medical services, services rendered by physicians or other health care\n   <em>\n    providers\n   </em>\n   ... medicines and supplies, as and when needed.\" 77 P.S. \u00a7 531(1)(i) (emphasis added). Section 109 of the Act defines a \"health care provider\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    [A]ny person, corporation, facility or institution licensed or otherwise authorized by the Commonwealth to provide health care services\n   </em>\n   , including, but not limited to, any physician, coordinated care organization, hospital, health care facility, dentist, nurse, optometrist, podiatrist, physical therapist, psychologist,\n   chiropractor\n   <em>\n    or pharmacist\n   </em>\n   and an officer, employe or agent of such person acting in the course and scope of employment or agency related to health care services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   77 P.S. \u00a7 29 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Act requires employers to make prompt payment on provider invoices for reasonable and necessary medical treatment of a claimant's work injury, and it establishes specific procedures for resolving disputes about a particular invoice. Section 306(f.1)(5) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The employer or insurer shall make payment and providers shall submit bills and records in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n   <em>\n    All payments to providers for treatment provided pursuant to this act shall be made within thirty (30) days of receipt of such bills and records unless the employer or insurer disputes the reasonableness or necessity of the treatment provided pursuant to paragraph (6).\n   </em>\n   The nonpayment to providers within thirty (30) days for treatment for which a bill and records have been submitted shall only apply to that particular treatment or portion thereof in dispute; payment must be made timely for any treatment or portion thereof not in dispute.\n   <em>\n    A provider who has submitted the reports and bills required by this section and who disputes the amount or timeliness of the payment from the employer or insurer shall file an application for fee review\n   </em>\n   with the department no more than thirty (30) days following notification of a disputed treatment or ninety (90) days following the original billing date of treatment. If the insurer disputes the reasonableness and necessity of the treatment pursuant to paragraph (6), the period for filing an application for fee review shall be tolled as long as the insurer has the right to suspend payment to the provider pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph. Within thirty (30) days of the filing of such an application, the department shall render an administrative decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   77 P.S. \u00a7 531(5) (emphasis added). Subsection 6 states, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    [D]isputes as to reasonableness or necessity of treatment by a health care provider shall be resolved in accordance with the following provisions\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (i) The reasonableness or necessity of all treatment provided by a health care provider under this act may be subject to prospective, concurrent or retrospective utilization review at the request of an employe, employer or insurer. The department shall authorize utilization review organizations to perform utilization review under this act. Utilization review of all treatment rendered by a health care provider shall be performed by a provider licensed in the same profession and having the same or similar specialty as that of the provider of the treatment under review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   77 P.S. \u00a7 531(6) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In sum, where an employer challenges a provider's treatment as neither reasonable nor necessary, it must seek utilization review pursuant to Section 306(f.1)(6) of the Act. Where a provider does not receive payment within 30 days (and payment has not been stayed by an employer's utilization review request), it has recourse. The provider may file a fee review petition under Section 306(f.1)(5) of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The case law has limited the scope of the fee review provisions of the Act. This Court has explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [T]he fee review process\n   <em>\n    presupposes\n   </em>\n   that liability has been established, either by voluntary acceptance by the employer or a determination by a WCJ [workers'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   compensation judge]. Neither the Act nor the medical cost containment regulations provide any authority for a fee review officer to decide the issue of liability in a fee review proceeding. The Department's regulations, at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20127.255\">\n    34 Pa. Code \u00a7 127.255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), state that an application for fee review filed by a provider is premature and will be returned if \"[t]he insurer denies liability for the alleged work injury.\" The issue for the fee review officer is the \"amount and timeliness of the payment made by an insurer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20127.251\">\n    34 Pa.

Cmwlth. 2008) (emphasis added). In short, an employer's liability for a claimant's work injury must be established before the fee review provisions can come into play. Our Supreme Court has underscored this point, stating that a fee review is designed to be a simple process with a \"very narrow scope\" limited to determining the \"relatively simple matters\" of \"amount or timeliness\" of payment for medical treatment.\n   <em>\n    Crozer Chester Medical Center v. Department of Labor and Industry, Bureau of Workers' Compensation, Health Care Services Review Division\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202778\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/610/459/\">\n    610 Pa. 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7276261,7276361,7276205,4203406,4203414,4202778\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/22/189/\">\n    22 A.3d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 196-97 (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Whether an entity is a \"provider\" has been considered a question of employer liability and, thus, beyond the scope of a fee review proceeding. In\n   <em>\n    Selective Insurance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947335\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/86/300/\">\n    86 A.3d 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the employer sought review of two fee determinations of the Bureau's Medical Fee Review Section, which had awarded payment to the so-called \"billing agency,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , The Physical Therapy Institute. In its request for a hearing on these determinations, the employer asserted that The Physical Therapy Institute was not a provider but a billing entity. The Hearing Office dismissed the employer's petition, stating that it lacked jurisdiction to determine whether The Physical Therapy Institute was a provider, and this Court affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In so holding, we noted that the employer did not question the amount of the invoice but, instead, its liability to The Physical Therapy Institute. Since liability \"must be established before a fee review proceeding can take place,\" we concluded that the issue was beyond the scope of a fee review proceeding and, thus, the Hearing Office \"lacked jurisdiction to determine whether The Physical Therapy Institute [was] a medical provider.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947335\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/86/300/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947335\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/86/300/\">\n    at 304-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, the record in\n   <em>\n    Selective Insurance\n   </em>\n   showed that at least two claimants treating with The Physical Therapy Institute had filed penalty petitions to litigate the issue of whether The Physical Therapy Institute was a provider within the meaning of the Act. Given this record, this Court observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Claimants have an incentive to file a petition on behalf of a provider because when an insurer violates the Act by failing to make proper payment to a medical provider, the penalty is payable to the claimant.\n   <em>\n    Westinghouse Electric Corporation v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Weaver)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9122552\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/823/209/#p218\">\n    823 A.2d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 218 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2003). The absence of a direct statutory remedy for providers does not mean that the Court may expand the scope of a fee review to create a remedy. The matter is one for the legislature, assuming there is a need for a provider to have another remedy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6889082\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/108/957/6889082/#p960\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 305 n.9. With regard to The Physical Therapy Institute's recourse, the Court noted that the claimant \"can file a petition to establish [an] [i]nsurer's liability to The Physical Therapy Institute, such as a review petition or a penalty petition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9122552\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/823/209/#p218\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Thereafter, in\n   <em>\n    Physical Therapy Institute, Inc. v.

However, we observed that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   the issue of whether [The] Physical Therapy Institute can establish itself as the provider entitled to payment, by contract with another provider, will be decided.

Cmwlth. 2018) (\n   <em>\n    Armour I\n   </em>\n   ), Pharmacy appealed a Hearing Office determination that it lacked jurisdiction over a fee review determination that, as here, involved the dispensing of a compound cream. Prior to the hearing on the employer's appeal of the fee determination, the employer and the claimant entered into a Compromise and Release (C &amp; R) Agreement that obligated the employer to pay for previously incurred medical expenses that were determined to be reasonable and necessary for treatment of the claimant's injury. Notably, the C &amp; R Agreement explicitly relieved the employer of liability for past, present or future prescriptions for compound creams. Before the Hearing Office, the employer argued that under the C &amp; R Agreement, it had no liability to Pharmacy and, in any case, the Hearing Office lacked jurisdiction. Pharmacy petitioned for this Court's review, and we held in favor of Pharmacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We concluded that the employer could not use a C &amp; R Agreement, to which Pharmacy was not a party, to deprive Pharmacy of its right to payment under the Act. Further, the employer had previously sought utilization review of the compound cream, and it was determined to be a reasonable and necessary treatment of the claimant's work injury. However, the employer did not appeal that determination. We construed the C &amp; R Agreement, which established the employer's liability for past medical expenses, to require reimbursement for the compound cream.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The polestar in\n   <em>\n    Armour I\n   </em>\n   was that the Act must be construed in accordance with due process of law. An employer may challenge a claimant's medical treatment as not medically necessary. Once it loses that challenge, however, it cannot use a C &amp; R Agreement to deprive the provider of its right under the Act to prompt payment for services rendered to treat a claimant's work injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Pharmacy Issues on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In its first issue, Pharmacy requests this Court to revisit or limit its holding in\n   <em>\n    Selective Insurance\n   </em>\n   and offers several reasons in support thereof. First, because the Bureau has not promulgated an appropriate regulation, a provider does not have a remedy where the employer questions its status as a \"provider\" under the Act. Second, the Court's observation in\n   <em>\n    Selective Insurance\n   </em>\n   that it is for the claimant to establish the employer's liability to a \"provider\" did not protect providers because they cannot compel claimants to file a petition. Indeed, a claimant may fear retaliation by the employer in the form of a termination, suspension or modification petition, and a claimant may not be able to\n   afford counsel. Third, a claimant's interest does not necessarily coincide with a provider's interest, as was shown in\n   <em>\n    Armour I\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Pharmacy argues that\n   <em>\n    Selective Insurance\n   </em>\n   should be limited to its facts, where the employer made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that the billing agency was not a provider. In\n   <em>\n    Selective Insurance\n   </em>\n   , the billing entity's status was a valid question because the invoices named two different physical therapists, one of whom had a business address different from that of The Physical Therapy Institute. By contrast, here, Pharmacy is both the provider\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the billing entity, and Employer presented no evidence to support its averment to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Pharmacy argues that\n   <em>\n    Physical Therapy Institute\n   </em>\n   is likewise factually distinguishable because in that case, the employer had consistently maintained that the \"provider\" seeking payment did not render the physical therapy services recited in the invoice. By contrast, here, Employer has denied payment for several reasons, stating that the amounts exceeded the fee schedule and that compound creams are not medically necessary. At no point did Employer present any evidence that Pharmacy was not a provider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Employer does not respond to these arguments, stating that it \"has little to argue with [Pharmacy] in terms of what the statute says, what the regulations provide, and what prior case law emanating from this [C]ourt has held with respect to the fee review process.\" Employer Brief at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In its second issue, Pharmacy contends that it is being denied its due process of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the Act and implementing regulations, as presently construed, empower an employer (or its insurer) to refuse payment for medical treatment of a claimant without having to make its case in an evidentiary hearing. In support of its due process claim, Pharmacy cites\n   <em>\n    Cruz v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Philadelphia Club)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11621105\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/728/413/\">\n    728 A.2d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 1999). There, we reversed a decision of a workers' compensation judge (WCJ) that a provider's treatment was unreasonable where the provider had not been given notice or an opportunity to participate in the deposition of an expert who opined that the treatment was unreasonable. We held that this was \"fundamentally unfair\" to the provider.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11621105\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/728/413/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11621105\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/728/413/\">\n    at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We disagreed and reasoned,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the Bureau had to promulgate a regulation before WCJs could qualify vocational experts. Our Supreme Court reversed, holding that WCJs routinely make competency determinations about experts and were fully able to do so in this context. Pharmacy argues that our reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Caso\n   </em>\n   has continued viability to the extent it stands for the principle that this Court can direct the promulgation of a regulation.

Employer argues that the Court can avoid this dilemma with a construction of the Act that allows the Hearing Office \"to entertain evidence on the issue of whether a purported 'provider' is, in fact, a 'provider' or 'the' provider in the first instance.\" Employer Brief at 11. Allowing the Hearing Office to make the threshold determination of \"provider status\" and its own subject matter jurisdiction saves the fee review provisions in the Act. However, this will not entitle Pharmacy to a hearing in this case because Pharmacy did not make a proffer of evidence relevant to its provider status before the Hearing Office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The principles governing administrative practice and procedure in Pennsylvania are founded in our Constitution.

Jurisdiction, a quasi-judicial matter, is not to be decided by the Medical Fee Review Section, whose responsibility is solely administrative.

Cmwlth. 2002), is also instructive. In\n   <em>\n    J.G.\n   </em>\n   , we considered a challenge to the administrative hearing procedures under the Child Protective Services Law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   which established a ChildLine and Abuse Registry consisting of \"indicated\" and \"founded\" reports of child abuse. 23 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6331(2) (requiring the Department to establish \"[a] Statewide central register of child abuse\"). The Child Protective Services Law provided that a perpetrator of child abuse named in an indicated report could have an administrative hearing to challenge the report. However, the statute did not provide this opportunity to perpetrators named in a founded report, which is issued following a judicial adjudication of abuse in a criminal conviction or a civil dependency proceeding. In\n   <em>\n    J.G.\n   </em>\n   , a child was adjudicated a \"dependent child\" because of abuse suffered while in the care of both parents. The mother sought a hearing to challenge the founded report that named her as a perpetrator, but the Department dismissed her hearing request as not authorized by the Child Protective Services Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We reversed and remanded the matter to the Department for a hearing. We held that the omission of a hearing on a founded report in the Child Protective Services Law was not dispositive. We looked to the Administrative Agency Law, which defines an \"adjudication\" as a \"final order, decree, decision, determination or ruling by an agency affecting personal or property rights, [or] privileges ... of any or all of the parties to the proceeding in which the adjudication is made.\" 2 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 101.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, an \"adjudication\" is not valid except where the party has \"reasonable notice of a hearing and an opportunity to be heard.\" 2 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 504. In\n   <em>\n    J.G.\n   </em>\n   , the child dependency adjudication did not \"specifically find that [the mother] was guilty of abuse.\"\n   <em>\n    J.G.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9428418\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/795/1089/\">\n    795 A.2d at 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A founded report naming the mother as a perpetrator of child abuse in the absence of a hearing on that disputed fact would constitute an invalid adjudication. Accordingly, this Court filled the lacuna in the Child Protective Services Law with the default hearing required by the Administrative Agency Law and directed the Department to conduct a hearing on the mother's challenge to the founded report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Likewise, here, it is for the Hearing Office to conduct a hearing on whether a person invoking the remedy set forth in Section 306(f.1)(5) is a \"provider\" within the meaning of the Act. In no way does this holding expand the scope of the fee review proceeding beyond timeliness and amount owed to a provider that has treated a claimant for his work injury. This holding does not allow the Hearing Office to determine the reasonableness of the medical care or service; the claimant's injury as work-related; or the employer's liability for a work injury. Where utilization review is sought, a fee determination is premature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Our holding does not limit the determination of the status of a \"provider\" to a fee review proceeding. In appropriate cases, this question may also be determined by a workers' compensation judge in the course of a claim or penalty petition proceeding. This was the case in\n   <em>\n    Selective Insurance\n   </em>\n   . Where the employer's liability for medical treatment is established without a determination on the status of a putative provider, then this question can be addressed by the Hearing Office where raised by the employer.\n   <em>\n    Selective Insurance\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable, but to the extent\n   <em>\n    Selective Insurance\n   </em>\n   is inconsistent with our holding here, it is overruled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For all of the above-stated reasons, we reverse the Hearing Office's adjudication and remand the matter for a determination of whether Pharmacy is a provider within the meaning of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   AND NOW, this 29th day of March, 2019, the order of the Bureau of Workers' Compensation Fee Review Hearing Office, dated October 30, 2017, is hereby REVERSED and this matter is REMANDED for further proceedings in accordance with the attached opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Jurisdiction relinquished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   CONCURRING OPINION BY JUDGE WOJCIK\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   I join in the result reached by the Majority.
