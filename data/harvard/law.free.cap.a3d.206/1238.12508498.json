Essentially, Jones presents three issues for this Court's review: (1) whether the Secretary properly calculated Jones' compensation; (2) whether the School District of Philadelphia (District) violated Jones' due process rights; and (3) whether the Secretary was required to address additional issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After review, we vacate and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The District hired Jones as a teacher and professional employee on September 1, 2002. Jones was a vocational teacher at Dobbins Area Vocational Technical School (AVTS) for six years until the electronics program was discontinued at that location. During the 2008-2009 school year, Jones was assigned as a math teacher at Mastbaum AVTS (Mastbaum). On or about April 30, 2009, Mastbaum's principal Mary Dean (Dean) received a letter containing alleged inappropriate statements Jones made in his classroom while teaching. Thereafter, an investigation commenced regarding the alleged statements. After an investigatory conference on June 1, 2009, Dean prepared an unsatisfactory incident report and recommended that Jones' employment be terminated. In August 2009, the District's Administration recommended that Jones' employment be terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Jones requested a hearing before the District's School Reform Commission (SRC) and on April 16, 2010, a hearing was held before the SRC. Effective December 15, 2010, the SRC terminated Jones' employment. Jones challenged his employment termination by pursuing litigation against the District before the Secretary and this Court. On June 2, 2016, this Court concluded that the District failed to comply with the mandatory provisions of the Public School Code of 1949 (School Code),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and thus held that Jones' employment termination was a nullity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sch.

Those hearings commenced on January 24, 2017, and continued over the course of several days throughout 2017. On May 1, 2018, the Secretary ordered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Jones shall be entitled to $4,303[.00] as a total gross amount for lost compensation during 2014 and 2015.

The District rejoins that because Jones had a teaching job for only two of the relevant years, he failed to mitigate his damages. Therefore, the District maintains, they are the only years he is entitled to compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Jones I\n   </em>\n   , this Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   With respect to Jones' damages, the law is well established that '[a] school teacher is not a public officer, but is an employe[e] of the school district, and the ordinary rules relating to damages for breach of contract of employment apply.'\n   <em>\n    Coble v.

As a result of his employment search, Jones obtained a position at MAST Charter School during the 2010-2011 school year,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 380A, 410A, and Pottstown High School as an evening program teacher.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 410A-411A. Moreover, Jones explained that from August 2011 through December 2012 he worked at Hope Charter School,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 412A-413A, from January 2013 to January 2014 he worked at Upper Darby High School,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 414A-416A, and thereafter, he obtained a position as a tenured teacher at DCIU. In addition, Jones testified that he registered with Kaleidoscope.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Jones, Kaleidoscope \"puts candidates in many schools in the area.

Jones also noted that he persistently sought to improve his position in the education field by attending graduate school and earning additional certifications. The record evidence clearly reveals that as a result of Jones' employment search, he was continuously employed throughout the period of his dismissal, except for two short periods of unemployment. Thus, Finding of Fact 12 is not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Importantly, the District has the burden to prove that substantially comparable\n   work was available and that the plaintiff \"failed to exercise reasonable due diligence in seeking alternative employment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800673,12485127\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/358/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The District presented vocational expert Terry P.

It included jobs throughout Pennsylvania in such locations as Pittsburgh, Lancaster, York, Fairview, Lebanon, Scranton, Bedford, Mechanicsburg, Stroudsburg, Huntingdon, Newville, Jim Thorpe and Erie, among other places, which are a great distance from the Philadelphia area. The Summary also listed postings on CraigsList and Internships. Importantly, none of the job postings stated the salary for the particular position. Moreover, the Summary included hundreds of positions not geographically relevant as Jones was not required to relocate to obtain employment in order to mitigate back pay damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Somerset Area Sch.

The responses further\n   included, among other things, lists of new hires, rehires, and classification changes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Leslie opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q Okay.

Accordingly, since no official action was necessary, the Sunshine Act does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    Reinstatement Letters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Jones asserts that the District's letters offering Jones' reinstatement were illegal and thus void. Consequently, Jones maintains he was not reinstated. This Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   On June 2, 2016, this Court ordered Jones' reinstatement. In accordance with this Court's Order, on August 25, 2016, the Secretary ordered Jones reinstated effective June 2, 2016. This Court recognizes that the District requested that the Secretary vacate his order based on its petitioning the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for allowance of appeal. However, when the Secretary did not address the request, the District in fact, sent a letter to Jones offering reinstatement \"with a start date of November 4, 2016.\" R.R. at 82A. Jones responded by stating his position that the SRC had to reinstate him at a public meeting and that Jones could not be reinstated with pending disciplinary action. The District responded on December 1, 2016, explaining that SRC action was not required, that the District had the right to proceed with disciplinary action and requested Jones to report to work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 83A-84A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   This Court agrees with the District. As explained above, SRC action was not required because this Court ordered Jones to be reinstated. Moreover, the District was free to proceed with disciplinary action as this Court specifically concluded: \"\n   <strong>\n    Jones is reinstated to his position as a professional employee until the District properly terminates his employment in accordance with the\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    School Code\n   </strong>\n   ....\"\n   <em>\n    Jones I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800673,12485127\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/358/\">\n    139 A.3d at 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). Accordingly, Jones' reinstatement was valid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    Additional Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    Application to Enforce\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Jones argues that he submitted an application to enforce the Secretary's order reinstating him, and notwithstanding the Hearing Officer's scheduling order (Scheduling Order) stating otherwise, the Secretary did not address it. The Scheduling Order stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   At the hearing, the following issues/matters shall be considered:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   a. The [District's] request for a stay or supersedeas pending review by the [Secretary].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   b. [Jones'] request for enforcement of [the Secretary's] orders reinstating [Jones] to his position with the [District].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   c. The amount of back pay, if any, that should be awarded to [Jones], taking into account his duty to mitigate damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   R.R. at 144A. Jones claims the Secretary did not address issues a and b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   First, the Secretary's decision was dated May 1, 2018, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied the District's Petition for Allowance of Appeal on February 15, 2017. Therefore, the issue of the District's request for a stay or supersedeas was clearly moot on the date the Secretary issued his opinion. Second, the Secretary concluded that the District reinstated Jones as of its first offer of reinstatement. Consequently, the issue of enforcement of the Secretary's reinstatement order was also moot at the time the Secretary issued his decision. Accordingly, the Secretary addressed the issues properly before him,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the amount of backpay and mitigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    Liberty Interests and Records Expunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Jones states in his brief: \"Jones asked the Secretary to order the expunction of all records and his Hearing Officer never addressed the issue. We ask this Court to do so now.\" Jones' Br. at 53. Jones further argues: \"The District provides a 'do not hire' list to Kelly Services. If Jones' name is placed on that list it would create a 'stigma' which would create a cause of action against the District.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800673,12485127\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/358/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1551(a) provides in pertinent part: \"Review of quasijudicial orders shall be conducted by the court on the record made before the government unit. No question shall be heard or considered by the court which was not raised before the government unit ....\" Pa.R.A.P. 1551(a). This Court remanded this matter in\n   <em>\n    Jones I\n   </em>\n   for Jones' reinstatement and calculation of damages. The Hearing Officer specified the issues to be determined in its Scheduling Order (the District's stay request, Jones' Enforcement Application and damages/mitigation). As Jones' record expunction was not before the Secretary, it was properly not heard or considered by the Secretary. Consequently, it cannot now be considered by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   This Court notes that although it reversed Jones' employment termination because the District failed to comply with the School Code, it did not address the actual charges. Moreover, if Jones had accepted the reinstatement, the original charges could again be reinstituted and disciplinary proceedings could be brought against Jones correspondingly. Accordingly, the Secretary did not err in not addressing Jones' records expunction and we will not do so now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   For all of the above reasons, the Secretary's order is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the Secretary to recalculate Jones' damages by including what he should have received under the masters salary schedule for the time period beginning with Jones' dismissal and ending on the date he was first offered reinstatement, including all accumulated leave, less all income actually earned throughout that time period, plus 6% interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   AND NOW, this 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   day of April, 2019, the Secretary of Education's (Secretary) May 1, 2018 order is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the Secretary to recalculate Ellis Jones' damages in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Jurisdiction relinquished.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Jones' \"Statement of the Questions Involved\" includes five issues: (1) whether the Secretary misapplied the law of mitigation of damages; (2) whether unsubstantiated, inadmissible hearsay evidence can be relied upon to prove a fact at issue when it is repeatedly objected to during the hearing and in objections to the testimony of an expert witness who has no first-hand knowledge of any fact at issue; (3) whether the District's counsel's circumvention of the Philadelphia School Reform Commission (SRC) violates the Sunshine Act, 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 701 -716, and is the very same malfeasance which this Court admonished the District for so doing; (4) whether the District's counsel's refusal to properly reinstate Jones through the SRC and refusal to properly assign Jones to a teaching position, and thereafter unilaterally declaring that he had abandoned his job without any knowledge, authority or action of the SRC is yet another due process violation; and (5) whether the Secretary failed to act to reinstate Jones as directed to do so by this Court pursuant to the Court's Order and as asked to do so in Jones' application to enforce the executory orders of both this Court and the Secretary.
