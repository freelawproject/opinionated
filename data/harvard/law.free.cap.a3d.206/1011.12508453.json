Plaintiff, Adrian Sosa, appeals from summary judgment dismissing his breach-of-contract complaint against his homeowner's insurer, defendant Massachusetts Bay Insurance Company. Plaintiff unsuccessfully sought coverage for real and personal property damages after a municipal water main broke under a public street and\n   inundated his home. Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, the court dismissed the complaint, finding that the policy's plain language excluded his claim. As we find that the water damage exclusion does not clearly bar plaintiff's claim, we reverse the grant of summary judgment to Massachusetts Bay. However, we also affirm the order denying summary judgment to plaintiff, as plaintiff has not established that his personal damage claim satisfies a named peril, and the balance of plaintiff's damages are not clearly documented.\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are undisputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 30, 2015, a municipal water-main pipe broke under Knox Avenue in Cliffside Park. The pavement buckled on the side of the street opposite plaintiff's home and water gushed about a foot into the air. The water flowed from the street into plaintiff's driveway and then into the garage and basement apartment of his home. About a foot of water filled the downstairs floor. Plaintiff identified invoices exceeding $ 75,000 for work to remediate the damage to his real and personal property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff was unaware whether any other homes were affected. After he submitted a claim to Massachusetts Bay, an adjuster inspected the property and concluded that the damage resulted from \"surface and ground water intrusion.\" On that basis, the company disclaimed coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Massachusetts Bay policy provided \"all risk\" coverage for damage to the dwelling and other structures, and \"named peril\" coverage for damage to personal property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Victory Peach Grp., Inc. v.

Both forms of coverage were subject to the policy's water damage exclusion. Thus, plaintiff's real property damages were covered unless subject to the exclusion. The personal property damages were covered only if they also satisfied a named peril. We consider the water damage exclusion first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The underlying policy form excluded losses caused by \"water damage.\" An endorsement, entitled \"Water Back-Up and Sump Discharge or Overflow\" (\"Sump Endorsement\"), replaced \"water damage\" with \"water.\" It also modified the exclusion's reach. Consistent with its title, the endorsement expanded coverage to include damages caused by water from sewers, drains, sumps, sump pumps or related equipment, except if caused by flood. However, the endorsement also revised the water damage exclusion in other respects having nothing to do with the subject of its title. Notably, it explained that the exclusion \"applie[d] regardless of whether\" the water was \"caused by an act of nature or [was] otherwise caused.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As revised by the endorsement - we note the endorsement's additions in bold and deletions in brackets - the policy states that water means:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) Flood, surface water, waves,\n   <strong>\n    including tidal wave and tsunami, tides\n   </strong>\n   , tidal water, overflow of any body of water, or spray from any of these,\n   <strong>\n    all\n   </strong>\n   whether or not driven by wind,\n   <strong>\n    including storm surge\n   </strong>\n   (\"Exclusion 1\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (2) Water which:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n   </strong>\n   Backs up through sewers or drains; or [which]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n   </strong>\n   overflows\n   <strong>\n    or is otherwise discharged\n   </strong>\n   from a sump,\n   <strong>\n    sump pump or related equipment; as a direct or indirect result of flood\n   </strong>\n   (\"Exclusion 2\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (3) Water below the surface of the ground, including water which exerts pressure on, or seeps, leaks\n   <strong>\n    or flows\n   </strong>\n   through a building, sidewalk, driveway,\n   <strong>\n    patio\n   </strong>\n   foundation, swimming pool or other structure (\"Exclusion 3\");\n   <strong>\n    or\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    (4) Waterborne material carried or otherwise moved by any of the water referred to in D.1 through D.3 of this Exclusion\n   </strong>\n   (\"Exclusion 4\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    This exclusion applies regardless of whether any of the above, in D.1 through D.4 is caused by an act of nature or is otherwise caused.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    This exclusion applies to, but is not limited to, escape, overflow or discharge, for any reason, of waterborne material from a dam, levee, seawall or any other boundary or containment system.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    However\n   </strong>\n   , direct loss by fire, explosion or theft resulting from [water damage]\n   <strong>\n    any of the above, in D.1 through D.4, is covered.

It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   2.

The only named peril arguably pertinent covers damages caused by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from within a plumbing, heating, air conditioning or automatic fire protective sprinkler system or from within a household appliance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The peril does not include loss:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   c.

Rather, a flood is \"a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas.\" Even if one assumed that plaintiff's driveway, a \"normally dry land area,\" was partially or completely inundated, and that inundation caused damage to the home, the condition was not a \"general\" one.

Plaintiff, relying on a dictionary definition, contends that \"surface water\" is natural water that has not penetrated much below the surface of the ground. Massachusetts Bay contends essentially, that any water found on the surface of land, regardless of its source or its properties, is \"surface water\"; and, citing the Sump Endorsement, such \"surface water\" need not occur naturally, but may result from human behavior. Particularly absent a definition in the policy, we reject the insurer's broad interpretation of the term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \"Surface water\" has been defined to possess a permanent nature, akin to a body of water.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.A.C. 7:7-16.4 (defining \"surface water\" as \"water in lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, bogs, wetlands, bays, and ocean that is visible on land\"); N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4 (defining \"surface waters\" as \"water at or above the land's surface which is neither groundwater nor contained within the unsaturated zone, including, but not limited to, the ocean and its tributaries, all springs, streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, wetlands, and artificial waterbodies\"). Alternatively,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Surface waters are those which fall on the land from the skies or arise in springs, and, following no defined course or channel, are lost by being diffused over the\n   ground through percolation, evaporation, or natural drainage.

According to the definition, \"surface water\" comes from rain, snow or other precipitation, or underground springs - not water from a broken water main. Applying a similar definition of \"surface water,\" the court in Colorado Court of Appeals found for the insured when an insurer invoked a surface water exclusion to deny coverage for damages from the broken water main in that case.\n   <em>\n    Ferndale Dev.

Otherwise Caused\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Massachusetts Bay argues that any ambiguity in the meaning of \"flood\" or \"surface water\" is resolved by the Sump Endorsement's provision that the water exclusion \"applies regardless of whether any of the above, in [Exclusions 1 through 4] is caused by an act of nature or is otherwise caused\" (\"Proviso\"). We are unpersuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As a threshold matter, we question whether the insurer may invoke a general amendment to the water damage exclusion that is buried in an endorsement that, by its title, leads the reader to believe it pertains only to \"Water Back-up and Sump Discharge or Overflow,\" and which in fact primarily pertains to that subject. Insurers are not free to subject policyholders to \"hidden pitfalls\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   that violate the insured's reasonable expectations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kievit v.

Likewise, an insurer should not be free to limit coverage provided by the underlying policy form, through an endorsement that suggests, by its prominent title, that it pertains to something else. An endorsement with no\n   title at all would have been less problematic than the one employed here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Even assuming that the Proviso is enforceable in cases not involving sump pumps and water back-ups, it does not alter our conclusion that the water that entered and damaged plaintiff's property was neither \"flood\" water nor \"surface water.\" As for the former, as we discussed above, the principal defining characteristic of a flood is not that it is a natural phenomenon - it may arise from human actions - but that it involves the overflow of a body of water. And, even if \"surface water\" may be caused by other than\n   \"an act of nature,\" water from a water-main break is not, unambiguously, surface water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The New York Appellate Division rejected an insurer's argument, like Massachusetts Bay's here, that damage from a water-main break was surface water damage because the exclusion applied \"whether the water damage [was] caused by or result[ed] from human or animal forces or any act of nature.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The exclusion precludes claims for damages from \"water below the surface of the ground, including water which exerts pressure on, or seeps, leaks or flows through a building, sidewalk, driveway, patio, foundation, swimming pool or other structure.\" Simply put, the water that damaged plaintiff's home was no longer \"below the surface of the ground\" when it reached his property; it was above ground. By its plain meaning, the provision does not address damage caused by above-ground water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Supreme Court of Kentucky reached the same conclusion.

We do so for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   First, plaintiff must establish that his personal property damage claim satisfies one of the named perils in his policy. As we noted above, the only named peril that would appear to apply would be the coverage for personal property damage caused by the \"accidental discharge or overflow of water ....\" However, the provision does not extend coverage if the discharge occurred off the \"residence premises,\" and the discharge from the water-main\n   break occurred on the street and off the residence premises. Inasmuch as neither party addressed this provision, we decline to hold that plaintiff's personal property damage claim must be denied on this basis, and instead leave it to the parties to fully address the matter before the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Secondly, with regard to plaintiff's claim for damage to the dwelling and other\n   structures, he has failed to provide the court with competent evidence quantifying his damages. He provided no statement of material facts in support of his cross-motion, and Massachusetts Bay's statement was silent on the subject of the quantification of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded.
