The second issue is whether the Attorney General can bring a cause of action against those lessees, pursuant to the UTPCPL, for alleged violations of antitrust law. The Court of Common Pleas of Bradford County (Trial Court) answered both questions in the affirmative; however, after thorough consideration, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Attorney General filed suit in the Trial Court against Appellants Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and Anadarko E &amp; P Onshore LLC (Anadarko), as well as Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Chesapeake Appalachia, LLC, Chesapeake Operating, LLC, and Chesapeake Energy Marketing, LLC (Chesapeake), (collectively, Appellants). In the complaint, the Attorney General alleges that, pursuant to both the UTPCPL and Pennsylvania antitrust common law, Appellants acted unlawfully by using deceptive, misleading, and unfair tactics, and committed antitrust violations, in their efforts to secure subsurface mineral rights leases from private landowners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Amended Complaint at 1-4, 29-105.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   These leases allow Appellants to extract natural gas from the Marcellus Shale formations underneath these private landowners' properties, in exchange for royalties and other types of payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Attorney General alleges that Appellants agreed to split the portion of \"northeast Pennsylvania within the Marcellus Shale gas play\" between them, so that Anadarko and Chesapeake would each effectively have exclusive areas in which to\n   seek mineral rights leases, without the fear that the other would tender competing offers to private landowners who were prospective lessors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Amended Complaint at 62-76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response to the Attorney General's Second Amended Complaint, Appellants each filed preliminary objections. As part of their overall preliminary objections, Appellants made two arguments that are relevant to these interlocutory appeals. First, they demurred\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the basis that the Attorney General could not state claims against them under the UTPCPL, because this law could only be applied to address the allegedly deceptive or unfair conduct of\n   <em>\n    sellers\n   </em>\n   in the context of a consumer transaction. Anadarko's Preliminary Objections at 11; Chesapeake's Preliminary Objections at 2-3. Since they had leased subsurface mineral rights, Appellants argued that they were effectively\n   <em>\n    buyers\n   </em>\n   in these transactions, and that their conduct was thus not actionable under the terms of the UTPCPL. Anadarko's Preliminary Objections at 11-13; Chesapeake's Preliminary Objections at 3. Second, they demurred on the grounds that antitrust claims could not be made under the UTPCPL, as this law was not designed to be an antitrust statute. Anadarko's Preliminary Objections at 28-32; Chesapeake's Preliminary Objections at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Trial Court sustained Appellants' Preliminary Objections in part and overruled them in part. Of relevance to these interlocutory appeals, the Trial Court held that the Attorney General could sue Appellants pursuant to the UTPCPL, since the companies were conducting trade or commerce, as those terms were defined in the Law, and determined that the Law permitted the Attorney General to pursue antitrust claims against these companies under the UTPCPL. Tr. Ct. Op. at 16-33, 47-50. After making these rulings, the Trial Court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   certified these issues for interlocutory appeal, recognizing that they are questions of first impression in which different interpretations of the law were being debated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73-75, 79, 81-82. Appellants then filed separate petitions for permission to appeal on an interlocutory basis,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which the Honorable Bonnie Brigance Leadbetter granted, consolidating Appellants' respective appeals and limiting them to the following two questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. Whether a cause of action may be brought under the [UTPCPL] for alleged wrongful conduct by lessees in oil and gas lease transactions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2. Whether a cause of action may be brought under the [UTPCPL] for alleged antitrust violations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Commonwealth Court Order, 3/12/18, at 2-3. The parties subsequently filed responsive briefs and appeared for\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   argument. These issues are now ready for our consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The UTPCPL\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Legislature sought by the [UTPCPL] to benefit the public at large by eradicating, among other things, 'unfair or deceptive' business practices. Just as earlier legislation was designed to equalize the position of employer and employee and the position of insurer and insured, this Law attempts to place on more equal terms seller and consumer. These remedial statutes are all predicated on a legislative recognition of the unequal bargaining power of opposing forces in the marketplace.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Instantly, the Legislature strove, by making certain modest adjustments, to ensure the fairness of market transactions. No sweeping changes in legal relationships were occasioned by the [Law], since prevention of deception and the exploitation of unfair advantage has always been an object of remedial legislation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Although the [UTPCPL] did articulate the evils desired to be remedied, the statute's underlying foundation is fraud prevention....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Since the [UTPCPL] was in relevant part designed to thwart fraud in the statutory sense, it is to be construed liberally to effect its object of preventing unfair or deceptive practices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Com., by Creamer v.

Section 3 of the UTPCPL, 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-3 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sections 2(4) and 3.1 of the UTPCPL, 73 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 201-2(4), 201-3.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of relevance here is the subsection that prohibits \"[e]ngaging in any other fraudulent or deceptive conduct which creates a likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding.\" Section 2(xxi) of the UTPCPL, 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(xxi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Law defines \" 'trade' and 'commerce' \" as \"the advertising, offering for sale, sale or distribution of any services and any property, tangible or intangible, real, personal or mixed, and any other article, commodity, or thing of value wherever situate, and includes any trade or commerce directly or indirectly affecting the people of this Commonwealth.\" Section 2(3) of the UTPCPL, 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(3). In addition, the UTPCPL authorizes actions by private parties and imbues the Attorney General, as well as district attorneys throughout this Commonwealth, with the power to file suit if they \"[have] reason to believe that any person is using or is about to use any method, act or practice declared by [ 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-3 ] to be unlawful, and that proceedings would be in the public interest[.]\" Section 4 of the UTPCPL, 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Attorney General's UTPCPL Claims Against Appellants\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In this interlocutory appeal, Appellants argue that the Trial Court erred by holding that the Attorney General could sue\n   them pursuant to the UTPCPL. According to Appellants, since they merely leased subsurface mineral rights from private landowners, they were not selling or distributing anything and consequently, the UTPCPL does not apply to their conduct, as the lease transactions do not satisfy the statutory definition of 'trade or commerce[.]' \" Appellants' Br. at 13, 18-19. Instead, Appellants contend that the UTPCPL is designed to only protect\n   <em>\n    consumers\n   </em>\n   against the underhanded behavior of sellers, rather than\n   <em>\n    all parties\n   </em>\n   to a given transaction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition, Appellants maintain that the Trial Court erred in finding that these leases constituted \"distribution of services,\" which is part of the definition of \" 'trade' and 'commerce' \" found in 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(3).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20. Appellants argue that the Trial Court was bound by the Attorney General's averments in its Second Amended Complaint, which make clear \"that the object of the lease arrangement was for [Appellants] and other gas companies to purchase outright landowners' interests in oil and gas deposits beneath the surface of their land.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Furthermore, Appellants state that the Trial Court erred by finding that their conduct fell within the second clause of the UTPCPL's definition of \" 'trade' and 'commerce,' \" which states, \" 'trade' and 'commerce' ... includes any trade or commerce directly or indirectly affecting the people of this Commonwealth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(3). According to Appellants, the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   requires this second clause to be read as referring to activities of the \"same general nature or class\" as those mentioned in the first clause\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Section 2(3) of the UTPCPL. Appellants' Br. at 21. Consequently, the Trial Court should not have used the ordinary definition of \" 'trade' and 'commerce' \" when deciding whether Appellants' actions were trade or commerce for purposes of the Law, not only because of the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   , but also because reading the second clause as being independent would effectively render the first clause's narrower definition superfluous.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We disagree. Contrary to Appellants' desired conclusion, we find that their conduct in relation to the aforementioned leases constitutes \" 'trade' and 'commerce,' \" as those terms are understood in the context of the Law. As we have already noted, Section 2(3) of the UTPCPL states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   'Trade' and 'commerce' mean the advertising, offering for sale, sale or distribution of any services and any property, tangible or intangible, real, personal or mixed, and any other article, commodity, or thing of value wherever situate, and includes any trade or commerce directly or indirectly affecting the people of this Commonwealth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Per this statutory language, and our case law, these leases were, in essence, sales. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court recognized long ago that residential leases\n   are functionally equivalent to a property sale in many ways, and that residential leases fall within the scope of \" 'trade' and 'commerce' \" under the UTPCPL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monumental Props., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"481001\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/459/450/\">\n    329 A.2d at 820-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the\n   <em>\n    Monumental Properties\n   </em>\n   court noted,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   there is substantial common-law authority that the leasing of property is identical to the sale of the premises.

Still other courts recognize that the lessee's interest is tantamount to absolute ownership of the premises for the term.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   It is certainly the modern understanding of the common law of leases that '(a) tenant is a purchaser of an estate in land[.]'\n   <em>\n    Pines v.

We recognize that\n   <em>\n    Monumental Properties\n   </em>\n   focused upon residential leases, and stated that the UTPCPL \"attempts to place on more equal terms seller and consumer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 816. However, given the General Assembly's intent that the Law be liberally interpreted, so as \"to benefit the public at large by eradicating, among other things, 'unfair or deceptive' business practices[,]\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 815, we find that Section 2(3)'s express language covers business and commercial leases as well, not just those which involve consumers or are residential in nature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Danganan\n   </em>\n   , 179 A.3d at 16 (\"[W]e recognize ... the wide range of conduct the [UTPCPL] was designed to address, including equalizing the bargaining power of the seller and consumer, ensuring the fairness of market transactions, and preventing deception and exploitation, all of which harmonize with the statute's broad underlying foundation of fraud prevention.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Here, under the terms of the at-issue leases, the private landowners effectively relinquish title to Appellants for natural gas that is extracted from their land during the lease term, in exchange for some combination of up-front and royalty payments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Second Amended Complaint, Exs. G, H, Q. We fail to see how that is functionally different from a sale of property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Furthermore, in\n   <em>\n    Danganan\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court interpreted Section 2(3) of the UTPCPL as containing two\n   <em>\n    distinct and independent\n   </em>\n   clauses, the latter of which \"does not modify or qualify the preceding terms. 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(3). Instead, [the second clause] is appended to the end of the [first clause's] definition and [is] prefaced by 'and includes,' thus indicating an inclusive and broader view of trade and commerce than expressed by the antecedent language.\"\n   <em>\n    Danganan\n   </em>\n   , 179 A.3d at 16. Therefore, this second clause operates as a catch-all of sorts, enabling \" 'trade' and 'commerce' \" to be defined in terms of common usage and not just, as argued by Appellants, through the narrower, more specific language of the first clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1903(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Pennsylvania courts generally use dictionaries as source material to determine the common and approved usage of terms not defined in statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    THW Grp., LLC v.

Cmwlth. 2014). Consequently, we turn to Merriam-Webster's Dictionary, which defines \"trade\" and \"commerce,\" in relevant part and respectively as, \"the business of buying and selling or bartering commodities\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"the exchange or buying and selling of commodities on a large scale involving transportation from place to place.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Again, Appellants have, by virtue of leasing subsurface mineral rights, purchased time-limited rights to whatever natural gas is situated underneath the private landowners' properties. Thus, these transactions are, in the context of the UTPCPL, \" 'trade' or 'commerce'.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Having decided that Appellants' leases qualify under the Law as \" 'trade' or 'commerce',\" the question then becomes whether this type of activity can give rise to a UTPCPL action by the Attorney General. We find that it can. As noted above, the UTPCPL states that \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce as defined by subclauses (i) through (xxi) of [ 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2 ] and regulations promulgated under [ 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-3.1 ] are hereby declared unlawful.\" 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-3. The key phrase here is \"in the conduct,\" which, when read in the full context of the language used in Section 3 of the UTPCPL, pertains to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" connected to UTPCPL-defined \" 'trade' or 'commerce',\" regardless of who is committing these unlawful acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Additionally, while the UTPCPL places restrictions on the ability of private parties to file suit,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Law creates no such\n   impediment for the Attorney General. Instead, the Attorney General is imbued with the express authority to file suit against \"any person,\" whenever the Attorney General determines that such a person \"is using or is about to use any method, act or practice declared by [ 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-3 ] to be unlawful, and that proceedings would be in the public interest[.]\" 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-4. Section 2(2) of the Law defines \"person\" as \"natural persons, corporations, trusts, partnerships, incorporated or unincorporated associations, and any other legal entities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947523\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/86/330/#p343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 201-2(2). Given that the Appellants are comprised of various corporations and other legal entities, they are thus subject to suit under the UTPCPL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Tying this all together, the Attorney General has asserted that Appellants, which are UTPCPL-classified \"persons,\" have operated deceptively, misleadingly, and unfairly \"in the conduct of any trade or commerce\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the leasing of subsurface mineral rights from private landowners).

Therefore, the Attorney General has stated legally viable claims against Appellants. For these reasons, we hold that the Trial Court properly overruled Appellants' demurrers that their behavior in securing these leases was not actionable under the UTPCPL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Attorney General's Antitrust Actions under the UTPCPL\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Appellants argue that the Trial Court erred in ruling that the Attorney General could use the UTPCPL to pursue claims against them that were rooted in alleged violations of antitrust law.

Appellants' Br. at 13-14, 29. Instead, Appellants assert that the Attorney General is simply attempting to \"retroactively and unilaterally\" rewrite the UTPCPL, in order to get around the General Assembly's repeated failure to pass an antitrust statute, and the fact that damages are not recoverable under Pennsylvania antitrust common law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14, 27-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   According to Appellants, \"[n]either the 'trade or commerce' definition in [ 73 P.S.] \u00a7 201-2(3) nor the catchall provision in [ 73 P.S.] \u00a7 201-2(4)(xxi) addresses agreements between market participants or in any other way purports to regulate competition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.

Consequently, Appellants conclude that the General Assembly's intent that the UTPCPL be liberally construed should not be interpreted in a way that disregards the plain language of the Law or permits the creation of antitrust provisions that are not explicitly contained within the UTPCPL. Appellants' Br. at 32-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We agree with Appellants that the UTPCPL is not designed to render\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   antitrust violations actionable and that the scope of actionable antitrust behavior under the UTPCPL is narrower than under federal antitrust law. As we have already noted, the UTPCPL provides two avenues through which activities can be declared \"unfair methods of competition\" or \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\" First, the General Assembly may define a given activity as unlawful by statute in Section 2(4) of the Law. Second, the Attorney General, by virtue of Section 3.1 of the Law, may also promulgate definitions of these terms through the administrative rulemaking process. 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-3.1. Given that neither the Attorney General nor the General Assembly has thus far used their powers to expressly define monopolistic behavior, joint ventures, or market sharing agreements as examples of \"unfair methods of competition\" or \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" we find that such activities are not\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unlawful for purposes of the UTPCPL. Consequently, the only manner in which these activities can give rise to viable UTPCPL actions is if they fit within one of the categories of behavior deemed, by rule or in the Law itself, \"unfair methods of competition\" or \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Attorney General's Second Amended Complaint contains two claims which allege antitrust violations by Appellants under the UTPCPL. The first can be discerned in Count III, in which the Attorney General asserts that Appellants' allegedly unlawful joint venture and market sharing agreements violated the UTPCPL through \"impairment of choice and the competitive process[.]\" Second Amended Complaint at 65-67. According to the Attorney General, these agreements \"created the likelihood of confusion and misunderstanding\" amongst the private landowners under whose land the desired natural gas was situated, by eliminating the prospect of competition between potential lessees and depressing the amount of compensation the landowners received in return for leasing their land to Appellants.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2041\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2041\">\n    at 66-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Thus, the Attorney General essentially argues through Count III that Appellants' joint venture and market sharing agreements\n   <em>\n    intrinsically\n   </em>\n   violated the UTPCPL. As we have already explained, the plain terms of the UTPCPL do not support such a conclusion. Rather, the Attorney General's claim that the mere existence of these business dealings created \"impairment of choice and the competitive process\" is insufficient and does not enable Count III to fit within any of the 21 categories of \"unfair methods of competition\" or \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" listed in Section\n   2(4) of the Law. Furthermore, the Attorney General has thus far declined to deem joint ventures or market sharing agreements as \"unfair methods of competition\" or \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" under the UTPCPL through the administrative rulemaking process. Consequently, the Attorney General has failed to state a viable UTPCPL-based antitrust claim in Count III, and, therefore, the Trial Court erred by overruling Appellants' demurrers to Count III of the Attorney General's Second Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The second UTPCPL-based antitrust claim can be discerned in Count IV, in which the Attorney General argues that Appellants deceived and acted unfairly towards private landowners by giving them misleading information, and/or failing to disclose information, regarding the open market's true appetite for subsurface mineral rights leases, as well as whether the terms of the agreed-to leases \"were competitive and fair.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2041\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2041\">\n    at 72-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   With regard to Count IV, however, we find that the Attorney General has articulated a legally viable UTPCPL claim. The Attorney General's assertions in Count IV regarding Appellants' allegedly disingenuous and misleading behavior brings that claim within the ambit of Section 2(4)(xxi) of the Law, which defines \" '[u]nfair methods of competition' and 'unfair or deceptive acts or practices' \" as \"[e]ngaging in any other fraudulent or deceptive conduct which creates a likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding.\" 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(4)(xxi). Hence, the Trial Court did not err by overruling Appellants' demurrers to Count IV of the Attorney General's Second Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In summation, we hold that the Attorney General was permitted to file a UTPCPL-based lawsuit against Appellants, but can only pursue antitrust claims through the UTPCPL where the so-called \"antitrust\" conduct qualifies as \"unfair methods of competition\" or \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" as those terms have been either statutorily defined in the UTPCPL or by the Attorney General through the administrative rulemaking process.

Although\n   <em>\n    Schwarzwaelder, DeFazio\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gregg\n   </em>\n   involved lawsuits by private parties rather than the Attorney General, all such actions are confined to the UTPCPL's definition of \"trade\" and \"commerce,\" which applies both to actions by the Attorney General and by private\n   parties. Thus, the aforementioned cases are instructive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   By imposing a\n   <strong>\n    consumer\n   </strong>\n   protection statute's restrictions, prohibitions and burdens\n   <strong>\n    on consumers\n   </strong>\n   , the Majority's analysis and ruling is a gross misinterpretation and misapplication of the UTPCPL. Such ruling is inconsistent with the UTPCPL's statutory purpose, creates a never-intended or anticipated UTPCPL cause of action that is completely contrary to the General Assembly's intent, and creates a dangerous precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   With respect to Count IV, the second UTPCPL-based antitrust claim, the Second Amended Complaint alleges therein that Appellants violated the UTPCPL:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   a.
