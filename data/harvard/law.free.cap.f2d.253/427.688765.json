See 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 186(b). Further payments have been enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">For a statement of the case reference is made to the district court\u2019s decision: Conditioned Air <em>&amp; </em>Refrigeration Co. v. Plumbing &amp; Pipefitting Labor-Management Relations Trust, 159 F.Supp. 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-15\">In the time intervening before argument in this case, this Court\u2019s decision came down September 16, 1957, in Sheet Metal Contractors Association of San Francisco v. Sheet Metal Workers International Association, 9 Cir., 248 F.2d 307. Rehearing therein was denied on November 5, 1957. Certiorari thereon was denied on January 13, 1958. Sheet Metal Workers International Association v. Sheet Metal Contractors Association, 78 S.Ct. 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-16\">We are unable to find any distinguishing facts in the Plumbing Trust which should produce a different result than was reached in the Sheet Metal Trust. The Sheet Metal case, as this one, was capably presented. We adhere to the decision of the division which heard the Sheet Metal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-18\">Therefore, judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
