Upon review of the trial record we find no basis for concluding that the conviction should be set aside. We accordingly affirm the result reached by the Municipal Court of Appeals.

Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, 594, 68 S.Ct. 222, 228, 92 L.Ed. 210 (1948). Only \u201creasonable force\u201d is permissible in resisting an unlawful arrest. Abrams v. United States, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 46, 237 F.2d 42 (1956); United States v. Angelet, 2 Cir., 231 F.2d 190, 193, certiorari denied, 351 U.S. 952, 76 S.Ct. 849, 100 L. Ed. 1476 (1956). It is not contended that the force appellant used was unreasonable if the arrest he was resisting was unlawful. He was guilty of assault only if he was resisting a <em>lawful </em>arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-25\">The policeman sought to arrest appellant for either \u201cdisorderly\u201d or \u201cinterference\u201d. The circumstances leading to the arrest were that appellant was challenging the policeman\u2019s legal right to give a third party a parking ticket. The policeman testified at the trial that appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>lant\u2019s challenge was made in disorderly fashion. Appellant\u2019s testimony was that he was completely orderly. If the jury believed the policeman, appellant\u2019s arrest was lawful and his resistance was unjustified. If the jury believed the appellant, his arrest was unlawful and his resistance justified. <em>The trial court did not allow the jury to consider the critical and disputed factual question of orderliness. </em>As the Municipal Court of Appeals stated in its opinion: \u201cThe trial judge ruled that the arrest of appellant was legal as a matter of law and in substance so instructed the jury, leaving for their consideration only the question of whether the alleged assault took place.\u201d 132 A.2d 155, 156 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The Municipal Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. The court said: \u201cIt is true that ordinarily when the evidence on such a question [orderliness] is conflicting it would have to be resolved by the jury, and appellant\u2019s testimony tended to prove that he was not disorderly. His own admission, however, that he interjected himself into an affair between an officer and a third person and engaged the officer in a jurisdictional dispute which was not his concern, clearly shows that he was interfering, and thus that his own arrest was justified.\u201d Id. at page 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The Supreme Court said in District of Columbia v. Little, 339 U.S. 1, 6, 70 S.Ct. 468, 471, 94 L.Ed. 599 (1950):' \u201cAlthough force or threatened force is not always an indispensable ingredient of the offense of interfering with an officer in the discharge of his duties, mere remonstrances or even criticisms of an officer are not usually held to be the equivalent of unlawful interference.\u201d The Court cited an annotation in 48 A.L.R. 746, 749, 755, which discusses statutes similar to D.C.Code \u00a7 22-505 (1951 ed., Supp. V), the \u201cinterference\u201d statute which appellant is alleged to have violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Since the jury was not permitted to consider whether appellant\u2019s remonstrances with the policeman were other than orderly, the only theory of law upon which the conviction can rest is that it is a crime, punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment of up to five years or both, to argue peaceably with a policeman about his right to give a third person a parking ticket. This gives a policeman on his beat the same privilege not to be questioned by a bystander that a judge has in his courtroom. The decision seems to create a new crime, contempt of police. We think the error is so serious that the petition for rehearing in banc should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-18\">. The order of the Court in banc (Pretty-man, Wilbur K.
